Additionally, the "National Savior Flag" was presented. The Chairman encouraged the Northeastern compatriots to emulate the national compatriots with the spirit of diligence, thrift, and loyalty to the nation, setting a model role.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] The Shenyang welcome rally for Chairman Chiang and his wife, filled with popular joy, was held at 10:00 AM on the 29th in front of the Shenyang City Government. Today, the breeze was gentle, and the sky was clear. From early morning, citizens of the entire city, young and old, assisted each other as they flocked to the City Government Square, all eager to catch a glimpse of the head of state's dignified presence and the First Lady's elegant demeanor. Before 9:00 AM, the square in front of the City Government had already gathered over 100,000 people. National flags fluttered, and music resounded, presenting a harmonious atmosphere. The platform was simply decorated. At 9:15 AM, the Chairman and his wife arrived at the venue by car, greeted by enthusiastic cheers from 300,000 people for over ten minutes.

### Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Address

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] The full text of Chairman Chiang's address to the people of all circles in Shenyang on the 29th is as follows: Northeastern compatriots, today, Mr. and Mrs. Chiang have come to the Northeast, which has been occupied for fourteen years, and we are meeting with our Northeastern compatriots in the square in front of the Shenyang City Government under the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth. This is the happiest thing in our lives, and it is also the realization of our ideals for the past fourteen years. Our Northeast has been occupied for fourteen years. During these fourteen years, our Northeastern compatriots have suffered the oppression and torment of the enemy and puppets, living the life of slaves and cattle. Our central government and national compatriots have never forgotten this for a single day. Our Chinese Kuomintang and the National Government have led the national compatriots to fight arduously and at the cost of sacrifice for fourteen years. The sole purpose was to recover the lost territory of the Northeast and rescue our Northeastern compatriots. Now our goal has been achieved, and our Northeastern compatriots have been liberated. We should of course express our joy and excitement at this historical achievement. However, at this time of rejoicing and excitement, we must not forget the pain of being invaded and humiliated by foreign races for the past fourteen years, nor must we forget the great sacrifices and losses made by our national compatriots in seeking freedom and independence for the past fourteen years. Therefore, after the restoration of the Northeast today, our Northeastern compatriots must remember the painful lessons of the past, be vigilant and strive, work diligently, cherish ourselves, be self-reliant and strong, defend our own territory, improve our own well-being, and enable our Chinese nation to live freely, independently, and gloriously in the world for generations to come (slight applause). Mr. and Mrs. Chiang have come to the Northeast primarily to express our condolences to our Northeastern compatriots who have suffered for many years, and at the same time to instruct the local government on how to rehabilitate the Northeast (cheers). When meeting with you compatriots today, there are also a few simple points that I would like to offer to everyone. In order to achieve the prosperity and revitalization of the Northeast in the future, our compatriots must all cultivate diligence, advocate thrift, understand etiquette, know integrity, take responsibility, and observe discipline. Everyone, under the leadership of the government, must unite as soldiers and civilians, work together with one heart and one mind, and work hard to build our Northeast. In this way, I believe that in the near future, our Northeast will surely become a model area for the whole country and a proving ground for the Three Principles of the People. Only in this way can we comfort the spirits in heaven of the military and civilian martyrs who sacrificed for the recovery of the Northeast for the past fourteen years. Finally, with the most joyful mood, Mr. and Mrs. Chiang sincerely wish the Northeastern compatriots freedom and liberation to last forever.

### Completion of the Takeover of Factories and Mines in the Beiping-Tianjin Area

[Report from our Beiping office, 29th] The takeover of factories and mines in the Beiping-Tianjin area has gradually gotten on the right track after several adjustments. Except for heavy industry transferred to the Resources Commission for operation, the work of taking over factories and mines received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and transferred from other agencies has been largely completed. More than sixty units of factories and mines have resumed operation. These include coal mines and factories manufacturing chemical industry products and brewing, etc. The first batch of factories is currently being put up for tender, totaling 2,300 units, all of which are operational. There are four coal mines. Except for the Great Wall Coal Mine, which has not resumed operation due to security issues, the coal production of the other three mines is still good. The Kailuan Mine produces 10,000 tons per day, mainly for the Beining Railway and Tianjin industry. The output of Mentougou is still not good, producing 600-700 tons per day, for civilian needs. The Jingxing Mine produces 1,600-1,700 tons per day, mainly for the Pinghan Railway. It can be increased to 2,000 tons per day soon. The issue of management has not yet been resolved. It is possible that it will be jointly operated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Hebei Provincial Government. In addition, the North China Iron and Steel Company was a military factory of the enemy and puppets. It currently only produces a small amount of building materials. Also, the North China Vehicle Factory's business is currently limited to repairs and cannot manufacture automobiles.

### First Batch of U.S. Landing Craft Accepted

Eight ships participated. After taking over the ships, the corps' captains led all officers and soldiers to board the ships with the national flag. The names of the ships have also been drafted and submitted to the Navy Department for approval.

Xue Yue will come to Nanjing. He can be appointed after Chairman Chiang returns to Nanjing.

### Chairman and Wife Meet with Families of Martyrs in Shenyang City Hall; Orders Preferential Treatment for Families of Northeastern Soldiers Killed in Action

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] At 10:30 AM on the 29th, President Chiang and his wife went to the auditorium of the Shenyang City Government and summoned more than 200 bereaved families of comrades who were persecuted and martyrs in the northeastern provinces in the past fourteen years to give them words of encouragement, stating: The Northeast has been occupied for fourteen years, and comrades of our party have suffered greatly from the persecution of the enemy and puppets. The central government has been concerned about this at all times. However, at that time, it was limited by the environment and could not provide assistance. Under such dangerous circumstances, the comrades were still able to fight hard. They could not be subdued by force, nor could they be moved by poverty. They were finally able to obtain freedom and light. This tragic and magnificent history can truly represent the great spirit of our party and all patriotic people. Today, I am able to meet with all the comrades in Shenyang after they have gone through many hardships, and I feel infinitely happy in my heart. On behalf of all the comrades of our party, I would like to express my deep condolences. The comrades have endured hardships, taken risks, and achieved success in restoring the country. This spirit of nameless heroes is truly a model for the members of our party and is also what the late Premier hoped of all the comrades. My visit to Shenyang is rushed, and I have not been able to have individual talks with all the comrades and comfort them one by one. However, what our revolutionary party members value is spirit, emotion, and history, not material things and appearances. I sincerely hope that you will carry forward the spirit of the past and strive hard. With the smooth working environment in the future, I believe that your work achievements will be even better than in the past. In short, the revitalization of the Northeast in the future depends on the comrades of our party working together with one heart and one mind, assisting the government, working hard, and striving forward, so that in a few years, the Northeast can become a model for the whole country. After the speech, all those who listened to the instructions were moved and felt inspired, and Party Representative Luo Dayu reported to the President on the struggles and sacrifices of the Northeastern comrades over the years. The President nodded frequently and personally went to the bereaved families of the martyrs with his wife to express condolences, accept their letters of petition, and promised to provide preferential treatment and condolences separately.

[Another telegram] President Chiang recently sent a hand-written note to the Secretariat of the Central Party Headquarters, stating: "During the fourteen years of the Northeast's occupation, the comrades of our party's underground work, under the oppression and torment of the enemy and puppets, persevered and made repeated efforts to engage in a long-term and arduous struggle with the enemy and puppets. As a result, there were many martyrs and those who were persecuted. This spirit of loyalty, courage, righteousness, and valor is the greatest guarantee for our government to recover the Northeast. Now that the war of resistance has been won and the Northeast has been restored, our party should give preferential treatment and condolences to the families of the martyrs and to the comrades who were persecuted in the past fourteen years and those who were disabled due to their work, in order to encourage loyalty and dedication." The secretariat has already accepted the instructions and formulated measures for the families of the martyrs and the persecuted comrades. The measures were announced in Shenyang today.

[Another telegram] President Chiang is concerned about the families of soldiers killed in action during the War of Resistance and issued a hand-written order to the secretariat of the headquarters, saying: "Over the past fourteen years, there have been many officers and soldiers of the Northeastern nationality in our National Revolutionary Army who were killed in action or went missing during the War of Resistance. Their spirit of sacrificing themselves to serve the country is commendable. Now that the country has been restored, the government should provide preferential treatment and relief to the bereaved families of the martyrs. I hope you will investigate and handle the matter and report it. This is what I hope." It is learned that the secretariat of the headquarters has ordered the formulation of measures for the registration of families of Northeastern officers and soldiers killed in action or missing during the War of Resistance, and a public announcement has been published in the newspaper.

### Madame Chiang Personally Instructs on Women's Movement Work in the Northeast

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] Madame Chiang met with Madame Du Chang and Madame Zhao, wife of the Chief of Staff, in the afternoon of the 29th and gave instructions on the women's movement work in the Northeast.

### Administrative Chief Officer of the Northeast Receiver, Guan Jiyu, Arrives in Shanghai Via a Circuitous Route; Liu Zhe Says Destruction of Buildings in Changchun is a Pity

[Central News Agency, This City] Guan Jiyu, Chairman of the Songjiang Provincial Government, Peng Jiqun, Chairman of the Nenjiang Provincial Government, Yang Chuoan, Mayor of Harbin, and 51 other receiving personnel from each province and city; Liu Zhe, Director of the Changchun Railway Company, Wan Yi, and 6 senior company officials, a total of 62 people, departed from Haishenwai on the Soviet ship Smolny on the 19th of this month, returning to the country via Tokyo, Japan. They arrived in Shanghai at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 29th). The ship berthed in the middle of the river at the customs wharf. Ding Guitang, Deputy General Tax Commissioner of the Customs, upon hearing the news, took a steamboat to the side of the ship to welcome them ashore. The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Foreign Ministry's office in Shanghai sent representatives to the wharf to greet them. It was drizzling, with clouds gathering and scattering from time to time, and the weather was quite cool. Chairman Guan and others were all dressed in autumn attire. Although they had traveled a long distance, they were still in high spirits. After exchanging brief greetings with the welcoming party, they took cars to their residences to rest.

The reporter first met Chairman Guan on the Smolny ship. He looked thinner than when he saw him in Chongqing some time ago. He shook hands with the reporter and chatted with a smile on his face, expressing great pleasure. He first asked about the current situation in Shanghai. After the reporter briefly reported, he then made a statement about his trip, saying: "The government administration receiving personnel of Songjiang, after receiving the order to withdraw with the Soviet army last month, joined with the receiving personnel of Nenjiang and Harbin and rushed to Harbin on the 23rd of last month. On the 25th, Peng Jiqun, Chairman of the Nenjiang Provincial Government, Yang Chuoan, Mayor of Harbin, and 51 other receiving personnel withdrew from Harbin with the Soviet army. On the 27th, they arrived at Haishenwai and took a boat to Shanghai. After transportation arrangements are finalized, they will rush to Shenyang from Shanghai."

Later, the reporter met Peng Jiqun, Chairman of Nenjiang Province. Peng had a full head of white hair and a serene demeanor. The reporter asked about the situation of the Northeast takeover. He expressed many feelings and said: "The takeover work cannot be finished in a short time. However, since receiving the order to withdraw with the Soviet army, our province's security team has suffered 1,300-1,400 casualties up to the time of the withdrawal of the remaining personnel. Both provincial and municipal hospitals are full. There are also 4,000-5,000 people led by Wang Lin, Deputy Commander of the Provincial Security Police Headquarters, who are engaged in maritime combat. We are extremely eager for the national army to arrive as soon as possible."

Finally, the reporter asked Director Liu Zhe about the withdrawal of the staff of the China Changchun Railway Company. He said: "On April 28th, Wan Yi and I led eight senior staff members to Harbin by car from Changchun. On the 25th, we took a military vehicle to Haishenwai. On the 27th, we arrived at Vloshilov Station. After getting off the train, we were entertained by the Soviet side and stayed at the seaside sanatorium. On May 18th, we took the Smolny ship via Japan to Shanghai. I have no feelings about this trip, but I heard that 8,000 soldiers and civilians died in the Battle of Changchun, and two large government buildings, one large Overseas Chinese Building, one large real estate corporation building, one Academy of Sciences building, one former Kwantung Army Command building, and one Colonization Association building were burned down, which is a great pity. The construction of these buildings was magnificent, and it is feared that they cannot be restored in a short time. I now plan to go to Nanjing to meet with the President and then decide where to go."

The list of China Changchun Railway and Songjiang Provincial Government officials who arrived in Shanghai yesterday is recorded as follows: China Changchun Railway Liu Zhe, Wan Yi, Liu Shenhua Wu, Liu Chengyao, Zhu Shiming, Chi Yifu, Wang Zubei.

Songjiang Provincial Government Chairman Guan Jiyu, Director of Civil Affairs Shi Lianhang, Director of Construction Wu Shaolin, Committee Member Nao Menghua, Chief of Police Feng, Councilor Wang Xihong, Chief Secretary Zhang Chongyu, Director of Personnel Office Li Jingzhan, Secretary Tian Wenbin, Section Chief Zhao Huailin, Assistant Secretary Liu Yuqing, Section Chief Li Xiangying, Civil Affairs Section Chief Chen Guorui, Section Chief Liu Xibai, Adjutant Junshi.

### Yesterday's Central Standing Committee Passed the Reorganization of Anhui and Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters; Liu Zhenru and Wang Baoxuan Appointed Chairmen Respectively

[Report from our Nanjing office, 19th] In addition to discussing general routine cases, the Central Standing Committee held a meeting today to continue to conduct a careful study on the issue of downsizing the organization of the Central Party Headquarters. Finally, it was resolved to appoint Wang Baoxuan as the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters and Liu Zhenru as the Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Party Headquarters.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Central Standing Committee held a meeting in the State Council conference room on the 29th and passed the plan to reorganize the Anhui and Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters. The chairmen of the Anhui and Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters were originally concurrently held by the respective provincial chairmen, Li Pinxian and Wang Maogong. They are now relieved of their concurrent posts, and Liu Zhenru will succeed as the Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Party Headquarters, and Wang Baoxuan will succeed as the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters.

### Minister Peng Tells Foreign Reporters: The Prospect of Peace is Very Bright; The Government Sincerely Hopes that the Communists will Fulfill the Agreements

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Ministry of Propaganda held a press conference for foreign reporters at 4:30 PM on the 29th. Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs attended and presided over the meeting. The original wording of the questions and answers is translated as follows:

Question: What is the government's policy on the recent peace talks? What are the government's demands? Does the government's policy coincide with that pointed out in the editorials of the Central Daily News on May 27th and 28th?

Answer: Some aspects of the recent peace talks seem to ignore some basic facts. In order to seek peace and national unity, the government has agreed to some agreements. There are three provisions in these agreements: (1) cessation of conflict, (2) restoration of transportation, and (3) reorganization of the national army and unified编 of the Communist troops. As stipulated in Section 2, Article 2 of the ceasefire order agreement of the National Army on January 10 this year, the conflict stopped (without affecting the movement of the National Government's troops to enter Cambodia in order to restore China's sovereignty or within the territory of the Northeast). The above-mentioned agreements have been announced. The government has no other demands except to require the Communist Party to practice its promises and fulfill the agreements. As for the Central Daily News editorials you mentioned, they quite reflect the government's views and the wishes of the general public.

Question: When will the government and the Communist Party reopen peace talks? When will the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group and the Constitution Review Group reconvene?

Answer: The government and the Communist Party and other parties maintain constant contact. The date of resumption of the various groups is being consulted for their opinions. I personally believe that if the above-mentioned basic issues can be put into practice, then the issues in the Political Consultative Conference group will be easier to resolve.

Question: It is rumored that Chairman Chiang told General Marshall that the cessation of conflict and the restoration of transportation are prerequisites for peace talks. Is this news accurate?

Answer: I cannot comment on the correspondence between the Chairman and General Marshall, but if you review the basic agreements I pointed out, the answer will be obvious. The cessation of conflict and the restoration of transportation are indeed the first necessary steps to realize national unity. All of this is not a new condition, but only a part of the aforementioned agreement.

Question: Will the National Army advance to take over Harbin and Qiqihar?

Answer: The answer to this question is the same as what I told you at the last press conference. The government's responsibility to take over the entire Northeast is undeniable, but we always wish to achieve a peaceful solution. Yesterday, the Communist Party declared that the Communist army automatically withdrew from畏春 upon the order of Yan'an. I very much hope that they will receive the same Yan'an order to withdraw from other cities.

Question: When will Chairman Chiang return from Shenyang?

Answer: I don't believe the Chairman himself has made a decision.

Question: What is the latest situation regarding the propaganda truce?

Answer: Since Marshal Marshall arrived and issued a statement, we have reiterated our advice to all newspapers across the country: First, avoid publishing unreliable and unimportant conflict news; second, avoid attacks by rumors. You must have seen that this advice from the Ministry has been fully reflected in various newspapers. We will continue to encourage all newspapers to adhere to this policy. We have taken these measures regardless of how the Communist Party decides, and we very much hope that they can do the same. The Communist side suggested that all conflict news should be uniformly released by the mediation enforcement department and its enforcement team. The government found some technical difficulties and could not agree. First: The mediation enforcement department is not comparable to a news agency, and its bulletins must go through review procedures, so it is feared that it will lose its news value due to delays. Second: If news can only be released with the consent of the main party, then its quantity may be very scarce. Third: If only the consent of both parties is required, then the US representative will always be in an extremely difficult position. For the above reasons, the government cannot agree to this suggestion, but we firmly believe that the above-mentioned measures are sufficient to solve the current problem.

Question: Are the current conditions for peace more optimistic than in the following stages? (1) When Marshal Marshall returned to China; (2) When the government recovered Changchun; (3) When the government seemed about to recover the China Changchun Railway.

Answer: It is quite difficult to compare in this way, but I think the prospect of peace is very bright.

Question: What is the latest situation with US loans to China?

Answer: (Vice Minister Liu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) Regarding this matter, I believe you can get better news sources.

### Representatives of the Democratic League Met with Various Parties Yesterday

[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] The Democratic League telegraphed Chairman Chiang today, requesting that he return to Nanjing immediately to conduct peace negotiations. Democratic League representative Zhang Junli also met with Special Envoy Marshall to review the entire situation. Representatives of the Democratic League visited Chen Lifu, Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, and Wang Shijie this morning.

[French News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] After arriving in Nanjing, representatives of the Democratic League immediately met with Communist representatives Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, and Lu Dingyi to review the current situation for three hours.

[French News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Hours after the Central News Agency released the news that the National Army occupied the city of Jilin today, Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of the Communist Party stationed in Nanjing, gave a speech, saying that "the situation is in imminent danger." Zhou said: "Chairman Chiang is now stationed in the Northeast, personally presiding over the fire plan. During the Chairman's absence from Nanjing, any effective negotiations to stop the conflict cannot be conducted."

[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] Propaganda Minister Peng Xuepei, when hosting reporters today, said of Zhou Enlai's claim that Chairman Chiang personally commanded the operation in Shenyang: "In my opinion, the Chairman has not been to Shenyang for more than 20 years. This trip is to inspect the local area and comfort the people."

### Communist Troops Attack the Central China Railway Line: National Army in Anshan Withdraws to Higher Ground North of the City

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] A telegram from Liaoyang on the 29th reports that over 20,000 communist troops belonging to the 11th Brigade, 13th Brigade, and 1st Brigade of Li Zhenhua's forces, who had been lurking in the Liaoyang area, launched an attack on the Anshan and Tanggangzi stations of the Central China Railway Line on the 24th. The attack was supported by over ten artillery pieces manned by Japanese prisoners of war. Along the way, they engaged in arson, murder, and destruction, setting fire to railway bridges. The National Army units responsible for guarding the stations and bridges were forced to resist in order to carry out their duties, fighting fiercely for two days and nights. The communist forces continued to receive reinforcements from Xiuyan, and they threatened innocent civilians to act as their vanguard. Unable to withstand the enemy's superior numbers, the National Army has withdrawn to higher ground north of Anshan. At the same time, the areas of Dashiqiao and Haicheng are also under siege by the communist forces. As of the time of this dispatch, fighting continues on all fronts. This communist offensive near Anshan is aimed at preventing the National Army from moving north to take over defense duties, with coordinated actions from the north and south. This proves that the claims by communist representative Lu Dingyi and Xinhua News Agency that they would voluntarily withdraw from Changchun are contradictory to their actions.

### Ministry of National Defense to be Established on June 1st: Organizational Outline Under Discussion by the National Defense Council; He Yingqin to Preside Over the Strategic Committee

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] According to General He Yingqin, the Military Affairs Commission and the various departments, including the Military Administration, Military Order, Military Training, Political, and Foreign Affairs departments, will be closed by the end of this month. The Ministry of National Defense is scheduled to be established on June 1st without delay. Under the Minister of National Defense, there will be three Vice Ministers, overseeing six departments and three bureaus. A General Staff Headquarters will also be established, with the Chief of General Staff responsible for the national military deployment, reporting directly to the Supreme Commander. Under the Chief of General Staff, there will be three Deputy Chiefs of Staff, overseeing the General Commands of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Logistics. Due to its expanded scope, the Logistics Department will be renamed the Joint Logistics General Command. This organizational law has been submitted to today's meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council for discussion. He also stated that he has been in the military since 1924 and has been away from his home (Zunyi, Guizhou) for over ten years. During his command in Guiyang in the winter of 1945 (when Dushan in southern Guizhou fell, the enemy threatened the region, and all of Guizhou was shaken, He personally went to Guiyang to oversee the battle, turning the tide), he did not have time to return home to sweep the ancestral tombs. After the disbandment of the Army Headquarters, he plans to return to Guizhou for a short rest, but this is not possible at present. It is reported that He will not leave Nanjing in the short term. After the Ministry of National Defense is established, he will preside over the Supreme Strategic Advisory Committee, assisting the head of state in completing the great task of building the army and the nation.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] It is reported that the three Vice Ministers under the Minister of the soon-to-be-established Ministry of National Defense are internally designated as Lin Wei, Qin Dechun, and Liu Shiyi (as reported in this newspaper's special dispatch). The three Deputy Chiefs of Staff under the Chief of General Staff are also internally designated as Liu Weizhang, Fan Hanjie, and Guo Chan. It is considered more likely that the four General Commanders of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Logistics will be Zhang Fakui, Chen Cheng, Zhou Zhirou, and Huang Zhenqiu, respectively. The candidates for the four Deputy General Commanders are roughly Wang Jun, Zhou Xianzhang, Mao Bangchu, and Duanmu Jie.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The 31st meeting of the Central Executive Committee was held at the National Government at 9:00 AM on the 29th. The attending members included Yu Youren, Xie Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Guofu, He Yingqin, Chen Cheng, Song Ziwen, Shao Lizi, Zhu Jiahua, Liang Hancao, Pan Gongzhan, Zhou Tongzi, Peng Xuepei, Xiao Zheng, Cheng Tianfang, and Yu Jingtang, totaling 34 people. The meeting was chaired by Yu Youren, and discussions were held on personnel and financial matters. At 12:00 PM, the Supreme National Defense Council continued the meeting. Yu Hongjun, Xu Kan, and Jiang Menglin were also present, discussing the organizational outline of the Ministry of National Defense and scheduling a continuation of the meeting on the 30th. Regarding the adjustment of the salaries of public school teachers, the President had previously instructed the Executive Yuan to draft specific measures and report to this meeting, but the Executive Yuan did not submit anything today.

### Highway Bureau Strengthens Land Transportation: Slight Changes to Water Transportation Resettlement Plan; Henan Negotiates with Shaanxi to Receive Residents

[This newspaper, Zhengzhou, 28th] Due to transportation difficulties, 300,000 Henan residents stranded in Shaanxi are unable to return home. The Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration office, accompanied by American officials, went to Shaanxi to offer condolences and is negotiating the reception and transportation arrangements.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] The Highway Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has recently formulated a land transportation plan for June. The Lianyun Company, using the Shaanxi-Henan road, can transport 12,000 to 15,000 people. The Hunan-Shaanxi Road and the southwest road, from Chongqing to Hengyang, can transport 10,000 to 15,000 people. From Hengyang to Nanjing, 5,000 to 7,500 people can be transported. From Chongqing, through Sichuan, to Changde, and then by small boat to Hankou, 5,000 people can be transported. The land transportation capacity from Chongqing, via Hunan-Shaanxi Road, to Changsha and Ji'an is being calculated and coordinated. The Bureau also plans to expand land transportation from Ji'an to Nanchang. Along the Sichuan-Shaanxi line from Chongqing, the Southwest-Hunan line, and to Hankou and Nanchang, the Bureau and the China Travel Service will jointly establish national reception centers. The journey from the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road to Nanjing includes train travel on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Nanjing-Pukou lines. Therefore, the price is extremely low, only 78,805 yuan per person, plus a 75% discount for the return journey, totaling 129,250 yuan. The price from the Southwest-Hunan-Shaanxi Road directly to Nanjing is 164,650 yuan, plus a 75% discount for the return journey, totaling 287,113.75 yuan. If the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration can allocate appropriate materials for transportation on the return journey, this 75% return journey fee can be excluded from the ticket price.

[Additional telegram] Due to unforeseen circumstances, the water transportation resettlement plan for June has undergone slight changes. The original plan included 16 ships for water transportation in June. In addition to transporting grain and government-designated materials, they could carry approximately 10,000 people. Given the urgent need to resettle young people, it has been temporarily decided to allocate the Minxi and Laixi vessels from the 16 ships to transport youth soldiers from Wanxian downstream. Therefore, only 14 ships will transport grain from Chongqing eastward. The originally planned number of people transported eastward from Chongqing via waterways has also been reduced to 8,628. The original distribution ratio was one-fourth each for students, party, government, and military agencies, and others. The resettlement of students has now been changed to account for one-third of the total number, i.e., 2,896 people. Party and government agencies will account for 2,000 people, and the remainder will be for military agencies and other personnel requiring urgent resettlement.

### Li Nisheng's Case Concluded in Nanjing: Sentencing Scheduled for 3 PM on June 4th

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Li Nisheng's case was publicly tried today in the Capital High Court. The debate concluded in court, and sentencing is scheduled for 3:00 PM on June 4th. Throughout the public trial, the most profound impression was the unprecedented thoroughness with which Li Nisheng disavowed any culpability for his actions, compared to the countless other major and minor traitors who have been tried across the country. At 3:00 PM, Li Nisheng was escorted to the court from the detention center. After the opening of the trial was announced, Prosecutor He Zhongjin read the main points of the indictment. Presiding Judge Zhu Zhizhi then began the interrogation. In his responses and self-defense, the defendant repeatedly professed that his participation in the puppet organizations was aimed at "loving" Wang Jingwei and dissuading him from taking extreme measures. He claimed that he never voluntarily assumed the posts of Central Executive Committee member and member of the puppet Central Political Council, and that he never actively participated in any plot by the puppet regime to collude with the enemy. As for why he did not prevent Gao and Tao from fleeing, he replied that "they had nothing to do in Chongqing, so it was more beneficial for them to stay in Shanghai and engage with various parties." In his self-promotion, Li Nisheng vigorously emphasized that during his tenure in the puppet Ministry of Justice, he implemented a general amnesty, releasing many patriotic individuals who had been unjustly imprisoned. During his tenure as the puppet Minister of Education, he restored the teaching of party ideology. During his two-month tenure as the puppet Minister of Foreign Affairs, he refused to visit the Japanese "ambassador" to the puppet regime, Tani Masao, first. He only met with Tani Masao once during his tenure. He concluded by stating that "to accuse him of being a traitor who colluded with the enemy, even in death, he would not be willing." Lawyer Wang Long, appointed by the court as the defense attorney, also exerted himself especially, citing Confucius's principle of not punishing Mengzi as a justification, arguing that the defendant was merely a scholar who did not attach himself to the enemy while serving in the puppet regime, which was understandable.

### Simplifying Measures for the Compensation of War-Wounded and Deceased Officers and Soldiers: Three Simplified Procedures Prescribed to Increase Compensation

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The Telegraph and Postal Commission has simplified the procedures for compensating war-wounded and deceased officers and soldiers as follows: (A) Simplify compensation procedures: (1) Applicants can submit a list of simplified documents to the Commission. (2) The issuance of orders has been changed to be issued by the municipal and county governments for distribution. (3) Compensation funds are distributed by the Commission through administrative agencies. (B) Improve compensation standards: (1) Increase compensation funds.

(5) Commendations and Awards of Certificates of Honor. Those who have made special contributions in the anti-Japanese war will be presented to the National Government for commendation or to the Political Department for commendation, and will be awarded Certificates of Honor, so that the descendants of the deceased can have a permanent memorial for generations to come.

### National Taiwan University Professors Continue Research on Effective Drug for Pulmonary Tuberculosis: Chen Yi Approves Large Funds to Complete the Project

[This newspaper, Taipei, 29th] Today I interviewed Dr. Chen Xingfan, a professor at National Taiwan University. He said that the extraction of levorotatory lodinic acid from cypress essential oil was invented by Professors Chongshengye and Fucinan of National Taiwan University. The former Governor-General funded the research, but it was suspended after the retrocession. Now, under the leadership of Chen, professors from various departments of the National Taiwan University Medical College are working together to continue the research and propagation of its effectiveness. Dr. Chen has drafted a research plan to establish a tuberculosis research institute and sanatorium, and to conduct research in the eight departments of clinical organic chemistry, biology, pathology, anatomy, pharmacy, physiology, and bacteriology. Currently, there is a shortage of effective drugs, with only enough for fourteen people for six months. They are still consulting with the Gaosha Chemical Plant of the Monopoly Bureau, hoping to produce and supply them within three months. Chief Executive Chen has approved a budget of NT$2 million for the project, which will be formally submitted and implemented within a week. According to Chen's investigation in Taiwan, two effective drugs have been discovered, the other being <i>Stephania cepharantha Hayata</i>, but it has side effects. Cypress oil has a 20% success rate, but the extraction rate is only 0.1%, i.e., 100 tons of cypress oil yields 100 kilograms of lodinic acid, which can treat 1,000 patients for one month. Currently, they are also researching and manufacturing a mixture of <i>Cymbopogon citratus</i>, which is abundant in Taiwan, and two similar geranic acids, which will be more effective. Chen is very determined.

### News from Various Locations

Hefei: County Magistrate of Hanshan Arrested for Embezzlement

Since the provincial government implemented the reform movement, all corruption cases have been seriously investigated. For example, the former county magistrate of Hefei, Long Wugong, who was reported by local gentry, and the former county magistrate of Wuhu, Li Zhicheng, who was found to be corrupt, have both been arrested and handed over to the court for investigation.

An Incident Occurred in the Provincial Assembly Election in Anhui. Lu Shikui, the former speaker of the Hefei County Assembly, was elected as a provincial assemblyman, as previously reported. Now, sixty members of the Hefei County Assembly, including Bao Zhengjie, Wang Gengnian, and Liu Ziqiang, believe that Lu used bribery and is suspected of corruption. After being reported, the provincial government ordered the county to investigate thoroughly, confirming that his reputation was not respected and unanimously expressed their disagreement, advocating for a re-election. They have recently publicly petitioned the provincial government, requesting that they accede to the will of the people and declare their unwavering commitment to achieving their goal.

Wuxi: Joint Petition Regarding Property Tax

Local businesses and landlords are protesting the county government's proposed "tailor-made" property tax, which would collect 5% of the rental value. Given the decline of the silk industry and the sluggish export market, few properties are being rented. Imposing a property tax would only worsen the situation. On the 27th of this month, the silk industry association held its spring membership meeting and decided that if the government insists on the industry collecting the tax, they would have no choice but to close all their businesses. Over a hundred members collectively went to the county government to petition for exemption but were unsuccessful. The silk merchants are determined and have also telegraphed the provincial government, requesting leniency for agricultural and commercial interests by granting them an exemption.

Hangzhou: Low Silkworm Cocoon Prices Leave Silk Farmers Perplexed

Spring cocoons have already entered the market in Hangzhou. The provincial authorities, aiming to benefit businesses and support farmers, have announced a standard purchasing price of 100,000 yuan per dan. However, due to the exceptionally high price of silkworm feed this year and the scarcity of leaves, which are increasing in price, silkworm farmers have no choice but to bear the burden. The total cost per dan, including the two expenses, is 150,000 yuan. According to the standard price set by the authorities, they are already losing a significant amount. Recently, some businesses have failed to purchase cocoons at the standard price, and some are even lowering the purchase price. Silkworm farmers who travel long distances to sell their cocoons are perplexed and at a loss. They are frustrated and urgently hope that the authorities will send personnel to investigate the purchase situation of businesses to benefit the silkworm farmers.

In the evening, Speaker Zhang of the Provisional Assembly, along with local figures Huang Tongsheng, and representatives of rural towns, including Xu Shouyi, held a meeting at the Commissioner's Office. During the meeting, they repeatedly expressed the difficulty in purchasing military grain and requested a reduction or exemption, proposing to borrow money to purchase grain and repay it after the new grain is available. Chairman Shen stated that the military grain purchase quota was set by the central government, and the current reduction of 5,000 stone was an exceptional concession and could not be changed. Therefore, a satisfactory solution was not reached. The accompanying staff members also consulted on county administration and provided instructions to Chairman Shen. On the morning of the 28th, Chairman Shen convened county magistrates and others at the Tenth District Commissioner's Office to host an administrative meeting and hear reports from each county on their administration.

Together with the original cost of 3,000 yuan, the net price for the farmers would be 5,300 yuan per dan. They also immediately arranged for welfare projects such as farmers' schools. The entire county admired their efforts to advocate for the people and secure their well-being.

Editorial

### Replace Hatred with Love: A Sincere Admonition to the Chinese Communists

In recent days, Chairman Chiang has been making preparations to go on tour in the Northeast. According to a Reuter's Beiping dispatch on the 29th, the Nationalist army, after recovering Changchun, has also captured Jilin, and will soon take Harbin. The situation unfolding in the Northeast is about to clear up, which is gratifying. We cherish the memory of the boundless plains of the Northeast and the open skies of the North Country. Regarding the developing situation in recent months, for the future of the country and the nation, we sincerely present our views amidst our rejoicing.

First, the Northeast is an integral whole. Now that Changchun and Jilin have been announced as recovered, we cannot tolerate any situation where the Northeast becomes specialized. News reports state that if the Communist army abandons its attempt to seize the Northeast by force and voluntarily relinquishes Harbin, Qiqihar, and other places, it may be possible to establish a Communist army defense zone in the western part of Liaoning Province and grant them certain conveniences. Although this is news from reports, and its reliability remains to be verified, we, standing from the position of the country and the nation, do not want to see the Northeast divided. The entire Northeast should be taken over by the National Government and defended by the National Army without question.

Second, since the mission of Marshal Marshall, not only has the domestic situation not improved, but even the achievements made in the past are in danger. We should feel ashamed of this peace envoy. We cannot allow this situation to continue. We must ask why the Agreement on the Cessation of Military Conflicts, the Agreement on the Restoration of Communications, and the Agreement on Integrated National Forces, which were negotiated and signed by all parties, are now being treated as waste paper! If these agreements, solemnly signed by representatives from all sectors of society, cannot be implemented, then future negotiations will be empty words. The Chinese people, after suffering through the hardships of war, desire peace. To satisfy this desire, the government has spared no effort to compromise; however, even after the agreements were reached, the situation of domestic unrest has not been calmed, and transportation remains obstructed, causing suffering to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The facts before our eyes make it clear who bears the responsibility. For the sake of the people and the nation's survival, we hope that the Chinese Communists will demonstrate sincerity in upholding these agreements through their actions.

Now is the time to replace hatred with love, and the phrase "the proletariat has no motherland" has been negated by the two world wars. The Chinese Communists, after all, still say Chinese, and China cannot tolerate any more war. For the sake of the Chinese people, we should replace hatred with love and destruction with cooperation. We pray for the Chinese Communists to turn back.

An Impartial Discussion on the French Military Invasion of Siam

In this restless post-war world, we have recently witnessed conflicts caused by French military invasions. According to a United Press dispatch from Bangkok on the 26th, a report from the Vietnamese-Laotian border states that 800 French troops, along with motorized artillery, crossed the Mekong River five miles southeast of the Vietnamese town of Vietiane and entered Siamese territory, currently engaging in fierce battles with Siamese police and militia. According to the report, the incident broke out last Friday, when the first group of French troops crossed the river five miles southeast of the Vietnamese-occupied area. An hour and a half later, reinforcements arrived, and the French army began to advance eastward, immediately occupying the Siamese town of Long Gei and intending to concentrate their forces to attack Fraratat. The Siamese defense line was forced to retreat ten miles westward. Another Reuters dispatch on the same day also stated that French troops crossed the Mekong River at two points this morning, occupied Thai Bo, and advanced towards Long Gei. The Siamese government has prepared to file a complaint with the United Nations and requested intervention from the British and American governments, intending to seek a peaceful resolution through diplomatic channels. When the French army invaded, the Siamese police initially resisted but then retreated inland. The French army bombed military installations and reconnoitered inland Siamese territory. According to the above reports, one came from the American news agency and the other from the British news agency. The sources are different, but the facts reported are the same: the French army broke the border and invaded Siamese territory, using airplanes and artillery to bomb Siamese villages and cities. The transmission of this news of armed conflict is truly distressing.

According to the aforementioned reports, the French invasion of Siam was initially met with resistance from the police and civilians. However, the Siamese government has filed a complaint with the United Nations and requested intervention from the British and American governments, intending to seek a peaceful resolution through diplomatic channels. This adoption of a peaceful policy deserves our sympathy. According to yesterday's news report: the British Foreign Office officially announced tonight that Siam has decided to file a complaint with the United Nations Security Council, requesting the Security Council to immediately investigate the fact that the French army invaded and attacked Siamese territory. A British Foreign Office spokesman also stated that the British side will definitely place Siam's complaint on the Security Council's agenda. However, according to a Central News Agency dispatch from New York on the 27th, a message from Bangkok stated that although the Siamese government has accused the French army of invading Siamese territory to the Security Council, the United Nations Secretariat has not yet received any reports from the Siamese government regarding the French invasion. According to Article 25 of the United Nations Charter, although Siam is not a member of the United Nations, it has the right to file a complaint if it declares in advance that it accepts the obligation to resolve disputes peacefully as stipulated in the Charter. However, because the United States and Britain will soon propose that Siam join the United Nations, Siam's accusation against France is causing them unease. Therefore, the new dispute between France and Siam may be mediated by the United States and Britain without being placed on the Security Council's agenda. Regardless of whether this dispute between France and Siam will be placed on the Security Council's agenda, or whether it will be mediated by the United States and Britain, we hope that this incident can be resolved peacefully as soon as possible. The occurrence of this French military invasion of Siam has evoked the following thoughts:

First, this French-Siamese conflict does not seem to be an isolated incident. According to a France Press dispatch from Saigon on the 27th, French authorities held secret talks with a delegation of Siamese police representatives in April of this year. French authorities demanded that Siam return the Cambodian and Laotian provinces occupied in 1941 to Vietnam. According to a London report on the 27th, these secret talks have been going on for two months, focusing on the Siamese-Vietnamese issue and have completely failed, with the Siamese representatives having left Saigon. The French military crossing of the Mekong River and invading Siamese territory occurred after the failure of these talks, suggesting that their actions are based on the belief that Siam's international position is isolated and weak, seeking to force Siam to comply with the conditions put forward by the French side. The territorial disputes between France and Siam are another matter. Here, we do not want to comment on whether the demands of the French side or the past actions of the Siamese side are justified. But if troops are sent to invade because the conditions cannot be accepted by the other party, or if there is an attempt to coerce the other party into compliance, or if there is an attempt to create a fait accompli of military occupation to gain a favorable position, all of these are illegal acts and should not be tolerated by international morality. In order to ensure lasting peace, we denounce this act of aggression. If there are territorial disputes between countries, they should seek solutions through legitimate channels, and force should never be used arbitrarily. In international relations, we adhere to this principle; otherwise, illegal acts between nations will occur endlessly, threatening the lasting peace of the world.

Second, based on the principle that force should not be used lightly in international relations, we should prevent the occurrence of "border incidents" and confirm that all armed border conflicts are illegal, and those who initiate border incidents should be subject to legal sanctions. Some people believe that this French military invasion of Siam is "nothing more than a 'border incident'" and dismiss it lightly. In the past, border conflicts seemed to be commonplace, such as the "Zhang Gufeng Incident" and the "Lugou Bridge Incident," which were relatively well-known "border incidents." After the Second World War, humanity should condemn these "border incidents." In the post-war world, there should be no more "border incidents." "Border incidents" can escalate from local conflicts to full-scale wars. The traditional view of "border incidents" should be destroyed along with the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by atomic bombs. Therefore, even as a "border incident," we believe that the French military invasion of Siam is inappropriate; because at this time, we cannot allow any more "border incidents" to occur and disrupt the international order.

Third, France, having suffered hardships and trauma in this World War, should have a new sense of awareness. Whether the return of Vietnam to France is wise from the perspective of international justice is another matter that we do not want to discuss. But what international figures hope for from the "Fourth Republic" is that France should have a new self-awareness. The obsolete colonial policies adopted by France in ruling Vietnam, if continued, will inevitably encounter resistance. The French military invasion of Siam, although the truth has not been fully revealed, is undoubtedly another example of these obsolete colonial policies at work. It is due to the implementation of these obsolete colonial policies that "border incidents" such as the current one have occurred. These local events are not acceptable in the middle of a century. However, we hope that the "Fourth Republic" after the war can respond to the new era with new spirit and new methods.

### Byrnes Issues Statement Denying Formation of Anti-Soviet Bloc; Answers Molotov's Accusations Point by Point

[United Press International, Washington, 28th] Secretary of State Byrnes today answered Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's accusations point by point, denying that the United States and Britain have formed an anti-Soviet bloc. Byrnes's response also cited the records of the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference as its basis. Regarding Molotov's statement that Byrnes's assertion about the Soviet Union's expression of willingness to help the United States in proposing a four-power twenty-five-year treaty, conditional upon Germany's disarmament, was inaccurate, Byrnes also responded by emphasizing: Molotov at least acknowledged that the Soviet Union would, in principle, agree to this matter.

[United States News, Washington, 28th] Secretary of State Byrnes today expressed his views at a press conference on Molotov's remarks published in Pravda:

The Soviet Union Will Indeed Agree to a 25-Year Pact

Regarding Stalin's opinion on the Four-Power Twenty-Five-Year Agreement (which was proposed by Byrnes in Paris), Byrnes stated: On September 20, 1945, he discussed this matter with Molotov in London, and at the same time, he brought to Molotov's attention Stalin's remarks in Yalta on the Polish issue. Those remarks stated that Poland had been used twice as a corridor for attacking Russia in the past twenty-five years, and that the United States was at risk of retreating from European affairs and Germany rising again. Byrnes continued: In London, he asked Molotov whether the Soviet Union was willing to sign the Four-Power Twenty-Five-Year Agreement, requesting Molotov to express his opinion. He also stated at the time that the details of the agreement could be drafted. Molotov replied that he could not express the government's opinion, but could forward the plan to the government. Molotov also said that he was very interested in the agreement. On December 24, 1945, he submitted the previous proposal to Stalin through Molotov. Stalin replied that if the proposal was made by Byrnes, he would absolutely support it. On February 14th, he submitted this document to Molotov, along with a memorandum of his own conversation with Molotov. Later, the Soviet Union expressed its approval of the proposal in principle. Byrnes continued: If there were any doubts at the time, Soviet officials could have raised them. In Paris in April, he expressed his willingness to discuss the issue with Molotov. On April 20th, he received a letter from Molotov stating that the Soviet side opposed the draft agreement, but did not mention the issue of Germany's disarmament. Byrnes further stated: Even in Paris, Molotov did not express any doubts about Byrnes's remarks regarding Stalin's opinion. Byrnes said that he immediately requested Lieutenant General Clay, the Deputy Commander of the U.S. Zone in Germany, to instruct the Allied Control Council's Coordinating Committee in Berlin to dispatch representatives to each zone to inspect war factories and individual disarmament. Britain and France agreed to this, but the Soviet government only agreed to the disarmament of troops and did not express agreement to the disarmament of factories. Byrnes believed that it was very important to know whether war weapons were still being manufactured.

Byrnes emphasized that the twenty-five-year disarmament agreement proposed by the United States went beyond a mutual assistance agreement. This method could directly reach the root of war before it breaks out. After Stalin and Molotov understood this point, they very much hoped to establish the agreement.

Byrnes absolutely denied Molotov's mention of an Anglo-American bloc and welcomed opinions from all sides.

U.S. Policy on the Italian Issue Remains Unchanged

Regarding the position taken by the United States on the Italian reparations issue, Byrnes said that this matter originated from Truman's report at the Potsdam Conference. To accommodate the Soviet Union's views, the United States had made some concessions on the issue of reparations, but the opinions of the people have not changed. We do not want to help Italy pay reparations with our funds.

Regarding the issue of Italian colonies, he said that we advocated at the London Conference that they should be governed according to the United Nations Trusteeship System, with neutral administrators in charge. The policy of the United States has not changed to this day. Byrnes said that this move would give the Soviet Union and the United States equal opportunities, and the United States very much hoped that the Soviet Union would agree to this proposal. The United States agreed to France's proposal for Italian trusteeship after obtaining Soviet consent and co-signing an agreement. However, he believed that Italian colonies should declare independence within a certain period. Byrnes said that the United States was willing to discuss issues that had not been agreed upon by the United Nations, and the United States had no intention of changing this desire. The United States was willing to present world problems to world public opinion. "We live in the same world and want to live in the same world." He and Molotov both reached an agreement on the treaty before the convening of the peace conference. Molotov earnestly hoped that governments would study and calmly consider various issues before reaching an agreement, and Byrnes believed that he still held this hope.

Military Bases Are for Security Purposes

Regarding Molotov's accusation that the United States' demands for military bases exceeded the scope of security, Byrnes pointed out that in October of last year, before the United States made a proposal to Iceland, the United States had notified the British and Soviet governments in advance that the goal of the United States in borrowing air bases and other military facilities in Iceland was to ensure the security of the United Nations. Byrnes also said that after Iceland joins the United Nations, Iceland should be able to exercise its sovereignty to make the air bases and other military facilities available for the use of the Security Council. The United States had two wishes in this matter: one was the security of the United States itself, and the other was the security of the United Nations. He said that the United States only had 750 non-combat personnel stationed in Iceland. Regarding Stalin's request that Byrnes conduct negotiations on a U.S.-Soviet friendly economic and understanding agreement, Byrnes said that he had not received this request, but diplomatic exchanges between the United States and the Soviet Union had indeed discussed loans and other related issues. Regarding this matter, Byrnes said that the United States would propose a treaty on goodwill, commerce, and aviation. Discussing Molotov's statement regarding the costs of Allied occupation in Italy, Byrnes said that the occupation was indeed a major burden on Italy, but he believed that Italy should pay part of the cost of the war. He also said that most of this cost had been offset by our assistance to the Italian people.

### Regarding the Peace Treaty Issue, France Stands on the Same Side as Britain and the United States; Bidault Makes Public Statement: French Diplomacy Is Absolutely Independent

[United Press International, Paris, 28th] Regarding the issue of the peace treaty, French Foreign Minister Bidault today publicly stated that France stands on the same side as Britain and the United States in opposing the views of the Soviet Union. Bidault declared: If the Four Foreign Ministers' conference on June 15th does not reach an agreement, he supports submitting the peace treaty issue to the United Nations General Assembly. The plan was originally proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes. Bidault expressed his hope that Byrnes's proposed "choose one of two" method would not be necessary, and pointed out that some new factors may make the situation clearer before the next conference. But he warned that these new factors must be that the Foreign Ministers return to Paris with the will to reach an agreement, which can promote an agreement. If this can be achieved, the unresolved issues in the last meeting can be resolved.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] French Foreign Minister Bidault announced that France will propose a solution to the Trieste port issue to ensure that it is resolved. The reason why the Italian colonies issue has not been agreed upon is due to the attitude taken by the United States. Regarding the German issue, France does not want to divide Germany into eastern and western zones, but wants to separate the Austrian issue from the German issue. France adopts an absolutely independent diplomatic policy, and cannot be bought by the United States or the Soviet Union.

### The Soviet Union Resists Anglo-American Cooperation; Strengthens Southeast European Alliances; Aids Poland and Other Countries to Solidify Friendly Relations

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 28th, United Press International] The Soviet Union's move to strengthen its alliance system in Southeast Europe can be regarded as Molotov's explanation of Anglo-American policy as a first step against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is solidifying the Soviet-Polish alliance by providing financial, economic, and military assistance to Poland. This move precisely aligns with Molotov's claim that the Soviet Union will not succumb to the rumored Anglo-American attempt to "impose its will" on the Soviet Union and dominate the world. Polish Prime Minister Osubka-Morawski and Polish Army Commander-in-Chief Zymierski have departed from here to the south, and Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito will arrive in Moscow next, accompanied by the Chief of Staff and Minister of Interior. The Soviet Union can be expected to provide Yugoslavia with the same assistance, aiming to solidify the friendly relations between the two countries and strengthen Yugoslav military strength. The Soviet-Polish agreement has become a model for the Soviet Union's assistance to its allies, and it is predicted that the Soviet Union is prepared to make sacrifices to strengthen its friendly countries. Other steps related to Molotov's statement will occur soon.

### Molotov Will Visit Warsaw

[Agence France-Presse, Warsaw, 29th] According to reliable sources here: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has accepted the invitation of the Polish government and is scheduled to visit Warsaw in the near future.

Also, the delegation led by the Polish President, which visited the Soviet Union, returned to Warsaw from Moscow on the 28th.

### The Soviet Union and Iceland Sign a Trade Agreement

[United Press International, Reykjavik, Iceland, 28th] Local authorities announced today that the Soviet Union and Iceland signed their first official trade agreement in Moscow yesterday, stipulating that the Soviet Union will purchase herring, frozen fish, fish oil, etc. from Iceland, and Iceland will buy wood and grain from the Soviet Union. Britain has previously been Iceland's largest buyer of these items.

### Iranian Carries Out Two-Faced Diplomacy Under Soviet Pressure; Talks by Leftist Politician

[United Press International, London, 28th] An influential Iranian leftist politician, widely predicted to be re-elected in the next parliamentary election, told a United Press International reporter: The Iranian government is deliberately engaged in two-faced diplomacy under intense pressure from the Soviet Union to prevent the Soviet Union from seizing our grain. Regardless of the government's public statements, the Iranian Prime Minister and the Iranian people deeply believe that the course taken by Ambassador Ala in the Security Council is a way to avoid a situation where our country loses its footing. The Soviet Union's influence in our country is clear, and we can only offer passive resistance, that is, resistance with a friendly smile and a reluctant protest.

### Four Foreign Ministers' Representatives Pass Restrictions on Romanian Military Strength; Define Disposal Methods for Italian War Materiel

[United Press International, Paris, 28th] According to U.S. official sources: The Paris Four Foreign Ministers' Representatives have passed the Military Committee's report, defining the definition and disposal methods for Italian war surplus materiel. The issue of war criminals in the Italian peace treaty was also raised for discussion, but no conclusion was reached. U.S. Representative Dunn reiterated the proposal of U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, advocating that a special United Nations committee should accept accusations within a certain period, such as within ninety days after the signing of the peace treaty. Dunn strongly stated that the United States wanted war criminals to be handled by United Nations agencies, rather than unilaterally. The Foreign Ministers' Representatives also passed a report on the future number of Romanian army personnel, but it must be approved by the Four Foreign Ministers. The Foreign Ministers' Representatives have agreed that the Romanian army should be limited to what is needed to protect the borders and maintain domestic security.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] The Four Foreign Ministers' Representatives are scheduled to continue their meeting tomorrow to discuss the memorandum submitted by Austria regarding the border issue between Austria and Italy. They are also scheduled to hear the opinions of the Austrian representatives on the 30th. The Foreign Ministers' Representatives will continue to discuss the issue on the 31st, and at the same time review the report made by the military experts on the Italian fleet, and the report made by the economic experts on the Italian reparations issue.

### Our Student Wins Second Place in United Nations Advertising Competition

[Central News Agency, New York, 28th] A Chinese art student, Zhou Yixin (transliteration), won second place out of 650 participants in the United Nations advertising competition organized by the Christian Science Monitor magazine.

### French Army Invades Siam; Siam Issues Appeal; Sends Telegrams to United Nations and Four Power Leaders; Lie Does Not Intend to Submit Case to Security Council

[Our Report] San Francisco, 29th. It is said that a United Nations spokesperson said that United Nations Secretary-General Lie has decided not to submit to the Security Council the complaint issued by Siam regarding the French army's invasion of its territory.

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 29th] The Prime Minister of Siam has telegraphed Truman, Attlee, Stalin, Chairman Chiang, United Nations Secretary-General Lie, and Kiernan, conveying information about the French army's invasion of Siam. He stated that the invasion of Siam may affect Siam's food production and requested the world leaders to cooperate and work to restore peace and order in Siam. The Siamese Foreign Minister issued a statement yesterday morning saying that if the French army continues to attack, Siam will be unable to fulfill its important mission. The French army's invasion of Siam should be regarded as a coordinated action that violates Siam's sovereignty. British and American military representatives will go to Siam to investigate the facts and provide reports to their respective governments.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 28th] It was announced here that the Prime Minister of Siam, Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena, has filed a protest to United Nations Secretary-General Lie regarding France's actions against Siam. The Prime Minister said, "On the 26th of this month, the French army crossed the Mekong River and forcibly occupied part of Siamese territory, which is still in their hands. This is a premeditated action against Siam's sovereignty and peace guarantees, and it is hoped that the Secretary-General will cooperate in restoring peace."

[United Press International, New York, 29th] Siam's complaint to the United Nations against the illegal actions of the French army in Vietnam raises a new problem. This is the first time that a non-member country has appealed to the world peace organization, and there is also a subtle aspect: Siam is a former enemy country, while France is not only a member of the United Nations, but also an ally that fought against the Axis powers.

A certain committee member opposed discussing any of these two weapons, but said that they did not doubt their existence. One of them said: "After hearing about the inquiries from the Army scientists in the committee's secret meeting, it is difficult to doubt the existence of such weapons. Of course, the United States should not spend huge sums of money to develop such murder weapons, and then hand over the results to other countries. The results of other countries' experiments do not let people know their secrets." Other committee members said: The Army Department can almost obtain most of its requested 400 million yuan for scientific research, especially focusing on subatomic research.

[United Press International, Washington, 28th] Army Secretary Patterson, today speaking at the House Interstate Commerce Committee, supported the abolition of the National Science Foundation proposal.

### Allied Control Council for Japan Met Yesterday - Soviet Union Provides Opinions on Japanese Land Reform, Making Constructive Contributions - MacArthur Willing to Adopt in Good Faith

[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] The Allied Control Council for Japan held a meeting this afternoon. Soviet representative, Mr. Andrei Gromyko, put forward detailed suggestions on the handling of Japanese property and agricultural land reform.

Those accompanying them included Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Social Affairs Lu Jingshi, General Labor Union Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Director of the Labor Affairs Department of the Social Affairs Bureau Zhao Banfu, and more than 1,400 representatives from various industry labor unions. The meeting was presided over by Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian. The chairman delivered the opening remarks, explaining the significance of convening the meeting of heads of labor unions, and then Mayor Wu and Minister Gu gave successive instructions, announcing the central government's labor policies and the guidelines and methods for handling labor strikes, which were extremely earnest and detailed, lasting for two hours. The details are recorded as follows:

### Mayor Wu's Instructions

Unstable Labor Strikes - No Different from Drinking Poison to Quench Thirst

Since taking office at the municipal government, I have long wanted to meet with the labor union compatriots in this city because the severity of the food problem poses a serious threat to the lives of the citizens. The entire industry of Shanghai cannot be stabilized, so labor is needed to stabilize food prices and encourage grain merchants to purchase rice, so that rice prices will not rise endlessly. Today, I hope for the following from everyone: (1) Do not think of me as an official, (2) Do not think of me as a rich person. My own income is probably less than yours, so it is more appropriate and intimate for a poor person to speak to poor people. Shanghai is like a big family, I am like the eldest brother, and everyone is like younger brothers. If everyone is happy, then the whole family is happy.

What I am worried about now is everyone's unemployment problem. In another six months, everyone will be at risk of unemployment. Everyone's personal affairs are the affairs of me, the eldest brother. In the past, Shanghai was prosperous because Chinese wages were low and raw materials were cheap. Now wages are high, raw materials are expensive, and the cost of living is higher than that of foreign countries. Take one pound of cotton yarn as an example, the cost in the United States is only 16 U.S. cents, while the cost in Shanghai is 45 U.S. cents. Currently, maritime transportation is not smooth, but in the future, when large quantities of foreign goods are imported, China's entire industry will not be able to compete with them, and they will be unable to operate. At that time, if everyone loses their jobs, how can I, the eldest brother, face everyone?

Currently, labor strikes occur in this city every day, one after another. If this continues, it is no different from forcing factories to close. Therefore, I have invited everyone here today to discuss how to stabilize our lives. At the same time, I have invited Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs to announce the central government's policies in order to protect everyone's jobs and stabilize everyone's lives.

### Minister Gu's Instructions - Workers' Arbitrary Demands Only Increase Business Crisis

In brief: This is my third time coming to Shanghai. The first time was during the surrender, when Commander-in-Chief Tang and Mayor Qian were both in Shanghai. They unanimously ordered the factories that had been closed to distribute three months' salary, set up agencies to provide relief to workers, and urged factories that could resume work to do so. The second time I came to Shanghai, the task was to adjust wages and seek to stabilize the lives of workers, and wage adjustment methods were decided. This is the third time, and I am pleased to learn that the comrades in the labor unions are well organized and that there is a virtuous mayor, which is rare. I would like to express the following opinions for your attention: First, the central and local labor policies are to improve the lives of workers and increase production efficiency. Although this is a policy guideline, it is also in line with the demands of the workers, which I hope you understand. Second, the current economic crisis has several aspects: 1. Shrinking production quality, 2. Increasing production costs, 3. Interrupted transportation, 4. Domestic products cannot compete with foreign goods. These factors are sufficient to affect the national economy, which I hope you also understand. Third, there are also several immature actions of labor: 1. Arbitrary strikes and slowdowns, 2. Threatening other industries to strike and slowdown, 3. Arbitrarily destroying factories or machinery, 4. Using threats against capital, 5. Arbitrarily making excessive and unreasonable demands. These factors directly increase the risk of workers losing their jobs and the pain of their lives, and are sufficient to affect production and construction, social security, and the welfare of the people.

### Four Principles Proposed for Handling Labor Strikes

Regarding the government's policy on handling labor strikes, I can say frankly that there are also several aspects: 1. The legitimate interests of workers should be protected, 2. Labor discipline must be rectified, including that workers should abide by factory management and not arbitrarily strike or slowdown. In the event of illegal strikes or slowdowns, or other illegal acts, they will be severely punished according to law. 3. Labor-capital disputes should be handled in accordance with legal procedures. In any dispute, mediation should first be applied for according to law. If mediation fails, arbitration should be applied for. If one is not satisfied with the arbitration, all major disputes should be subject to the evaluation of the labor-capital evaluation committee. 4. Wage adjustments should be handled in accordance with the prescribed standards, that is, wages should be adjusted in accordance with the cost of living index promulgated by the municipal government, and the wage base should not be changed. If the factory is indeed unable to afford to pay wages according to the cost of living index due to poor production or business, the labor and capital parties should negotiate, or the evaluation committee should agree on a method to reduce and pay wages. Finally, I would like to urge the heads and leaders of the labor unions to pay attention to: 1. The need for correct leadership, 2. The need for sound organization, 3. Improving labor education, 4. Promoting labor welfare, 5. Enhancing labor's self-esteem and self-respect. I also hope that all the workers in Shanghai will show their strength, work hard, improve their lives, and promote welfare in order to improve the status of workers.

### Those Who Instigate Labor Strikes Will Be Severely Punished

After Minister Gu's instructions, Mayor Wu, with a tone of earnest sincerity, announced the measures for handling labor strikes: 1. Strikes and slowdowns are not allowed, 2. Those who instigate labor strikes will be severely punished, 3. In the event of strikes or slowdowns, no wages will be paid during the strike or slowdown period, and no demands may be made under any name, 4. Those who instigate labor strikes and extract commissions will be severely punished, 5. Laborers should absolutely abide by discipline. I hope that the heads and leaders of the labor unions will pay close attention to the above.

### Three Million People Died of Hunger - Hunan Disaster Relief Association Established Yesterday - Actively Launching Fundraising for Relief

The severity of the disaster in Hunan Province is unprecedented. More than 3.2 million people in Hunan have died from epidemics and starvation. Hunanese in Shanghai He Yaozu, Qin Zhen, Zhang Shizhao, Wang Yuxiang, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Yishu, Li Chongshi, etc., initiated the organization of the Shanghai Hunan Disaster Relief Association. The inaugural meeting of the initiators was held yesterday morning at the New Life Club, and at the same time, the founding meeting was held. Hunan Provincial Senator Fang Dingying, who came to Shanghai two days ago, and Zhang Xiang, representative of the Hunan branch of the Executive Yuan, reported on the disaster situation in Hunan. Thirty-five celebrities from all walks of life in the city were immediately appointed as members of the Hunan Disaster Relief Association, and 20 Hunanese in Shanghai were appointed as alternate members. A committee meeting will be convened within days to decide on fundraising and relief measures.

### Central Bank Embezzlement Case Expanded - Authorities Thoroughly Investigate Chongqing Bank - Central Bank Financial Inspection Office Will Request Instructions from the Ministry of Finance

The case of the Central Bank staff stealing gold bars has involved multiple banks because they had mortgaged the gold bars or had bill discounting relationships with the escaped staff member. The Central Bank Financial Business Inspection Office and other relevant agencies have been intensifying their investigations in recent days. Chongqing Bank manager Zhu Zhifei, who accepted the mortgage of the gold bars, will be handled separately by the judicial authorities for the criminal offense of altering accounts. However, relevant parties are unwilling to make any announcements about the development of the case because it is still under investigation. However, it is fundamentally illegal for banks to accept gold mortgages, so the authorities are thoroughly investigating. As the case becomes more complex, the entire financial community in the city is paying close attention to it. The Central Bank Financial Inspection Office will submit a detailed report to Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance after the investigation is completed to request instructions on how to handle the matter. Furthermore, the Qin Tai Silver Shop stated that the previous report that "Yu Shiyang, the owner of the Qin Tai Money Shop, is suspected of receiving stolen goods and has been interrogated" is inconsistent with the facts. Yu is only a staff member of the shop, not the owner, and the incident has nothing to do with the shop.

### Labor Strike at Longhua Airport - Stalemate Expected to Be Broken

General Manager Shen of China National Aviation Corporation met with representatives of the aircraft navigation group at Longhua Airport again at 7 PM the night before last to persuade them to resume work. As a result, the communications staff of the group resumed work automatically yesterday. Other parts are still at a standstill. According to the person in charge of the company, a glimmer of hope has appeared in the stalemate, and it is expected that full recovery will be achieved this morning.

In addition, all the staff of the factories taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Shanghai requested to adjust their wages because they were poorly paid and unable to make a living. They sent representatives to the office of the special commissioner of the ministry to request an adjustment of their wages, including three requirements: (1) Wages must be paid according to the cost of living index, (2) If the factories are auctioned or dissolved, three months' severance pay must be paid, (3) Before the wage adjustment problem is resolved, each person should be lent 300,000 yuan first. It is reported that the ministry completely rejected the first requirement, agreed to pay two months' severance pay for the second requirement, and only agreed to lend each person half a month's salary (about 30,000 yuan) for the third requirement. All the staff expressed dissatisfaction and prepared to fight for it.

### Madam Sun Advocates Raising Disaster Relief Funds - A Six-Day Peking Opera Performance Featuring Mei Lanfang and Others Will Begin on the First

Madam Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, in view of the current severe disaster situation in various provinces and the urgent need for relief, announced yesterday at the China Welfare Fund Committee the commencement of fundraising for the China Disaster Relief Fund. The initial plan for raising the China Disaster Relief Fund is to have famous Peking opera stars Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Ma Lianliang, and famous amateur Du Yuesheng's wife, etc., give a six-day Peking opera performance at the China Grand Theater on Niuzhuang Road, starting on June 1st. All proceeds from the performance will be used for disaster relief. The performance programs of the above-mentioned famous stars and amateurs are all their masterpieces. On June 1st and 2nd, Cheng Yanqiu will perform "Spring Boudoir Dream", on the 3rd, Du Yuesheng's wife will perform "Beheading Huangpao", and Ma Lianliang will perform "Calling for the Scholar". On the night of the 4th, Ma Lianliang will still perform "Four Scholars". Mei Lanfang will perform on the last two nights, and the program is yet to be determined. Tickets are now on sale at the China Grand Theater on Niuzhuang Road and at the China Welfare Fund Committee office, Room 201, 175 Suzhou Road.

### American Soldiers in Shanghai Commemorate Fallen Soldiers

Today is Memorial Day in the United States, which is also the first Memorial Day since the end of World War II. The U.S. military headquarters in Shanghai announced a day off and held a memorial ceremony.

### Allocated Housing for Various Agencies Must Be Limited to Self-Use; Issuance of Permits Limited to Cases of Urgent Need

[Report from this newspaper] The Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan for Shanghai Agencies held its eighth routine meeting yesterday morning at the City Government Conference Room in Huashi. Mayor Wu presided, deciding that future housing allocations should be as public as possible, announced at any time, to thoroughly clarify the committee's work to the outside world. Cultural organizations and any individual applicants will only be considered after the central government agencies that must remain in Shanghai have received housing, and if there are remaining houses, they will be allocated at the committee's discretion. At the same time, to prevent abuses in housing allocation, it was decided that all agencies allocated housing must limit it to self-use. If it is discovered that any agency has transferred or sold the housing, the housing will be taken back, the name of the agency will be publicly announced, and the responsible personnel will be handed over to the court for strict punishment, as a warning. According to the person in charge of the committee, the biggest difficulty currently encountered is that the Navy, Air Force, and Logistics Command troops occupy a large number of houses in Shanghai, but the relevant authorities have not yet submitted a detailed inventory for the committee to review. It is reported that the committee has decided to send telegrams to Minister of Military Administration Chen Cheng, Director of the Air Force Zhou Zhirou, and Commander-in-Chief of Logistics Huang Zhenqiu, requesting them to appoint responsible persons to participate in the committee's handling of housing matters, in order to vacate houses for allocation to other agencies. It is said that among the current military agencies, the Shanghai Garrison Command under Commander Tang has the strictest discipline over its subordinates. In addition to requesting the committee to recognize the approved 50 houses, all 87 temporarily borrowed houses (including 17 enemy properties) have been listed and reported to the committee, and they will be ordered to vacate them by the end of this month to assist the committee's work.

As for the rumors outside that the committee has issued a large number of permits, there is a misunderstanding. Up to today, the committee has only issued ten permits to the Local Court and one to Prosecutor Du of the High Court, both due to urgent housing needs, and no other permits have been issued. Although the Local Court has permits, the current residents of the houses have not yet moved out, so they cannot move in immediately.

### The Mei Gongmei Case After Pronouncement Awaits Instruction From The Highest Authority

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, Tan Yulin, Chief of Staff of the Songhu Garrison Command, told reporters: "The case of Jiang Gongmei's embezzlement and dereliction of duty has been tried three times since it was returned for retrial. Jiang's witnesses for each point have been summoned repeatedly, but they have not arrived in court. Therefore, this command immediately sentenced him to imprisonment based on the facts of his crime and is now submitting it to the highest authority for approval. Only after approval can the entire case be made public. The rumor that it has already been formally pronounced is not true." In addition, a batch of 26 criminals recently sentenced to imprisonment by the command but not yet approved, have been transferred to the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison for detention a few days ago due to the location of the detention center. Mei Gongmei is also among them.

### Real Estate Sale First Bidding Yesterday

The Central Trust Bureau held its first auction of enemy and puppet real estate at the bureau's real estate office at 4 pm yesterday. The results of the auction were that the dormitory of the former Friendship Bank on Jiaozhou Road and Kangding Road was won by Judiancheng Bank, the residence at 1194 Yuyuan Road was won by Runda Company, and the garden open space at 192 Hongqiao Road was won by the Central Broadcasting Equipment Repairing Institute. The bureau is now preparing to hold a second auction in the near future.

### A Gambling Den Cracked in Papineau Road; Wang Meixian's Drug Trafficking Failed

[Report from this newspaper] The Water Police Branch received a tip at 8 am on the 27th that a woman was carrying drugs to Pudong for sale. Police were dispatched to wait at the Shiliupu Ferry Terminal. Soon, a young woman named Wang Meixian (25 years old, from Pudong) appeared, carrying a net bag containing a small paper package. After inspection, it was discovered that the package contained eighteen pellets of opium disguised as peanut skins. A small packet of heroin was also found on her person. During interrogation, she confessed that the drugs were purchased from the Yang family at 22 Papineau Road, Lüban Road, introduced by Tang Wenxian. Branch Chief Wu Kexiao immediately ordered Zhou staff member Jiang Ying, Li Jinglian, Fang Xizhang chief officer and Police Officer Wu Zhencheng, to take Wang Meixian to the above location by car. Together with the relevant Baojia chief, they entered the house for a search. Wang Meixian identified Yang Yongjiang (57 years old, from Pudong, in the grain business) in the attic on the second floor, but Yang refused to confess. A search was conducted and two small packets of heroin were found on the table in the attic on the third floor (also rented by Yang), and a square of opium was found inside an inverted paper umbrella, and three small packets in another cloth bag. A number of peanuts disguised as opium were also packaged in newspaper. The total weight of opium was over ten taels and heroin was two taels and four qian. The introducer, Tang Wenxian, was also arrested at his address. They were taken back to the branch for interrogation and found to be true. They will be sent to the Municipal Police Bureau and then to the court for investigation in the near future.

### A Thief Shot Dead in the Nanshi District

[Report from this newspaper] Police officers Xie Wanfu, Hu Yunjiu, Chen Wanfu, and Yang Qingquan of the Yemiao Police Branch were patrolling near 170 Danfeng Road at 5 pm yesterday when they suddenly saw a thief running wildly from Dasheng Lane. People behind him were shouting to catch the thief. They ordered him to stop, but the thief opened fire to resist arrest. Police officer Hu Yunjiu immediately fired back in succession. As a result of the gunfight, the thief was shot dead inside 170 Fengmei Store. It is reported that the bandit robbed an old woman Yang in Pudong of 190,000 yuan and was trying to escape when the incident occurred. After the incident, a pistol and seven bullets were found.

### Luo Jingyu Discusses Silver Screen News and Future Film Production Plans Focusing on Education and Science; "Goodbye, Chongqing" is About to Be Completed

[Report from this newspaper] Luo Jingyu, Director of the China Film Studio, recently returned from the United States after inspecting the film industry. A reporter specially visited him to inquire about his impressions of this trip, the current situation of "Shan Zhi" (China Film Studio), and future plans. He said: The film industry has developed to this day and has become a kind of social enterprise. In the United States, there are more than 17,000 cinemas, 8 large film studios, and a total of 21 studios. There are as many as 276 kinds of businesses related to the film industry. The average number of people going to theaters each week is about 90 million. From this number, it can be seen that the film industry is closely related to people's livelihood and economy. In terms of education and propaganda, because films have a lot of contact with the general public, they have undeniable merits. The US has produced more than 10,000 kinds of military education films since the war. The US was able to mobilize 11 million people during the war and complete the training in six months, the merit of film education is worthy of praise. For this reason, the future plans of the studio will focus on the production of military education short films. The development of future work can be advanced in an orderly manner from two aspects: screening and production. In terms of screening, it is planned to establish the Central Military Education Film Museum in Nanjing in the near future. The museum has the nature of a library and will widely collect military education films from all over the world for reference. At the same time, branch museums will be established in various parts of the country to assist the main museum in collecting materials. In terms of production, a military education film studio will be established in the capital this year. The work will be carried out in two ways: one is to translate military education films from all over the world, and the other is to produce films by ourselves, focusing on two points: (A) technical education, including engineering and natural sciences, (B) common sense of social sciences, which will be compiled in the form of documentary films. Luo also said that when he was in the United States, he discussed cooperation methods with the US Time Forward Films Company and the Canadian Government Film Business Administration Office. In the future, they will exchange materials for use by the two countries. The studio will also publish a collection of "Time Forward" films every month. The products that have been finalized include "Goodbye, Chongqing" edited by Tang Xiaodan, "Savage Mountain" (describing the Yunnan-Burma campaign of the National Army), edited by Zheng Junli, "Inflation," "Chinese Navy," "Chinese Water Conservancy," "Chinese Shipping," "American Agriculture," "Today's Xinjiang," and "The Road to Nation-Building." "Goodbye, Chongqing" will be completed soon.

### The Asset Disposal Bureau Denies The Rumor Of Auctioning Broadway Mansions

[Report from this newspaper] The reporter recently visited the person in charge of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau to inquire about the facts of the sale of Broadway Mansions. The bureau made three points: (1) Up to now, the bureau has never proposed to auction the building. All rumors of auctioning are groundless. (2) The building is currently borrowed by the US military. Recently, the Ministry of Propaganda ordered that two floors of the building be allocated for the temporary use of Allied reporters. (3) Although some personnel from the Municipal Government are currently residing in the building, the bureau has no record of it. It is also reported that the bureau has received more than 2,000 enemy property houses of various sizes. About 30 enemy and puppet houses have been seized through secret reports, and about 50 enemy property houses have been received. The estimated value of the above houses is about 100 billion yuan.

### Flour and Cotton Yarn Tycoon Rong Desheng Returns Safe and Sound; Confined in a Bandit's Den for a Total of 35 Days; Family Members Remain Silent About the Circumstances of His Escape

[Report from this newspaper] Rong Desheng, the flour and cotton yarn tycoon, was kidnapped at the entrance of his residence at 210 Gaoun Road on the 25th of last month. It has been more than a month since then. The case caused a sensation at the time, and all sectors paid close attention to it. Yesterday, this newspaper obtained confirmation that Rong had returned to his residence safely the night before. There are various rumors about how he escaped. One said that his family paid a huge ransom to the kidnappers. The reporter went to his residence to inquire about the circumstances of his escape, but Rong himself and his sons all avoided meeting, so whether it was a "ransom" or not, his family members remained silent. Another said that after Rong was kidnapped on the 25th of last month, the Inspection Office of the Songhu Garrison Command and the Municipal Police Bureau considered the case to be of great importance, and both sides devoted all their efforts to the investigation and dispatched a large number of officers to step up the search in order to solve the case as soon as possible. The bandits, seeing that the situation was becoming increasingly tight and knowing that it was difficult to hide, released him at midnight on the 28th. It is reported that Rong was confined in the bandit's den for 35 days. Because he is over seventy years old, he looks a little thin. It is said that he will go to another port for recuperation in the near future.

[Report from this newspaper] In order to widen the road from Xinchang Road to Huangpi North Road, the Municipal Works Bureau requested the Shanghai Race Club to demolish the wall there and estimated the compensation for the original wall construction at more than 19 million yuan. In order to facilitate the US military stationed there, the bureau built a bamboo fence wall. Later, the Race Club objected to the compensation fee proposed by the bureau and requested an increase to more than 30 million yuan. Yesterday afternoon, the Works Bureau specially convened representatives of the Race Club, engineers, and representatives of the US military to hold a meeting to discuss a solution. As a result, it was first decided that the Municipal Works Bureau would start building a temporary fence from today.

### "Running Strips"; Detention Center of the Local Court Has Always Extorted Money; Cheng Zhaopeng Dismissed and Forced to Investigate

[Report from this newspaper] Since the president of the court came to Shanghai to inspect the high and local courts, the authorities have stepped up the implementation of the integrity campaign. Cheng Zhaopeng (from Anhui), the warden of the Detention Center of the Local Court on North Zhejiang Road, was recently dismissed for "running strips." "Running strips" is their slang, which means using the convenience of their position to extort money from the families of prisoners. All advances of money to prisoners must be registered with the detention center authorities and cannot be used casually. Therefore, some prisoners asked Cheng to privately solicit money from their families and buy all kinds of food items on their behalf. Cheng took this opportunity to make a profit and was eventually investigated by the authorities and immediately dismissed. Cheng was still unwilling to give up and still solicited a wristwatch from the family of Chu Benfan, a opium addict (who runs a clock shop). The Local Court found out about it and has ordered an investigation.

### Chen Bofan Under Trial; Serving in "Underground Work" Even if Not False Does Not Affect the Establishment of a Crime; Shelley Chewing Gum; Walks into Court with His Head High; His Attitude Remains Arrogant

[Report from this newspaper] Starting at 10 am yesterday, the Special Criminal Court of the High Court separately tried four cases of treason, presided over by President Xiao Xie and Prosecutor Cao Ju. The details are as follows:

Chen Bofan, a native of Shanghai, 47 years old, graduated from the Department of Law of Japan University. Before the war, he operated matches and served as the chairman of Shanghai Great China Match Co., Ltd. In 1940, he also served as the puppet minister without portfolio. In February 1945, he served as a member of the puppet Legislative Yuan. In 1941, he was transferred to the puppet Embassy in Japan as a counselor and committee member, etc. After being arrested by the Shanghai Office of the Military Statistics Bureau, he was sent to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Chen confessed to the facts listed, and claimed that he had assisted in the war of resistance and provided our side with enemy and puppet economic intelligence, etc. The prosecutor believed that although the Military Statistics Bureau had sent a letter stating that the defendant was serving in an organization, it was not false, and it could be used as a reference for sentencing, but it did not affect the establishment of a crime, and filed a public prosecution according to law. During yesterday's interrogation, the defense lawyer stated that the witnesses Huang Kefu and Chen Zukang had not appeared in court, and requested a retrial to summon the witnesses. The court ordered a change of date for the trial.

Zhang Zhiliang, a native of Shanghai, 41 years old, had colluded with the Japanese Zhugu Jiangbo, and the enemy naval attache Hino. At the beginning of 1944, he was recruited by Hino to serve as a special agent in an organization under the enemy naval attache's office, providing information. In April of the same year, he was transferred to the puppet Huangpu Police Branch as a plainclothes police chief of the Special High Section. He was arrested after the victory and prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office. When Zhang was brought to trial yesterday, he stood in the defendant's column, lowering his voice and trying to pretend to be a pitiful bug, trying to cover up his bloody crimes with the words "forced by life".

Hua Zhensheng and Gu Wenhua, during the enemy and puppet period, Ye served as the chief of the 50th Baojia of the enemy navy, and Gu served as the chief of the 55th Baojia. At 9 pm on July 26, 1944, the two of them, together with Gan Maotou, the secretary of the Hongzhen Baojia Office, went to Cao Baoru's house at 12 Hexing Lane, Zhangjia Lane. Because the extortion was unsuccessful, Ye and Gan started beating him and dragged Cao to Gu Wenhua's place at 88 Zhangjia Lane. Gan then committed murder, causing Cao to die from serious injuries. Later, Cao's relative Li Zongtang complained to the puppet court, which acquitted them. Recently, they complained to the authorities again. The High Prosecutor's Office confirmed the autopsy was true, and the defendants were all employed in puppet organizations, so they were prosecuted on charges of treason. Except for Gan Maotou, who is at large, both defendants Ye and Gu have been interrogated once, and a retrial has been ordered.

Ye Yaoxian, a native of Suichang, Zhejiang, 32 years old, is the nephew of Li Shiqun. In September 1939, he was introduced by Li to serve as the chief of the document section of the General Affairs Office of the puppet Special Agent Headquarters. In July 1940, he was promoted to the director of the puppet General Affairs Office of the headquarters. In 1942, he also served as the manager of the puppet Jiangsu Bank. During his tenure in various puppet positions, he harmed underground workers of the Central Government and investigated military, political, and economic news. During yesterday's interrogation, Ye still tried to deny it.

Also, the case of Shelley, the former deputy chief patrolman and political director of the French Concession Police Department, and Aminov, who used to work for the enemy gendarmerie on Baidang Road, jointly communicating with the enemy, was continued yesterday afternoon by Prosecutor Cao Jun in the First Criminal Court. The defendant was defended by lawyers Yan Zhenlin and Yao Zhao. When Shelley entered the court, he strode in with his head held high, chewing gum in his mouth. He walked straight to the defendant's column before slightly bowing to the judge to show his respect. After Prosecutor Cao asked some questions briefly, he summoned witnesses Juri Ai, Santo Yang, Shawi, and Mono. Shelley and Aminov sat aside to rest, still chewing gum. Aminov also asked him for food. The two crossed their legs and looked arrogant, as if they were watching a play in a theater. The witnesses who were summoned were all colleagues of the defendants, and their words were all in favor of the defendants. Finally, lawyer Yao requested the court to view all the files on Shelley in the French Consulate. Prosecutor Cao declared that it still needed to be considered and ordered a change of date for the trial.

[Also News] The Supervisory Office of the Shanghai High Court has formally filed a public prosecution against Xu Jianping and Zi Wenzhong for suspected treason.

Chen Bofan looked strange when he was on trial with his mouth open and speechless.

### Two Puppet Bureau Chiefs Sentenced Yesterday; Liu Xingchen to Ten Years; Zhang Haoran to Five Years

[Report from this newspaper] Liu Xingchen, director of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Goods Allocation Office and director of the Economic Bureau, was sentenced yesterday afternoon by the Special Criminal Court of the High Court. The main text: Liu Xingchen communicated with the enemy country and plotted to resist this country. He was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, deprived of public rights for ten years, and all his property was confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family. Zhang Haoran, director of the puppet foil tax bureau and director of the incense and candle tax bureau, was also sentenced at the same time to five years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for five years. All of his property was confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family. The charges were the same as above.

### A Love Triangle Murder Case in Yunnan South Road

A Ningbo woman named Miao, 34 years old, remarried Wang Dasang (45 years old), a fellow townsman, after her husband died, and gave birth to a son named Wang Baogen, 15 years old. Eight years ago, Wang was unable to support Miao, and they separated. Later, Wang served as an employee of a Japanese ship. When the war broke out, the ship was detained in the UK, and Wang stayed in the UK. After Miao separated from Wang, she married another fellow townsman, Lu Zisheng (36 years old, ship business), and lived together in a tongxiang room on the second floor of 3 Yuqing Lane, Yunnan South Road. After the victory of the War of Resistance, Wang Dasang returned to China in February of this year. After arriving in Shanghai, he missed his old love in boredom and visited Miao. He lingered for more than a month. At that time, Lu happened to return to his hometown for something, so no accident happened. Miao said to Wang: "I have been separated from you for many years, and I have another partner now. Please don't come to my place in the future to avoid any problems." Wang left in anger, but Wang came back two weeks later and stayed for two days. Taking advantage of the unprepared Miao, he stole 560,000 yuan in cash and fled. Miao found out, but she did not pursue it out of consideration for their past relationship. But at 5 am yesterday morning, Wang Dasang suddenly came again and broke into the room. At that time, Miao and Lu Zisheng were fast asleep. Wang immediately took out a sharp knife and stabbed Miao's vagina first, then repeatedly stabbed her buttocks and right arm four times. Lu saw this and shouted for help and tried to snatch the knife, but Wang stabbed Lu's left hand and then stabbed his ribs, both of them were seriously injured, lying on the bed, bleeding profusely. The murderer saw that his goal had been achieved and ran away without a trace. After receiving the report, the police station sent the two injured to the hospital and hunted down the murderer.

### Celebrating the Motherland's Longevity: South China's Premier Legal Institution – Fujian College

— Huang Yunqiu

Law students often admire Chaoyang University in Beijing and Soochow University in Suzhou, for their long histories and numerous alumni. Little do they know that in the southern part of the country, in Fujian, there is also a legal school with a long history and many alumni – the present Fujian College in Fuzhou.

Fujian College in Fuzhou has long been known in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces as "the Chaoyang University of the South".  The school came into being after the National Revolutionary Army liberated Fujian.  Initially, it was reportedly called "Political and Legal Academy," later changed to "Fujian College of Political Science and Law," and finally took its current name in the 20th year of the Republic (1931). There were also many changes in its organization during this time.  It initially only had a law department, later adding political science, and then economics in the 18th year of the Republic (1929). (In the 26th year of the Republic [1937], an agricultural college was added with the intention of expanding into "Fujian University," but the plan failed after only half a year of preparation. The agricultural college then became an independent institution and is currently one of Fujian Province's two provincial medical and agricultural colleges.)  To date, its history spans a full thirty-five years.  It is difficult to get an accurate number of the total alumni at the moment, but to give an example, over half of the county magistrates in Fujian's sixty-four counties, forty percent of the senators, and ninety percent of the judges are graduates of the college.  Given "similar connections" in other departments, the actual number is undoubtedly higher.  The establishment and growth of a private school is partly due to the board of directors and partly due to the support of alumni.  Under this "dual approach," Fujian College was not only unharmed during the eight years of the War of Resistance, but also became even more prosperous. During the war, it moved to Liudu in Minhou, and then to Baiyundu. During these relocations, school buildings, transportation, staff and student dormitories, meals, and so on were almost entirely provided by alumni from various regions. Alumni also competed to find solutions for the college's students' career prospects.  This shows that the solidarity, love, mutual assistance, and mutual support among the students are admirable. Last year, before the end of the war, as soon as Fuzhou was recovered, the entire student body clamored to "return to Fuzhou," and the faculty also agreed, and the move began in July. As a result, Fujian College became one of the first universities in the country to resume operations.  The Suzhou campus is located in the Baishui Jing area in the south of the city.  It lacks the noisy air of the city center, but is close to the countryside and has a rural flavor. Behind the campus is the scenic Niaoshi Mountain, and next door is the Higher Court, which is quite spacious and imposing. This semester, Fujian Normal School moved to the mountain above, and the medical college moved to the Li family ancestral hall, a few hundred steps away. It seems that the Baishui Jing area will become Fuzhou's "university district". Of course, the students of Fujian College warmly welcome their arrival.

The college still has its three original departments: Law, Political Science, and Economics.  This semester, it also has new Judicial and Banking groups, and it seems likely to expand into a college of law and business in the future.  The president, Mr. Guo Mu, has expressed his desire to turn it into a university, which is probably possible. The Law Department has the most students.  The total number of students in the college is now over five hundred. Too many students were admitted to the lower grades, resulting in over two hundred students in three classes, which is rare in universities in China. The faculty here is also the strongest in the Law Department, with many alumni and some foreign teachers, all with acceptable academic qualifications.

Finally, I want to introduce two distinctive features of the college: First, the library has a large collection of books. The Fujian College Library is the famous Niaoshi Mountain Library in Fuzhou, located under the wings of Fushan near the college headquarters. It is a huge building made entirely of reinforced concrete, consisting of two Western-style buildings. The first floor is used exclusively as a reading room and for students' evening self-study. The second floor is entirely a "book storage," and the third floor is a large drying platform, which can be used for cooling off on summer evenings and for reading while overlooking the Fuzhou night market. The entire collection of books includes 60,000 volumes of ancient books and approximately 50,000 volumes of modern editions. There are also plenty of new books and old magazines. In terms of quantity, it is said to be third in the province after Xiamen University and Union College. However, in terms of literature and law books, the college leads the province. The second distinctive feature is that the college's affiliated middle school has achieved remarkable results, with a student body of over 1,300 in both the senior and junior high school divisions. Since moving to Fuzhou, the school's progress has been even faster. The principal of the affiliated middle school is Lin Hongqi, and the director of discipline is Chen Guangzu, known for his "iron face." The school has a total of seventeen or eighteen classes, and the lower grades are particularly crowded, perhaps due to the more lenient entrance examination standards of private schools.

When National Linsen University was being planned, it was intended to include Fujian College, but the alumni unanimously opposed it. The only reason was that they "did not want to change the name of the college".  It seems that this college has a strong sense of confidence. With a long history and deep roots, it is naturally difficult to shake it!

### Answering Readers' Legal Inquiries

(1) Zhou Chenghua asks: I am from Wuhu. After the war, government agencies withdrew to Sichuan. My father is old and unwilling to leave his hometown. Our family owns more than twenty rooms. My father lives in a few himself, and the rest are rented to relatives and friends. After my hometown fell, my father initially had extra money, but due to the prolonged war, he was heavily in debt. He was forced to sell all the houses in the thirty-third year of the Republic (1944). The buyer took advantage of my father's distress and deliberately lowered the price. My father reluctantly sold them and signed a sales contract, which was notarized. Since then, the education and marriage expenses of my younger siblings have been unfunded, and even my father's living, death, and burial expenses are lacking. I wonder whether the sales contract made under the puppet regime is valid?

[Answer from Lawyer Duanben Kai]: Unless forced by the power of the enemy and puppets, the sales contract cannot be considered invalid. Your letter states that the sale was due to family poverty, so it was voluntary, and there is no claim for damages.

(2) Bei asks: I heard that Mr. Cao Tingzhang inquired about the pre-war mortgage of real estate in your newspaper. Lawyer Duanmu replied: "Handle pre-war debts and deposits in the same way, referring to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Civil Procedure after Repatriation," etc. However, I do not know how to interpret the permanent provisions? The matter about the enemy is the same as Mr. Cao, please disclose it in the newspaper, I will be very grateful.

[Answer from Lawyer Duanben Kai]: The "legal act" mentioned in that article refers to all contracts, including borrowing.

(3) Suzhou Ying asks: I bought several acres of farmland before the War of Resistance and signed a contract. The seller borrowed money from me twice before and after selling his farmland. However, the latter was repaid with interest last year after the victory. However, according to local customs, when signing a contract for the sale of property, an additional "persuasion loan" must be added at one-tenth of the value. I have several questions as follows:

(1) Are there any legal regulations for this type of additional persuasion loan contract? (2) If there are regulations, can the loan receipts for silver dollars before the establishment of the sales contract be used as evidence? (3) Is it still valid to date? (4) If the seller uses various methods to demand or force the establishment of a persuasion loan, can I sue the court to protect the people's property?

### Increased Supply, Slow Consumption: Rice Prices Continue to Fall. Oil, Beans, and Grains All Weak. Distribution of Cooking Oil Ends Today.

Yesterday, the rice market experienced slow consumption. Both Japonica rice and Keng rice fell by a small amount per thousand. Although Baiyuan and Yangjian goods were scarce, the influx of Japonica rice and Keng rice was not as strong, but the market was also weak, and prices softened. The flour market was sluggish, and the new wheat harvest was approaching, so the market weakened and fell another 500-600 yuan. Soybean consumption was also slow. It was rumored that soybeans were being shipped from Europe and the United States, causing market sentiment to soften and prices to fall sharply by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Many people wanted to sell soybean cakes, but buyers were cautious, so prices gradually declined, falling sharply by 600-700 yuan. Bran transactions were scarce, with neither gain nor loss. Peanut kernels were weak, with prices falling by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Wheat transactions were still sluggish, and red sorghum sales were stagnant, with prices falling another 2,000 yuan. Mung beans fell slightly by 1,000-2,000 yuan. The corn market was hesitant in the morning, but livened up at noon due to developments in Qingdao, and prices rose by more than 1,000 yuan. There was a large supply of oil from various sources. Recently, supplies from Henan Province had been arriving continuously, creating a strong atmosphere and causing prices to fall steadily, dropping another 1,000-2,000 yuan. Since the China Vegetable Oil Factory began distributing vegetable oil, it has distributed a total of 30,000 dan to date. It is said that due to the abundant inventory in the city, distribution will be temporarily suspended starting today. Yesterday, according to the rice market, over 9,000 shi of rice arrived in the city, with the following types and quantities: 3,702 shi of white Japonica rice, 1,042 shi of early rice, 126 shi of Du Xian rice, 889 shi of Baiyuan rice, 995 shi of thin rice, 970 shi of Yang Xian rice, 1,738 shi of Wu Xian rice, and 204 shi of Yin Yuan rice.

### 3,600 Tons of American Rice: The Hai Su Liner Expected to Arrive Today

[Our Newspaper] According to the Grain Administration, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Hai Su" liner, loaded with 3,600 tons (38,000 bags) of rice from Haiphong, Vietnam, is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. The Ministry of Food has also telegraphed, instructing that 10,000 bags be unloaded in Shanghai to regulate the people's food supply. However, how to handle the sale is still awaiting orders and instructions from the Ministry of Food.

### Bulls Retreat, Government Bonds Weaken

Yesterday, some bulls from the northern gang sold off government bonds, changing the situation and leading to a downward trend. The Tong Bing bonds gradually fell from around 7,450 yuan to as low as 6,750 yuan. After weakening near noon, there was a slight recovery, but the final result was a decline of 500 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Jia and Yi bonds fell by 400 yuan, Ding bonds fell by 300 yuan, and Wu bonds also fell by 550 yuan.

### Hang Seng Index Mediocre, US Dollars Sluggish

The Hang Seng Index was mediocre yesterday. Although the opening price was slightly higher in the morning, it was not easy to sell. It fell slightly from 1.79 million to around 1.775 million, and then fluctuated slightly. Although there was a recovery, it was difficult to exceed the opening price in the morning. 148 pieces were distributed at a price of 1.78 million. The situation became even more sluggish after 10 o'clock, lacking stimulation. Near noon, it was still suppressed by closures and retreated to 1.76 million before stabilizing slightly. The index remained around 1.78 million at noon and in the afternoon. The final result was not much different from the previous closing price. Gilt was 188,000, silver was 1,900, and the asking price for silver dollars fell slightly, with secret discounts ranging from 12 to 16 cents.

Foreign currency US dollars weakened slightly yesterday, gradually declining from the opening price of 2,345 yuan in the morning. It struggled at 2,325 yuan at noon and declined slightly in the afternoon. The situation was sluggish, and the final result was a decline of 15 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Hong Kong dollars were slightly boosted by telegraphic transfers, but the final result was flat. The Hong Kong exchange rate gradually rose from 415 yuan to 420 yuan. The rupee was 525 yuan. A certain foreign company made a large number of settlements, but the US exchange rate remained stable.

### Active Trading in Spot Cotton

Yesterday, New York's American cotton telegram reported that overseas textile merchants were buying in large quantities, causing a sharp increase of 23 to 27 basis points. Intermediate positions even rose by 43 basis points. The near-term price of American cotton was US$27.98, the far-term price was US$28.56, and the spot price of middling cotton was US$28.60. Trading in spot cotton in Shanghai was active. The textile construction company, after waiting for many days, was in urgent need and actively purchased 3,600 bales of fine-linted middling raw materials and 1,000 bales of Brazilian cotton, which were specifically used for spinning fine yarns.

### Scarce Trading in Rayon, Steady Prices for Silk Fabrics

Yesterday, the rayon market was affected by the upcoming opening of goods by China Textile Corporation today, so prices were slightly lower than the previous day by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The opening price for spot goods of the No. 120 Tianqiao brand was 1.32-1.33 million yuan, but trading was scarce, and prices did not change throughout the day. Prices for other miscellaneous brands fell by 10,000-20,000 to 30,000-40,000 yuan. Silk factory prices did not change. There were no transactions in foreign company goods. Users' silk was also very quiet. The price of Qianjing silk was lower than the previous day by 20,000-30,000 yuan. Due to cost factors, manufacturers were unwilling to sell silk fabrics at low prices, and market prices were steady. The price of Mei Ya bed sheets was 1.3 million yuan in the morning, and the price of Dachen checkered fabrics was 4,150 yuan per yard, which was 100 yuan stronger than the previous day. Prices rose another 100 yuan or so in the afternoon.

### Not Many Spot Goods, Yarn Prices Firm

Yesterday, the yarn market fluctuated narrowly. The 20-count yarns of various brands did not see any activity due to extremely sluggish demand from the Canton-Hankou and Tianjin areas. However, prices did not fall as a result, because the supply of spot goods from various factories was not abundant either. There were not many 42-count double-stranded threads available, and there were people looking for them, causing prices to rise by 20,000-30,000 yuan again. At noon, Textile Construction Corporation opened yarn sales as usual, offering two types of 20-count yarn, Liuma and Yunpeng, but there was not enough to meet demand. However, the opening prices for 60-count and finer yarns were significantly higher than the previous period, by a large margin of 100,000 to 500,000 yuan. It was reported that there were another 11 types of coarse and fine yarns and threads being sold through bidding.

### Cotton Cloth Sales Very Strong

Factories Have a Strong Demand for Grey Cloth

The cotton cloth situation remained stable and quiet. Factories were in strong demand for grey cloth, and purchases from the northern gang were also not weak. Buyers from Sichuan, Shanxi, Jiangxi, Fujian, Henan, and other places were very keen on finding spot goods for the winter season, so colored cloth was particularly expensive, and market prices rose by 1,000-2,000 yuan. The market in the afternoon was not much different from the morning. The Four Gentlemen's broadcloth and V-Dragonhead fabrics continued to trend upwards.

### Barter Trade with Japan

Managed Entirely by the Central Trust Bureau

[Our Newspaper] After the victory, our country's trade with Japan has not yet begun. For any factual needs that require the exchange of materials with Japan, the Executive Yuan has decided that the Central Trust Bureau will handle all negotiations and settlements. No other agencies or companies are allowed to operate on their own. The above regulations have been communicated to all provinces and cities for compliance.

### Neither Chinese nor Foreign Stocks Were Exciting

Chinese stocks were affected by the sale of yarn in Canton and by the exit of some participants in the financial sector. Yesterday, the market was uninspired, and the situation appeared tired. Yongsha fell from 6,180 yuan after the opening to 5,730 yuan. Meiya fell from 4,700 yuan to 4,430 yuan. Jingfu fell from 348 yuan to 315 yuan. Xinguang fell from 328 yuan to 303 yuan. Qinxing fell from 250 yuan to 220 yuan. The market stabilized slightly from exhaustion near noon. The final result was that Yongsha and Meiya fell slightly, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by a little more than half. Other stocks also showed some fatigue. The veteran stocks were mediocre with little change. In the afternoon, Yongsha was quoted at 5,750 yuan, Meiya at 4,450 yuan, and Jingfu was flat. The situation for foreign stocks was bleak. They were initially exhausted and then flat. Only Yisha was the hottest, rising from 2,800 yuan to 12,400 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. The final result was that Yisha was uniquely stable due to the small number of transactions. The rest were all slightly weaker.

### The Main Reason for the Food Shortage Is the Rice Shortage. The Rice Shortage Is Most Severe in China. This Year's Western Hemisphere Has a Relatively Good Harvest.

[US News Agency, Washington, 28th] According to statistics from the US Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Relations Office, the world's sales of rice from 1945 to 1946 amounted to only 6.2 billion bushels. In comparison, the market sold 6.8 billion bushels last year. The average number for the five years from 1935-36 to 1939-40 was 7.4 billion bushels. The reason for the rice crop failure is not only that planting and harvesting were hindered by the war, but also that some countries were affected by drought. The most severely affected area is Asia. Europe's harvest has also been drastically reduced. However, the production in the Western Hemisphere, stimulated by world demand and also due to favorable weather, has set an unprecedented record high. Africa's output is also unprecedented. Rice is the main food for half of the world's population, so the rice production shortage from 1945 to 1946 is the main factor in the current world food shortage. It is generally estimated that only 2 to 4 billion pounds of rice will be available for export in the world in 1946. The shortage in Asia is 40 billion pounds. Before the war, most of the world's imported rice came from Eastern countries. These countries imported an average of 16 billion pounds per year. The small amount of rice available for export this year comes from the production in the Western Hemisphere from 1945 to 1946 and the old rice surpluses remaining in the surplus areas in the East before the war. The Western Hemisphere can export between 600 million and 800 million pounds of rice in 1946. The place with the most severe rice shortage is China, where pre-war production accounted for 35% of the world's total. It is estimated that China's harvest from 1945 to 1946 will be at least 460 million bushels short compared to the pre-war production of 2.62 billion bushels. Even in years of good harvest, China needs to import an average of nearly 800 million pounds of rice from abroad each year. Compared to the large shortage this year, the amount of rice that China can expect to import this year is very limited. Other countries with particularly severe rice shortages are India, Japan, the Philippines, Ceylon, British Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies.

### Sugar Allotment Slightly Looser

Taiwan Company Opens Second Sale

Prices for Over 10,000 Bags Remain Original

Yesterday, the sugar market weakened due to the second sale of medium and white sugar by the Taiwan Company, and downstream sales continued. The guild's allotment price for spot medium and white sugar was initially 72,500 yuan, and then 72,000 yuan to 71,500 yuan, a small decrease of 1,000 yuan. The price for double bags was 71,000 yuan due to the need to account for the loss of the bag skin. The Taiwan Company sold a total of more than 13,000 bags. The price was announced at about 4 PM, still 66,000 yuan, delivery at the pier, payment on the 31st, payable by check, directly to the Bank of China. The Hao Fang company opened a batch of Shang Zhuang Diaocing, with a price of 54,000-55,000 yuan.

### Bituminous Coal Dust Sales Active. Hai Su Imported Yesterday Afternoon, Transporting Large Quantities of Coal Jin.

The factory is actively purchasing coal dust, and transactions continue to become more active, because the factory's allocation of coal this month has not yet been released, so the factory needs to purchase coal from the coal market, and the market is steadily firming. At the end of the market, it was rumored that 5,000 tons of allocated coal for factory use would be released soon, and the market situation was slightly looser, but the selling price remained stable.

[Our Newspaper] The Hai Su ship brought 2,500 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao and was imported yesterday afternoon, and is now berthed at the Yangjiadu Wharf for unloading.

### Director Zou Jingheng of the Chinese Silk Technology Department Discusses: The Looming Crisis in the Silk Industry; High Grain Prices; Lack of Talent

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] According to Mr. Zou Jingheng, Director of the Technology Department of the China Silk Corporation, the current state of the silk industry gives cause for anxiety about its future in our country. The current crisis in the silk industry mainly stems from: (1) High Grain Prices: Silkworm farmers calculate based on the ratio between cocoon prices and grain prices. Currently, it is roughly three *dan* of rice for one *dan* of fresh cocoons. If it falls below this ratio, farmers would rather uproot mulberry trees and convert the land into fields for other crops. Once mulberry trees are uprooted, it takes at least five years for new cultivation to yield a useful harvest. Moreover, labor costs are also rising due to high grain prices, making it difficult to reduce production costs. (2) The imbalanced proportion of increased production costs to raw material costs. Coal prices, for instance, have increased 16,000-fold compared to pre-war levels, while silk prices have only increased 2,300-fold. Before the war, production costs accounted for 20% of the cost of producing one *dan* of silk, while raw material costs (cocoon prices) accounted for 80%. In other words, silkworm farmers received 80% of the revenue. Currently, although each *dan* of raw silk sells for 2.3 million yuan, manufacturing costs account for one million yuan, leaving only 1.3 million yuan for the silkworm farmers. Furthermore, four *dan* of dry cocoons are required to produce one *dan* of raw silk, and it takes three *dan* of fresh cocoons to bake one *dan* of dry cocoons. Based on this ratio, each *dan* of dry cocoons is worth only slightly more than 100,000 yuan, which is 50% less than the price ratio of three *dan* of rice for one *dan* of fresh cocoons. Silkworm farmers feel this is insufficient to cover costs, but if the cocoon purchasing authorities were to purchase cocoons at this price, they would still suffer losses based on the current raw silk prices. (3) During the eight years of the War of Resistance, both silk production technology and talent in our country declined. Therefore, much of the silk produced does not meet standards, and it is difficult to recruit specialists. (4) External Threats: (A) The rise of synthetic silk substitutes, such as nylon, which was used extensively in the United States during the war to manufacture stockings due to a shortage of raw silk. Currently, nylon stockings account for 75% of all stockings produced. While it is said that raw silk use will resume on a large scale after the war, if raw silk prices are too high, the percentage of raw silk being used will not be very high. (B) The recovery of the Japanese silk industry. General MacArthur has allowed Japan to restore light industry, with the food industry taking precedence, followed by the silk industry. The production costs of the Japanese silk industry have not changed drastically from pre-war levels. Therefore, the conditions for the recovery of the Japanese silk industry are better than in our country. General MacArthur's actions are aimed at solving the livelihood of the Japanese people, but it is also hoped that the recovery of our country's silk industry will be taken into consideration.

Furthermore, it has been reported that the China Silk Corporation has begun to purchase cocoons in the silk-producing regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces starting on the 23rd of this month. The purchases are divided into four districts: Hao County in Anhui Province, Jiaxing and Changan in Zhejiang Province, Wujiang and Suzhou in Jiangsu Province, and Wuxi, Changzhou, and Liyang. A total of 58 cocoon businesses are operating in these districts, with an estimated purchase volume of over 8,000 *dan* of fresh cocoons. It is said that the purchases should be completed around the 6th of next month.

### Price Controls Partially Lifted in Britain Intended to Facilitate Exports

[Reuters, London, 29th Dispatch] The British Ministry of Food has announced that price controls on exported food, soap, and animal feed have been lifted. The types and quantities of exported goods will not be affected. Furthermore, exporters are allowed to adjust packaging and shipping costs to obtain better prices when selling abroad and to generate profits.

### Remedial Measures for Exchange Settlements Central Bank Sets Methods Export... Can Apply for Loans with Documents Import... Allowed to Purchase U.S. Dollar Deposits from Individuals

Recently, due to lower prices abroad and excessively high domestic production costs, imports have doubled in the past three months, while exports have been meager. People in the industrial and commercial sectors are calling for a longer foreign exchange retention period or effective incentives for exporters to increase exports. It is reported that the authorities are sympathetic to these suggestions, but because foreign exchange policy is determined by the highest central authorities, it is not yet the time to change policies. Therefore, to encourage exports, the Central Bank has remedial measures for export exchange settlements, allowing exporters to apply for exchange settlements at the Bank of China with two telegrams from foreign sales. The Bank of China will first lend the equivalent value of the goods based on these supporting documents, calculated at a weekly interest rate of 0.5%, to facilitate the operational capital for exporting goods. As for the industrial sector's request to extend the foreign exchange settlement period, the authorities feel that the extension period is too long, making it difficult to review. To facilitate the industrial sector in ordering machinery and raw materials from abroad, industrial enterprises are allowed to purchase our country's private deposits in the United States or pay with some U.S. dollars.

### Special Assessment of Gongxi Tea

Ruichang Purchases Two Hundred Cases

Due to the urgent demand from local printing merchants and foreign firms, Ruichang Foreign Firm purchased over two hundred cases of specially assessed Gongxi tea from Dadi Tea Factory at a price that soared to 40,000 yuan per *dan*, an increase of over 3,000 yuan compared to the previous price. As for sales to the United States, there has been no progress. Local sales of assorted teas to local stores and visiting merchants continue unabated, but sellers also continue to sell off their stock. The trend is that supply and demand are balanced, and prices remain stable. However, Qimen black tea and Dafang green tea are selling more sluggishly, and market prices have declined rapidly.

### Eighth Bidding Sale by China Trust Today at 3 PM

The eighth bidding sale of materials handled by the China Trust Bureau on behalf of the Government Property Disposal Committee includes various types of cloth amounting to 14,474 bolts, 40 cases of rayon, and 50 bales of yarn, with a total of eight bid numbers. Each bidder must pay a deposit: 4 million for the first bid number, 25 million for the second, 15 million for the third, 14 million for the fourth, 12 million for the fifth, 9 million for the sixth, 16 million for the seventh, and 4 million for the eighth. Bid submissions will close at 12 noon today, and bidding will open at 3 PM.

### Twenty-Nine Days in Changchun (Continued) (Concluded)

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper: Shao Shenzhi

Wings of Freedom

On April 28th, Major Rick, the military attaché, was scheduled to take off in the morning, but the flight was repeatedly delayed due to gasoline issues. In the afternoon, everyone was listless and sleeping. While napping, Major Rick suddenly called out to Shixun: "Someone is talking downstairs." When he went downstairs, he saw a young communist soldier in a yellow uniform. The soldier politely approached and asked, "Are you Mr. Zhao?" Shixun replied, "I am. May I ask your name?" The soldier introduced himself as Liu Ke and handed over a letter from Zhou Baozhong to us:

"To Mr. Shixun and Major Rick: I hereby introduce my secretary, Comrade Liu Ke. In the future, all matters concerning Major Rick's gasoline, as well as outings for the Chinese and American reporters, can be handled through Comrade Liu." Zhou Baozhong, April 28th.

Liu Ke was from Jilin and spoke fluent English. He told Shixun that he was a graduate of the Political Science Department of Yenching University. He had a rather democratic mindset. Talking with him, we felt that we were all taking an objective stance. He lacked the consistently simple, narrow, undemocratic, and tiresome political jargon theory of lower-ranking communist political instructors, where there was a desire to speak, but nothing came out of it.

On the morning of the 29th, Zhou Baozhong and he personally came to the reporters' residence to take Rick to the airport and see him off. After this, Liu Ke often came, sometimes bringing large packages of cigarettes, sometimes sending a lot of alcohol. As soon as he sat down, he would talk freely about everything. He shed his military uniform and put on a Zhongshan suit, making him even more casual. We frankly told him about the "secret radio station," and he laughed at the idea. He admitted that the communist army generally lacked scientific common sense. Such willingness to admit mistakes earned him a new level of respect from us.

In the afternoon of May 2nd, he accompanied us to the Yamato Hotel for a luncheon hosted by the communist Mayor of Changchun, Liu Juying. He told us that the Peiping Executive Headquarters had sent a telegram saying they would send a plane to pick us up back to Shenyang. We were overjoyed, but Beckett suddenly pouted and said, "This morning, I was on the balcony and saw two planes circling constantly over the West Airport, with gunfire from below. The plane coming to pick us up is probably going to run into trouble again." Sure enough, during the meal, Zhou Baozhong said, "Two planes came this morning and strafed at low altitude. We definitely had casualties. I haven't received a confirmed report yet. Our soldiers thought it was a plane coming to pick you up, so they all ran out without markings, and unexpectedly, they were shot at." He said he would never prevent our return flight, but if the airfield was damaged, that would be terrible! This was our first disappointment.

On the morning of the 4th, the same day that the Northeast Bureau hosted us for dinner, Liu Ke came again and told us that the Peiping Executive Headquarters would send a plane to pick us up tomorrow. The telegram was sent to the Northeast Bureau. On the evening of the 4th, we packed our luggage, ready to leave tomorrow. But on the morning of the 5th, Zhou Baozhong's adjutant suddenly arrived, wanting to speak to Liu Ke. When he learned that Liu Ke was not there, he told us that the plane was not coming today and asked us to inform Liu Ke that he did not need to accompany us to the airport. When Liu Ke arrived, he was truly ignorant of the situation, confused and went back to Zhou Baozhong. Later, at Zhang Xuesi's place, Zhou Baozhong came specifically to show Liu Ke Bai Dete's telegram to us. It read:

"I have decided to send a special plane to land in Changchun between 12 PM and 2 PM tomorrow to pick you up."

This was our second disappointment.

Because of the two disappointments, we didn't dare to trust ourselves regarding our flight. Beckett was the first to express, "There definitely won't be any hope again tomorrow." He smiled bitterly at us, so we suggested to him that instead of being bored at home, we should go to the Angel Dance Hall. We finally entered this dark place again. We sat down, feeling uneasy.

On the morning of the 6th, Kaifeng and Liu Ke came together to tell us to prepare to leave, causing us to be busy and flustered. Before we left, we first dismissed the five workers. This was something they had requested from us in advance. At the time of dismissal, we had to raise a severance payment and calculate the food expenses for each person for the past twenty days. Shenzhi and Shixun were penniless, so whoever had money took it out first, planning to settle the accounts in Shenyang. The embarrassing situation was both funny and infuriating!

After a while, Lü Zhengcao also came, representing the Northeast Bureau to see us off. An hour later, we arrived at the West Airport again!

The West Airport, except for some damage to the buildings, was otherwise the same as the day before. The howling wind no longer carried the smell of gunpowder. The grass grew tall, and the ground was full of pits, wooden planks, and gasoline drums – these were obstacles!

We waited at the airport for two hours, but the wind took our hopes away. We waited until 3:30 PM, but there was still no sign of the plane. We all dejectedly returned to the original house, feeling stifled. I really wanted to cry. We were so disappointed! This was our third disappointment. We, the eight Chinese and American reporters, decided to jointly telegram the Executive Headquarters, saying that we were waiting at the airport every day.

When we returned, all the workers were gone. There was no fire in the stove, and the room was empty. It was like an old house that had been abandoned for many years. This gloomy atmosphere was frightening to us. However, we had to find a way to survive, so Shixun and Beckett ran around the streets like crazy, trying to find two Japanese women to cook for us or do laundry.

Night was falling. After walking for half a day, sweat dripped down our faces, but to no avail. The two had to walk back to the residence with big strides. Suddenly, an old man and a young man walked out of a dilapidated house. Shixun asked them what they were doing. The old man's name was Liu Gui, and he said he was a Quartermaster. The young man was his son. Shixun and Beckett were overjoyed. Regardless of their qualifications, they brought them back. It's always better to have someone. Strangely enough, the dinner that was served was no less than the master chef’s meal of Wu. Everyone exclaimed in surprise: "This is really like a fairy tale in a children's book!"

### Returning to Shenyang

On the 7th, we got up particularly late, fully expecting that the plane wouldn't come again today, but as soon as breakfast was over, Meng You and Liu Ke came again. Liu Ke's expression was very hurried. He said, "The plane is already parked at the airport. We need to prepare to leave immediately. The plane won't be staying long." When our car passed over Anqiao, the car that sped past us carried Rick Haig and Kang Qinsi, the editor-in-chief of the People's News Propaganda Department. At this point, we were relieved, we were going to leave.

After a while, Zhou Baozhong also rushed over to see us off. We took off southward at 1:30 PM!

We reached Shenyang after an hour, and couldn't help but cheer. Chen Zurun from the International Propaganda Office and the American representative from the Military Affairs Department, knowing the news, rushed to the airport to welcome us. We were both happy and sad to be back in Shenyang. It was at this moment that we realized how concerned we were by the government officials and military leaders in Shenyang, our communist friends, and our respected Chinese and foreign colleagues. They offered their condolences and showed warm hospitality, which was deeply moving. We had only experienced a battle, but the fires of war were still burning on the Chinese people. At this moment and place, we couldn't help but shed tears.

Whether they were friends we knew or didn't know, they were in Shenyang, Peiping, or elsewhere, inquiring about our safety in advance, and then negotiating with the Executive Headquarters to send a plane to welcome us back to Shenyang. Especially the invaluable friendship from our colleagues, we will always remember and will urge us to stand even firmer in our common positions. (End of Full Text)

### Taipei Aborigines Awaiting Government Pacification

— This Newspaper Taiwan 20th Dispatch: Special Correspondent Muyun

In Taipei County's scenic areas, Wenshan, Suao, and Dong'ao, there are substantial numbers of aborigines, including the "Nanao Aborigines," "Yaogou'an Aborigines," and "Xitou Aborigines," commonly known as the Takasago Tribe. These are civilized aborigines who have been under Japanese control and education. They are truly indigenous people of Taiwan. The people currently referred to as "native Taiwanese" are actually merchants who crossed the sea from Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Guangdong in southern China, and have only maintained lineage ties here for several generations. In reality, the aboriginal inhabitants of Taiwan are a part of the Indochinese people who were forced to flee into the deep mountains and valleys after the late Ming Dynasty, isolated from modern civilization, living a primitive life. A portion of them are now the civilized aborigines — the Takasago Tribe.

Japanese Unconquered

On the 6th of this month, the reporter went to Taitung to investigate, and also took the opportunity to observe the lives of the Takasago Tribe in the Zuoshui Magan area of Suao and Dong'ao. On the small train from Luodong to Zuoshui (this line was built by the Taiwan Takushoku Kaisha, primarily for transporting wood from Taiping Mountain, and it also carries passengers. Since February 15th, it has been jointly managed by the Industrial and Mining Department and the Agricultural and Forestry Department. The total length from Luodong to the terminal Tu Chang is 37.1 kilometers), District Chief Liao and Mr. Chen, who has been here for more than ten years, pointed to the shrouded mountains and said that the Japanese spent eight or nine years and had many people shot dead in these mountains. This is their graveyard for conquering the aborigines. In those years, the aborigines were restrained and deprived of their wild freedom and security of life. Their agricultural activities were restricted, and they were forcibly subjected to Japanese education and language. However, after the Japanese surrendered, a reaction arose in their simple minds, and they rekindled the flames of resistance. They said, "We have not been conquered."

Glimpse of Aboriginal Life

In the Zuoshui Magan area, there are 490 households of Takasago Tribe compatriots, about 2600 people. Their total number in Taiping Mountain is over 8,000, Suao has fewer, about 6,000, and others are scattered in Hualien Port, Hsinchu, and other places. Their lives are all the same: squatting in small wooden houses huddled on the side of the mountains. The only things in the houses are simple straw mats, but on the dirt floor, firewood is piled up to burn yam skins and weeds, emitting a wild atmosphere that far surpasses the "level of civilization" given by the Japanese. Most of them can speak Japanese. The men among them are either knitting baskets and sharpening knives indoors during the day, or going to the mountains to farm and gather firewood. A German engineer used a twelve-kilometer-long water diversion project on Clear Water Mountain to generate electricity for the residents of the mountainous area, but the Takasago Tribe are not accustomed to enjoying it. Most of the women wear tattered clothes, some also wear Western-style clothing, and their faces are tattooed with patterns. In Dong'ao, we met a Takasago woman sitting on a mat weaving rattan. She was working as a nurse at the affiliated hospital of National Taiwan University. In Magan, we met a young Japanese woman who had just graduated from the police station. She and they were the most outstanding figures. Agricultural cultivation and planting are primitive, without fertilization, and after one or two years, they no longer cultivate and move the land. Each household has a "warehouse," where rice, yams, vegetables, and peanuts are stored in small houses built high up like pigeon cages. They say this is to avoid rats. Women who marry Han Chinese are subject to the most severe punishment by the tribe, but in Zuoshui, a Takasago nurse followed a Japanese doctor back to Tokyo.

Conversation with Young Aborigine

The reporter had a brief conversation with a young aborigine, Wudesheng, who had just graduated from the Taipei Police Training Institute and was studying Japanese annotated texts. When the reporter asked about the aborigines' real feelings after the Retrocession, he replied: "For a period after the Retrocession, the aborigines were afraid of the attitude the Chinese government would take, and everyone panicked. Now, things have gradually changed, but generally, they all think that the price of rice used to be only a few cents per catty, but now it has risen sharply, which is unbearable. I personally want to do something for the government and the aborigines. It's just that the government can't agree to him, which is a problem." The reporter told him that the government treats the aborigines as fellow countrymen and that all the past Japanese restrictions have been lifted, and they will have the freedom to obtain jobs and live their lives in the future. (The Zuoshui Police Station has publicly announced the removal of the old terms for savages and barbarians). He and a group of 135 aborigine youths are leaders in the area. He conveyed the opinions of the government and the local police station to the tribe, and he became a crucial intermediary.

### American Scientist Predicts Disease-Causing Bacteria Will Become Resistant to Penicillin

Dr. Hous Molitoi, who studies therapeutics at the Merck Institute, gave an alarming prediction at a meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, stating that "Penicillin" would lose its therapeutic efficacy within five to ten years.

Unless chemists can improve Penicillin and keep it effective, patients suffering from pneumonia and streptococcal infections will need new bactericides to treat them.

Currently, great drugs such as Penicillin and Streptomycin will become useless waste within a few years. This is because bacteria are constantly developing resistance to these compounds. Dr. Molitoi predicts that in the future, doctors will need to use a thousand times the dose and use it faster to cure patients.

One way to prevent Penicillin from becoming ineffective is to avoid giving patients this drug unless it is really necessary. Making this drug into pills or ointments, so that patients receive only a small amount of the compound, or using it in conditions that it cannot treat, such as influenza, will accelerate the ineffectiveness of Penicillin.

When using Penicillin, the dose used must be able to kill the bacteria within a few days before the bacteria become accustomed to the drug and develop resistance. (Translated from the March 23rd "Science News Letter")

### National Assembly Delegate Tells Our Reporter: Hunan Famine Victims Eating Kudzu Roots

— Mao Shukai, dispatched from Nanjing on the 27th

A National Assembly delegate from Hunan Province told the reporter: "Hunan Province contributed the most during the War of Resistance and suffered the most damage. Currently, the entire Hunan is on the verge of collapse. There is a shortage of food, housing, clothing... shortages in everything. When we, the National Assembly delegates, passed through Yueyang, hundreds of representatives of the people came to petition, requesting that the National Assembly delegates report the disaster to the central government after arriving in Beijing, hoping to quickly obtain relief. Many of these representatives of the people were only wearing shorts. A complete cloth garment is considered a luxury item here. The magistrate of Yueyang County originally had a pamphlet to report the disaster situation to us, but the county government gave up because it could not afford the printing costs. The civil servants of the county government now only eat one meal a day."

### Dug Up Kudzu Roots, Pressed Out Milky Juice with a Stone Mill

Readers often hear stories of famine victims eating grass roots and tree bark, but they may not necessarily understand how they eat them. Now, we have a real-life example to report to readers: In Hunan's Xuefeng Mountain, Wugong Mountain, and other mountainous areas, wild kudzu vines grow everywhere. Starving people dig up the roots of these kudzu vines and carry them home in large bundles. They use stone mills to press out a milky white liquid. After being boiled in boiling water, it turns into a block of semi-solid substance. It is said to contain some starchy matter and has a slightly bitter taste. Currently, millions of Hunanese people are relying on this kudzu root to sustain their lives.

Hunan was originally a rice-producing region, but after the enemy's plundering and the military's requisitioning of grain, all the stored grain has been emptied. Coupled with last year's drought, this has created an unprecedented famine. Large numbers of refugees are concentrating in the cities, but what is there in the cities?

### Lucky Houses: Only Fourteen Buildings Remaining in the Entire City

After six conferences and a major fire in the provincial capital of Changsha, and after a month and eighteen days of fierce street fighting, burning and bombing, after victory, only fourteen buildings remained standing in the entire city by sheer luck. Countless battles have long turned Changde into a pile of rubble, with only half a fortress remaining. For dozens of miles along both sides of the Hunan-Guangdong section of the Yuehan Railway, no human habitation can be found. Under such dire circumstances, the people still have to bear the burden of military grain. The total amount for this year was initially set at 12 million shi. In reality, even if all of the province's resources were gathered, it probably wouldn't be enough to pay for that much military grain. Later, the authorities reduced it to 4 million dan. Can you imagine, how can the people of Hunan, who are already eating grass roots and tree bark, still have the ability to supply military grain? As a result, less than one-tenth was collected before it was stopped.

### Grain Stores Emptied Long Ago: Trees on the Mountains All Felled

Although western Hunan was not ravaged by enemy forces, it was a major military station when the war situation in central Hunan was tense. The troops passing through demanded this and that. Western Hunan has always been a well-known poverty-stricken area, and it could not withstand years of supporting a large number of troops. All the grain stores were eaten clean long ago, and the trees on the mountains were all felled for construction purposes, leaving nothing behind. Currently, starving people gather as bandits, and no one dares to go near places twenty miles from the towns.

The people of Hunan have a strong and indomitable spirit. After the occupation, the people spontaneously organized guerrilla forces. Small numbers of enemy troops entering the villages were often killed. Therefore, the Japanese invaders harbored great hatred and carried out particularly brutal burning and killing. When they gathered large forces to attack small villages, they razed everything to the ground. In particular, they often used machine guns to collectively slaughter oxen and burned agricultural tools and seeds. Therefore, the rural areas of occupied Hunan have been thoroughly destroyed. Post-war relief is now an urgent task.

### Desks and Benches Incomplete: A Million Young People Out of School

Before the war, Hunan Province had more than 400 public and private secondary and higher education institutions. Now, 80% have been destroyed by artillery fire. Even those that have not been destroyed are missing pieces. There are benches but no desks; there are desks but no benches. It is estimated that there are more than a million young people out of school.

The Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has agreed to provide Hunan with 100,000 tons of flour, but due to transportation difficulties, only 4,000 tons have been delivered. Sichuan Province has agreed to supply 200,000 shi of rice, and Jiangxi has also agreed to subsidize 200,000 dan of grain. However, not a single grain has been shipped to date. The Hunan representatives attending the National Assembly have been in contact with the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Four Banks Joint Office, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for days, requesting loans and increased relief supplies, but with little result. One representative angrily told reporters, "The people of Hunan have no choice but to starve to death!" The reporter was deeply moved by this and readily agreed to report the serious disaster situation in Hunan to all sectors of society and the people of the whole country. I believe that it will surely receive widespread sympathy and assistance, and I firmly believe that the millions of suffering Hunanese compatriots can be saved.

### Bengbu's Salt Industry Plummets

— Bengbu Report on the 23rd, Correspondent Qian Mengchao

After more than seven years of devastation, Bengbu has suffered serious internal injuries. The social situation after the recovery is still extremely corrupt, with glaring contradictions. The pacification is not peaceful, and the public security is not secure. On the surface, they are doing their best to gloss over the situation and decorate the city with unnecessary construction, but this cannot cover up the internal wounds. Ten counties in northern Anhui have been occupied and harassed by the Communists, causing the generally docile people to be unable to live in peace and unable to enjoy their work. Those who have fled gather in Bengbu, struggling on the brink of starvation.

Bengbu is the largest transportation and sales market for Huai salt on the Anhui-Henan bank of the Huai River. Unfortunately, most of the salt fields in the Huai area are under the control of the Communists and cannot be freely transported and sold. The eastern section of the Longhai Railway, which is being repaired and destroyed at the same time, has long lost its effectiveness in transporting salt, thus causing the salt industry in Bengbu to plummet. Transporters have no salt to transport, salt shops have no commission to collect, and the decline of the salt industry affects the collection of salt taxes. The Director-General of the Salt Administration, Zhai Qiujie, after observing the situation in Bengbu a few days ago, believed that the shortage of income was due to smuggling. Therefore, he added bureau posts on the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, calling it the final inspection and supplementary collection line, requiring all untaxed goods to be paid within fifteen days. In addition, a large number of salt police were transferred to strengthen the inspection and seizure forces along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. However, the market price of Huai salt rose from 18,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan per dan yesterday.

Bengbu, which has always relied on salt and grain as its main commodities, has seen both items become sluggish since this month due to scarce sources and sluggish sales. As for rice, the soaring rice prices in Shanghai in recent days have caused widespread panic. In addition, the surrounding counties are all suffering from grain shortages, with the price per shi rising from 70,000 to break through the 90,000 yuan mark. Wheat has also entered the market and has followed suit, with each shi costing 54,000 yuan and facing a situation of supply falling short of demand. The local authorities have yet to come up with a way to suppress the soaring prices of rice and grain.

With the soaring prices of rice and grain, other commodity prices have also fluctuated greatly, and the general middle class is suffering unspeakable hardship. Teachers in various primary and secondary schools have requested relief from the Anhui Relief and Rehabilitation Branch. People in the community who are enthusiastic about education, after being prompted by public opinion here, have enthusiastically launched a movement to respect teachers. Celebrities in military and political circles have actively donated to promote the movement, and it is believed that the fund of 20 million yuan will not be difficult to raise in a short period of time.

### A Good Way to Solve the Housing Shortage

I recently read in your newspaper that the authorities will deal with the city's housing shortage in a strict manner in the short term, or will adopt the same method as Beijing and forcibly rent out vacant houses. Specifically, each household will be limited to two rooms for every five people, and three rooms for every six or more people, with a maximum of four rooms, to punish those who have vacant houses and do not rent them out. This measure is truly wise. Since the outbreak of the war, the city's housing shortage has become increasingly serious. Recently, solving the housing problem has become even more difficult than the food problem. After all, no matter how high the price of food is, it is not necessary to use gold bars as a medium. There are still not many people who are completely without food, while the housing shortage has left the general middle class and small citizens in a completely helpless state. In the past, during the enemy puppet period, the puppet municipal authorities repeatedly issued announcements strictly prohibiting the collection of key money, but it was just a piece of paper with no practical measures, only giving the citizens a bad impression. After the victory, the municipal authorities have not taken any relief measures. This time, Mayor Wu took office and, in addition to making efforts to suppress food prices, has further addressed the housing shortage, which has truly made the small citizens extremely delighted. At present, there is no shortage of houses in Shanghai. As your newspaper has stated, assigning houses based on the number of people will naturally eliminate the evil practice of key money. Three years ago, I lived in Yantai City, Shandong Province, which was also under the iron heel of the Japanese enemy. The housing panic was similar to the current situation in Shanghai. The Japanese instructed the local authorities to allocate houses based on a few square feet per person, ordering those with excess houses to rent them out. After this news spread, the situation changed greatly. Landlords who occupied large houses with a small number of people not only dared not ask for key money but also widely contacted relatives and friends to recruit tenants. After all, the discipline of the enemy puppet army was extremely poor, and if such people were rented to, the landlords would never have peace. Therefore, as long as they were decent people who were willing to live there, they were welcome regardless of the amount of rent. Later, I moved to this city, but I had neither gold bars nor power. The suffering I have endured in terms of housing over the years cannot be described in a few words. I often thought to myself that housing allocation is the most reasonable and effective way to solve the housing shortage. Why did the municipal authorities not see this and allow the small citizens of the city who had no gold bars to be unable to find a tile to cover their heads? Until today, after reading the news in your newspaper, I couldn't help but call it a wise measure, which truly touched my heart. I hope that the authorities will make a decisive decision and proceed resolutely. As long as there is determination and steps, the results will be as quick as a shadow following a pole and can be expected soon. It is definitely not as difficult and complicated as suppressing rice prices. As for the unreasonable aspects such as excessively low rents, we must also find ways to adjust them so that we can gradually restore the normal state before the war. I hope that your newspaper can publish this letter in your newspaper and forward it to the relevant authorities for reference, so as to attract the attention of the authorities and people of Florida so that the severe housing shortage can be solved easily. Sincerely yours, a small citizen.

### Worries of Provisional University Students

Editor: Please forgive my presumption in writing directly, and I hope you can publish it. As everyone knows, the summer vacation is coming soon, and we, the students of the Provisional University preparatory class, are worried about the standards for future distribution. It's not that we don't work hard or try hard, but the fact is that even if you work hard and try hard, the future distribution may become a problem. Isn't this a strange and contradictory thing? No, editor, please read it patiently to the end. The level of the preparatory class varies greatly. Comparing the best and the worst is simply unbelievable to everyone. In addition, the professors of each group and each subject are not the same person, so the teaching materials are not unified. Also, the professors have different psychologies when grading papers, so it is difficult to calculate the standards based on test scores alone. For example, one group of professors can understand the students' difficulties, and everyone's test scores are above 80 or 90 points. Another group of professors is very suspicious, so they gave a small half of the students zero scores, but in fact, the level of the students in the latter group is not necessarily lower than that of the former group. So, can we just rely on scores to determine the distribution standards? This is the first point. In this semester's exam, the proctors were too lenient, and the practice of cheating was rampant. If you were to be there, you could truly say that you would be amazed. So, can these test scores be used as a standard? This is the second point. There are also some students who have not studied some subjects at all because they majored in vocational subjects in high school and also plan to major in vocational subjects in college, but the preparatory class treats them all as if they have studied them under the principle of reviewing. These students have suffered a great loss. In the future, they will definitely not study it, so under certain principles, they have all suffered great misfortune because their scores are not enough. You must know that if their scores are not enough, it will be difficult to distribute them. This is the third point. Our only hope is that the final exam will be as strict as possible and that the grades of each subject should be evaluated according to the students' wishes. If there are a few subjects that are absolutely unnecessary, then the failing scores should be accommodated as much as possible because they have neither learned it before nor will they learn it later. The wise preparatory class authorities, here are just a few of the main points that have been disclosed above as a reference and suggestion for future distribution standards. It must be a very sincere approval, a student of the Provisional University preparatory class, May 26th.

Free Talk - Special Issue on Women and Family

### The Unborn Baby

— Shuzhuang

This article was originally published in the Women and Family Companion magazine and then abridged in the American Reader's Digest. The original article is largely based on the original author Amram Scheinfeld's famous book "You and Heredity" and his new book "Women and Men," with the addition of other reliable arguments and supplements. —Translator's Note.

For thousands of years, parents have often asked these kinds of questions about their unborn children, and the answers they received were often wrong. Scientists have only recently uncovered this secret of the first stage of life, and now parents can get the correct answers.

[1] Is there any way for parents to get a boy or a girl as they wish?

No. The sex of the baby is determined at the moment of conception, when one of the two types of sperm enters the egg. Parents cannot do anything in advance to determine the sex of their future child. (Note: Recent scientific research shows that men have two types of sperm, one that produces girls and one that produces boys. These two types of sperm enter the vagina in the same way, and their proportions cannot be changed artificially. However, usually only one sperm can enter the egg and become an embryo, so the sex of the fetus depends on which type of sperm enters the egg and is determined, and cannot be changed later. Chinese people often blame women for not giving birth to sons, and men use this as an excuse to divorce and remarry or take concubines. Poor women have nowhere to complain and can only blame their "unproductive bellies." Well, now new scientific evidence proves that women cannot be held responsible for the sex of the fetus. Whether or not to have a son is still a matter for the men themselves.)

[2] Can the sex of the baby be predicted before birth?

No. The common general notion that male fetuses kick more violently in the womb than female fetuses is inaccurate.

[3] What color eyes will a foreign baby have?

If both parents have blue eyes, their baby will mostly have blue eyes. If one parent has blue eyes and the other has blue-eyed parents, siblings, half of their children may have blue eyes. If both parents have dark eyes, but both sides of the family have blue eyes, then one in every four children may have blue eyes. If there are no blue-eyed people in the family at all, then the child's eyes will definitely be dark.

[4] Is it easier for a child to resemble the father or mother who has distinctive features?

In some ways, yes. In terms of each parent's appearance, the one with more obvious features - such as a very long nose, large ears, large eyes, long eyelashes, etc. - will have many opportunities to reappear on the child. If that special appearance has been passed down for several generations in either parent, then their children will have even more opportunities to have that special part.

[5] If both parents are unattractive, is there a chance that they will have a beautiful child?

Very likely. Of course, if both parents are good-looking, the child will be more likely to be good-looking. But it is also very possible that if both parents are unattractive, they may pass on the hidden genetic factors in their bodies to the newborn child, which can produce a particularly beautiful appearance.

[6] We often hear many legends that if a mother is frightened during pregnancy, the child will have strange marks or defects after birth. Is this really possible?

Absolutely not. There is no direct connection between the mother's nervous system and the fetus's. The mother's thoughts and experiences cannot find a representative symbol in the child. Only fantasies or accidental coincidences support this theory.

[7] Can children born to couples in love have better temperaments?

Yes. This is not due to heredity or prenatal influence - it simply means that children born in this environment may have better personalities.

[8] Will children inherit the personality of the parent who has the stronger personality?

No. Parents' personalities are not inherited by children. Children are born with certain genetic factors that are a combination of both parents' bloodlines. However, most of their personalities are created by experience and training.

[9] Will children of parents who have received little education be less intelligent than children of parents who have received higher education?

No. Children's intelligence is not affected by their parents' education. Whether or not parents are educated does not change their inheritance of intelligence.

[10] If a husband returns from the army with serious injuries, will the child have defects if they have a child?

No. As long as a man is fertile, his physical condition, age, and health will not affect the child's genetic makeup.

[11] If a man has had an infectious disease when he was young, will his child have the risk of inheriting his disease in the future?

Absolutely not. Bacterial diseases will not be transmitted to children unless the mother has already contracted the disease first, in which case she may transmit the bacteria to her fetus, so that the child will have the disease at birth. If the man's illness has been cured, his child will not get the disease because of him.

[12] Is the child's blood relationship with the mother closer than with the father?

No. Because not a drop of the mother's blood goes directly to the child. Her blood is first transformed into countless kinds of primordial substances, which are filtered through the placenta, from which the fetus makes its own blood.

[13] What is the possibility of having twins?

In every ninety pregnancies, there is a chance of having twins; in every eight thousand, there is a chance of having triplets; and in every seven hundred thousand, there is a chance of having quadruplets.

[14] In a large family, will the youngest child often have a very different personality from the first-born child?

Yes. From a genetic point of view, the order of birth is not a factor that causes personality differences; only the environment is. When the youngest child is born, the parents are often more experienced and have a better environment; at the same time, they also have the help of older brothers and sisters. Therefore, the youngest child in a large family is often more precocious, sensible, and independent.

### The Mayor's Wife Talks About Current Work

— Yi

When Mrs. Wu, the mayor's wife, recently met with reporters from various newspapers, she talked about the most important work at present, which is to practice frugality and promote education.

Regarding the first point, Mrs. Wu had seen the suffering of the starving prisoners in various provinces before coming to Shanghai. People living in Shanghai should practice frugality and work together to seek relief. Regarding the second point, education is the prerequisite for all construction. If education cannot be popularized, then nothing can be done.

In fact, these two tasks can be started from the family. If the family can practice frugality, it can indirectly cultivate a clean and honest atmosphere. There are many wives who only know how to enjoy themselves and do not care where their husbands' money comes from or what methods they use to get it. There are also many wise wives who, even though the material enjoyment is very poor, can create spiritual happiness so that their husbands can concentrate on their careers. At the same time, housewives are the planners and implementers of consumption. Americans have a saying that housewives hold the strings of the nation's purse. Therefore, how a housewife manages the family may affect the entire country's economic structure. Modern housewives should not only know how to do housework (House Keeping), but also take on the responsibility of building a family (Home-Making).

Regarding the popularization of education, starting from the family is also a very reasonable way. If we take the family as a unit and completely eliminate illiteracy in each unit, and then promote it to the neighboring families, then we can complete the task of eliminating illiteracy in a very short period of time.

Mrs. Wu, the mayor's wife, has received modern education, and she has been following the mayor in the important municipal positions he has held over the years. She must have a lot of insights into the municipal facilities. From now on, she can lead the women of the city to complete great tasks.

### Opium Song

— Bā Líng

"Stepping into the opium den, pleading to heaven and kowtowing to the earth; one pipe of opium, ecstatic joy; lying down for a sleep, conversing about heaven and earth; three puffs and a whoosh, energetic and vibrant; bent double coming in, standing straight going out; meeting an opium fiend, addressed as 'brother'; no money in the pocket, stealing sheep and catching chickens; having some banknotes, eating another three 'cash' worth. The front door of the house, no need to care about it; called an opium immortal, carefree and without worry. It is a pity that recently, the price of opium is outrageously expensive; small business owners, unable to afford to eat it continuously; moreover, the government is determined to prohibit opium; if one does not quit opium, one will go to jail; suffering all kinds of hardships, with no recourse for complaint; thinking of this moment, it is better to quit opium."

This is a song describing the person who smokes opium, bankrupting their family, extremely realistic.

In any family, if there is someone who smokes opium in the household, that family will certainly not be wholesome. Now, as victory arrives, the government is determined to prohibit opium. It is hoped that those with opium addiction will quickly reform themselves, make a firm resolution, and wage a deadly battle with the utterly evil opium. Recover human life anew and create a happy and fulfilling family.
