### The Incident in Central Hubei Comes to a Conclusion: Xu Yongchang and Others Return to Beijing from Hankou; Baird Reports to Marshall

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Xu Yongchang, the government representative on the Committee of Three, and Zhou Enlai, the CCP representative, departed Hankou by plane at 3:45 PM on the afternoon of the 10th, arriving in Beijing at 5:47 PM and landing at the Dajiaochang airfield. Our reporter approached General Xu Yongchang to inquire about the findings of this trip. Xu stated, "There was no war in Central Hubei at all," repeating it three times. He also said that they had signed a communique in Hankou a few hours before leaving. After speaking, he left by car to his private residence to rest. It is reported that General Xu Yongchang will visit Chairman Jiang at 9:00 PM on the 10th to report on the situation in Central Hubei. The reporter then asked Mr. Zhou Enlai for a statement. Mr. Zhou replied, "On the third day after our arrival in Hankou, we went to Xuanhua Store. Because Minister Xu was not feeling well, Wang Xueming went as his representative. However, wherever the Committee of Three went, there was no state of war." At this point, Zhou made a slight rebuttal to Chief of Staff He's statement at yesterday's press conference that the CCP forces in Hubei seemed to want to extend eastward from their original base into the southern section of the Jinpu Railway. After speaking, he drove to his residence at No. 30 Meiyuan New Village to rest. It is reported that Mr. Zhou will meet with Special Envoy Marshall tonight to discuss the trip in detail. Additionally, General Baird, the American representative on the Committee of Three investigating the actual situation in Central Hubei, arrived in Beijing by plane one hour after Xu and Zhou arrived at the airport. After disembarking, Mr. Baird immediately went to Special Envoy Marshall's residence at No. 5 Ninghai Road to report.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] After Xu Yongchang, Zhou Enlai, and Baird returned to Beijing from Hankou, the Central Hubei conflict, which had been causing so much uproar, suddenly seemed to dissipate like smoke, and the truth became clear. Based on Zhou Enlai's remarks, it appears that the CCP's front and rear lines have become disconnected, leading to such a farcical situation. Considering the recent actions of the Communist forces in Northern Jiangsu, it is worth observing.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Zhou Enlai said after disembarking that he would very much like to go to Northern Jiangsu with government representatives to investigate the truth of the Nantong incident. Furthermore, according to the reporter's inquiries, after the incident in Central Hubei is clarified, there are still the issues of the opening of the Longhai Railway, the restoration of the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways, and the unfortunate incidents of unprovoked disturbances by the Communist forces in Northern Jiangsu, all of which require the CCP to conduct a thorough review. If the CCP sincerely seeks peace, the government can send personnel to accompany Mr. Zhou to inspect various places at any time.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 9th] Zhou Enlai, Baird, and Xu Yongchang's representative Wang Xueming, etc., returned to Hankou from Xuanhua Store on the afternoon of the 9th. In addition, a subsidiary group (also named the Guangshan Group) of the Hankou Executive Headquarters was recently established. The government representative is Colonel Chen Qian, the Communist Party representative is Lieutenant Colonel Ren Shishun, and the American representative is Colonel Haske. On the 9th, they arrived in Xuanhua Store from Hankou and will depart to inspect various areas in the Henan-Hubei border area. Accompanying them are more than ten translators and telegraph operators.

### The Three Representatives Sign an Agreement: Ordering a Ceasefire and the Mutual Release of Detained Personnel; General Xu Yongchang States that the Same Should Be Done in North and Central China

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Xu Yongchang, the government representative of the Military Committee of Three, Zhou Enlai, the CCP representative, and Baird, the American representative, went to Hubei to investigate the military conflict. On the 10th, they reached an agreement in Hankou, which was simultaneously sent to the Beiping Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters, and the CCP Central Plains Military Region Headquarters. The tripartite meeting unanimously resolved the following items to be sent to the above-mentioned command organizations to order the relevant troops north of the Yangtze River to implement: (1) The commanders of the above-mentioned command organizations of both sides should immediately issue orders to stop small-scale battles and sentry conflicts in the local area. (2) Any movement of troops in violation of the original armistice agreement should be stopped immediately, but small-scale troop movements permitted by the armistice order, such as administrative transfers, may continue to be implemented, but the Executive Headquarters should be notified in advance. (3) The construction of new bunkers and permanent fortifications in the above-mentioned areas should be stopped immediately. (4) The commanders of both sides should quickly send necessary liaison officers to their headquarters and to opposing troop units. These liaison officers should contact the Executive Headquarters, with one of their main tasks being to determine the boundaries of the opposing troops. (5) Agree to transport 1,000 wounded and sick CCP soldiers, 100 family members, and 60 care and medical personnel from the CCP Central Plains Military Region to Anyang, and set May 15 as the date of departure. The detailed procedures should be carried out in accordance with the procedures agreed upon by the Ninth Group's tripartite meeting. Both sides should issue orders to commanders at all levels to ensure that this transportation is not delayed. (6) Agree that the commanders of both sides will immediately exchange lists of detained personnel. All those identified as political prisoners or prisoners of war should be released by June 1 of this year. (7) Agree to guarantee the safety of CCP soldiers who are demobilized for troop reorganization from the CCP Central Plains Military Region to their destinations and after arrival. However, before these personnel return to their hometowns, the CCP Central Plains Military Region should prepare a list stating the destination and route taken, and send it to the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters, and guarantee that these personnel are indeed returning home, do not carry weapons, and hold passports.

This agreement does not hinder or affect the past instructions of the Beiping Military Mediation Department or the agreements that the Committee of Three may reach on fundamental issues in the local area.

The above documents were signed by Government Representative Xu Yongchang, CCP Representative Zhou Enlai, and American Representative Baird. The signing time was 3:00 PM on May 10, 35th year of the Republic of China. The signing location was Yang Sen Garden in Hankou. Before signing, General Xu Yongchang made the following formal statement: "It is hoped that all small conflicts and troop movements that have occurred in the currently ceasefired areas of North and Central China will be stopped in the same way. For areas in a state of confrontation, liaison personnel should also be mutually dispatched. Regarding the problems of food supply to areas besieged by the Communist army, the transfer of wounded and sick soldiers, the safety guarantee of demobilized personnel, and the release of captured personnel, the Communist side should resolve them in the same way as the Hankou agreement of May 10." American Representative Baird expressed his deep agreement with this, and CCP Representative Zhou Enlai also expressed general agreement in principle.

### Choice for Minister of National Defense: Chen Cheng Has a Higher Chance

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] It is reported that the Ministry of National Defense will be established on June 1, and the choice for minister has not yet been determined, but it is believed that General Chen Cheng, who is in charge of the reorganization and restructuring of the seven military agencies, has a higher chance. Chief of Staff He Yingqin, who completed the major tasks of accepting surrender and sending prisoners of war, will take on a new position and will not be able to go abroad for the time being.

### Communist Army Responds to Operations in the Northeast, Actively Engaging in North China; The Xuzhou Group's Inspection of the Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway is Obstructed

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] Local officials explain the recent active actions taken by the Communist army in various parts of North China as a response to the operations in the Northeast, and in preparation for the event that Marshall's mediation is ineffective, to immediately control the National Army's strongholds with a superior posture. Therefore, in addition to increasing troops in the Northeast, they have also increased pressure on important cities in North China. For example, a division under He Long recently transferred from Zhangjiakou to the vicinity of Beiping, and the Communist army south of Tianjin has also increased compared to before. The Communist army around Tangshan has also increased pressure. On the Shijiazhuang front, the Communist army transferred 1,400 people from Yixian on April 27. In addition, they are gradually moving troops on both sides of various railways closer to the railway, occupying military stations or destroying the tracks.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] The Communist army is stepping up its destruction of the Beining and Jinpu lines. The power lines south of Yaoguantun on the Jinpu Line were completely destroyed at 10:00 PM on the 9th. Between Beitang and Chadian on the Beining Line, about 500 Communist troops occupied the area around 9:00 PM on the evening of the 9th, and have not yet left, with unclear intentions, but the railway there has not been destroyed. Iron bridge No. 160 between Wuhu and Huangshi on the Yuguan-Suizhong section was destroyed by the Communist army on the 8th and repaired at 1:00 PM on the 9th, but the bridge was destroyed again at 12:00 AM last night. Iron bridge No. 171 between Taizi and Gaoling was also destroyed by the Communist army at 1:00 AM this morning, burning more than 700 sleepers, and is currently being repaired. Therefore, the Jinyu section, which had just been opened to traffic, is closed again. It is also learned that passenger trains between Shenyang and Changchun can reach Kaiyuan, and military trains can reach Mangniushao, the first station south of Sipingjie. An iron bridge there was destroyed. Passenger trains between Shenyang and Lushun can reach Dashiqiao, and the line south of Dashiqiao has been completely destroyed.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] After Botou on the Jinpu Line was occupied by the Communist army at 9:00 PM on the 6th, the whereabouts of the Botou group are unknown. Government personnel said that before the Communist army attacked and defended the station, they lured the government and American representatives of the group to Nanpi and restricted them. The Communist side said that the Communist army's occupation of Fengjiakou and Botou was because Xu Chunxia, the magistrate of Jiahe County, led security forces to attack the Communist army a few days ago, and the Communist army counterattacked and occupied the two places. As for the government and American representatives of the Executive Group, they went to a certain place before the conflict and were obstructed by traffic. It is not certain whether they are in Nanpi.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] According to official sources, the vicinity of 198 kilometers east of Damao Station on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway has been destroyed by the Communist army. The Xuzhou group planned to inspect it, but was shot at by the Communist army and forced to stop, refusing the inspection. The Zhangdian-Boshan Railway was agreed to be opened to traffic on the 27th of last month, but it has been temporarily suspended again for some reason.

### Wang Dongyuan Goes to Henglai to Inspect the Disaster Area in Southern Hunan

[Central News Agency, Hengyang, 9th] Wang Dongyuan set off to inspect the disaster area in the Henglai border area. Along the way, he personally visited nearby villages and towns and disaster victims. The disaster situation he learned about was even more serious than rumored. Eating wild grass to satisfy hunger has become a common phenomenon. Deaths from hunger and suicides leaving houses empty were found everywhere. Wang then turned to inspect Lingling and Qiyang.

### National Assembly Preparatory Committee Designates Representatives; Fang Ma Shi Expresses His Views; Tenth Meeting Held Yesterday Morning to Discuss the Draft Constitution and Other Issues

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] It is reported that Special Envoy Marshall may receive Zhu Jingnong, Xi Yushu, and Hu Ding'an, the three representatives designated by the National Assembly Preparatory Meeting to visit Special Envoy Marshall, the day after tomorrow. When the three representatives Zhu, Xi, and Hu meet with Special Envoy Marshall, they will first express the people's highest respect to Special Envoy Marshall for his love for China and his mediation of the Kuomintang-Communist disputes, and will sincerely express the suffering felt by the people in various parts of China to Special Envoy Marshall.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The tenth preparatory meeting of the National Assembly was held at 10:00 AM this morning, attended by 189 representatives. They discussed issues such as the draft constitution and the collection of data, and planned to send representatives to various places to investigate and inquire about opinions on the constitution. Most of the representatives expressed that they did not intend to leave Beijing before the opening of the congress. During the recess of the preparatory meeting, the presidium's secretariat will continue to work, and the eleventh congress will be held tomorrow.

### Nanjing Massacre Case: Investigators Compile Report in Shanghai

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Our reporter recently learned from authoritative American sources that MacArthur's headquarters sent personnel to China to investigate the Nanjing Massacre case for more than a month. The relevant key elements have been largely collected, and a detailed report is currently being compiled in Shanghai.

### National Army in the Northeast Stands Ready, Preparing for the Battle of Sipingjie

[United Press, Shenyang, 10th] Du Yuming, commander of the Northeast Security Headquarters, said today that the Northeast National Army is currently adopting a "wait-and-see" policy, gathering troops in preparation for a full-scale battle in Sipingjie. The Communist army has concentrated heavy troops in Sipingjie. The National Army is now waiting to see what kind of agreement can be established by the negotiations in Nanjing. In the past, the Communist Party's attitude towards political negotiations has often been shifted by its military victories or defeats. The Communist army's defeat in the Battle of Benxi may make its attitude more conciliatory. Du said that in the Battle of Benxi, the Communist army was defeated and the National Army achieved a decisive victory. In this battle, five to six thousand Communist troops surrendered, three thousand were captured, and ten thousand abandoned their weapons and fled. However, there are more than 100,000 Communist troops in the Benxi area.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 10th] Liu Depu, deputy commander of the Changchun garrison, has already escaped. The previous report from the Central News Agency that Liu had been killed in action during the Changchun battle was inaccurate. According to people from Changchun: After the security team decided to break through on the 18th of last month, they originally planned to gather at Chunbao, 40 miles south of Changchun, but only Chief of Staff Wang Zhengguo of the Garrison Headquarters, Senior Advisor Cui Zhiguang, and two soldiers arrived there. Wang and Cui continued to Phoenix Tuo, where they met Deputy Commander Liu. They went around Xi'an, Xifeng, and other places for ten days before arriving at Shuangmiaozhi (south of Kaiyuan), where the National Army was located, and escaped from the difficult situation. Chen Jiazhen, commander of the Changchun garrison, was shot in the leg and suffered inflammation, which was swollen like wood. Chen and Lu Zhengcao, deputy commander of the "Democratic Allied Army" of the CCP, are from the same hometown and classmates. Lu's first words when he met Chen were: "If I had known it was you, I wouldn't have attacked." Although the Communist army has occupied Changchun for many days, they still cannot open the safe of the Central Bank of Manchuria's silver notes. The safe is one of the most solid safes in the world, comparable to the famous Bank of England safe. The safe has three keys, which must be used in succession to open it, and none can be missing. Now the three keys are gone, and ordinary knives and axes cannot open it. The only way to destroy the safe is to use fierce, high-temperature weapons, such as rocket launchers, to burn it, but in that case, the silver notes in the safe will also be destroyed.

### Chairman Jiang's Concern for the Municipal Facilities of Nanjing: Summons Ma Chaojun to Inquire

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Since the National Government returned to the capital, the Chairman has been very concerned about the municipal facilities of Nanjing. It is reported that he specially summoned Mayor Ma Chaojun of Nanjing at about 10:00 AM on the 10th to inquire about everything. Ma gave a detailed report on the municipal facilities. After listening to Ma's report, the Chairman gave instructions on the current road administration, sanitation, and housing shortage problems in Nanjing, as well as social morality problems.

### National Army is Gradually Being Downsized; The Number of Surplus Officers This Year Will Reach 100,000

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The downsizing work of the National Army is currently being implemented gradually according to the planned plan. It is estimated that the number of surplus officers this year will reach 100,000. If combined with the surplus and unemployed officers currently being trained by the various officers' corps of the Ministry of Military Administration, the number of officers to be demobilized will be around 200,000. According to our reporter's recent information from related parties, among these 200,000 demobilized officers, the military authorities have decided to select 10,000 outstanding officers to provide them with advanced studies and store them as new military cadres. 150,000 people will be allowed to enter the Central Training Corps to receive vocational training according to their wishes and expertise, so that they can transfer to individual occupations. In addition, methods will be sought to transfer 30,000 people in groups, and 10,000 people will be handled in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Military Officers and Enlisted Personnel, that is, those who have been suspended from service for more than three years and have not returned to service will be dismissed. Those who have been dismissed, suspended, or suspended for more than three years and have not been appointed, those whose performance has been unsatisfactory for three consecutive years, those who have reached three times the stagnation of their official rank (four times in peacetime) and cannot be promoted, those whose physical condition is weak or injured and cannot serve in active service, and when the number of retirements is stipulated due to the necessity of replenishment and official quota, or those whose performance is ranked last, will be retired. The handling of officers of all ranks who have exceeded the age limit for active service will also be retired. The age limits are as follows: first-class generals are 62 years old, second-class generals (general street) are 60 years old, lieutenant generals are 56, major generals are 52, colonels are 46, lieutenant colonels are 44, majors are 42, second lieutenants are 40, first lieutenants are 38, second lieutenants are 36, and warrant officers are 34. In addition, officers of all ranks who have exceeded the age limit for service will be discharged, and the age limits are as follows: generals are 67, lieutenant generals are 65, major generals are 60, colonels are 58, lieutenant colonels are 55, majors are 53, captains are 50, first lieutenants are 47, and second lieutenants are 41. As for military and political civilian personnel who do not meet the regulations for retirement, they will be dismissed. In addition to the government issuing travel expenses for returning home, various retired and discharged officers can receive a certain amount of retirement pay at one time.

### Interview with Representatives of the General Chamber of Commerce, Our Correspondent in Beijing

— Zhang Ming

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] The enlarged preparatory meeting of the General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China concluded at 5:30 PM on the 10th, after a six-day session, having passed 164 proposals and a draft of the general charter. On the morning of the 11th, all representatives toured scenic spots in the capital city, with two large buses hired by the meeting for their transportation.

With some areas of the country mired in special circumstances, on the one hand, grain and materials are blockaded, and on the other hand, there are famine, displacement, and wailing everywhere! The economic landscape arising in this situation inevitably faces a crisis. As a result, prices are soaring, and people's lives are subjected to bottomless oppression. Naturally, the most intense struggles occur between labor and capital. Amidst this intensifying situation, a national enlarged preparatory meeting of the General Chamber of Commerce is being held in the capital. This association is composed of thousands, even tens of thousands, of organized guilds. The convocation of this meeting today undoubtedly holds significant meaning for China's economic future.

The history of chambers of commerce in China dates back to the 27th year of the Guangxu reign. The first was the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the National Chamber of Commerce was also established in Shanghai. Since the "September 18th" Incident, the northeastern provinces have been under enemy control, and North China, as well as the Yangtze River basin, have been subjected to enemy incursions, making it impossible for the General Chamber of Commerce to convene a general meeting.

During the War of Resistance, initially, due to the unstable war situation and the unsettled state of many businesses and industries, no organizational efforts were undertaken. It was not until June 6th two years ago that the National Chamber of Commerce was established in the provisional capital, Chongqing. However, due to the war situation, the participating units were limited to the provinces in the Great Rear Area. This meeting, with the participation of representatives from the Northeast and overseas, symbolizes the unification of the country. But this meeting is still only a preparatory meeting, which is already enough to excite us.

At the opening ceremony of the meeting, Wang Xiaolai, a prominent figure in Shanghai's business circles and chairman of the presidium, said, "The main purpose of this association is to promote national unity, sincere solidarity, and to industrialize the economy, laying a stable foundation." These two short sentences can be said to be the most important focus of future livelihood issues. We must transform from light industry, from handicrafts, from relying on foreign raw materials, into a highly industrialized nation.

During the meeting, they seriously discussed foreign trade, which is related to the nation's lifeline, and how to develop and support private enterprises. In addition, active cases concerning industrial and commercial personnel, the protection and training of employees, and various investigations and research were also presented for discussion. A total of 146 cases were discussed. The central theme of their discussion was the current state of industry and commerce in the Southwest and the future development of industry and commerce in Beijing and Shanghai after the political center shifted from the Southwest to Beijing and Shanghai.

Mr. Pan Yangshan, a representative from Chongqing, spoke to the reporter. The reporter asked him, "After the transfer of the political and economic center, what is the current state of industry and commerce in Chongqing? What are your expectations for the future?" He said solemnly, "From the victory until now, we have been stuck in this dangerous state. For the sake of victory, institutions and individuals are all moving eastward (even if they can't move, they are all planning to return home), so all purchasing has become a problem. There is no market for finished products. In order to maintain the lives of the workers who have endured eight years of hardship with us, we have to continue production. Goods are piling up one after another, with no one interested. Goods cannot be exported, and capital cannot flow. When capital cannot flow, both labor and capital are trapped in a terrible collapse. Therefore, many small factories could not withstand this huge wave and have closed down one after another. Later, after consultations with the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and other relevant opportunities, it was decided that the government would purchase finished products, purchase production tools, and send workers back to their hometowns. Now, it is finally all resolved. However, although the labor unrest has been resolved, the machinery that the bosses obtained during the eight years of hardship has also been sold off. Is this really the right way to solve labor unrest?" Mr. Pan, standing on the side of capital but sympathizing with labor, issued the deepest sigh, a sigh inspired by the impending economic collapse.

He also said: "Currently, the textile industry is the only one that can barely survive; they can still make a profit. As for the machinery and steel industries, they have all collapsed. Although the textile industry can temporarily survive, we lack working capital and cannot store a sufficient quantity of raw materials, so even if we can make money, we cannot make the most of the machinery. Moreover, in the future, when American cotton is imported and cloth is transported internally, foreign goods will be cheaper, and our costs will increase. How can we compete with them? Therefore, the result is still inevitable collapse."

Mr. Wang Xiaolai, a representative from Shanghai, said to the reporter, "I think all strength is based on organization, and even the economy is based on organization. For example, the Japanese will try to monopolize the market regardless of whether they have raw materials. Conversely, the Jews have raw materials, money, and people, but they still cannot succeed. Therefore, the power of organization is very important. Over the past eight years, China's industry and commerce have reached a point of 'hardship,' but how should we deal with it now? The only key is to revitalize factories. Shanghai is a hub for foreign trade and a place for consumption. For the country as a whole, to develop industry, it is best to set up factories in the places where the products are produced, and to take advantage of the convenience of labor and water sources. In this way, our economy can truly become industrialized." Mr. Luo Zongqiang, a representative from Tianjin, told the reporter about the current state of industry and commerce in Tianjin. He said: "Tianjin has a total of 161 trade associations, owning 1,796 factories, but only 1,240 factories are currently operating, with the remaining 555 being shut down. Among them, 134 are state-owned, 1,642 are commercially operated, and the status of 20 is unclear. In terms of nature, the most are cotton weaving factories, with over 500, followed by metalworking factories with over 150, the chemical industry with around 200, the food industry with over 100, the construction industry with 25, and other daily necessities with over 200. Currently, the crux of the problem lies entirely in whether security and transportation can be resolved, but the communist army is destroying everything everywhere, and some raw materials must be supplied from abroad. At its peak, the number of unemployed workers reached over 100,000, and after some relief efforts, there are still over 30,000. Wages are around 60,000 to 100,000 yuan per month, but labor unrest still occurs frequently."

Mr. Wang Yiqi, a representative from Nanjing, said: "To revitalize Nanjing's industry, we should first rectify the existing handicrafts and light industries. The government has now designated the Yanziji area as an industrial zone, and more than 30 factories moving east have registered in Nanjing. Generally, cotton weaving factories are still the most numerous, followed by chemical factories. However, paper mills and oil mills are also in the planning stage. Currently, there are 60,000 to 70,000 workers employed, and around 30,000 unemployed workers. The treatment is slightly lower than in Shanghai, between 50,000 and 80,000 yuan." Mr. Lin Xiongzheng, a representative from Taiwan, came from Taiwan. He said that Taiwan produces sugar, rice, timber, tea, camphor, and other products, and has over 100 factories, with the sugar industry being the most prosperous and its exports being the largest. However, there are some restrictions, and the most lacking are cotton cloth and fertilizers.

The representatives who attended this national preparatory meeting of the General Chamber of Commerce will return to their respective regions after the meeting to strengthen their organizations in an effort to convene a formal general meeting of the National Chamber of Commerce after the autumn. This organizational strength will undoubtedly lead China's industrial and commercial sectors into a healthy state of development, and the future national economic foundation can thereby become increasingly consolidated.

### Eisenhower Arrives in Tokyo from Shanghai, First Meeting with MacArthur After Victory Over Germany and Japan, Inquires About China's Disasters from Mayor Qian Before Departure

(The picture shows Eisenhower arriving in Beijing and walking out of the airport with welcomers. Front row, from left to right: He Yingqin, Dwight D. Eisenhower, George C. Marshall, Chen Cheng)

[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Dwight D. Eisenhower arrived at Atsugi Airport outside Tokyo at 2:05 PM on the 10th, flying from Shanghai. General MacArthur and U.S. Eighth Army Commander Eichelberger welcomed him at the airport. This was the first meeting between the two commanders of the Allied forces in Europe and the Pacific after defeating the powerful enemies Germany and Japan. Eisenhower also knew that this meeting was particularly rare. When he firmly grasped MacArthur's outstretched hand, he couldn't help but say with emotion, "Mac, how are you? I didn't expect to meet again here." MacArthur smiled and replied, "It's great to see you again." The two generals patted each other on the shoulder while speaking. The two generals had a meal at the embassy and then went to MacArthur's headquarters to meet with headquarters staff. They also scheduled a meeting with the heads of various departments at headquarters on the evening of the 11th. On Sunday morning, they inspected the First Cavalry Division of the Tokyo Occupation Army, and then, in the afternoon, they traveled with Eichelberger through scenic mountain areas to southern Honshu. Eisenhower is currently scheduled to spend two days inspecting the troops and then return to the country by plane from near Kobe on the 15th. Eisenhower's flight from Shanghai to Tokyo was hampered by severe weather, so a special radar landing aircraft was used to control it.

[Our Newspaper] U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Dwight D. Eisenhower flew to Beijing from Manila the day before yesterday to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang and General Marshall to discuss military issues and to give speeches to senior U.S. military officers. At 7:30 PM, he arrived in Shanghai with U.S. Army Commander in China Lieutenant General Gillem and others. Eisenhower originally did not intend to come to Shanghai, but decided to do so ten minutes before departure, so the city authorities had no prior knowledge. After receiving the news, Mayor Qian immediately visited General Wedemeyer's residence on Dallas Street with Commander Li and Jin Zhilang, the chief of the Social Affairs Section, and had a twenty-minute conversation. Eisenhower, with a smiling face and amiable manner, inquired about the Chinese famine, the Communist Party, and other issues from Mayor Qian. Later, he had talks with U.S. military officers in the city. Because important officials in Washington were awaiting him, Eisenhower needed to return to the country urgently, so he left Shanghai at 7:30 AM yesterday, boarding a heavy aircraft to fly to Tokyo. Mayor Qian, Commander Li, Lieutenant General Gillem, Major General Maddox, U.S. Consul General Davis, and more than 20 others went to the Jiangwan Airport to see him off.

### Investigation of Traitor Liang Hongzhi Completed, Shanghai High Procuratorate Announces Full Text of Indictment

[Central News Agency, this city] The investigation of Liang Hongzhi, the head of the puppet "Renovation Government", has been completed by the High Procuratorate, and a public prosecution has been initiated. The full text of the indictment is recorded as follows:

Defendant Liang Hongzhi, male, 64 years old, from Changle, former President of the puppet Legislative Yuan, residing at 150 Bixun Road, currently in custody.

The above-named defendant, in the case of suspicion of being a traitor (Case No. 125 of the 35th year of the Republic), has been investigated by this prosecutor, and it is deemed that a public prosecution should be initiated. The criminal facts, evidence, and relevant laws are listed as follows:

Criminal Facts

Defendant Liang Hongzhi served successively as a counselor of the State Council, Secretary-General of the Beijing Garrison Headquarters, Senator, and Secretary-General of the Executive Government during the Beijing government era. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, he lived in seclusion in Hang County. In August of the 26th year of the Republic of China, at the beginning of the War of Resistance, he moved to Shanghai. When Nanjing and Shanghai successively fell, and the National Government moved west, he conceived the idea of colluding with the enemy and betraying the country. He became acquainted with enemy Major General Harada and others, preparing to build a puppet regime in the occupied areas of Central China. On March 28th of the 27th year, the puppet "Renovation Government" was formally established in Nanjing. The puppet government had two courts and eight departments. The defendant served as the puppet Executive Yuan President, holding full power in the position of chief, issuing orders, and chairing the political meetings of the heads of the puppet courts and departments. He changed to the five-color national flag, summoned troops, consolidated the rear for the enemy, and forcibly took over the Jianghai Customs located in the concessions, seizing central customs duties. He also successively signed agreements with enemy leaders regarding railways, telecommunications, salt affairs, and banks, organized the Central China Railway Company, the Central China Electric Communications Company, the Central China Hydropower Company, and the Central China Salt Industry Company, cooperating with the enemy. He jointly established the Xingzhong Bank, issued banknotes, circulated them in the market, and disrupted finance. He jointly established the China Shipping Company and approved the establishment of inland river shipping companies, allowing the enemy to navigate the inland rivers unimpeded. He also established a smoking prohibition bureau, specializing in public sales, transporting opium, and registering smokers, assisting the enemy in implementing a poisoning policy, and collecting opium and other taxes, opening up financial sources for the puppet government. Not long after the establishment of the puppet "Renovation Government", the defendant consulted with Wang Kemin, the chairman of the puppet "Provisional Government" in North China, on merging. After several rounds of negotiations, on September of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the puppet "United Committee of the Chinese Government" was established in Beiping. The defendant also served as a member. The puppet committee held several meetings in places such as Ping, Jing, and Qingdao, and issued and promoted absurd speeches and actions such as ceasing war to save the country, opposing the central government. On April 5th of the 28th year of the Republic of China, Wang Zhaoming betrayed the party and the country and secretly came to Shanghai, preparing to establish the puppet "National Government". The defendant and Wang, seeing that Wang had enemy support and their own power was gradually weakening, after consultations, issued declarations on September 21st and 23rd of the same year from the puppet "United Committee of the Chinese Government" and the puppet "Renovation" and "Provisional" regimes, responding to Wang's peace movement. On January 23rd of the following year, the defendant and Wang met in Qingdao, jointly deciding to organize a Central Political Conference. On March 20th, they held the conference in Nanjing, negotiating and determining the outline for the establishment of the puppet "National Government", the organization regulations for the puppet Central Political Committee and the Committee of North China Affairs, and announced the candidates for the ministers of various courts and ministries of the puppet "National Government". On the 30th of the same month, they realized what they called the "return of the national capital" and issued an absurd declaration of returning the capital and the program of the puppet "National Government". At the same time, the puppet "United Committee of the Chinese Government", the "Renovation Government", and the "Provisional Government" were all dissolved. The defendant was renamed a member of the puppet Central Political Committee, concurrently serving as the President of the puppet Control Yuan. Until November 20th of the 33rd year, Chen Gongbo, the President of the puppet Legislative Yuan, succeeded Wang as the Chairman of the puppet National Government and concurrently the President of the Executive Yuan due to Wang's death. The defendant then took over as the President of the puppet Legislative Yuan until the victory of the War of Resistance. He has now been sent to this office by the Shanghai Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission for investigation in accordance with the law.

Grounds for Prosecution

In this case, the defendant has confessed without denying during the investigation the details of how he organized the puppet "Renovation Government" starting in February of the 27th year of the Republic of China, served as the President of the puppet Executive Yuan, held full power, and consulted with Wang Kemin, the chairman of the puppet "Provisional Government", on merging to establish the puppet "United Committee of the Chinese Government", concurrently serving as a member. In the year the traitor Wang established the puppet "National Government", he also served as a member of the puppet Central Political Committee, President of the Control Yuan, President of the Legislative Yuan, etc., until the victory of the War of Resistance. This is consistent with the statement made in the Shanghai Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, and there are also his handwritten confession, news reports over the years, the Shanghai Yearbook, the New China Handbook, and other time-related records that can prove the facts are extremely clear. It is found that the defendant was originally a well-known pro-Japanese Anfu faction politician. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, seeing the military failures of our army and that Wang Kemin had organized the puppet "Provisional Government" in Beiping, he took it upon himself to emulate it, determined to collude with the enemy and betray the country, and in the occupied areas of Central China under the enemy's military control, he established the puppet "Renovation Government", seized the capital, believed in administrative orders, changed the national flag, summoned troops, and created a situation of confrontation with the central government, fueling the enemy's aggressive flames and shaking the will of the military and civilians to resist the war. His collusion with enemy countries and resistance to his own country are obvious. During the period when the defendant was the head of the puppet "Renovation Government", he held great power, promoted puppet politics, established puppet troops, and established four military control zones in Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Haibu, implementing pacification work, which clearly assisted the enemy's military, consolidated defenses, and prevented the activities of our guerrilla units. His obstruction of the War of Resistance was profound and significant. The establishment of various agreements with the enemy and the joint establishment of the Central China Railway Company, the Central China Electric Communications Company, and the Central China Hydropower Company were all in the name of joint ventures with the enemy, handing over important undertakings such as public transportation to the enemy. The Central China Salt Industry Company and the Xingzhong Bank, which were also jointly established, were institutions that monopolized the transportation and sale of salt, which is essential for people's livelihood, and issued puppet Xingzhong coupons, disrupting finance. The establishment of a smoking prohibition bureau to handle the public sale of opium and transport opium was nothing less than assisting the enemy in implementing a policy of poisoning the people and endangering the race. Seizing the Jianghai Customs and intercepting customs duties was also using violence to prevent our customs authorities from exercising their powers. In addition, the joint establishment of the Shanwa Shipping Company with the enemy and the approval of the establishment of inland river shipping companies, recognizing the enemy's inland river navigation rights, and the collection of opium and various taxes were all methods of collecting excessive taxes and levies, plundering people's wealth, and opening up financial sources for the puppet government. The above points were all measures that sacrificed rights to benefit the enemy and harmed the country and the people. Although the defendant claimed that the motivation for colluding with the enemy and betraying the country was driven by a tragic and compassionate emotion, so he went to hell to save sentient beings, but regardless of the various measures taken after the establishment of the puppet "Renovation Government", as mentioned earlier, there was nothing beneficial to the people at all. Furthermore, it is found that when the enemy invaded and the War of Resistance began, the whole country was united in hatred against the enemy. The defendant actually regarded the country's war of resistance and survival as an opportunity for personal advancement and profit, not hesitating to recognize the thief as his father, allowing the enemy to use him to establish a puppet regime in the occupied areas, promote puppet politics, and resist the central government, almost causing the nation and the race to fall into a state of eternal doom. His madness was extreme. Even in the defendant's own confession, he admitted that "with regard to the country's standpoint, he did not take all aspects into consideration, which is the confusion of a businessman and cannot excuse him from criminal responsibility," how can he be allowed to use sophistry to refute the charges? Furthermore, not long after the establishment of the puppet "Renovation Government", the defendant conspired to merge with the puppet "Provisional Government" in Beiping, which clearly followed the will of the enemy and promoted the unification and solidarity of the puppet regime, thereby strengthening the force to resist the central government. Later, when the traitor Wang colluded with the enemy, issued the notorious telegram, and prepared to establish the puppet "National Government" with the support of the enemy, the defendant knew that the situation was irresistible, so he colluded with them, not only issuing declarations in response, but also cooperating with them to prepare and plan in detail to bring it to fruition. After the establishment of the puppet "National Government" and the dissolution of the "Renovation Government", he was still enthusiastic and reluctant to leave, participating in the puppet "National Government" and serving successively as the President of the puppet Control Yuan and the President of the puppet Legislative Yuan. At that time, although he was no longer the chief and Wang did not trust him with his heart, causing him to be unable to act alone, he was still a key member of the puppet organization's central leadership and a member of the puppet Central Political Committee, which was the highest political guidance organ of the puppet government that decided on major policies, military affairs, and foreign affairs. He should also bear joint responsibility for the declaration of war on our allies Britain and the United States on January 9th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty on November 30th, the declaration of the joint declaration between China and Manchuria, the recognition of the puppet Manchukuo, and the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty on October 30th of the 32nd year. The defendant led the organization of the puppet regime at the beginning of the War of Resistance. Although the puppet organization changed several times, the defendant participated in it throughout, serving in key positions. He ignored the interests of the state and the survival of the nation, brazenly colluding with the enemy and betraying the country. He was truly a great traitor and scoundrel. Considering the circumstances, there is no way to be lenient, and it is requested that he be severely punished in order to rectify popular sentiment and extend the national law.

In summary, the defendant has committed the crime of colluding with enemy countries and conspiring to resist his own country under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. In accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is initiated. Please adjudicate according to the law immediately. Dai Rongduo, Prosecutor of the Shanghai High Court.

### Vietnamese Government Imposes Harsh Taxes; Overseas Chinese Petition for Diplomatic Intervention

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 10th] The Vietnamese government has recently set up checkpoints everywhere, collecting passage taxes from merchants and travelers and inspecting travel permits.

The tax rates are even heavier than during the Japanese occupation, and there is a need to pay the taxes which were not collected last year.

Editorial

### Britain's New Policy Towards Egypt

On the 7th of this month, British Prime Minister Attlee announced that Britain had decided to withdraw all British naval, land, and air forces stationed in Egypt and to negotiate with Egypt. Since the British government made this decision, opposition leaders Churchill and Eden have criticized the British government's Egyptian policy in Parliament. Churchill saw that Britain's operations in Egypt for nearly a century, especially in the last sixty years, were about to collapse, and he reminisced about the glory of the past British Empire. Moreover, the world situation is unstable, and he naturally felt emotional and wistful about the British government's decision. However, the British government's new decision on Egypt was finally supported by Parliament, because the government's Labour Party has an absolute majority of seats in the British Parliament, and the opposition can only shout out opposition, but cannot shake the government's established policy. Churchill's speech in Parliament focused on Britain's operations in Egypt over the past sixty years, and he could not bear to destroy the operations of his predecessors. Moreover, the Suez Canal in Egypt is the key to the British Empire's transportation line, and troops should be stationed there to ensure imperial transportation. He also said that Egypt controls the hub of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, and if Britain withdraws from Egypt, it will inevitably affect its entire strategic plan. However, Attlee said that the British government's decision was made after consulting the heads of the navy, land, and air forces and the heads of various autonomous territories, and that the opinions were the same before making this decision. Now that the British Parliament has supported the government's Egyptian policy, and the British-Egyptian negotiations are in progress, the entire British naval, land, and air forces stationed in Egypt will soon begin to withdraw, and the period should not be far away, but the complete withdrawal of all troops may take a longer period.

Britain's new decision on Egypt is certainly extremely wise. The rising national sentiment in Egypt has forced Britain to take this resolute decision. A country with national consciousness does not allow foreign troops to be stationed within its territory. Rather than incur anti-British sentiment due to the stationing of troops, which makes the defense of the Egyptian canal more difficult, it is better to voluntarily withdraw the troops in order to win people's favor. Sixty years ago, Britain sent troops to occupy Egypt for the benefit of Britain; today, the British army's withdrawal from Egypt is also for the benefit of Britain. Although the Labour Party, which is in power in Britain, has a more left-leaning policy, they are all British, first British and then Labour Party members, so all measures can ultimately put national interests first. From Britain's point of view, the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Egypt has satisfied Egypt's national aspirations and is also beneficial to Britain itself. The skillful application of this policy, the old-fashioned "empire builders" or "Victorian era" figures like Churchill, may not know the bottom line. Isn't "peaceful penetration" a feature of this era?

It is worth noting the evolution of the strategic relationship caused by the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt. In fact, it should be said that the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt is the result of the evolution of the strategic relationship gained from the experience of this World War. Judging from British Prime Minister Attlee's announcement, the British government made this decision after consulting the Chiefs of Staff of the Navy, Land, and Air Force and obtaining their consent. It can be seen that Britain's withdrawal of British troops stationed in Egypt was originally a new strategic decision. Due to the use of airborne troops, the development of air force power, the possibility of remote bombing, and the elimination of the threat from the Berlin and Rome axis, Egypt's strategic value is no longer what it used to be. At this time, the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Egypt can not only satisfy the wishes of the Egyptian people, but also allow Britain to have new strategic arrangements. Indeed, Britain spent sixty-four years operating the Alexandria naval port, which was originally an important stronghold of the British Navy's Mediterranean Fleet; the British army's withdrawal from Egypt will inevitably abandon this important naval port. Due to the experience of this war, naval strategy has undergone fundamental changes. Traditional naval strategies are no longer applicable. Modern naval warfare has gone beyond the traditional conditions of having naval bases. During this war, the US Navy's operations in the Pacific were a clear example. South Africa, East Africa, Ceylon, and the Near East may be used as British military bases in the future to take on the task of defending the Suez Canal. The withdrawal of British troops from Egypt is by no means an abandonment of its responsibility to protect the Suez Canal, but a new strategic decision to protect the canal. The negotiations currently underway between Britain and Egypt include defense matters in the canal area, which shows that Britain has not relaxed its responsibility for defending the area.

What we feel deeply here is that when Britain decided to withdraw British troops stationed in Egypt and recognized the independence of Britain, the Soviet Union demanded to take over Italian North Africa and East Africa. This is a very interesting contrast in policy. The intellectual level of the people of Italian North Africa is quite high, and they were originally influenced by ancient Roman culture; later, they were also influenced by Saracen culture. When the Soviet Union was "supporting" national movements everywhere, it advocated that it should take over Italian North Africa itself. Although this may be a diplomatic means and may not be able to achieve the real purpose of taking over, it is not difficult to imagine that it is paying attention to North Africa and East Africa. Egypt has gained complete independence due to the withdrawal of British troops, but those who regard themselves as "protectors of Islam" are afraid that they will not be succeeded by anyone due to Mussolini's death. In today's world trend, the survival of small countries may depend on the breath of big countries at any time; Egypt has indeed become completely independent, satisfying their national aspirations for generations. How Egypt will deal with itself in this turbulent world is really related to the lasting peace of the world. We hope that Egypt will cherish the fruits of their victory. For Britain, what this new decision symbolizes is not the decline of Britain but the rebirth of Britain. The relationship between countries should be built on the basis of trust and love to be lasting. The era of "empire" and "conquest" is over, and it is a new era! The British government can grasp the spirit of this new era and make new policy decisions, even though Churchill may not like it, but in any case, it is wise.

### Foreign Ministers of the Four Countries Too Far Apart in Opinions; Yesterday's Meeting Again Without Conclusion; Soviet Union Firmly Opposes Convening a Peace Conference

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: After the Soviet Union refused to participate in initiating the convening of a peace conference, the foreign ministers of the four powers held a meeting again today in an attempt to reach a compromise, but to no avail. It was decided to hold an informal meeting tomorrow morning. In this morning's meeting, British Foreign Secretary Bevin had a disagreement with Molotov and formally told Molotov: "To oppose the convening of a peace conference is not only to veto the peace conference, but also to veto the right of all participating countries to speak. I absolutely cannot agree to this kind of behavior." At that time, the French Foreign Minister proposed a compromise, advocating that the peace conference be postponed and that the foreign ministers of the four powers could hold a meeting on the 15th of next month (the date recommended by Bernes for holding the conference) to make another effort to formulate a peace treaty, and then decide the date for convening the peace conference.

[United Press, Paris, 10th] The meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries not only saw the conditions of the new European peace treaty rejected, but also had conflicting opinions on the issue of convening a twenty-one-nation peace conference to discuss the terms of the treaty, resulting in many obstacles to the meeting. People in general today expect that the representatives will make a final effort to reconcile the differences between the Soviet Union and the United States on convening a peace conference, but most observers believe that it is difficult to reach an agreement, and the foreign ministers will return to their respective countries at the beginning of next week. The representatives also privately admitted that there are several fundamental issues on which the opinions between the Soviet Union and the Western powers are too far apart, and there is little hope of reconciliation. During yesterday's meeting, US Secretary of State Bernes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov argued for two hours over the US proposal to convene a peace conference on June 15. Molotov argued that the four countries should first agree on a peace treaty before convening a peace conference. The US representative strongly opposed it, and the opinions of both sides were even more different, so the meeting adjourned. British sources said today that Molotov has accused the United States of violating the Moscow Three-Power Agreement, because at that time Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union had decided that the foreign ministers must first formulate a peace treaty before submitting it to the peace conference, and the peace conference must be convened when the draft treaty has been drafted and is waiting for consideration. At the same time, participants in the meeting revealed that the Soviet Union had requested one of the two new warships of Italy, which Britain and the United States had refused. It is heard that this matter is one of the key points in the naval clause related to the nurturing and appointment of the treaty, and the four countries' naval experts have also reached a stalemate in discussing the relevant naval clause.

[Reuters, Paris, 10th] French sources expect that the foreign ministers of the four countries will remain in Paris at the beginning of next week to exchange views on the German issue.

[Reuters, London, 10th] Rome Radio announced today that Yugoslav troops have arrived in Aidosino, eighteen miles northeast of Trieste.

### United States Policy Toward the Soviet Union Will Not Undergo Significant Changes; Truman Speaks to Reporters

[United Press, Washington, 10th] President Truman told the press today that US policy toward Britain and the Soviet Union will not undergo significant changes due to the imminent breakdown of the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference. When a reporter asked about a rumored possible change in US policy, the biggest change would be to strengthen relations with Britain, the president said that he had not heard of this statement. He also frankly stated that he was one of the policy makers. When asked about the apparent failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference, the president said that he had no comment yet.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th, United Press] President Truman held a press conference today, denying that the Foreign Ministers Conference of the Four Powers had broken down. He also said that he had authorized Secretary of State Bernes to issue a statement at the appropriate time.

### Churchill Speaks at the Dutch Parliament: Advocates for the Organization of a European Federation; Small Nations' Sacred Inviolability Should Be Affirmed; So-Called Democracy Means Government Belongs to the People

[United Press, The Hague, 9th] Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, accompanied by his wife and daughter Mary, arrived here last night. Today, he delivered a thirty-minute speech at the Dutch Parliament. Churchill advocated for the organization of a European Federation, encompassing both Eastern and Western Europe. This federation could arise from the United Nations framework, and its unity would be unprecedented since the fall of the Roman Empire. Churchill also championed the affirmation of small nations' sacred inviolability, stating that the modern world should prioritize the protection of small nations' rights. The purpose of the United Nations organization is to establish "justice through strength," protected by "the strength of justice." Churchill vehemently criticized those who seek to "mold the entire world into a single form," and reproached the unconscious promotion of nationalism as the world's supreme ideology. According to Churchill, the most outstanding aspect of democracy lies in whether the people have the freedom to criticize the government and access to independent courts. In short, it is "whether the government belongs to the people, or the people belong to the government." Churchill stated: "I hope that the twenty-year treaty between Britain and the Soviet Union will prove to be a true cornerstone of world peace, and I hope that Western European democracies can grow closer to each other within the European Federation." Churchill's speech was met with thunderous applause.

### International Financial Institutions Approve New Regulations

India Permitted to Serve as Director

[U.S. News Service, Washington, 9th] The Board of Governors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development today approved new regulations, allowing India to retain its right to serve as a director of the bank (for a two-year term), even if the Soviet Union is also a director at that time. Therefore, after the implementation of this regulation, India becomes one of the five major directorial countries. The Monetary Fund also adopted a similar resolution yesterday regarding India serving as a director. This regulation favors India; otherwise, India would have to postpone joining the International Bank and Fund for two years. The number of director seats in both the bank and the fund can be temporarily increased from five to six. The total number of director seats in both the bank and the fund, whether through appointment or election, should be temporarily increased from twelve to thirteen.

### Atomic Bomb Power Test Plans Approaching Maturity; Test Base Extensively Fortified; Special Fleet Flagship Departs

[United Press, Kwajalein, Marshall Islands, 9th] The U.S. plan to test the power of the atomic bomb on Bikini Atoll in July is approaching maturity. At that time, the U.S. Marine Corps will protect this world's biggest secret, with orders to kill without exception. The U.S. Army and Navy Joint Task Force is currently using Kwajalein Island as a base for testing atomic energy, and its fortification methods are being intensified daily to ensure foolproof security. From July 1st, no one is allowed to pass through here without special permission. The atomic bombs used will be stored in specially built cellars, covered with canvas for concealment and surrounded by wire mesh. Only a few people are allowed to enter. Transporting the atomic bombs to Kwajalein Island will also be kept absolutely secret, so as not to attract the attention of the curious. Even its size and shape can be regarded as valuable reports in countries that do not yet have atomic bombs. U.S. troops are patrolling the coast under the command of Major Hosse. According to Hosse, "It is not easy for a soldier to stop a senator or government official from entering this restricted area, but the orders will be strictly enforced. Anyone who does not obey the orders of the guards will be easily injured."

[U.S. News Service, Aboard the U.S. Navy Flagship USS Mount McKinley, 9th] The USS Mount McKinley, the flagship of the special mixed fleet for atomic bomb testing under the command of Vice Admiral Blandy, left San Francisco Harbor yesterday for Pearl Harbor.

Some of the equipment prepared for collecting scientific records during the atomic bomb explosion will be tested along the way. One of these is a fleet of pilotless fighter planes, entirely controlled by radio, which will be launched from the aircraft carrier. This is the first public demonstration of unmanned aircraft. These planes, along with Army B-17 Flying Fortresses, will immediately fly through the atomic cloud over Bikini after the atomic bomb explodes, equipped with various scientific instruments to automatically record data. Sprague announced that his flagship will depart from here on the 21st of this month to carry out the testing work.

### Failure of the Japanese Socialist Party to Form a Cabinet; Matsudaira Possibly to Assume Premiership

[United Press Tokyo, 10th] With the failure of the plan to organize a coalition cabinet or a "People's Democratic Front" government in Japan, it is generally speculated that Grand Chamberlain Tsuneo Matsudaira may assume the premiership.

[Remodeling Daily News Tokyo, 10th] After the Socialist Party's attempt to form a cabinet alone was rejected by Kijūrō Shidehara, the party convened a central standing committee meeting this afternoon. They decided to insist on forming the cabinet and invited fourteen people including Communist Party representatives Tokuda and Nosaka to meet with Shidehara. They demanded that Shidehara immediately recommend Katayama as Prime Minister. Shidehara merely said "I cannot answer," maintaining a composed demeanor as if he had a plan. Communist representative Tokuda became impatient, his forehead veins bulging as he slammed the table and angrily said, "Then how about we go together to negotiate before the Emperor!" Shidehara, seeing the situation was not good, excused himself to hold a cabinet meeting and slipped away. In the current situation, the Socialist Party's cabinet formation efforts have clearly stalled. According to observations from powerful sources, Shidehara may invite the leaders of the Social Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, the Cooperative Party, and even the Progressive Party tomorrow morning to hold consultations, excluding the Communist Party in an attempt to organize a so-called "National Unity Cabinet," and still recommend a Liberal Party representative as Prime Minister.

### Growing Industrial Crisis; Wool Textile Industry Requests Layoffs; Matter of Great Importance Transferred to Labor-Management Arbitration Committee

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Workers in the city's wool textile industry previously demanded adjustments to their pay due to the rising cost of living. After the Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from both labor and management to discuss the matter, the labor dispute was reasonably resolved. However, recently factories are experiencing shortages of raw materials, increased production costs, and the inability to compete with imported goods, resulting in a sharp decline in business and near-unsustainable conditions. Reluctantly, the industry association recently approached the Social Affairs Bureau requesting permission to lay off some workers, with the remaining employees working in shifts. The Social Affairs Bureau, considering the significance of this matter, acknowledges that it does not have the authority to prevent closures or cutbacks based on factory regulations. However, the resulting consequences would exacerbate the already complex social problems. For prudence's sake, it has been handed over to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee for processing, and countermeasures are currently being considered.

### Operating as Usual But Not Selling Tickets; British Tram Company Staged a Slowdown Yesterday; Labor Claims Treatment Has Not Improved; Social Affairs Bureau to Mediate Today

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The streetcar and trolleybus lines under the British Tram Company in this city staged a slowdown again yesterday, starting at 2:30 PM. People were allowed to ride without buying tickets, leading to doubled congestion. The Social Affairs Bureau will convene representatives from both sides today to conduct mediation. According to the workers, the reason for the slowdown is that management violated the plan previously agreed upon by the Social Affairs Bureau and has not complied with it. Although fares have been increased threefold, the workers' treatment has not improved. With the high cost of living, the average worker's monthly income of seventy to eighty thousand yuan is simply insufficient to maintain a living. This slowdown is a last resort, but to maintain transportation, they have decided to continue working as usual, without interrupting service.

Workers of Tobacco Company Petition

Over three hundred workers from the Wah Hwa Tobacco Company on Honan Road sent representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday.

The workers are unable to maintain their livelihoods and have requested a subsidy, which has been denied. Therefore, they are requesting mediation. On the same morning, workers from the Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Hongkou also sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition for mediation, requesting the resumption of work.

### Hu Wenyuan Assumes Office as Acting Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau; Expresses Optimism About Tax Revenue Prospects

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Hu Wenyuan, appointed as Acting Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, assumed office at the bureau the afternoon before yesterday. Yesterday, he met with reporters from this newspaper and discussed the city's financial situation. He stated that when the municipal government took over, tax revenue was only tens of millions of yuan. After several months of efforts by Director Pu and his colleagues, it has reached over 2.8 billion yuan last month, which can cover regular expenses, but construction funds are still tight. After the central government returns business taxes, deed taxes, and land taxes to the local government, improvements can be gradually made. Mr. Hu stated that he is new to the position and needs to study the details of the city's finances further, but he is confident that the bureau staff are able to faithfully perform their duties. If all sectors outside the bureau can cooperate and management is improved, Shanghai's tax revenue will not fall short of expenses.

Currently, the financial community is unwilling to invest in local projects. Mr. Hu stated that the main reason is the national political situation, which has led to a decline in currency value. Not only is there no profit to be made after investment, but it is also easy to lose money, which ordinary private banks cannot afford. Therefore, idle funds are used for speculative loans to collect interest. Moreover, the salaries of civil servants are meager, making it impossible to maintain a living. This is also a problem for the whole country. Therefore, during this period of national instability, civil servants can only tighten their belts, maintain austerity, and overcome this difficulty together.

Acting Deputy Director Hu is 35 years old, a native of Wuxian, Jiangsu Province. He graduated from Soochow University with a Master's degree in Economics from Harvard University in the United States. He has served as a professor at Chongqing University, specialist and section chief of the Ministry of Finance, director of the Foreign Exchange Management Committee, specialist of the Ministry of Finance, and attended the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference as an expert in the summer of 1934.

### Captured German Nazi Elements to be Tried Separately by the U.S. and China; Seven Arrested in Guangzhou to be Transferred to Shanghai

Many French Nazi elements, suspected of endangering the Allies and continuing their secret work after Japan's surrender, were discovered by the U.S. Military War Crimes Commission and arrested last month. A total of nine were arrested in Shanghai and seven in Guangzhou. According to Colonel Younger, director of the U.S. Military War Crimes Investigation and Trial Commission, the U.S. military may try this group of Nazi war criminals in Shanghai within a month. Those arrested in Guangzhou will also be brought to Shanghai for trial at the same time. The U.S. military believes that the case is related to China, so it is cooperating with the Chinese authorities to collect evidence. The case may be tried separately by the U.S. military court and the Chinese war crimes tribunal in the future. The U.S. military has contacted Chief of Staff He Yingqin and Commander Zhang Fa-kui's troops and may first have the U.S. military conduct the trial, followed by the Chinese authorities, to determine the charges separately.

### Suspicious Jeep Intercepted on Caoxi Road; Incident Occurred During Escort; U.S. Soldier Killed by Sniper; Rioter Shot Dead While Trying to Flee

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Joint Vehicle Inspection Office, currently stationed at the Racecourse, is jointly established by the U.S. Marine Corps Military Police and our country's military police. They send out three shifts daily to the Caoxi Road-Caobao Road intersection in western Shanghai to inspect passing vehicles. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, two U.S. military police officers, along with German soldier Deng Huiming, squad leader Ni Mingqi, and police officers No. 8728, 8731, and 8718, and a translator, went to Caoxi Road to relieve the previous shift. Around 12:00 PM, a rioter driving a jeep, bearing the permits Guohu No. 14025 U.S.N.N. and No. 3548, with a worn-out Guohu permit No. 15653 hanging behind, was heading south from the north. The U.S. military police approached for questioning and, finding his actions suspicious, detained both the person and the vehicle. At 4:00 PM, the team rotated back, with the U.S. military police driving the jeep driven by the rioter, with Deng Huiming sitting next to them, and the rioter sitting in the back row alone. The three police officers, squad leader Ni Mingqi, and the translator were traveling in front in a U.S. military police vehicle, Guohu No. 41160. Unexpectedly, when the two vehicles reached the entrance of the Cao Family Cemetery (about two hundred steps from the Caoxi Road intersection), the rioter suddenly reached out and sniped at the U.S. soldier driving. The U.S. soldier did not have time to dodge,

and was killed on the spot. The rioter then moved the dead U.S. soldier to the back, intending to drive the military vehicle, turned around, and tried to flee south. He was discovered by police officer No. 8728 in the vehicle in front, who fired three shots at the rioter. The rioter was wounded and fell from the vehicle, dying on the spot. The bullet entered from the left waist and exited from the right waist. A Browning pistol and a leather bag were dropped and taken away by the U.S. soldiers. The corpse appeared to be

in his twenties, wearing a suit, a yellow raincoat, white gloves, and black leather shoes, and wearing glasses. A "Shanghai Security Corps, Shanghai Central District Corps One Character No. 496" service card cloth sleeve, two gold rings, 13,000 yuan in customs gold units, 7,000 yuan in legal tender, a silver dollar, and a St. John's University diary were found on his person. The U.S. soldier's body was taken away by an ambulance. After the authorities took photos of the rioter's body, it was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to await inspection by the court today.

The murdered was sixteen years old. According to the post-incident investigation: The U.S. Navy soldier killed was named Anderson, and the rioter who died was named Chen Dailun, 16 years old, a student at St. John's University. His father, Chen Shixia, works at the customs office and serves as the captain of the first battalion of the Shanghai Security Corps in the central district. That night, after the incident, the Shanghai Joint Vehicle Inspection Office at the Racecourse immediately summoned Chen Shixia for questioning. According to him, the No. 14025 jeep driven by the deceased Dailun was indeed stolen, and the pistol he was carrying was found to belong to Yao Kangfu, a security corps leader. Dailun falsely claimed that he could obtain a gun license on behalf of Yao, so the gun was in his possession. Unexpectedly, he caused this disaster and deserved to die. After the incident, the U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters stationed in Shanghai immediately ordered a large number of military police, together with our military police, to heavily guard the area around the scene, blocking traffic until 8:00 PM, when the curfew was lifted and traffic was restored.

The corps members also fired back and pursued them to Hongjiajiao, where one robber was captured on the spot. He confessed that his name was Yang Haifa, a local, who had been arrested for robbery and released last winter.

### Forcibly Occupying Vacant Enemy Alien Houses; Continued Orders to Evacuate; Addresses of Those Being Enforced Temporarily Not Released

The Shanghai branch of the Executive Yuan's Housing Committee for Various Agencies yesterday enforced the eviction of those who forcibly occupied vacant houses left by enemy aliens. The committee's enforcement orders No. 5 through No. 7 are specifically issued for such cases. However, the names and addresses of those being enforced are temporarily not being released to the public. A senior official of the committee told reporters that, after the previous first to fourth enforcement orders were published in the newspaper, there were inquiries from various parties to the committee about the addresses and house numbers of those being enforced, because they learned of it and tried to obtain approval from responsible people in society in order to be allocated those houses. Therefore, the committee does not plan to publish the addresses of those being enforced in future enforcement orders.

### Low-Cost Housing to Be Built in Nanshi and Zhabei Districts; 320 Units to Have Sanitary Facilities

### Public Trial of Traitor Tsai Pei: Once Praised "Co-Prosperity" and Sought "Friendship," Briefly Prominent, Now Humbling Himself, Submissively Quibbling, Hoping to Avoid Punishment; Wang Yongkang and Five Other Criminals Brought for Trial This Morning

[Reported by This Newspaper] During his period of resistance, Cai Pei, who served as the "Ambassador" of the puppet Nanjing National Government to Japan, vigorously sought "friendship" and loudly proclaimed "North Honor," once enjoying brief prominence, entered the court under public scrutiny at 2:30 PM yesterday to begin facing the sanctions of our laws. Traitor Cai is nearly old, his back slightly hunched, his head bald, and a short mustache remains on his upper lip. He wore a regular old gray-green long robe, revealing long black trouser legs beneath, and a pair of black serge cloth shoes. When he arrived in court, he wore a smile on his face, but his voice was low and slightly asthmatic when answering questions.

After Judge Liu inquired about his age, hometown, family size, and assets, he asked: "Have you ever joined the Kuomintang?" The answer was: "No." Subsequently, the prosecutor read the indictment, and Traitor Cai immediately stated that his participation in the puppet government was a forced scheme by Traitor Wang Jingwei, who pulled him in as Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce, and that he was by no means "willingly collaborating." During his tenure as the puppet mayor of Nanjing, he claimed to have renovated the tomb of Sun Yat-sen and provided relief to the impoverished. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, when the Japanese army forcibly conscripted laborers in Nanjing, he also intervened to help them avoid conscription. When he was the head of the puppet Food Management Committee, he advocated for the reduction of military rice rations to resist Japan, but when he failed, he was transferred to Shanghai to hold a nominal position and reflect in seclusion. As for his appointment as the puppet ambassador to Japan, he originally did not want to go, but received instructions from Xu Mingcheng of the central government to "penetrate the tiger's den and spy on enemy intelligence." His actions in Tokyo were not entirely free and he seemed to be regarded as a spy, so he immediately returned to China and resigned.

Cai Pei Standing in Front of His Lawyer Giving Testimony

The presiding judge read aloud absurd remarks made by Traitor Cai in Japan, as reported in the newspapers, and asked him why. Traitor Cai actually said: "Speeches have been translated and re-translated, and I cannot be responsible for what is written in the newspapers." The presiding judge then asked: "Did you sign the 'Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty' during your time as the puppet ambassador to Japan?" Traitor Cai cunningly claimed: "No, this was negotiated by the puppet government authorities and the Japanese ambassador. They treated my agency as a decoration. Even after the fact, they did not inform me." The presiding judge then read out the speech given at the reception hosted by Aoki, the Greater East Asia Minister of Japan, on January 20, 1944, after the signing of the "treaty." Traitor Cai retorted: "Is this evidence not from the newspapers?" and turned to look around, saying, "What's in the newspaper is not accurate." This kind of quibbling was immediately ridiculed by the audience. Judge Liu then asked: "On January 9th last year, you sent 800,000 catties of sugar to the citizens of Tokyo on behalf of Chen Gongbo, is that correct?" He answered: "That was completely empty rhetoric." The audience burst into laughter. Subsequently, the lawyer for the defense submitted several documents. After the court debate and investigation were completed, the hearing was adjourned to a later date. Traitor Cai claimed to be ill. Judge Liu immediately allowed the prison doctor to examine him, and also granted his request to see his family. He met with his concubine and children, and Traitor Cai was exhausted, closing his eyes and opening his mouth, unable to speak coherently.

It is found that Traitor Cai is from Wuxi, 62 years old, residing at No. 4, Lane 395, Fuzhou Road. Before the war, he served as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Ministry of Interior. After the July 7th Incident, he did not follow the government to the west, but in April 1940, he served as the puppet Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce. In June, he was transferred to the post of mayor of Nanjing. In January 1942, he became the Chairman of the Puppet Food Management Committee. In March, he became a member of the Relief Committee of the Puppet Executive Yuan. In December, he was appointed as a political advisor to the puppet National Government. In May 1943, he served as the puppet ambassador to Japan, where he discussed peace with enemy leaders Konoe Fumimaro and others several times. After returning to China from Japan in May 1945, he served as a member of the puppet National Government Committee and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Nanjing City Bank. After the victory, he was arrested by the Shanghai office of the Military Intelligence Bureau and brought to justice. The Higher Procuratorate's investigation confirmed that his actions constituted a violation of Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed in accordance with the law. Furthermore, the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court tried four traitor cases yesterday morning, and all were adjourned to a later date. Details are listed below.

Yuan Jufan is from Anhui, 44 years old, residing at Room 1, No. 1396, Yuyuan Road. After graduating from Nanyang Medical University in 1927, he practiced medicine in Shanghai. In August 1939, he sought refuge in the puppet government and served as a medical officer at the Municipal Hospital of the "Great Way Municipal Government." On July 31, 1943, when the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government took over the concessions and merged Districts 18 and 2, he served as the Director of the Health Department of the two districts. In June 1944, he was promoted to Counselor of the puppet Municipal Government. In July 1945, he was further promoted to Director of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau. According to his statement: because his brothers were brutally murdered by the communists, his family had an elderly mother, and living conditions were difficult, his collaboration was out of necessity, and the positions he held were all beneficial to the people.

Tan Zhongjiang, from Hunan, is the nephew of Tan Yankai, 33 years old, residing at No. 581, Seymour Road. His father and brother were lifelong friends with Traitor Wang Jingwei, so in July 1941, he was summoned by Wang Jingwei to serve as a secretary of the Puppet Executive Yuan with a simplified appointment. In the spring of 1942, he resigned and came to Shanghai to work at the Litai Yarn Factory in Taicang. He claimed that his acceptance of the puppet position was due to personal obligations, so he only worked for a few months.

Li Junle, from Guangdong, 51 years old, residing at No. 220, Ferguson Road, joined the puppet government in October 1940 and served as a clerk at the puppet Huaxing Bank. In 1942, he was promoted to Assistant Manager of the Foreign Exchange Department. In July 1944, he served as the Director of the Huaxing Bank's Xiafei Road branch. In January 1945, he was promoted to Deputy Manager of the Business Bureau of the puppet Head Office. He is accused of issuing puppet currency indiscriminately and disrupting the financial system.

Li Yimin, from Anhui, 36 years old, joined the puppet government in May 1943 and served as an inspector in the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau and as the director of the puppet anti-smoking offices in Changzhou and Kunshan, selling drugs and corrupting the people. His crimes are indeed great. The defendant claimed that he was forced by livelihood and had no other choice.

### Oppose the Method of Guaranteed Admission to Higher Education; Students of the National Peking University Preparatory Class Boycott Classes; Continue to Petition the Ministry of Education

### The Food Problem Is Becoming Increasingly Urgent; Rice Prices Are Jumping Again; Is the Ministry of Food Successfully Distributing Grain?

Yesterday, the rice market was buoyed by continued price increases in the interior, and sentiment was firm. Spot transactions were acceptable, and prices uniformly rose again by two to three thousand yuan. Flour was also affected by the rising rice prices, and shopkeepers were receptive to turnover, raising prices by more than one thousand yuan. Bran rose slightly by one hundred yuan. The bean cake market became active, with prices rising by four to five hundred yuan. The same was true for soybeans, with prices rising by around one thousand yuan. Corn prices in Qingdao were stable due to active trading. However, red sorghum remained flat, while peanuts were quite popular, with prices increasing by more than one thousand yuan. The cotton cake market was stable, with active spot transactions. Shopkeepers competed with each other, driving prices up sharply in the morning. The market calmed down at noon, resulting in an overall increase of around two thousand yuan compared to yesterday. The rice market saw chaotic trading again yesterday. The food problem is extremely serious. Various parties are feeling strongly that the food administration has not taken effective and strict measures. Looking at the rice arrivals in the city yesterday, according to the rice market news, a total of more than 2,500 dan of six types of white japonica rice and others arrived. The types and quantities are as follows: White japonica 1,396, Thin Rice 278, Early Rice 250, Sheep Wax 104, Du Xian 474, Zi Yuan 30 dan.

Also, in order to regulate the food supply in the Jinghu area, the Ministry of Food has recently requested and been approved by the Four Joint Offices to allocate another 1 billion yuan in grain loans, entrusting grain merchants to purchase rice in the rice-producing areas of Jiangxi Province, and sending personnel from the Ministry of Food to supervise the purchase area. The loan will be provided by the Bank of China locally in Jiangxi Province, and procurement and transportation are now underway. It is reported that this batch of rice will soon be transported to Jinghu to supply the market.

### Gold Notes Unchanged

Yesterday's gold notes remained largely unchanged. The opening price in the morning was around 1.59 million, and this price has been hovering for a long time. The Bank of China's allocation price has not changed, so there is no need to register anymore. Although it briefly rose to over 1.6 million, it soon returned to its original level, hovering around 1.595 million at noon. There were no special changes in the afternoon, and the closing price was similar to the previous day. Decorative gold was 170,000, silver bullion was 1,700, and silver dollars were selling at 1,080 yuan. The private exchange rate was calm, with interest rates ranging from 1.7 to 2 jiao.

Foreign currency US dollars were stable, with little special activity. There was no shortage of demand from Chinese businesses and industries. A certain American bank continued to release physical currency, in significant amounts, but because most of it was dirty and old, the currency exchange industry's reserves did not ease, and the process remained tight. The opening price in the morning was 2,190 yuan, after which it fluctuated in a short range between 2,180 yuan and 2,200 yuan, with no change until noon. The afternoon remained stable, and the closing price was similar to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars were still affected by the falling Hong Kong exchange rate, falling below 390 yuan at the lowest point before stabilizing slightly. The closing price was also flat, but there were more sellers than buyers. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 410 yuan, and the Robbie was 515 yuan, with supply exceeding demand. The US exchange rate remained flat.

### Yarn Sales Stagnant; Spot Cotton Trading Quite Active

Yesterday, the yarn market lacked vitality. The Green Jin and Yue gangs did not take action, and sales to customers became sluggish. Only the Jing, Wu, and Min gangs absorbed a small amount, but the demand was limited, and they could not revitalize the declining market. The prices of various yarns fell by about 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. There were still not many spot goods of small and medium-sized yarns. At noon, the Textile and Construction Company opened yarn as usual, with prices similar to the previous period. However, 42-count double-strand yarn was not listed, so the price of this type of yarn rose by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan at the afternoon tea party.

Yesterday, New York's American cotton telegram reported an increase of 12 to 22 points. The near-term price was US$27.52, and the forward price was US$27.82. There was no market for Middling cotton. Spot cotton trading in Shanghai was active. The Textile and Construction Company purchased a total of 5,663 bales of Middling, Brazilian, Flower Island, and Uruguay brands. Shenxin No. 1 Factory purchased 200 bales of Middling, and the price was higher than the previous day.

### Vietnamese Rice Allowed to Be Shipped to China in Small Quantities; Siam Also Cooperates to Increase Production

According to Chaoshan gang Hong Kong exporters, Shantou's rice supply has always relied on Siam and Vietnam. Since the two places restricted exports, Shantou's rice once rose to 140,000 yuan per dan, and flour also rose to 20,000 yuan per bag due to the ban on exports from Shanghai. Recently, local merchants have appealed to the Vietnamese authorities to lift the ban. It is reported that the Vietnamese authorities have agreed to ship a small amount of rice to Shantou. The rice price has fallen back to 60,000 yuan per dan, and the flour price has also fallen back to around 20,000 yuan per bag.

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] The US State Department announced yesterday that it has established a British-American committee to help the Siamese government increase rice production and expedite the transportation of rice to India and other areas in the Far East that urgently need food.

[United Press, New York, 9th] According to "Newsweek" magazine, the export industry of Burmese rice and hemp wood is difficult to recover for a while due to the lack of elephants and water buffaloes. It is said that of the 6,000 elephants that had been trained to transport timber, 4,000 died or disappeared in the jungle during the Japanese occupation.

### A Small Number of Major Players Manipulate; Government Bonds Rise in a Straight Line; The Stock Market Also Gradually Stabilizes

Government bonds were not exempt from a fluctuating trend. In general, people overly emphasized the monthly drawing of lots for principal repayment. Yesterday, the fear of winning the lottery slightly subsided. In fact, the rise and fall of the bond market have long deviated from common sense. A few so-called major government bond players shared similar interests, and a small amount of speculative capital followed their lead blindly. Tongbing rose from the opening price of 6,250 yuan all the way to 7,300 yuan, an increase of 1,150 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Jiayi and Yi also followed suit, rising by 650 yuan after struggling for a while. Dingzhong rose by 700 yuan, and Wuzhong rose by 750 yuan. Chinese stocks struggled fiercely. Although the situation improved slightly, speculative capital was still cautious and did not dare to participate in the rise. The process rose and fell repeatedly, but the trading range gradually narrowed, and the storm was relatively calm. The prices of various stocks were weaker in the middle of the day, but the opening and closing prices were more stable. Rongfeng made a major announcement, with 20 major joint short-selling players using 95 taels of gold to secure a certain number at a building on Central Road as the command center, attracting loyal followers of the stock market. The market price continued to advance, and the closing price was slightly higher for Yongsha and Meiya compared to the previous closing price. Rongfeng continued to rise by 10%. The gains and losses of the three small leading stocks were minimal, and the rest were relatively stable. In the afternoon, the prices of various stocks were still raised under encouragement. Foreign stocks also followed Chinese stocks and tended to stabilize, but the momentum was not strong. Yisha briefly reached a high of 14,300 yuan before turning around. The closing price was slightly lower for Yeguang and Huidefeng compared to the previous closing price, and the rest rebounded slightly.

### Sugar Prices Turn Flat

Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat. The association's marked price for medium-grade white sugar was 57,500 yuan, a slight increase of 500 yuan. The numbered price for medium-grade sugar with tax was 56,500 yuan, ordinary Diaoqing was 45,000 yuan, and inferior Qing was 43,000 yuan. The previous day's tender sale of sugar resulted in the sale of 660 packages of Che Bai honey at 60,000 yuan, 178 packages of raw sugar at 52,000 yuan, and 100 packages of inferior Che Bai (competitively bid) at 63,000 yuan, 50 bags of 22nd grade white sugar at 64,000 yuan, and 70 packages of inferior 3.5 Che Bai at 57,000 yuan.

### Philippine Sugar Production Decreases

No Surplus Sugar for Export This Year

[Reuters, Manila, 10th] It is predicted that there will be no surplus sugar available for export from the Philippines during the 1946-47 season. The total area of sugarcane fields in 1945-46 was 11,551 hectares, and the sugarcane production is estimated to be 299,000 tons.

### The Reopening of Silk Factories Has an Impact; Silk Prices Revolve Upward

Yesterday, the opening price of Youguang ren silk on the 120th Tianqiao was 1.26 million yuan. Later, upon hearing the news that silk factories were reopening, sentiment was boosted, and the price revolved upward to 1.33 million yuan at the close. In the afternoon, it rose another 10,000 yuan, resulting in an increase of 70,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other numbered goods all rose by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The purchasing price of 80-point evenness factory silk by Dachang was 2.34 million yuan. The transaction of user silk was bleak, and the price of ordinary goods was called up by 50,000 yuan. Meiya's silk goods were relatively firm, rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Dacheng's ge ten 縐 was quite weak, with a selling price of 3,680 yuan per yard.

### Domestic Soda Ash Is Cheaper; Ammonium Sulfate Has Not Yet Recovered

The Yongli Tanggu Soda Ash Factory has returned to its pre-war state, producing 80 to 100 tons of 99-degree soda ash per day. Its quality is no less than that of imported products. The current market price of British Merchant Bunemen's Moon Brand soda ash is 50,000 yuan per bag, while Yongli's soda ash is only sold for 35,000 yuan. The factory also originally produced caustic soda, but the electrolysis project is very complicated and has not yet been started. The outlets for soda ash are the production of old soda ash, glass, enamel, and other industrial raw materials.

Also, Yongli's Nanjing Ammonium Sulfate Factory will be able to start production as soon as the coal transportation problem is solved. Before the war, British Merchant Bunemen's ammonium sulfate fertilizer had the largest sales in China. After the war, the price of alkali and fertilizer sold by Bunemen not only decreased but was also higher than that of American goods. If Yongli Company can make its best efforts, then domestic alkali and fertilizer can replace it.

### Overview of Pulp Production and Sales; The United States Produces 18 Million Tons of Paper Annually; Part of the Raw Materials Come from Abroad

[United Press, New York, 9th] Sweden, Norway, and Finland are pulp exporting countries. Whether American paper mills can produce 18 million tons of paper this year according to plan depends on the pulp supply from these countries. According to industry estimates, the pulp supply from Canada next year is expected to be equal to or even exceed the previous year, reaching a total of 1.25 million tons. The amount of pulp supplied by Sweden and Finland is still unknown. According to paper mill estimates, Sweden can supply 800,000 to 900,000 tons of pulp to the United States this year, but the United States must raise the price limit. Of the 18 million tons of paper produced this year, 80% of the raw materials are pulp and 30% are waste paper. Last year, the United States imported about 1.7 million tons of pulp, of which 1.1 million tons came from Canada and 600,000 tons came from Sweden. The United States produced 11.1 million tons of pulp. The proposal to jointly increase the prices of imported and domestic pulp by 10% has recently been rejected by the Price Management Bureau. The current price per ton ranges from US$50 to US$80, and the price of special-grade pulp is as high as US$140 per ton.

### Nanyang Cotton Cloth Market; India Is Rapidly Catching Up

A reporter from the United Credit Reporting Agency inquired about the overview of cotton cloth export trade with Mr. Pan Shihao, the executive director of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association. According to him, before the war, Chinese cotton cloth sold well in various parts of the Nanyang Islands, with light-colored thin yarn cloth and printed cloth being the main products. Therefore, China formed a tripartite situation with Britain and Japan in the cotton cloth market of Nanyang. After the war, Japan's cotton cloth was temporarily difficult to export. The British government planned to build a 10 million-spindle spinning machine in India in an attempt to monopolize the Nanyang cotton cloth market. At present, China has not yet fully recovered, and transportation is not smooth, so it is difficult to talk about cotton cloth exports for a while. It is hoped that the Textile and Construction Company, which leads the national cotton spinning industry, can foresee this and avoid losing the Nanyang market.

### Kerosene Restrictions Lifted; Sales Prices Are Expected to Plummet

Since the arrival of the National Army in Shanghai, Mobil Oil and other companies have shipped large quantities of surplus kerosene from oil-producing areas in California, Texas, and New Jersey to China (due to limited sales in those countries during World War II), amounting to more than 200,000 tons. Therefore, the market is currently flooded with bulk kerosene, causing black market prices to plummet. It is reported that the Texaco gas stations sold by American merchants have no restrictions, canceling the previous limit of one jin per person and no need to queue to buy. Moreover, this kerosene will continue to be shipped from the United States to Shanghai, and the prices of kerosene and other fuels are expected to plummet soon.

### Pineapple Hemp; The First Batch Has Arrived in Shanghai

Pineapple hemp, a special product of Nanyang, is the most lustrous, strong, and soft of all hemp fibers. In the past, Japanese artificial silk ranked first in various countries, and its main raw material was pineapple hemp. According to inquiries, the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Company has purchased pineapple hemp from the Nanyang production area, and the first batch has arrived in Shanghai.

### White Coal Chunks Fall Back Again; Pine Firewood Enters the 3,000 Yuan Mark

In the coal market, the price of white coal screened chunks had been supported by major players, but due to sluggish actual sales, dealers and smallholders were forced to sell at low prices due to financial constraints, so the price fell back again. The arrival of firewood and charcoal downstream was also strong, and market prices continued to decline. Pine firewood has fallen below the 3,000 yuan mark. If there are large shipments, further negotiations are possible.

### Three Major Companies Voluntarily Stop Sales; Cotton Cloth Industry Resumes Trading; Association Sends Letter to China Textile Stopping the Sale of Enemy and Puppet Yarn and Cloth

The cotton cloth market, which had been stalled for many days, resumed normal trading between companies yesterday, but public sentiment remained extremely indignant. The association held a meeting in the afternoon to discuss the establishment of a sales office promoted and organized by the association to liaise with the Textile and Construction Company, expressing support for the proposal. However, the issue of personnel selection was given great importance.

Reorganization Method

It is reported that members will begin to formulate a plan, and then hold meetings in groups to discuss it publicly. They will also submit concrete methods for the procedures of the Textile and Construction Company directly opening goods to the Textile and Construction authorities for adoption. If the progress is smooth, it is hoped that opening goods to the Textile and Construction Company will resume next week. The cessation of activities of the sales offices organized by the three major companies, Baodaxiang, etc., has been accepted by the three major companies and the Textile and Construction authorities. However, how to reorganize to merge with the large organization promoted by the association is still under negotiation. The remaining yarn and cloth of the Pseudo-Merchant Association has been submitted by the Cotton Cloth, Cotton Yarn, and Dyeing and Weaving Three Industry Association to the Textile and Construction Company, and also presented to the Processing Bureau, requesting to stop the sale, pending the final reasonable disposal. According to the person in charge of the association, the sales office organized by the Textile and Construction Company should have been supported, but it is regrettable that it failed to accommodate the opinions of most of the industry in advance, which caused dissatisfaction. The following is a letter from Saidaxiang, etc., expressing their willingness to cancel the sales office, and a letter from the Three Associations requesting to stop the sale of the remaining yarn and cloth of the Pseudo-Merchant Association to the Manager of Textile and Construction Company.

Letter from the Three Associations

Dear Sirs, Regarding the case of our Association, etc., requesting the return of the remaining yarn and cloth transferred by the Pseudo-Merchant Association, there have been repeated changes over the months, and the processing authorities have repeatedly changed their approvals. The local newspapers have repeatedly reported on the progress of this case, which we trust you are aware of. We previously received a reply stating that when the bid price was paid, the price of gold soared, and merchants no longer suffered losses. However, the bid price was actually very small, and the price increase was far from making up for the losses. Furthermore, one-quarter of the payment has not yet been received. Seven or eight out of ten companies have gone bankrupt and closed down, and some have even become brokers, relying on small profits to make a living. The situation is miserable and difficult to describe. Such measures by the Bureau make it difficult for the victims to feel satisfied. Therefore, we have filed an administrative lawsuit with the Executive Yuan, seeking to return the remaining yarn and cloth in accordance with the Zhu-led payment portion. While this lawsuit is still pending, the Bureau has decided that this yarn and cloth is government property and entrusted it to your company for sale by tender. The news spread, causing the industry to reach the point of unbearable, ultimately leading to a storm of strikes and protests. In addition to working hard to persuade them to resume business first and wait for a reasonable solution, our Association, etc., hereby inform you for your information and request that the aforementioned yarn and cloth be suspended from tendering before the lawsuit is finalized. At the same time, we also hope that you will forward it for review, so as to avoid increasing disputes. We are counting on you. Best regards, To China Textile Construction Company.

Letter from the Three Major Companies

We have received your letter No. Cai Zi 103 with respect. After investigation, we have been entrusted by China Textile and Weaving Construction Company to establish a sales office to promote a portion of the various cloths produced by the company, which has caused dissatisfaction among various industries. In order to respect the opinions of various industries, we have decided to voluntarily stop undertaking and request the Textile and Construction Company to terminate the contract. We deeply regret that we did not seek the consent of your Association in advance. We hereby reply to your letter and ask that you convey this to various industries.

### Coal Transport by Freighters Between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao: 20,000 Tons Already Transported; Hongji Labor Dispute Resolved

[Our Dispatch] The American-owned Fu Lai Steamship Company's freighters William B. Phillips, Mitchell, Hiran L. Goth, and G. Land Willard (transliterations), four freighters specializing in transporting coal between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao, with the Hiran L. Goth and William B. Phillips,

arrived in Shanghai from Qinhuangdao the day before yesterday. Hiran L. Goth carried 9,500 tons of coal, docking at the Yi Tai Dian Bei Pier for unloading. William B. Phillips also transported 10,000 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao and is currently docked at the Mitsui Wharf for unloading. Two other freighters are en route to Shanghai. The aforementioned four American freighters regularly transport coal between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao.

The labor dispute at the Hongji Coal Mine in Annam that occurred last week has now been resolved. The coal industry has received a telegram stating that two giant freighters have been loaded with white coal dust from that area en route to Shanghai. One is the Norwegian freighter Rostum, carrying 5,600 tons of white coal dust, and the other is the British freighter Handamare, carrying 7,100 tons of white coal dust to Shanghai, scheduled to arrive tomorrow.

### U.S. Cotton Import: No Suspension Request Allegation; Indian Cotton Pricing is Cheaper

According to the cotton industry, the quantity of imported American cotton is sufficient for current use. There is also an allegation that the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank will temporarily suspend applications for foreign exchange for American cotton ordered after the 27th of this month. However, Lin Weiying, the Director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department, stated that of the $33 million USD in American cotton loans, only one-tenth to two-tenths has been used, and there is no suspension request.

Zhang, the manager of Jun Chang Cotton Company, stated that orders for American cotton have decreased in the past two months. Previous orders from this city can be delivered by the end of June. Currently, because American cotton prices are slightly higher than Indian cotton, most cotton companies are placing orders with India.

### New Flag Gunny Sacks Have Weak Base

In recent days, new flag gunny sacks have been arriving continuously from Shaoxing Ping Shui and Wen Hang. However, the quality is inferior to previous batches. Although the price for dismantling has not decreased, the base is weak. Other colors, especially from Tianjin, Suzhou, and Wuxi, are selling well, so the market situation is holding steady. Especially the scarce supply of "Shu Lan Tea" style, resulting in price increases, while other styles remain firm.

### Zhejiang Province Sericulture Enters Transformation Period: New Silk Emerges Three Days After Start of Summer

— Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 7th Day, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

Whether we travel from Shanghai to Hangzhou by train, car, or boat, we can see mulberry groves on both sides of the road, especially in the mid-spring weather, the mulberry leaves are lush and green and lovely. Furthermore, if we take the Hangjiang Railway from Hangzhou, or take the Zhegan Road train through Zhuji, Xiaoshan and other places, we can also see a row of neat mulberry trees. If you go to Yuhang, it is even more of a wilderness of mulberry groves. This is the famous silk-producing area of Zhejiang, where almost every farming family makes sericulture their business. Even urban families raise one or two silkworm egg sheets to forecast this year's wealth.

Now is a Great Opportunity for Silk to Rise

In the past, Zhejiang's silk was dumped abroad, but later Japan caught up, improving mulberry trees, silkworm breeds, sericulture, and cocoon drying. The world silk market was taken over by Japan. Now that Japan is busy with its domestic reorganization, it is the time for our silk to rise. I still remember when we studied some wild silkworms in the Great Rear Area, but to this day, there has not been much success. Now that the lost territory has been recovered and the strong enemy has been defeated, if we do not seek development, when will we wait?

According to the survey statistics in the "Zhejiang Chronicle" of the "China Industrial Gazette" of the Ministry of Industry's International Trade Bureau in 1933, in the old Hangjiahu area north of the Qiantang River and south of Lake Tai, on a provincial scale: the area of mulberry fields is 2,658,193 mu, the annual output of mulberry leaves is 18,366,410 dan, the number of silkworm farming households is 800,4,352, the annual output of improved silkworm cocoons is 326,400 dan, the output of native silkworm cocoons is 761,600 dan, the output of factory silk is 5,080 dan, the output of native silk is 85,260 dan, and the output of silk fabrics is 300,000 bolts. This number is considerable. Now, if we operate well, we will definitely have many methods. However, the problem we should pay attention to now is that silkworm farmers use high-interest loans for sericulture, resulting in the silkworm farmers still being completely impoverished. Native breeds are more common than improved breeds, and the outlet and handling methods for native breeds still need to be resolved.

China Silk Company Guides Sericulture

According to the person in charge of the state-owned China Silk Company Zhejiang Branch, they will absolutely not seize profits from the people, nor will they compete with the people for power. They are to guide the development of the sericulture industry. 300,000 sheets of improved silkworm eggs have already been allocated by them to the Zhejiang Sericulture Improvement Committee of the Construction Department, then allocated by the Improvement Committee to the Sericulture Improvement Institutes of various counties, then allocated to the Sericulture Improvement Organizations of various townships, and then distributed to the farmers. It is said that the price of improved silkworm eggs this year is as high as 12,000 yuan per sheet, but the China Silk Company is allocating them for only 2,000 yuan. If the real farmers can obtain loans at this price, it would be a cause for celebration. According to what the reporter learned: the Cooperative Business Administration is responsible for lending improved silkworm eggs only to Jiaxing, Chongde, Haining, Zhuji, Xiaoshan, Hangxian, Deqing, and other seven counties, because the cooperative organizations in these seven counties are sound and can lend directly to the people. However, Gu Dayi, the director of the Haining Seawall Disaster Relief Committee, caught someone raising the price of improved silkworm eggs and selling them to farmers. Therefore, whether the other counties can truly still lend to the farmers at 2,000 yuan remains to be investigated by people who can truly work in rural areas. The reporter once asked the person in charge of the Zhejiang Company of the China Silk Company whether the price of silkworm eggs would be increased for sale, and he said he could not guarantee it.

Silkworm Farmers Cannot Withstand High-Interest Loans

After the improved breeds are loaned, the 2,000 yuan price must be paid immediately. There is also a loan for sericulture, 3,000 yuan per household, which is lent directly by the Farmers Bank. Before the war, Zhejiang's improved and native silkworm eggs always exceeded one million sheets. Now, if we assume that it is discounted by 30%, then there should be 700,000 sheets. In addition to the 300,000 sheets of improved breeds, there are also 400,000 sheets of native breeds. Because the state-owned China Silk Company believes that native silkworm silk does not meet export standards, it leaves it to its own devices, does not lend, and does not provide guidance. Will the 321,732 silkworm farming households be subject to the exploitation of high-interest loans? This is a current problem.

Native Silk Factories Mystify the Situation

The season has arrived at "Start of Summer". "New silk emerges three days after the Start of Summer" is a common saying among sericulturists. Then the native silkworm silk will enter the market, while the improved breeds will be later. It is said that they will not go up the mountain to make cocoons until after the 15th of this month. The China Silk Company uses political power to prohibit silk factories from opening cocoon shops, which can be said to prevent the exploitation of intermediate cocoon merchants, which is correct. Moreover, the Zhejiang Branch has negotiated a 200 million yuan loan with silk factories to set up cocoon shops to collect cocoons. Recently, news has emerged that a Shanghai banking group has also loaned 2 million yuan to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces to collect cocoons. However, the China Silk Company wants cocoons from improved breeds, not cocoons from native breeds. Therefore, these many loans are also loaned to silk factories and cocoon shops that specialize in collecting cocoons from improved breeds. And the native silkworm farmers cannot find places to sell their cocoons. In the past, there were many cocoon shops run by surplus cocoon merchants that could collect them, but now the surplus cocoon merchants have been abolished. Occasionally, a few silk factories collect them, but the prices must not be very high. And the native silkworm farmers who have neither obtained improved silkworm eggs nor obtained sericulture loans, what will they do? The reporter once asked the person in charge of the Zhejiang Silk Company about this matter. He said: Don't worry about them, they have their own ways. In the past, native silk per 100 taels once fell to 50,000 yuan, but now it has risen to 90,000 yuan, but this is the mystification of the native silk factories to lure farmers to sell. Once there are too many seeking to sell, it will plummet again. The farmers will always fall for this trick. I think watching most of the silkworm farmers be tricked and suffer losses is ultimately not a good strategy.

Eliminate the Suffering of Native Silk Silkworm Farmers

After the silk factories and cocoon shops collect the cocoons and reel the silk, they can entrust the China Silk Company to sell them abroad. If they do not go through the China Silk Company, they can also do so, but they must have the silk appraised by the company beforehand. Currently, the export market for improved silkworm silk has reached US$12.5 per pound, which is of course much stronger than native silk. The outlet for native silk is of course to weave silk fabrics. Before the war, silk fabrics were sold to Northeast China and Southeast Asia. Now, Northeast China is in chaos, and Southeast Asia is not yet stable. The outlet for native silk is only to weave silk fabrics and sell them cheaply. Because silk fabrics are cheap, the price of native silk will definitely decline.

The China Silk Company has also established a demonstration zone in Jiaxing and on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to cultivate mulberry trees, raise silkworms, dry cocoons, and reel silk. The Cooperative Business Administration is also holding cooperative cocoon drying in Jiaxing and other places. However, it is best to call on the native silkworm farmers to visit and learn a lot from these many businesses. At the same time, it is necessary to produce a large number of improved silkworm eggs in order to avoid the suffering of native silkworm farmers.

[Silkworm Treasures] The ones that need a deep sleep are getting it, the ones climbing the mountains are already there, and the ones that are about to sleep are getting ready. We do not want there to be a difference between "foreign treasures" and "native treasures" among the equally treated farmers. We want to see the "native treasures" also receive the benefits of improvement.

### Current Lifestyle in Britain

— Translated by Our Editorial Office

Although the clouds of war over Britain have dissipated for a year, the British feel that peaceful days are still very difficult, and in some ways even more difficult than before. During the war, people were content with less food rations, worn clothes, lack of housing, and many restrictions on life, but the current tension seems to make the British, who are known for their patience, a little impatient.

Like other European countries, Britain's most difficult problem to solve is food and housing. Since taking office last summer, the Labour government has encountered various difficulties, but the most unpopular thing to date is that it had to reduce its already meager food rations again due to the global food shortage not long ago. This sudden news seemed to shock British housewives to the point of breathlessness.

Egg Powder Shortage Makes Faces Gloomy

On the morning when Sir Smith announced that there would be no more egg powder on the market, passers-by on the streets all wore gloomy faces, reminiscent of the days when news from the front lines during the war was not going well. We remember that when this news was announced, the Security Council was fiercely debating the issue of British troops stationed in Greece, but nine out of ten newspapers paid attention to the news of egg powder, just as they paid attention to the great debate between Bevin and Vyshinsky. Although the Ministry of Food talked a lot about how cakes and puddings without eggs are just as good as those with eggs, and even hens can't tell the difference, with fresh eggs as precious as ostrich eggs, no woman would believe that the shortage of egg powder is not a major misfortune.

Although most people hoped that peace could loosen the belts that had been tightened for a long time, they are now convinced that these belts must be tightened even more than before. Bread is also in danger of becoming a problem. The unrationed bread that used to look like small hills in food stores is no longer visible. Every kitchen must save as much as possible, just as when German submarines were lurking in British ports.

All Rationed Goods Show a Declining Trend

The total fat ration, including butter, margarine, and lard, has been reduced to seven ounces per week, and the government has revealed ominous hints about the supply of sugar. The meat ration remains at one shilling and two pence (less than 25 US cents) per week, one-seventh of which must be taken in canned corned beef. The tea ration is two and a half ounces, only half an ounce more than in November 1944. On the other hand, the bacon ration was six ounces per week during the emergency period in 1944, but now it is only three ounces. Even the points for buying sundries such as canned food, dried fruit, fruit juice, and grains have been reduced from 24 points per month to 20 points. According to the scoring method, a can of fruit juice costs 16 points, and a can of meat costs 16 to 24 points, so it is not difficult to imagine the difficulty of choosing a few luxuries in the family. The reality is too far from the British imagined state of enjoying the blessings of peace while smoking a pipe. According to recent chemical analysis, the average Briton received 2,923 calories of food per day in 1944, but only 2,750 calories in 1945.

Food is Too Monotonous, Every Meal is Similar

Britain is a bit luckier than many other European countries. The food people get is enough to sustain life, but the unusual monotony of the food, the excessive amount of starch, and the lack of fresh fruit and desserts are beginning to make people impatient. In pubs, no matter how high you pay, this meal feels "almost" the same as the last meal. In cheaper places, there are many dishes on the menu, but in reality, they are just old tunes like bread and sausage, just with better-sounding names.

The menus in London restaurants are even more magnificent and look beautiful, but they taste very bland. Most of the cold dishes are chopped vegetables, and sometimes there may be roast meat, but it is often crossed out on the menu when you visit.

For people who cannot eat out, the problem is even more difficult. Old people who live solely on rationed food are almost in danger of approaching the starvation line. British women are struggling with nothing to put on the table to feed their hungry families three meals a day.

Buying Fish Requires Queuing, Which is Frustrating

Eating fish is one solution, but to buy fish, you have to queue for a long time, which is frustrating. In the eyes of housewives, today's cattle and sheep seem to be born without livers and kidneys, because it is not easy to see their traces in butcher shops. Chickens and any kind of poultry cannot be bought. Last year's apple harvest in Britain was not good, and there has been no fresh fruit in fruit stores since autumn. Occasionally there are a few oranges, but buying them requires deduction of ration points. In addition, there was a small batch of bananas that recently arrived. The surprise of the British when they saw bananas they hadn't seen for many years shows how tired they are of the monotony of their daily food. Mothers always glow when they buy bananas from the grocery store, as if they picked them from the banana tree themselves.

Housing Offices are Crowded with People Looking for Housing

In addition to being worried about food, Londoners are also worried about housing. In London, as in other bombed cities in Britain, finding a house to shelter from the wind and rain is a very tricky problem.

According to officials in charge of housing issues, the current situation is worse than when the Germans carried out blitzkrieg air raids. Because during times of tension, most of the population evacuated to the countryside, and the people who enlisted went to other places, so there was always a place to sleep. Now the evacuees have returned, the children have also returned, the shelters have been closed, and although the demobilization of the army can increase the number of construction workers, the line of applicants for housing is also increasing every day. Mobile housing is indeed available, but in the general situation of housing shortage, it is just a drop in the bucket.

For example, in London's poor Comberwell district, out of the 75,000 houses in the entire district, only 400 were not bombed and were completely undamaged. In the local housing offices, there are always many people sitting every day, waiting to meet with the person in charge, hoping to get a place to live.

Modest Families Still Have Old Furnishings

Many modest British families still have very old furnishings and have little way to decorate them more beautifully. The maximum limit for house repair expenses is still 100 pounds (equivalent to a little more than 400 US dollars). Additional amounts can only be obtained for absolutely necessary repairs. In the early spring sunshine, London still looks very dilapidated. The situation indoors is almost the same. Whether cotton or wool fabrics are rationed. No woman can find a way to replace the sofa with a new spring cover. The linen decorations on food cabinets and the like have been patched and repaired again and again in most homes. Bath towels were very large when they were new, but now they have been cut to the size of handkerchiefs. The problem of porcelain is easier to solve, but the quality is not good. Most of them are plain, heavy things. Staffordshire porcelain with large red roses, Sparta tea sets, and blue and white Wedgwood porcelain are all famous British products, but now they are only for export to reduce the strain on the national treasury.

The beautiful hats that women cannot live without are not subject to rationing restrictions, but they find it most difficult to buy underwear, socks, and shoes. Buying shoes is even more difficult. Although there are many stocks in the windows of shoe stores, a closer look reveals a small sign below: "This is a sample and is not for sale." Occasionally, a batch of goods is sold in shoe stores, but it is immediately bought up by women in line. British leather goods were very famous before the war, but the goods on the domestic market are very poor. Most shoe stores have changed to repairing shoes. The most headache for mothers is children's shoes. It is not easy to buy them. If you offer a lower price, you may sometimes buy things made of oilcloth and cardboard that break after wearing them for a short time.

Better Day by Day, National Belief is Stronger

The general life of the British is so difficult and serious, so a slight relaxation of restrictions has a good impact on the spirit of the people. Now, housewives can buy good-quality frying pans. Although wooden combs cannot be bought except from black market vendors, nail polish can be bought in stores. It is said that the wartime restrictions on women's clothing will also be lifted soon. Pockets, buttons, and pleats can be freely renewed. For the long-suffering British people, this kind of reduction in wartime restrictions is of course greatly appreciated.

In a typical British home in peacetime, life is not necessarily easy, but it is very stable. There are indeed many difficult things, but they all know that the situation will improve day by day. In the past, the British had absolute faith in the victory of the Battle of Britain, and this time their faith is still as firm. (Translated from the April issue of Collier's magazine)

Artificial Rubber Tires

A new type of artificial rubber tire is said to be as good as a natural rubber military tire. It is made from the government's special CR-S-10 artificial rubber. The thing that makes the rubber into a latex here is not fatty acid but resin, which is a very important factor. It makes the tire durable, the temperature does not rise easily when rotating, and it has greater power to reduce the rumble of the wheels.

Another factor is the design of the tire form. The part that touches the ground is larger than ordinary tires, which makes it roll more smoothly on the road. This is a big step forward. The increase in the contact surface can make the car body more stable, the weight distribution more even, and reduce the drag of the contact surface. (US News Agency)

### New Problems Arise After Restoration of Civil Administration: Reorganization of Hong Kong's Political System

— Our Hong Kong Telegraph Dispatch at 7 PM, Lin Youlan

Reuters, London, 1st: It is announced here today that the system of the British colony of Hong Kong will be amended as soon as possible on a more liberal basis. The British government is currently considering ways to allow Hong Kong residents, like those in other colonies, to assume a more important role in handling their own affairs. The British government has instructed the Governor of Hong Kong to consult with all sectors of society, study this entire issue, and submit a report as early as possible before the end of this year.

On the same day that the above telegram was sent from London, Hong Kong officially restored civil administration, which had been interrupted since Christmas 1941. The new Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Mark Young, arrived in Hong Kong by plane from England. At 10 AM on the 1st, an inauguration ceremony was held at the Governor's residence. Lieutenant General Sir Harcourt Butler, the former Governor of the military government of Hong Kong, read out the first proclamation abolishing the military government and lowered the flag before leaving. In past dispatches, this reporter has reported on the situation in Hong Kong on the eve of the restoration of civil administration and the brief history of the new Governor, Sir Mark Young. Now, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the issue of reorganizing Hong Kong's political system.

New Governor Sir Mark Young Announces Hong Kong Autonomy Plan

In his inaugural address, Sir Mark Young also mentioned a "plan to develop self-government for the people of Hong Kong," saying, "I dare say this" announcement "will satisfy all the people of Hong Kong." This is the "gift" that Sir Mark Young, "after experiencing the painful imprisonment under the Japanese army" (see Lieutenant General Sir Harcourt Butler's address), brought to the people of Hong Kong, and it is also the first step in his administrative plan. No wonder that the next day after the announcement, the Chinese and Western newspapers in Hong Kong published this startling news with the most important space.

The issue of Hong Kong's autonomy is not entirely new. In March of this year, the English-language "South China Morning Post" of Hong Kong published an article by Mrs. Stowe, wife of the former Hong Kong Colonial Secretary Sir Atholl MacGregor, in the United Kingdom, discussing Hong Kong's future. This enlightened British figure, who had learned from the Pacific War, told people that "British people returning to Hong Kong to carry out municipal administration in the future should treat the Chinese people with an attitude of friendship and understanding." She also said, "Hong Kong should no longer adopt power politics, and racial discrimination should be abolished, and unequal treatment and exploitation should be ended." She listed the "hopes" of Chinese people residing in Hong Kong as suggestions: "Expand the administrative and legislative bodies, allow Chinese people to participate, and establish a self-governing municipal council in Hong Kong, with councilors elected by the legal population."

"Simple Simon's" Counterattack Met with Rebuttals from "Local Youths"

After Mrs. Stowe's article was published in the South China Morning Post, it sparked a debate. A person named "Simple Simon" submitted a letter to the newspaper, presenting a direct objection, arguing that ordinary Hong Kong people would only be opportunistic and selfish, and did not have the moral values of serving the public, and were not yet qualified to talk about autonomy. "Simple Simon's" words were attacked by "A Hong Konger," "Local Youth," and "Local Youngster." After a while, the debate slowly subsided. Unexpectedly, Sir Mark Young traveled from afar and revealed to the residents of Hong Kong a new plan to reorganize Hong Kong's political system. Within three days, that "Simple Simon" again spewed nonsense in the South China Morning Post, alarmingly opposing Hong Kong's autonomy. He said that his remarks were "based on facts. After the people of Hong Kong participate in politics, I can foresee days of unprecedented corruption, racial discrimination, injustice, and struggle." He also said, "The vast majority of Hong Kong people belong to other ethnic groups. These people are still loyal to the United Kingdom because their motherland and the United Kingdom have not yet had disputes." Therefore, he specifically requested the British government to give this issue more consideration. Those absurd words of "Simple Simon" are truly "simple." Before Sir Mark Young came to Hong Kong, he spent countless hours "in London planning future measures with the British government, especially related to the issue of Hong Kong's autonomy" (see Lieutenant General Sir Harcourt Butler's address). Could it be that the minds of those Colonial Office officials are not as good as "Simple Simon's"?...

Rescuing This Wounded Region, Laying the Foundation for Cooperation Between China and Britain

Regardless of the views of the die-hard British or the enlightened British, there is only one way to "rescue this wounded region" and "lay the foundation for friendly cooperation between China and Britain" in dealing with the Hong Kong issue: that is, to simply return this island, which is inseparable from China, to China. Otherwise, any opinions are either meaningless or have ulterior motives. Hong Kong originally belonged to China. The people who should express genuine opinions on Hong Kong are not the million people of Hong Kong, but the 450 million Chinese people. On the day after London announced the reorganization of Hong Kong's political system and "soliciting the opinions of all sectors of society," Reuters in Shanghai sent out the following telegram: "As Hong Kong transitions to civil administration, outside the British Consulate General here today, someone wrote a request to return Hong Kong in chalk. According to one slogan: 'We want to take back Hong Kong, this is our island.'" This is the general opinion of the Chinese people on the Hong Kong issue. I wonder what "Simple Simon" and his ilk will think after hearing this?

### Reading "Understanding America"

— Author: Chen Jianheng, Distributor: Jianfan Bookstore, Publication Date: December, Year 34

Among our allied nations, the United States can be considered the closest. In the future, our country's revival and construction will greatly require the assistance of the United States. If we want to build a truly democratic, peaceful, unified, and united new China, we must achieve close cooperation with the United States in all aspects. At the same time, the United States, as former British Prime Minister Churchill said, "The position of the United States today is not only related to the future of China, but also to the entire world peace, and the United States truly has the power to determine world peace." From another perspective, the United States is the most advanced country in material construction, and its cultural progress and scientific development have also made great contributions to world culture. How should we understand the situation of this country? There is no more urgent need than today.

Most people only superficially understand the material civilization of the United States, only knowing that it is a country with the most abundant living enjoyment, or only narrowly learn about some social situations of the United States from Hollywood movies, but in fact, they neglect a comprehensive and systematic understanding. As for looking at the United States with colored glasses, that is even more incorrect.

Recently, the "Understanding America" book published by the Commercial Press completely takes an objective stance, analyzing all aspects of the United States' situation. It is a book worth reading. The author, Mr. Chen Jianheng, is currently a professor at National Central University. This "Understanding America" was written based on his observations in the United States and after consulting some famous books about the United States. In particular, G. S. Counts' "Social Foundations of Education" and C. H. Keyserling's "America Set Free" provided this book with many valuable materials. However, Mr. Chen emphasized the viewpoint of "Chinese people's understanding of America," and did not directly translate the original books, but carefully selected and adapted the parts of those famous books that are particularly needed by Chinese people. Therefore, I feel that this work is indeed not a waste of effort. The author allows us to recognize the true face of our allied nation from his book.

The scope of this book is very broad, and it discusses the American family system, material civilization, and their national character. In terms of economics and politics, it raises important issues such as free economy and collective economy, democratic thought and democratic government. The general situation of education and the spirit of education, and education and new democracy are discussed in detail in separate chapters without fear of being verbose. Finally, after explaining the United States' foreign relations and peace ideals, it is attached with a "Reference for the New China," which is a chapter very worthy of study. The author tells us how to digest democracy, reflect on our country from the current situation of the United States, and encourage the people of the country to welcome and catch up with this new democratic era.

If we want to truly understand America, we certainly cannot ignore the historical composition of its nation, the political, economic, and educational and cultural background. However, the United States is a scientifically advanced country, and the foundation of its founding lies in the development of its educational spirit. Therefore, we might as well use American education and culture as the core to understand its entire situation. Therefore, the author very much hopes that we can grasp an outline of American culture. He knows deeply that education and culture have a leading role in social transformation, so he specifically directs us to recognize the trends of new education in America. The title of the book is "Understanding America," and it is also named "The Educational Background of America," which is what it means. Although it is said that the various aspects of the United States are discussed with education and culture as the core, it does not neglect other social forms that determine the role of education and culture, such as political, economic, and social conditions. All those that affect the educational system are explained one by one.

We know that in the past twenty years or so, our country's education system has been most influenced by the United States. If we want to promote the relationship between the two countries, we cannot ignore cultural exchanges. People in general have doubts about American education, and even many people in Europe suspect the American educational system. After this war, everything that the national strength of the United States has demonstrated outwardly proves the success of American education. Regarding this point, Mr. Chang Daozhi has a very thorough view. The American educational system and facilities will undoubtedly become the mainstream of educational thought in the world. Therefore, even if they are not majoring in education, it is also very necessary to correctly understand the background of American education and culture and its general national conditions.

Now let me talk about the contents of this book. Chapter 1, The Evolution of the Family System, discusses how the self-sufficient agricultural family, the development of the West, and the development of industry broke up the old organization of the family. It then discusses the characteristics of the modern family. The two important topics of the women's self-awareness movement and the future of the family system are thoroughly reviewed in this chapter. Chapter 2, The Rapid Advance of Material Civilization, makes us admire the excellent weather and abundant resources of the United States, and even more amazed at their ever-changing science, the progress of production technology, and the development of transportation. Chapter 3 is also very important, and we can understand the characteristics of Americans and the natural and historical conditions that constitute these characteristics. What is shown here is a vibrant and enterprising national spirit of young people. The author says that this newborn national character belongs to young people, and he points out the American character: first, they are particularly interested in material things; second, they have naive and impulsive emotions; third, they are full of activity; fourth, they like concrete things; fifth, they value industrial and commercial ethics. Some regions of the United States seem to have some special habits, but in terms of the entire culture, they are unified: "Just as China and the Soviet Union cannot be divided into many small countries, the United States can integrate forty-eight states into a cultural system." Chapter 4 discusses the scope of free economy and collective economy. It first talks about the economic situation in the pre-industrial period, and then develops to economic liberalism from the rise of division of labor and markets. Because of the result of free competition, it reflects the defects of the free economic development: "The free development of the economic system has the following drawbacks: (1) instability of production; (2) imbalance between production and consumption; (3) waste of materials and power; (4) wasting natural resources." The gradually budding new trend of the economy is "(1) the union of industry and commerce; (2) the cooperation of agriculture; (3) the organization of labor; (4) the intervention of the government." From here, we can see that the American economy has a trend toward a collective economy. Chapter 5, Democratic Thought and Democratic Government, allows us to see the documents of democratic thought in American history. Coupled with a free and equal living environment, it is naturally easier to express their democratic spirit. However, the method of realizing democratic politics in the United States has already surpassed the laissez-faire individual competition. The method they use today to strive for freedom and happiness has gradually shifted from laissez-faire individualism to collective liberalism. "The government's control over the national production and consumption machine is actually derived from the people's will to seek life security." The establishment of a progressive and sound educational system is a necessary means to achieve an ideal democratic society, because since government intervention in private enterprises is necessary, the people must obtain the wisdom to supervise the government, which is all an educational issue. Chapter 6 describes the current situation of elementary, secondary, and university education facilities in the United States, and also permeates the spirit of freedom, equality, and child-centered education, explaining the new concept of education that Americans have—education as a right that everyone should have. Chapter 7, from the economic environment and the international environment, indicates that in the new era of democracy, education should take the realization of the happiness of all people as the premise, and the promotion of popular education and the increase of mass intelligence have become a new trend in the new era of democracy. Educational systems, facilities, curricula, and teaching materials must all be in line with the needs of this new era. Figures such as Dewey, Kilpatrick, and Judd have all advocated that teachers must be the leaders and implementers of social transformation. Chapter 8 talks about how the United States, from the early days of its founding after 1789, rose to become a world power, as well as the expansion of national power after the Spanish-American War, and the contributions it made in the two World Wars. From foreign relations, it talks about the ideal of peace, which is indeed the premise of the entire human race, and at least half of it is in the hands of the United States. The author powerfully pointed out: "We firmly believe that peace should eventually be the ultimate destination of mankind, and we hope that the two major peace-loving nations of China and the United States can join hands with all countries in the world to continuously strive for this highest ideal of mankind!"

Looking at this book "Understanding America" as a whole, although the author has never had subjective criticisms and opinions, some of the facts and materials cited in the book are indeed enough for us to understand the United States. At least, we can understand why the United States has become the initiator of determining world peace from the evolution of American culture. We hope that everyone can get the opportunity to reflect on themselves from the historical process of the development of American culture—to understand their own country by understanding America.

Today's China is facing famine and disaster, and the crisis of civil war is imminent. Due to the lack of materials, most people are struggling on the line of disease and death. The people's selfish mentality is deeply rooted in the country, morality is declining day by day, and education and culture are backward, science and technology are naive, resources cannot be developed, and the people's strength cannot be exerted. If this ancient nation wants to talk about regeneration and revival, it must absorb the democratic spirit and creative spirit of the still-young American nation. We must learn from the strengths of the United States with a humble attitude and welcome the new era of democratization and industrialization!

### Ai Qing's "On Poetry"

— Tong Fang

Publisher: New New Publishing House, Publication Date: April, Year 35, Shanghai Edition

After reading the modern poet Ai Qing's "Poems Dedicated to the Countryside," I obtained his recently published "On Poetry." On the cover, it is printed: "I don't know if mankind will ever live without poetry..." From this sentence, we have already seen the connection between poetry and human life.

This book cannot be said to be a systematic theory of poetry. It is a collection of several important articles on poetry. But after I finished reading it, I felt a surge of fervent vitality, the power of life, filling my whole body. I was deeply moved by the author's poetic, refined, and powerful words. I feel that this era needs poetry, poetry that calls out for the suffering people.

This collection includes five important topics: the first article, "On Poetry," is nearly seventy pages long. It is not a dissertation divided into chapters, but is written in the style of quotations, with vivid and powerful feelings about poetry, which is quite thought-provoking. This may be because the author is a poet, so he can write so refined and concise. From the general concept of poetry, the spirit of poetry, to thought, life, subject and theme, form, technology, image, imagery, symbolism, association, imagination, language, and creation, the author expresses his views and opinions on poetry in brief sentences. Among these, there is the essence of art, and it permeates the scientific creative method and the philosophical thinking process. Some aphorisms are simply the most progressive artistic theories, and they are very worthy of letting people think slowly. For example, "Anything that can make mankind develop upwards is beautiful, good, and poetic." "Philosophy thinks about the world abstractly; poetry explains the world concretely—the purpose is to transform the world." "The more it is about life, the more beautiful it is, the more it is about humanity, the more beautiful it is." "As long as human language does not become extinct, poetry will not become extinct." "Man exists, therefore man thinks." "Life is the most fertile soil from which art arises. Thought and emotion must spread their roots in its bottom layer." "Association and imagination are the journey of thinking." All contain the atmosphere of poetry and the profound meaning of philosophy. (Although this article on poetry is said to be in the style of quotations, it is not all short. Some are composed of more sentences to form a paragraph of thought. Although they are fragmented thoughts, you can also find the affiliation and connection of thoughts.)

The second article, "The Beauty of Poetic Prose," is a short essay that explains the connection between poetry and prose. The author believes that the most beautiful prose and poetry should be the most capable of reflecting life. Even if there is good rhyme without rich imagery, it is not enough to be beautiful. The third article, "Poetry and Propaganda," is a relatively long thesis. Regarding the evaluation of poetry, according to the author: "This article emphasizes: how it expresses people's wishes, the joys and sorrows of life, and the light of hope and lofty will emitted from the dim fate with sincere language and fresh images." He believes that all art, in its fundamental meaning, is propaganda, and only by not leaving propaganda can the artistic value of poetry be expressed. The author said: "Conscientious people should not be silent, but use the power attached to truth in our poems to destroy the dregs of those decadent worlds!" He also explains the task of poetry in general. The fourth article, "Poetry and the Times," emphasizes the poetry needed in the modern era and narrates the path that Chinese new poetry must take from the initial founding period of the May Fourth Movement to the imitation of Western metrical poetry, and then to the imitation of various schools of European and American modern poetry. The fifth article, "On Poets," again adopts the style of quotations, including seventy-five fragments of thought. There are passionate shouts and insightful hints in these. They are all moving sentences like poetry. How to be worthy of being a poet, and how a poet should complete his historical and social tasks, are all said very thoroughly in these random notes.

At first, I felt that this book was too much like "Quotations," or it needed some explanation. Later, I thought that these fragmented thoughts should be a little implicit, why say everything completely? Moreover, artistic theory (many of the theories in this collection are "aesthetic" theories) cannot be completely expressed anyway. It is also very necessary to allow readers to have more opportunities for thinking and exploration.

Finally, I hope that readers will use the mood and method of appreciating poems to think about this "On Poetry" that contains a lot of truth.

### News from Police Writers

— Xi Yi

Yu Xiuhao, the translator of "The Model American Police System" (published by Zhonghua Book Company), has in recent years also translated "Police Personnel Management" and "Police Outline" (both published by Commercial Press). After his forced departure from the Harbin Police Bureau this time, I wonder if he is still safe?

Zheng Zongkai, a nationally recognized authority on police officer education, has authored numerous works, such as "Revised General Theory of Police Law" and "General Theory of Police Mobilization" (both published by Commercial Press), "The Theory and Practice of Modern Police," "Police Officer Patrol Duty Theory," and "Fourth Edition Police Officer Case Handling Manual" (all published by Zhengzhong Book Company). The Chongqing editions are mostly sold out, and many bureau chiefs and senior police officers in various provinces and cities have a copy on their desks or in their drawers. In recent years, Zheng has retired to a certain national bank, and apart from a few key personnel who know Zheng is a police expert, hardly anyone notices him. It is said that Zheng was invited to a Sino-American program to hold an important position, but he politely declined; he also repeatedly declined the position of director of the Beiping Police Academy. He is currently staying in Beijing to recuperate. During the War of Resistance, Zheng edited the "Citizen and Police" weekly in Chongqing's Dagong Daily, which was loved and welcomed by the general public. It is said that Zheng also directs the "Citizen and Police" section published weekly in the Nanjing Peace Daily, and will host a nationwide police academic monthly magazine recently.

Lin Donghai, author of "Foreign Affairs Police and International Relations" (published by Commercial Press), has left Chongqing and headed east to serve in the diplomatic field.

### Introducing "Fog Enshrouded Chongqing"

— Xi Zeng Publisher: Wenjiang Bookstore Author: Zhu Lei

I happened to buy a few books in a bookstore, brought them home to read, and also happened to discover a beautifully printed novel "Fog Enshrouded Chongqing." I seemed to have an excessive fondness for it, and wanted to comment on it here. The story is quite ordinary: Wei Yuehan, a young man who studied automobile engineering in the United States, returned to China via Hong Kong before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. There, he met a newspaper reporter, Li, and the two hit it off immediately, becoming close friends. Through Li's introduction, he met Li's dream girl, Miss Yang. They met briefly, always separated, but they both left a good impression on each other. Later, Yuehan arrived in Chongqing, where his high expectations for his motherland led to great disappointment. He was trapped in the mountain city and became destitute. Soon after, Li also arrived in Chongqing and moved him into his own home, helping him find a job. Then the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and Miss Yang's entire family was trapped in Hong Kong, with no news of them. Both men secretly fell deeply in love with her, but neither expressed it. Three years quickly passed, and she suddenly returned to Chongqing after a difficult journey. A problem arose between the two men. Li greatly admired Yuehan, and his sympathy was aroused by his learning and his altruistic efforts. Li himself was an optimist, so he was willing to sacrifice love to fulfill friendship. Yuehan was deeply touched by Li's kindness, so he left without saying goodbye and joined the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India and Burma. Miss Yang, unable to forget their encounter in Hong Kong three years earlier, made a special trip to Kunming to find him. Although the two met, Yuehan clearly valued his career more than love. Soon after, he was transferred to Burma. Later, Yuehan found another opportunity to counterattack Chongqing, but unfortunately the plane was blocked by dense fog in the mountains and returned to Kunming. Miss Yang suffered several disappointments and suspected that Li was stirring up trouble behind the scenes. Love turned into hatred, and she resolutely married a third party. Sadly, at that time, this pair of friends in adversity, one was interviewing news in the Xiang-Gui area, and the other was killed in a sniper battle during the counterattack on Lashio.

After the war, Li finally understood all the misunderstandings between them. When he found an opportunity to explain to Miss Yang, it was all too late. He blamed the responsibility on the dense fog of the mountain city and the mysterious fate, and they wished each other well in their efforts for China after victory.

Generally speaking, the author's writing is a failure. The short three days in Hong Kong occupy almost half the book, and there is a hint of glibness everywhere. The latter half spans several years in time and several cities in space, and involves several historical facts of the War of Resistance. He finished it with a light touch using cinematic techniques, and some places are too concise, making the reader feel as if they have missed a sentence or two and experienced the vicissitudes of life. The author is probably used to writing plays (I have seen several of his one-act plays in the past, and the results were indeed not bad). He handles each paragraph with bold strokes, and the climax and rhythm are arranged very skillfully and naturally. However, novels have their own rules, and doing so inevitably makes people suspect that it is too coincidental and lacks flesh and blood.

In terms of writing style, the author seems to be a disciple of Mr. Shen Congwen, and traces of his imitation and plagiarism can be seen everywhere. For example, the talkative tea boy at the beginning is clearly stolen from "Eight Steeds." The section in the eighth paragraph where Miss Yang goes to Kunming to see Yuehan vaguely resembles some vivid tones and writing styles in "Ruyi." Of course, the author has his own intelligence and his own threats, and careless readers can easily overlook his imitation, but in my opinion, it feels a bit too blatant. I wonder what the reaction would be if Mr. Shen Congwen actually saw it?

The third shortcoming is that the personalities of the three protagonists are too vague. The author only cares about the development of the plot and does not delve into the portrayal of characters. Fourth, the author is too superstitious about fatalism, such as the old man's prediction in the letter, the omen of throwing water slices on the beach, and the mysterious fog in the mountain city in 1945. Although we dare not definitively deny fatalism, it seems inappropriate for a young author and seems contrived.

I'm sorry, I originally said I was praising him, but here I have assigned him many faults. Perhaps it is the meaning of "love too deeply, inevitably blame too strictly." In summary, the author has his own abundant imagination and his own talent for writing plays. His entire story is like a detailed film script, becoming more exciting as it progresses. The ending is especially deep and moving, and extremely clever. Let's not bother to consider its authenticity; at least the ending of this story is very successful.
