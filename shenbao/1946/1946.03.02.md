### The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee Opened Yesterday Morning; President Chiang Instructed the Direction of Efforts; the Entirety of Party Members to Complete Their Mission

[Our Newspaper Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] The Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Kuomintang was held at 9:00 AM on the first day in the auditorium of the Military Affairs Commission. A total of 269 people attended, including 194 Central Executive Committee members and 75 Supervisory Committee members. Chairman Chiang personally presided over the meeting and delivered the opening address, which was several thousand words long, and briefly stated: The Sixth National Congress and the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee entrusted us with five tasks: (1) to strive for victory in the War of Resistance, (2) to promote international cooperation, (3) to implement nationalism, (4) to complete democratic constitutionalism, and (5) to improve the people's livelihood. The first three items have already been completed, while the latter two items are the active goals of the Party and should be striven to be completed after this plenary session. He continued: There are four directions in which Party members should strive: (1) Party comrades should develop their individuality, do their best, and work hard in culture, economy, and local autonomy, and promote the progress of the country in these positions. (2) Party members should consider themselves as the vanguard of the people, and serving the people is their greatest duty, in order to increase the people's faith in the Three Principles of the People. (3) We must awaken Party members to cherish the revolutionary history of our Party and strengthen their faith in moral principles. (4) We must understand that now is a great opportunity for the fundamental reorganization and renewal of our Party, to become an ordinary political party on the one hand, and to maintain the spirit of the era of the Chinese Revolutionary Party on the other hand. After the instruction was completed, there was a fifteen-minute break, and then the preparatory meeting of the general assembly was held to determine the candidates for the presidium. The meeting adjourned at approximately 11:00 AM.

[Our Newspaper Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] The focus of discussion at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee will be the reform of the Party's policies. A group of young Central Committee members held a pre-meeting consultation in the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters on the first day, and fiercely discussed two issues: one was "to promote national spirit and eliminate bureaucracy", and the other was to eradicate bureaucratic capital. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to summarize the opinions of each person and make a proposal, which will be formally submitted to the general assembly.

[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] The presidium of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee held a meeting in the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters at 6:00 PM on the first day, and made decisions on the agenda of the general assembly and the list of chairpersons for each meeting.

### Full Text of the Opening Address

[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] President Chiang attended the Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee on the morning of the first day and delivered the opening address. The full text is as follows:

Comrades:

Today we are holding the Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of our Party. This is the first time that all comrades have gathered together after the victory in the War of Resistance, and I feel immense joy.

The task of the plenary session is to review past work, analyze the current situation, and determine the direction of future efforts. This plenary session is being held after the end of the victory in the War of Resistance, when restoration has not yet been completed and construction is about to begin. It is also on the eve of our decision to convene the National Assembly, promulgate the constitution, and implement constitutional government. Therefore, the task of this meeting is even more important. I believe that everyone will be able to conduct a thorough review of all aspects during the meeting in order to obtain accurate conclusions. Now, I would like to briefly share my personal thoughts and hopes with everyone.

Three Missions Have Been Completed, Two Major Tasks Are Being Promoted

This plenary session is nine months away from the closing of our Sixth National Congress and the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee. The National Congress entrusted the current Central Committee with five missions: (1) to strive for victory in the War of Resistance, (2) to promote international cooperation, (3) to implement nationalism, (4) to complete democratic constitutionalism, and (5) to improve the people's livelihood. The Central Committee has always been diligent and conscientious in seeking to realize these five missions. Three months after the closing of the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee, Japan surrendered unconditionally, and our country's more than eight years of arduous War of Resistance came to a victorious end. At the same time, the National Government has made great efforts to promote the international security mechanism, consolidate the permanent friendship of the Allied countries, and enhance mutual assistance and cooperation. In order to help the self-governance of ethnic minorities in the border areas and implement nationalism, we have also made concrete decisions based on the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. It can be said that the first three missions have been successively accomplished, and the two major tasks left are the implementation of democratic constitutionalism and the improvement of the people's livelihood. These two major events are the ultimate goals of the Party's revolutionary struggle, and they depend on the promotion of political construction and economic construction. However, economic construction and political construction are closely related political issues. Without a concrete solution, economic construction cannot proceed. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, we aimed to advance the War of Resistance and national construction at the same time. Therefore, after the end of the War of Resistance, I considered the current situation of the entire country and the urgent needs of the entire people, and decided on the policy of peaceful national construction. On the one hand, we overcame all difficulties, cleaned up the battlefield, restored order, and accelerated the work of restoration, so that the people could have the opportunity to recuperate. At the same time, we also put forward the two major demands of "nationalization of the army" and "democratization of politics", and called on the whole country to work together to promote its success. The specific opinions on the democratization of politics are: the early convening of the National Assembly, the participation of social elites and leaders of various parties in the government, the guarantee of people's freedom, and the recognition of the legitimate status of political parties. Regarding the nationalization of the army: the entire national army is subject to the state, and there are no longer private armies within our country, nor are there any armies of any one party. It is necessary to ensure that all national armies are subject to the state's organization and respect the unity of military orders and government orders. I explained this decision in detail in my speech on the Victory Day of September 3 last year. Comrades, I believe you have already seen it clearly.

Eliminate Difficulties and Obstacles with a Spirit of Utmost Fairness and Sincerity

We have conducted a long-term war of resistance for more than eight years with a weak country, and in the middle of the war of resistance, there were still crises of turmoil and division and factors of disturbance and strife. Therefore, we want to move from wartime to peacetime and carry out the work of restoration and construction, and we encounter particularly many difficulties and obstacles. I have always believed that these difficulties and obstacles can only be overcome with the greatest patience and eliminated with the spirit of utmost fairness and sincerity. We must also handle them in accordance with the principle of "political problems, solved by political means" in our previous resolutions, because the purpose of our National Revolution is to save the country and build the country. After the end of the War of Resistance, the success of national construction is related to the survival of the country, and the prerequisite for construction is unity and peace. The destruction and sacrifice of more than eight years of the War of Resistance are countless. The people are displaced and in pain, and they yearn to return to their hometowns and live and work in peace. Therefore, the most urgent need of the people is also peace and stability. After the end of the War of Resistance, the phenomena of all kinds of disturbances and disputes are unbearable to trace, but our wish to implement constitutional government and return power to the people has not been realized due to various difficulties and obstacles. Our national policy of peaceful construction cannot proceed smoothly because the whole country has not achieved sincere unity and true unity. This is a difficulty that we believe must be resolved, and it is also the responsibility of the revolutionary party of national construction that cannot be shirked.

Based on the above analysis of the situation, comrades can understand why we have consistently used political methods to resolve disputes in the past nine months, used consultations to stop military conflicts, and convened political consultative conferences. In order to realize the grand wish of convening the National Assembly and implementing constitutional government as soon as possible, in order to cherish the decline of national power and people's strength after the war, and in order to promote further unity in the country, we, on the one hand, recognized the legitimate status of various parties, and on the other hand, invited people from various parties and non-partisan social elites to hold a three-week political consultative conference to negotiate on the nationalization of the army, the democratization of politics, and various other aspects. As a result of the meeting, there were five items: (1) expanding the government organization, (2) the program for peaceful national construction, (3) military issues, (4) the National Assembly issue, and (5) the review of the draft constitution. Among these agreements, the most important spirit is that the Three Principles of the People of our Premier Sun Yat-sen were unanimously supported and followed, and our government was even more sincere and mutually trusting at the consultative conference. Without violating revolutionary doctrines and without shaking the national legal system, we did not hesitate to change the overall view of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings on the procedures for national construction in order to obtain the opportunity for peaceful national construction. This is a painstaking effort of our Party for the country and the people, which all comrades must deeply understand.

Mutual Encouragement During the Transition Period, Preparing for the Implementation of Constitutional Government

The above-mentioned agreements, the draft constitution, are being reviewed, and the issue of nationalization of the army has been agreed upon by the military three-person group on the basic plan for reorganizing the army and incorporating the Communist army into the national army. It only awaits implementation as scheduled. We hope that all parties can be sincere and consistent, for the sake of the country and the people, so that the country can embark on the road of peaceful construction, unity, and democracy. I feel that as long as the peace and unity of the country are guaranteed, and the country can have a foundation for long-term stability, we should all do our best to promote its success. The ancients said, "Sincerity can move mountains." Our Party must first be sincere and trustworthy. I believe that we can certainly move other parties with a sincere heart and create strong mutual trust to facilitate the progress of national construction.

I would also like to state to all comrades that the simultaneous advancement of the War of Resistance and national construction has always been our established national policy, and the early implementation of constitutional government and the return of power to the people has always been our consistent wish. Our Party said, "After our country implements constitutional government, each political party must engage in open political competition in a peaceful manner before public opinion, which is in accordance with the spirit of democracy." The current transitional stage is precisely the period when we and various parties are observing and encouraging each other in order to create a democratic model. We must prepare for the implementation of constitutional government. We must be on an equal footing with all political parties, but our Party still has the special obligation to defend doctrines and protect the Republic of China. Our Party's status is slightly different from what it was before the end of the War of Resistance, and before the implementation of constitutional government, we cannot abdicate our responsibility to the country in terms of legal principles and facts. Therefore, this plenary session should conduct a thorough review of the direction of our Party's future efforts. I think the following points should be particularly emphasized:

Shift the Direction of Work to Lead the People in Construction

First, we must shift the direction of our party members' work and encourage our comrades to develop their individual abilities and strengths and work hard in cultural undertakings, economic undertakings, and local autonomy work. In these positions, we can promote the progress of national construction, which is also the way to train our own progress.

Second, we must enable every party member to recognize that being the vanguard of the people and serving the people is the greatest duty of a revolutionary party member. Regardless of what position they hold, they must always and everywhere, first be diligent and laborious, and lead the people to engage in construction undertakings. At the same time, we must do our best to relieve the suffering of the people and increase the interests of the people. Only in this way can we deepen the people's faith in the doctrines of our Party.

Third, we must awaken our party members to cherish the revolutionary history of our Party and strengthen their faith in implementing the doctrines. Every success in our Party's 50 years of revolutionary struggle has been due to the determination to sacrifice ourselves and the spirit of continuous self-renewal. Now that we are facing a great period of national construction, we must further promote the great cause of our predecessors and actively move forward to complete the entire task.

Fourth, we must understand that now is a great opportunity for our Party to fundamentally reorganize and refresh itself. On the one hand, we must be an ordinary political party, and on the other hand, we must maintain the spirit of the era of the Chinese Revolutionary Party to strengthen our Party's organization. Therefore, the organization must be streamlined, the discipline must be more strict, the steps must be unified, and the work must be more vigorous.

The above points are important principles. As for how to correct past shortcomings, how to achieve the goal of strengthening our Party, and how to enable our Party to adapt to the current new environment and fulfill our natural duties to the country and the nation, I hope that all comrades will concentrate and discuss them. In short, we must seize this once-in-a-millennium opportunity for national construction, and we must be invigorated and vigilant, and strengthen ourselves so as not to be ashamed of being a follower of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, and to achieve our sacred mission of maintaining the fruits of victory and completing the national revolution.

### The Number of National Representatives Will Continue to Increase

[Our Newspaper Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] It is reported that the relevant parties are continuing to discuss increasing the number of National Representatives. It is estimated that 70 representatives will be added from the Northeast provinces, 17 from Taiwan, 20 from women's groups, 10 from the army, and 3 each from Xinjiang, Xikang, and Chongqing provinces and cities. The total number will be increased by 150. The method of selection and addition is expected to be announced within a few days.

[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] The National Government ordered on the 1st: (1) Appoint Shao Lizi as a member of the Preparatory Committee for the National Assembly. This order. (2) Appoint Zhang Lisheng as the Director of the General Office for the Election of Representatives to the National Assembly. This order.

### Management of the Lushun Military Affairs Commission; Our Participating Personnel Will Be Designated Soon; The United States Prepares to Restore Consulates in Shenyang, Harbin, and Dalian

[Our Newspaper Beiping Dispatch, 1st] According to sources: (1) The Sino-Soviet Military Affairs Commission for the Management of Lushun has begun preparations. The Northeast Headquarters will designate personnel to participate in the commission. It is reported that the designated personnel will first go to Chongqing to negotiate with the Soviet side, and then go to Lushun. (2) Most of the old and weak troops of the Soviet army in the Northeast have been transferred back to their country. It is said that the soldiers who came to take over the defense were transferred from Poland, and they are all very young. At present, the total number of Soviet troops in the Northeast is more than before. (3) The Communist army in the Shenyang and Yingkou areas has shown signs of retreating to Dunhua. A spokesman said: The Communist army is launching an offensive near Zhangwu in northern Liaoning and He'an in the south.

[United Press Washington Dispatch, 1st] The US State Department said today that the US consulates in Shenyang, Harbin and Dalian will be restored as soon as it is feasible. A State Department spokesman declined to comment on reports from Chongqing that three US diplomats were in Chongqing waiting to reopen the three consulates within the next ten days, and declined to comment on the approximate date.

### The Cocktail Party Was Full of Optimism; The Northeast Conflict Can Be Resolved; Issues Other Than Military Reorganization Are Being Discussed

[Our Newspaper Beiping Urgent Telegram, 28th] The volatile Northeast issue seems to be optimistic again. Zhang Zhizhong affirmed at the cocktail party hosted by the three members of the Mediation Executive Department tonight: The Soviet Union will definitely withdraw its troops, and it will be soon. The Northeast military issue, due to the establishment of the reorganization and unified reorganization plan, has solved half of the problem, and the remaining problems have begun to be discussed. It is believed that an agreement will be reached and announced after returning to Chongqing this time. Zhou Enlai also said: Regarding the Northeast issue other than military reorganization, the Communist Party and the government have begun to contact each other. The Executive Department may send some personnel to the Northeast to preside over the work of stopping conflicts and restoring transportation. When asked whether the Northeast military reorganization and mediation work will begin before or after the Soviet army withdraws, Zhou replied, "This question is too specific, I cannot answer." When asked for his opinion on the Soviet Union's withdrawal of troops from the Northeast, he replied: "The Communist Party and other parties jointly requested the government to announce the truth about Sino-Soviet negotiations, but the government did not announce it." Subsequently, a reporter asked him for his opinion on the Sino-Soviet economic negotiations. Zhou replied: "I do not know the inside story and cannot answer."

Zhang Zhou Ma Flew Yesterday to Jining and Zhangjiakou

[United Press Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 1st] Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai flew to Zhangjiakou and Jining today. They were quite pleased by the guarantee from the Communist leaders that they would "immediately and completely obey" any orders from the three-person committee. The three changed to a G47 transport plane for this trip and landed at a small airfield facing wind and snow. Consultations were held in the cabin. The Communist side made a promise of full cooperation to the three-person committee. The persons making this promise were Liu Jun, deputy director of the Jicha Jin Political District of the Communist Party, and He Long, a Communist army general in the Sui Jin area. According to He Long, he is prepared to immediately disband his well-trained army of 70,000 men upon receiving orders from the three-person committee. Most of these men are farmers and can return to their hometowns to farm. After the three arrived here, the Communist leaders again complained to them that the Central Army had attacked the towns occupied by the Communist army. Liu Jun also said: The general situation today is still peaceful except for minor conflicts. When Japan collapsed, the Communist army in the Jicha Jin area sent "thousands" of people into the Northeast, and they still remain in the area. Because the people of the Northeast are eagerly awaiting Chinese troops, the Communist Party sent troops there. However, the Jicha Jin Political District has no contact with the Soviet army in the Northeast. As for whether other Communist military regions have contact with the Soviet army, he cannot say. Marshall and his party listened to the reports of the executive groups in Zhangjiakou and Jining, which were "extremely encouraging." Zhangjiakou is like an armed barracks, and armed men are everywhere. Communist leaders invited Marshall to a banquet at the headquarters, which was guarded by soldiers with US-made light machine guns. Marshall and his party are scheduled to depart tonight and return to Beiping, and continue to Jinan and Xuzhou for inspections tomorrow.

[United Press Jining Dispatch, 1st] Special Envoy Marshall flew to the airfield here today. Because the means of transportation to the city were more than a mile away, and there was only one jeep, he convened an international conference of the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party, and the United States in the plane. The participants sat on the hanging chairs of the plane and talked for an hour. Marshall then said, "The hanging chairs of the G47 plane have various uses, and now they serve a new purpose."

[Our Newspaper Beiping Dispatch, 1st] Director of the Headquarters, Li Zongren, hosted a banquet tonight to entertain Zhang Zhou Ma.

Several Major Issues Are Waiting to Be Decided in Chongqing

[Our Newspaper Beiping Dispatch, 28th] Ma Zhang Qing will complete the inspection of North China and return to Chongqing before the closing of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, and discuss several major issues with the central authorities. General Gillem came to Beiping with Marshal Ma. This three-star general, who had good cooperation with the Soviet army to cut off the retreat of the German army on the Baltic Sea, will take on practical and important work in the Mediation Executive Department. The reporter judges that his participation in the Executive Department may be a sign that the work of the Executive Department will be extended to the Northeast. At the cocktail party tonight, Zhou Enlai introduced the senior staff of the Executive Department to Gillem one by one. Zhou also praised General Gillem's brilliant achievements in Europe and his scholarly demeanor. At present, the work of the Mediation Executive Department still has difficulties, such as the recent Baoding conflict. Today, Ye Jianying frankly told reporters that some Communist troops in various places also want to take small advantages and occupy a few more villages, but the Executive Department will effectively stop them. Therefore, there is no doubt that the cessation of conflict will be completely successful. As for the issue of restoring transportation, the reporter informed that the railway between Tai'an and Yanzhou was already being repaired by the Communist army, and the same was true between Zhangdian and Boshan on the Jiaoji Railway. However, they all sent their own directors and management personnel. As for the Jinpu, PingSui, and PingHan railways, to this day, the Communist army in various places has not received official orders and has not started work. Ye Jianying explained this by saying that many transportation teams have not yet been sent out, so the restoration work has not yet actually started.

The Chairman Personally Visited the Family of Li Liejun

[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 1st] Chairman Chiang personally went to the residence of the late Committee Member Li Liejun at 4:00 PM on the 28th to offer condolences and visit his family.

### Zhang Zhizhong Talked in Beiping; There Is No Problem in Yining

The Reconciliation Annex Will Be Signed Soon

[Our Newspaper Beiping Dispatch, 28th] The issue of the people of Yining in Xinjiang demanding local autonomy can be resolved soon. General Zhang Zhizhong told our reporter: The annex to Article 10 of the plan for a peaceful solution to the Yining issue (ie, the second annex to the plan), which he formed with the Yining representatives, will be signed by him soon. Therefore, the so-called Yining incident will not be a problem. The Northwest Headquarters will govern the four provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. Whether the two provinces of Suiyuan and Shaanxi are included is still under consideration by the government. When he will go to Lanzhou and when the headquarters will be established have not yet been determined.

### The China National Aviation Corporation in Kunming Temporarily Suspends the Sale of Passenger Tickets

[Our Newspaper Kunming Dispatch, 28th] The Kunming Central Airlines Corporation has been ordered to temporarily suspend the sale of passenger tickets on all routes from March 1. Most of the aircraft are concentrated in Chongqing, in addition to being used for returning to the capital, and also for transporting equipment for the Ministry of Communications.

### New Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Bei Zuyi, Assumes Office Yesterday and Delivers Important Speech on Opening Foreign Exchange

[Our Report] The newly appointed Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Bei Zuyi, (see photo), accompanied by President Song, went to the Central Bank on the Bund at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to assume his duties. President Song summoned all senior staff of the bank for a speech and introduction, stating that the Central Bank was founded by the late Premier, and that he was ordered to prepare for its opening at that time. The capital was only 3,200 silver dollars, and the scale was very small. Later, it was only through gradual and painstaking management and planning that it was able to reach today's scale. Mr. Bei is a senior figure in the financial industry and a director of the Central Bank, with particular experience in foreign exchange matters. Therefore, it is deeply believed that he will be able to make great achievements in the future. Subsequently, Dai Mingli, representative of the Ministry of Finance, and Xu Jiguang, representative of the guests, delivered speeches successively, expressing their unlimited expectations for the future development of the Central Bank's business and Mr. Bei's appointment to the important position. Then, Mr. Bei delivered a reply, briefly stating that President Song had put in a lot of effort for the post-war economic recovery of our country, which he was well aware of. Now, because the foreign exchange problem urgently needs to be resolved, he was ordered to assume office first and will formally take office at a later date. In the future, the handling of foreign exchange affairs will be carried out in accordance with the regulations of the central government, and he hopes that everyone will provide assistance. Finally, Chen Xing, Deputy Governor of the bank, delivered a speech, emphasizing the difficulties in the establishment of the bank and hoping that all colleagues would continue to work hard to make the Central Bank the bank of banks.

Furthermore, after Mr. Bei assumed office, he announced the appointment of Lin Fengbao as the Director of the Business Bureau of the bank and Lin Weiyi as the Director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the bank. Those who went to congratulate Mr. Bei on his assumption of office yesterday morning included Mayor Qian, Song Hanzhang, Xu Weiming, Liu Gongyun, Zhu Runsheng, Hu Yunqiu, Wang Zhixin, Xu Xueyu, Gu Yiqun, Yang Yinpu, Qin Runqing, Wu Weiru, Liu Hongsheng, Du Yuesheng, He Dekui, Yang Zhixiong, and managers of foreign banks such as Citibank, Chase Manhattan, and Mercantile Bank.

Bei's Remarks

Our reporter specially visited the newly appointed Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Bei Zuyi, yesterday. He asked many questions about the Central Bank's opening of the foreign exchange market and the resumption of free trading. Mr. Bei answered in detail, which can be summarized into three points as follows: (1) The Central Bank will not "list prices" for gold and foreign exchange this time. The prices of foreign exchange and foreign currencies will be determined by observing market conditions. When necessary, measures will be taken to balance them. In the future, the Central Bank will supply, sell, or purchase foreign exchange through foreign exchange brokers, depending on the needs of the market. (2) The names and numbers of banks designated to engage in foreign exchange business will be announced approximately today. As for the banks, silver firms, and money houses approved to operate under Category A and the travel agencies approved to operate under Category B, there are no special qualifications or quotas for the application of these two types of firms. However, only those who have genuinely engaged in this type of business in the past will be considered. As for the approved foreign exchange brokers, it will also depend on whether they have actual import and export business to do. Those who have relied solely on speculative trading will not be considered. In addition, the period of operation for the approved Category A and B firms and foreign exchange brokers is limited. Only those who have shown good performance during the period will be allowed to continue operating; otherwise, their operating qualifications will be revoked. (3) The government's allocation of US$500 million as legal tender reserve this time is a portion of the Central Bank's existing foreign exchange fund. It is different from the organization and methods of the previous equalization fund. The previous one was relatively fixed, while the current one focuses on the balance of international payments. It will be used well in an open market trading manner, so that the national trade mechanism can be brought into order, and international trade is also expected to be facilitated, in order to complete our country's economic recovery plan.

### Military Institutions in North China to Maintain Status Quo Temporarily

[Our dispatch from Peiping, 1st] Authorities in the war zone stated that the military institutions in North China will maintain the status quo temporarily. Before the situation is thoroughly clarified, organs such as the Chief Executive's Office cannot be abolished. Bai Chongxi came to Peiping to convey the government's intention to restore and reorganize the army, but it is difficult to start immediately at present. Sun Lianzhong told reporters that he hoped the provincial government would postpone the move to Baoding, as the housing there is extremely scarce. The Hebei provincial government will also temporarily maintain the status quo in accordance with the ceasefire order.

### Students in Wuxi Hold Demonstration Parade

[Our dispatch from Wuxi, 1st] More than 10,000 students from major middle and elementary schools in Wuxi held a demonstration parade at 9:30 a.m. on the 1st to respond to the patriotic movement to protect rights. They issued a declaration and shouted slogans along the way, parading throughout the city for three hours. The mood was enthusiastic, and they dispersed at noon.

### Severe Disaster in Western Yunnan, Central Government Handles Relief

[Our dispatch from Kunming, 28th] The central government recently determined that the 50,000 square kilometer area in western Yunnan suffered severely from enemy devastation. It decided that the Relief Administration would set up an office in western Yunnan and send Xu Songjiu to preside over the matter. Mr. Xu is scheduled to go to western Yunnan in early March to prepare for setting up the office.

### From Shanghai to Qinhuangdao [I] Our Special Correspondent in the Northeast

— By Our Special Correspondent in the Northeast, Han Qingtao

— Six Days at Sea with the Northern Expedition Army —

One morning at sunrise, four American naval landing ships, each carrying 4,000 tons, loaded with our batch of young new soldiers, sailed away from Shanghai. Seagulls soared and glided, expressing their enthusiasm for farewell and protection, never leaving this large ship heading overseas.

Rising light, the Bank of China building and the Broadway Mansions, moved away from us, slowly becoming blurred, and soon disappeared. Then, the chimneys of the Yangshupu factories and the Jiangwan airfield approached and receded, until the ship left the Wusongkou, and the Yangtze River's current sent us into the vast ocean.

This happened on the morning of February 19th. The young soldiers on board were part of the 207th Division. They came to Shanghai from Qujing in the Great Southwest, walking, riding in cars, and sailing on ships. Now, they were departing from Shanghai to the Northeast, which had been away from the motherland for fourteen years. The reporter joined these enthusiastic troops to see our elders, uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters in the Northeast.

The four American ships that helped us with the transportation followed each other closely, moving forward. The reporter was on the first ship, number 596, but unfortunately, due to mechanical damage, it had to say goodbye to the other three ships and return to the Wusongkou alone, docking at the Jiujiang Wharf to wait for a replacement ship.

The next morning, the same type of landing ship approached, number 714. The iron gate at the front of the ship opened, and people boarded the deck. Ammunition, guns, bedding, flour, and rice were moved from the original ship to the other ship by this group of active young soldiers. After a day and a half of moving, the transfer was completed. On the morning of the 21st, the newly replaced landing ship hoisted various flags and brought this group of young troops back on the journey, the only difference being that it became a lonely boat without companions.

The brave young soldiers were mostly students and civil servants from the rear areas, lively, strong, and eager to learn. Everyone scrambled to read books and newspapers, and sometimes they still read silently while on guard duty. In many cases, everyone called each other "classmate," which became a popular story in the military. The shipboard life was the same this time. Most of them had not seen the vast ocean, so they were eager to experience its beauty. However, to their disappointment, the first half of the day's journey was spent floating in the turbid waters of the Yangtze River.

In the evening, the bright red sun sank into the sea, and the tide came in. The ship began to shake, swaying left and right more and more violently. The people eating dinner on the deck seemed drunk, unable to stand firmly, staggering and struggling to reach their intended destinations. Then, people in the cabins and on the deck began to vomit, "Wah, wah," spreading to every corner.

The center of gravity of the landing ship was at the back, with the command tower and heavy objects located there, so the front was light and the back was heavy. People were in the front, and the draft was shallow, so even without encountering stormy waves, the angle of lateral tilt was quite large, causing everyone to fall, get up, and vomit continuously. This chaotic scene continued for three hours. Around 9:00 p.m., the ship stopped shaking much, and everyone fell asleep in a daze. Everything fell into silence. In the quiet night sea, only the moon, showing half her face, accompanied this lonely boat on its voyage.

Shining light, clear sky, boundless green, the waves rushing beside the ship, making a rustling sound, rolled up on the clear water like milky foam. The wind was calm and the waves were gentle, and the scenery was exceptionally beautiful and fresh. Everyone seemed to have stepped out of a nightmare into another world of peace and happiness. Only then did they feel the greatness and intimacy of the sea. Happy expressions were on the faces of every brave soldier who saw the sea for the first time. This was the second day of the voyage.

Praise and singing. After ten hours, everyone began to feel a little lonely. Just then, a black dot appeared on the distant northwest sea. The signal light of the command tower on the ship immediately began to contact that black dot. After half an hour, an American medium-sized warship approached us and then led the voyage in front. Soon, another one came from behind, so one in front and one behind performed escort duties. The formation of the convoy filled everyone with great joy.

At dusk, the warship behind us left. Everyone was wary of the threat of the wind and waves they had experienced yesterday. Some ate less, and some lay down early. The largest waves only caused back-and-forth and up-and-down shaking, without lateral swaying, because the ship was traveling north, encountering head-on north-bound waves, so everyone was spared further suffering.

After a night of sleep, the weather had changed to a gloomy appearance, making people feel a little depressed. The young soldiers practiced some platoon exercises on the ship to avoid wasting time. After the course was over, they mostly leaned against the railing on the deck and looked out. Where the ship passed, the blue water boiled and rolled upward, and in the distance, the waves surged, covering the entire ground. In addition, there were the clouds in the sky and dozens of low-flying seagulls.

The sky became even more gloomy and heavy. It drizzled at night, and the waves became even bigger, still attacking head-on. The ship had entered the Bohai Strait, and everyone was somewhat accustomed to life at sea, so they did not feel too uncomfortable.

In the morning, there was a thick fog. The ship turned to tilting left and right again. Fortunately, the fog dispersed and the sun came out, and the swaying gradually decreased. Around 9:00 a.m., the escort warship in front bid farewell to us and turned towards Dagu, because Qinhuangdao was already in sight, and its escort mission was completed.

The seawater had changed from blue-green to light green, and Qinhuangdao's mountains responded to us, and the harbor was clearly visible. More than a dozen warships and transport ships were arranged in the port. The railway station, glass factory, iron factory, power plant, and urban buildings were all in front of everyone.

The port had beautiful mountains and clear waters. The wharf extended into the sea. Several large ships were docking with coal trains, carrying coal from Tangshan to Shanghai and other places. The chimneys of the factories emitted black smoke, and the roar of the locomotives rose and fell. Trains and wharf trams traveled between the port. Everyone felt great excitement and joy. The 714 landing ship that carried the young soldiers north docked at the wharf amid everyone's cheers. The time was 11:00 a.m. on the 24th.

Qinhuangdao's prosperity largely relies on the wharf. Kailuan Coal Mine uses this as an outlet, and other mines waiting to be developed include iron and arsenic. In terms of industry, there is the "Yaohua Glass Factory," whose products sell well in North China and are praised by many. There is also an iron factory, which belongs to the coal mine and is strictly used as a place to repair machinery.

### US Prepared to Use Force to Stop Aggression If Necessary, No Right to Station Troops in Other Countries Without Consent, Will Not Allow Any Country to Dominate the World

Powerful Speech by Byrnes

US Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a powerful speech to the Overseas Press Club in Washington on the 28th, addressing the world. The full text is approximately 5,000 words. The gist can be summarized as follows:

(1) Prepared to use force to stop aggression if necessary.

(2) Only an unforgivable mistake between the US and the Soviet Union could cause a serious conflict.

(3) No country has the right to station troops in the territory of other independent countries without approval or consent.

(4) No powerful country can arbitrarily take enemy property as its own in liberated countries or countries that have sided with the enemy.

(5) Will not allow any country to dominate the world.

[United Press International, Washington, 1st] The strict new diplomatic policy clarified by Byrnes has in fact foreshadowed that the United States will make a final resolution with Moscow on the deployment of the Red Army in the key areas of Europe and Asia. It has also made it clear that the United States will take a serious direct approach to the Soviet Union's policy of arbitrarily taking property in liberated countries. It is generally believed here that Byrnes's declaration in New York is a prelude to the US government's policy towards the Soviet Union.

### Full Text of Byrnes's Speech

[US Information Service, New York, 28th] Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a speech to the Overseas Press Club here tonight. The full text is as follows:

How to Ensure Peace

We have begun to understand that the war is over, sons, husbands, and fathers have returned home, and when we open the newspaper, we are no longer afraid that the names of our relatives will be found on the list of deaths. This is such a good thing. But now is not the time for complete celebration and joy. When families in villages and cities often listen to their children recounting the battles of Normandy and Iwo Jima after dinner, each of them has a question in their hearts that is not spoken. This question is, how can we be sure that there will never be war again? In the past during the war, our goal was very clear, our goal was victory. Of course: industrial mobilization and military mobilization were the most important issues, production stalemates often seemed impossible to break, transportation difficulties and labor shortages seemed impossible to overcome, and on the front lines, the intricate and complex actions of joint land, sea, and air operations were daunting. These were all arduous tasks, but we only needed to ask: "Does this help victory?" The common goal of victory united us and gave our efforts purpose and leadership.

Now we have reached a state of calm, our comfort and gratitude are mixed with anxiety. Our current goal is lasting peace, and we are pursuing lasting peace even more urgently than we sought victory before. The difficulty is that the road to lasting peace is not as easy to see and find as the road to victory. When we encounter any problem, the first thing we need to ask is: "Does this help peace?" If the answer to this question comes slowly, or even if there is no answer, then we begin to feel uneasy and fearful. Although we have many things that we are uncertain about, there are several basic covenants that we are very clear about.

Two Basic Theorems

One is that the result of victory is not necessarily a just and lasting peace? But victory has given us the opportunity to establish such a peace, and our lives depend on whether we can make full use of this opportunity.

Another thing we know for sure is that we Americans alone cannot determine whether the world will live in peace or be destroyed in war? Peace does not depend on us alone, but also on others. No country is the complete master of its fate, we are all in the same boat.

Because we know this, we have pinned our hopes on the flag of the United Nations. We cannot be satisfied just because we have joined this organization. We know that although we place the world's dreams on the United Nations, it will fail unless each member state has the conviction and determination to give the United Nations life and to make it play a role in concrete cases and all daily affairs.

### No Right to Station Troops in Other Countries Without the Other Party's Permission

During the first few meetings of the United Nations, the representatives made frank and straightforward remarks. The purpose of these initial meetings was only to establish the various institutions of the United Nations, but among the issues submitted to the Security Council for discussion, several were very urgent and needed to be resolved even before the Council had the opportunity to adopt provisional rules and procedures.

The proceedings of the meetings in London were not completely quiet and peaceful. Some people attempted to use the United Nations to promote selfish national goals, but the conflict of national interests and goals reflected in the debates in London is very similar to the conflict of local and special interests reflected in our national and state legislatures. Of course, we do not approve of these conflicts of interest, but since these conflicts exist, it is best to express them openly. If these conflicts of interest are not raised in the discussion meetings of the United Nations, then these discussion meetings will lose their effectiveness and end up being in vain.

When the governments of Syria and Lebanon filed complaints requesting the withdrawal of British and French troops from their territories, and the Security Council completed its discussion of these complaints, a very important precedent had been established. The Council did not take formal action because the permanent members had divergent opinions on the form of the resolution, but no country doubted the general proposition: that no country has the right to station troops in the territory of that independent country without the other party's permission. No country opposed applying this proposition to the aforementioned pending case. The special solution proposed by US representative Stettinius in accordance with this meaning was supported by the majority of the members of the Council, but was not accepted because the Soviet Union considered it not clear enough and rejected it. However, the British and French governments immediately declared that regardless of the Soviet Union's technical veto power, they would definitely comply with the US proposal, because this proposal clearly represented the opinion of the Council.

This is sufficient to show that even if a permanent member of the Council exercises its legal veto power, in fact, no country, whether large or small, can be relieved of its moral responsibility to act in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.

The United Nations has had a good start, but this does not mean that its success has been guaranteed. It only means that if the people of the United Nations are determined to make the United Nations Charter effective, then it will be effective.

Adhere to the Covenant of the Charter

Sometimes our Congress also makes serious mistakes of excess or deficiency. These mistakes are not the mistakes of the Congress's own system, but the mistakes of the congressmen or its constituents, because they have not fulfilled their responsibilities.

The same is true of the institutions of the United Nations. It will only succeed when we, the people of the United Nations, can fulfill our responsibilities.

If I were to tell you that the world situation today is healthy or can be put at ease, then I would not be frank enough. We are surrounded by suspicion and distrust, which in turn breed suspicion and distrust.

We have jointly established a covenant to not use force except to defend the laws specifically stipulated in the "Charter" labels and purposes. We sincerely abide by this covenant, but since we are a great power and a permanent member of the Security Council, we certainly have the responsibility to use our power to make other countries abide by this covenant. We are also willing to assume this responsibility. Unless all the great powers are prepared to act to defend the law, the United Nations cannot prevent war. We must make it clear in advance that we will indeed act to prevent aggression, and at the same time make it clear that we will not use force for other purposes.

The great powers have been given special responsibilities, because if they are willing to maintain peace, they have the power to maintain peace. This weight of power between countries is such that any one of them wants to destroy peace. Even if other countries can unite to defend the Charter, it still cannot be easily destroyed. The current weight of power between the great powers is sufficient to prevent any one of them from dominating the world. This weight of power cannot be practically changed by any great power's unilateral action, otherwise it will extremely disrupt the entire structure of the United Nations. Therefore, if we want to do our part to maintain peace, we must maintain our strength to do so, and we must make it clear that we will definitely unite with other great powers in defending the Charter.

If we want to be a great power, we must act like a great power. This will not only ensure our own security but also maintain world peace.

### Maintaining Armed Forces is Absolutely Not to Engage in Aggression

Although we long for universal disarmament, and we are prepared to participate in universal arms reduction, if we unilaterally eliminate our armaments, we cannot fulfill our responsibility to ourselves and the world. Maintaining a large professional standing army, although not in accordance with our traditions, we must be able and prepared to supply armed forces that can be assembled in a short period of time. We must also have many trained citizens who are able and willing to supplement these armed forces, without the need for unnecessary long-term training. For the sake of peace, we cannot allow our military capabilities to be reduced to a level inconsistent with our mission, and we must have some form of universal military training, which is the reason for this.

The power we maintain in this way cannot and will not be used for aggression. As a peace-loving and law-abiding nation, our traditions are sufficient to guarantee that our force will not be used for purposes other than defending the law. Our army, unless summoned by the Security Council, must first obtain the consent of Congress to be used for war. We need not fear its abuse unless we distrust the representatives of the people.

I am convinced that there is no reason for war between any major powers at present. The current balance of power and interests is such that as long as every nation faithfully adheres to the goals and principles of the Charter, no nation needs or should feel insecure in its relations with other nations.

It is not enough for nations to simply declare that they do not need to wage war. Hitler said this, and in a sense, he meant it. He wanted the world to accept a totalitarian government under his command. If possible, he wanted to achieve this goal without war. If necessary, he decided to use war to achieve it.

To abandon war, nations must not do things that lead to war.

Constructive Diplomacy

The United States has never recognized the status quo as sacred and inviolable in its domestic or foreign policies. The essence of our democracy is that we believe in life and growth, and that people have the right to create their own future. Our tradition is not to defend reactionary "arbitrariness" and the tyranny of privilege. We fought against the Nazis and Fascists because these parties wanted to turn back the clock of civilization and stop us from moving forward.

Our diplomacy must not be passive or indolent. It must be able to adjust and develop to suit constantly changing environments. It must have creative ideas, constructive proposals, practical and forward-looking suggestions. Although maintaining the status quo is not sacred and immutable, we cannot ignore a unilateral erosion of the status quo. The United Nations Charter prohibits aggression, and we cannot allow aggression to be carried out by coercion, oppression, or tactics such as political infiltration.

When adjustments are needed between large and small countries, we must honestly and fairly discuss the matter on its merits, consider adjustment methods, and take into account the interests of all countries, large and small, in order to maintain peace and security in this world based on the unity of major powers and not dominated by any one country.

There is no doubt that there are currently very important adjustment matters requiring our consideration. Some situations are extremely delicate to handle. However, as long as such means of seeking strategic advantages around the world, and methods of using the first adjustment as a model to continue exerting hidden strength, cease to be carried out, I believe a satisfactory solution can still be found.

We must face the fact that we must maintain the "United Nations," and we cannot ignore serious disputes existing between any major powers, regardless of whether or not the veto power is exercised, because disputes can affect the overall balance of power among all major powers.

### ### Peace Has Not Yet Arrived, the U.S. Must Maintain its Strength

Secretary of the Army Patterson Succeeds Byrnes in Speech

[United Press New York, 28th] Following Byrnes's speech, Secretary of the Army Patterson spoke, stating: The American people must remember that peace has not yet arrived, and there are still many major military risks in the world. The United States should maintain a strong and well-trained reserve force, unify its forces, and engage in active plans for scientific research and development. Weakness is not enough to seek solutions and is only enough to be despised. We have made this mistake in the past, and as a result, we have been forced to participate in wars repeatedly. Senator McMahon, chairman of the Atomic Energy Committee, also declared: The failure of the United States to transfer control of atomic energy from the military to civilian agencies is tantamount to raising a signal to the world for an atomic arms race. If the current military management of atomic energy continues, scientists engaged in atomic nucleus research will inevitably abandon it, and foreign countries will also regard this as a sign that the United States tolerates the atomic arms race.

### ### Allied Nations Allocate German Reparations

[United Press Beijing, 1st] Representatives of the eighteen nations of the Allied Reparations Conference met for the first time today at their permanent headquarters to begin dividing German reparations. It is expected that this task will take two to three years. The Soviet Union has been allocated half of German industrial and other equipment, which can be dismantled at will. The representatives will now allocate the remaining half according to the percentages stipulated in Paris in January. Norway, Egypt, and Czechoslovakia have not yet signed the agreement, but it is expected that they will do so soon. The percentages for the other countries to dismantle German industrial and other equipment, including merchant ships and inland river vessels, are as follows: Albania 0.35, United States 11.8, Australia 0.95, Belgium 4.5, Canada 1.5, Denmark 0.35, France 22.8, United Kingdom 27.8, Greece 4.15, India 2.9, Luxembourg 0.4, New Zealand 0.6, Netherlands 5.6, Union of South Africa 0.2, Yugoslavia 9.6.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Chinese food experts here have requested the Food Committee of the United Nations Food Organization to conduct a comprehensive review of the world food situation and to readjust the pilot food distribution in order to eliminate unfair treatment of China. According to authoritative sources, China's dissatisfaction is based on the following points: (1) China believes that the British have not made an accurate report on the food situation in Southeast Asia; (2) Most parts of China have been damaged by the war and will not have a new harvest until the second half of 1946, and the pilot food distribution method does not take this fact into account. The Chinese expert is most dissatisfied with the fact that the planned rice allocation for Hong Kong is equal to that of all other regions of China, which is considered very unfair.

### A Practitioner of Science and Patriotism: Zhang Xinfu in Remembrance

— Our special correspondent, Fang Canglang

Mr. Zhang Xinfu, acting Northeast Special Envoy of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, was unsuccessful in taking over the Fushun Coal Mine. On the way back to Shenyang, he was suddenly dragged off the train by bandits, stripped of his clothes, and stabbed to death with bayonets, a total of forty-eight times. Seven accompanying staff members were killed at the same time. The sight of their deaths was so tragic that those who saw it wept, and those who heard it were grieved. The reporter was acquainted with Xinfu and, upon receiving news of his death, wrote a letter to Mrs. Zhang, Li Xiangheng, inquiring about the circumstances of the martyr's death and the condition of his children. At the end of the letter, I added "Fushun, " a page where even the grass and trees are saddened, the Northeast will not perish, and the martyr will live forever," to express my condolences. The production of the Fushun mining area and the life of Xinfu were briefly mentioned in the Nanjing special dispatch of this newspaper. I plan to further elaborate on Xinfu's character based on what I know, in order to express my grief.

Others Retreat in Fear, The Martyr Advances Bravely

Martyr Zhang, about 52 years old, originally from the Northeast, had studied mining and metallurgy in Britain and the United States for many years. After returning to China, he first engaged in mining in Jilin. He once went to the Fushun mining area to conduct an investigation. Before and after the fall of the Northeast, he twice engaged in mining operations in Hebei and Henan provinces. China's science and industry are backward, especially due to the simple mining equipment and difficult management, which often makes many outstanding engineers retreat in fear. In addition, in the past, China's politicians, financiers, and intellectuals mostly ignored or even indifferently regarded those engineers and mining researchers who were confined to laboratories and those engineers and miners who braved the wind and rain and the hardships of the moon, delving into the wilderness and fighting against all kinds of disasters when they were struggling and needed sympathy, encouragement, and assistance. Until they occasionally saw one or two successful mining giants, they would flatter and fawn upon them, for fear of being left behind. However, upon examination, their motives mostly seemed to be for doing business. According to what Xinfu told me before his death, he had personally experienced both of these stages.

Living on Two Meals of Hardship, Not Afraid to Weep in Cattle Clothes

When the martyr failed in his mining operations in North China, he was so poor that he lived on two "wowo tou" a day. The husband and wife wept in cattle clothes, but they still continued to work hard with the courage to overcome setbacks. The couple was not much different in age, but four years ago, Mrs. Zhang already looked like a seventy-year-old woman. After the Anti-Japanese War, in order to strengthen the military-industrial needs of the country and its allies, the government established a Mercury Management Office in Huangxian, Xiangxi, to develop the cinnabar mercury mines in western Hunan, eastern Sichuan, and southeastern Guizhou on a large scale. Around the thirtieth year of the Republic of China, the martyr came to Huangxian to serve as the "Director of the Management Office" of this mercury mine. Through his continuous efforts over the course of two years, those sparkling things buried in the mountains of the border areas of Sichuan, Hunan, and Guizhou turned into treasures for us to exchange for foreign exchange. The work that originally required three or four dozen employees had to be done by thousands of people. The giant mercury industry management office also appeared in that remote Huangxian county.

Although Noble as the Director of the Mercury Mine, He Only Rented Three Bungalows

The Director of the Mercury Management Office, equivalent to the manager of a national bank, only rented three bungalows from nearby residents and lived a very simple and natural life. I met him in Huangxian county, and the place we met was in those three bungalows. That was in the winter of the 31st year of the Republic of China. It was a cold and terrifying winter. However, in the late winter of this year, a small number of remnant bandits in the Xiangqian border area gathered some unscrupulous people and fled from the Huangxian Duhua area to Xiaoqingxi on the Guizhou border. (Originally Qingxi County, now changed to a town under the jurisdiction of Zhenyuan.) There is a saying in Guizhou, "When the weather is dry, there are many rumors." In places with inconvenient transportation, rumors are especially prevalent. Once, bandits captured several county towns. At that time, people were panicking and at a loss. In order to obtain some real news and materials for news reporting, the reporter rushed from Zhijiang to Huangxian to borrow a car from the Mercury Mine Office, preparing to go deep into the bandit area to see what was going on.

In Order to Ensure the Safety of the Workers, He Ventures Deep into the Bandit's Lair

Unexpectedly, Xinfu wanted to go with me. The reason was: The iron mine in Xiaoqingxi was a pilot project of the Mercury Management Office. He was very worried about the safety of the workers in the iron mine. Finally, after comforting the families of the iron mine workers, he bravely got in the car with the reporter and rushed to the bandit area.

Before the reporter got into the car, Mrs. Zhang repeatedly told us to come back that day. Xinfu's four sons and daughters also waved to their father with a bit of frightened expression, and shouted in unison: "Dad, come back soon!" Fortunately, that time, we got our wish and returned. However, this time, he left and never returned!

The Martyr's Spirit Inspires, The Bandits Cannot Bear to Open Fire

Alas! Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have a wife and children? We are all human beings who have suffered the ravages of war, why do you use such cruel methods? I really can't bear to recall the happy state of Mrs. Zhang when she saw us return from Xiaoqingxi!

The trip to Qingxi didn't seem dangerous at the time, because when we arrived in Yuping County, we heard that the bandits had retreated. Later, according to the bandits who surrendered, they had seen the mine's car in the mountains. Because they knew that mining was beneficial to the people, and they heard that Director Zhang was a good person, they couldn't bear to open fire. This statement is somewhat credible. Originally, Xinfu was a good person, so even the bandits could have a discovery of conscience!

The Local Tyrants Grind Their Teeth in Hatred, Mr. Weng Smiles Through Tears

In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the reporter took a trip to the Northwest. Soon after, Xinfu also said that he was assigned to southern Jiangxi to preside over the tungsten sand mining area in the border area of Guangdong and Jiangxi. This was the second stage of Xinfu's experience as a Chinese engineer. Probably because of the interests of a mining right, Xinfu advocated that the benefits should belong to the country, which angered several local tyrants, who fiercely accused him to the Senate. At that time, Mr. Weng Yongni was so anxious that he jumped up and down, saying, "If people like this can't be relied on anymore, what will the world become! I am very sad, I am very sad! However, later, after several supervisory agencies investigated and found out that Xinfu had been framed, the truth was revealed. Mr. Weng smiled through tears and held Xinfu's hand with emotion, saying repeatedly, "Xinfu! You are really hardworking and uncomplaining, a clean and honest civil servant! Don't be discouraged! Keep up the good work! China has right and wrong, and the country has a future!" It is said that before Xinfu was dispatched to the Northeast this time, he entrusted his wife and children to Minister Weng before leaving, which shows that he was truly a man who feared neither death nor hardship.

On the road to Qingxi, he once said to the reporter: "If we cannot recover that piece of land with an area of 1,303,143,252 cubic kilometers, our poor people will be poor for the rest of their lives. Rather than continue like this, I would rather die in the Northeast!" Alas, his words came true, it's too heartbreaking! I hope he will open his eyes wide and watch that land that will be completely recovered sooner or later!

### A Powerful Speech by Mr. Byrnes

The World Must Not Be Divided

(Continued from Page Two) The United States hopes to maintain friendly relations with all countries but does not want exclusive agreements with any. Naturally, some issues are more relevant to certain countries than others. This is the case for many issues concerning relations between the Americas. The same goes for the control of Germany and Japan. In our relations with other major powers, many issues are more relevant to two or three of us than to others. I see no objection to meetings between the three, four, or five major powers. Even individual meetings with the Soviet Union, Britain, France, or China can help promote coordination among major powers and peace with smaller countries. However, even in these meetings, as far as the United States is concerned, we will never form cliques against any country. We will not divide the world into separate blocs or spheres of influence. In this atomic age, we will not attempt to decompose this single and indivisible world.

We openly, joyfully, and sincerely welcome our Soviet ally as a great power second to none. We have often accommodated its views, agreed to many adjustments, and in doing so, eliminated many serious doubts and tried to benefit it. Only an unforgivable and tragic error could cause serious conflict in the future. Although our ways of life are different, our people admire and respect our allies and hope to remain friends and partners in a world of ever-expanding freedom and rising living standards.

The Charter Must Not Be Violated

For the sake of world peace and our common traditions of friendship, we must clearly declare that the United States will defend the United Nations Charter. All countries, large and small, have agreed under the United Nations Charter not to resort to force or the threat of force, except to defend the law and the purposes and spirit of the Charter.

If anyone uses force or threatens to use force to achieve purposes contrary to the spirit of the United Nations Charter, we are unwilling and unable to stand idly by. Unless we obtain the free recognition of other sovereign states, we have no right to station troops within their territories. We should not excessively prolong the time to achieve peace and continue to station our troops in the territories of weak and impoverished countries. Before the Allied countries reach an agreement on reparations, no country has the right to arbitrarily seize enemy property in liberated areas or from former enemy dependencies. We cannot and will not agree to any country deciding for itself what it takes from these countries. We should not launch a war of nerves to achieve strategic goals. We are unwilling to fall into a situation where no country wants war, but no country can avoid war. We should not consider that drawing attention to the aforementioned possible threats to the peace situation constitutes an insult to the country or countries that should be held responsible.

Any country may take certain actions out of good intentions without fully realizing the consequences. We should be willing to review our own actions to maintain our common interests in peace because this is far more important to us than disputes that divide us.

We should restore the situation of peacetime. We must clear away the terrible legacies left by the war. We should let our troops return to their respective homelands. We must clear the atmosphere of suspicion and fear. We should not deceive ourselves and mislead our allies. To avoid disputes, we should not let the situation develop into irreparable events.

We should adhere to the United Nations Charter, which is the only way to achieve peace. We must abide by the Charter, and everyone should have goodwill and mutual understanding.

Building a Happy World Together

Those of us who had patience and inspired each other's confidence during the darkest periods of the war should now also have patience and inspire each other's confidence.

No country can monopolize human wisdom, and no country can claim the right to act alone. The behavior of friendly countries should be friendly.

Irresponsibly talking about the inevitability of war casts doubt on our loyalty to the Charter and infringes on the freedoms we cherish most at home and abroad.

There are many ideological differences in the world, and there always have been. But the world is large enough to accommodate many people with different opinions and governments with different systems.

No one can predict the distant future and the final situation. However, as part of a common culture, we are tightly bound together.

Looking back at the results of the war's destruction, we should understand that the difficult work of post-war reconstruction and creating higher living standards for the people requires our full efforts.

All countries, large and small, should work together to build a friendlier and happier world. If we cannot work together, none of us can achieve peace and tranquility, and there is not much hope for the future. (The End)

### Editorial: The Convening of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang

The Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang commenced yesterday in the provisional capital. The convening of this session marks the first such meeting since the Kuomintang led the nation to victory in the War of Resistance and occurs on the eve of ending political tutelage and implementing constitutional government, following the successful conclusion of political consultations. Its significance is profoundly weighty. Looking to the future, the achievements of this session will undoubtedly be epochal in the history of the Kuomintang. The national liberation movement of China is deeply entwined with the Kuomintang; the rise and fall of the Kuomintang is profoundly and greatly related to the future of the Chinese nation. As it holds this epochal meeting, we offer our respectful words as congratulations.

The Chinese Kuomintang currently stands at a historical turning point. The direction the Kuomintang takes from here, and its actions, will not only affect the Kuomintang's own fate but also the rise and fall of the nation. Today, the War of Resistance has been won, but the crises ahead may be even greater than in the past. Looking at the domestic and international situation, problems abound, and hidden dangers are everywhere. A glimpse of spring is followed by gathering clouds, and victory is in hand, but difficulties have not been alleviated. How to break through the current situation and lead the country onto the path of revival and reconstruction is a responsibility that rests with the entire nation, and the Chinese Kuomintang, as the largest party today, bears a particular responsibility that cannot be understated. Now that the Central Committee members of the Kuomintang are assembled in the provisional capital, we wish to express our views on what we perceive. We will discuss this in brief.

First, regarding the issues of the Kuomintang itself, at this time of implementing constitutional government, there are many aspects that urgently need discussion and decision. Among them, two points in particular cannot be ignored in their importance: (1) How to rectify the party's discipline, and (2) How to utilize new momentum. Today, many Chinese people hold unfavorable views of the Kuomintang; the reason for this can often be traced to the misconduct of local Kuomintang officials, who abuse their power and are arrogant, leading to a loss of popular support. If the Kuomintang wishes to regain popular support in the future, it must vigorously change the declining trends of recent years, and rectifying the discipline of party members is of the utmost urgency. A political party is originally composed of countless party members; when the number of members is large, it is inevitable that there will be a mixture of good and bad. There are many loyal and dedicated people within the Kuomintang, but the presence of even a few bad elements is enough to damage the Kuomintang's reputation and more. The launch of the Kuomintang's "rectification movement" is truly of the utmost urgency. On the positive side, the Kuomintang has been able to exert its greatest strength at every historical stage in its past fifty years. The overthrow of the Qing dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution and the National Revolution of 1926-1927 were both epochal national liberation movements, and the Kuomintang was able to seize the opportunity and fulfill its mission. Now is also the beginning of a historical stage, but the objective situation now is vastly different from the past. How to utilize new momentum to exert the power of the Kuomintang, as mentioned earlier, is not only related to the Kuomintang's own fate but also to the rise and fall of the nation. The overthrow of the Qing dynasty was mainly due to the patriots and scholars full of nationalistic ideas in various places; the high tide of the National Revolution coincided with the May Fourth New Culture Movement. The utilization of momentum in these two stages was already different. Now, at the time of national construction, the Kuomintang must utilize a new momentum in order to continue to carry forward its past glory.

Second, regarding the political aspects, how to implement the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution. The Three Principles of the People are the highest guiding principles for our country's nation-building and were originally accepted by all parties and factions, so how to implement the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution should not have been a problem. However, the agreements reached at this political consultative conference greatly violate the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, such as those concerning the system of the five branches of government and the status of the provinces. The Five-Power Constitution is a great legacy given to the Chinese people by the Founding Father, with carefully drafted provisions, the purpose of which is to save the drawbacks of Western parliamentary politics and establish a sound political system for the Three Principles of the People, which should not be misunderstood or misinterpreted. The agreements made by this political consultative conference on the draft constitution dismember and dissect the political system that the Three Principles of the People sought to establish. If implemented, it would render the Kuomintang's efforts over the past fifty years utterly futile. The crisis is far greater than the conspiracy of Yuan Shikai in the early years of the Republic. As for raising the status of the provinces and giving them provincial constitutions, this is a disguised form of local separatism and is opposed by the Chinese people. The fact that the states of the United States have constitutions has a historical background; the federal government of the United States was formed by the union of the states. The situation in our country is different, originally being a centrally unified political system that should not be divided, lest the situation of local separatism be re-enacted. The Chinese people, after a long period of war, urgently desire a stable order so that they can have the opportunity to recuperate and rejuvenate. Therefore, they are extremely concerned about the issue of the political system.

The Central Committee members of the Kuomintang are meeting in the provisional capital this time, hoping to preserve the spirit of the Three Principles of the People while accepting the achievements of the political consultative conference. The future of the nation depends on it.

### Reader Opinion: Why Not "Borrow a Head" to Stabilize Prices?

Mr. Editor:

Since the price of gold soared, the prices of all goods have risen accordingly, and the price of rice, a staple food, has surpassed them all, doubling in three days and threatening to break the 30,000 mark and continue to rise. Gold is not a daily necessity, and its price increase seems unrelated to people's livelihood. However, rice is a necessity for people's food. At a time when labor unrest is frequent and society is extremely unstable, if its price is allowed to continue to soar, the affairs of the country and the people will become unbearable!

The government must be planning carefully to stabilize the financial situation and suppress prices. However, the result of "a hasty illness and a slow doctor" may also lead to the death of the patient. The authorities seem to have no appropriate measures to suppress the price of rice and then suppress the prices of other goods, which inevitably gives people the feeling of "a slow doctor" leading to "death"!

We seem to understand that the crux of this surge in rice prices is mainly due to human factors. We sincerely hope that the authorities can quickly adopt decisive measures and imitate the established practice of the mayor of Guilin, who "borrowed a head to suppress rice prices," so that the current situation of "one road crying, one family laughing" can be transformed into "one family crying, one road laughing." This would be a virtuous policy and the only emergency remedy for prices today.

In the autumn of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], the price of rice in Guilin City, Guangxi Province, soared by 50%. Although the authorities tried many ways to suppress it, they were unable to do so. In the end, a written speech by Mayor Su Xinmin achieved the desired effect. The main idea of the speech was that he could give up his official position, but the price of rice had to be stabilized. The mayor would fight to the death with the unscrupulous merchants and adopt the method of "borrowing a head to stabilize prices"! Although the head was not actually borrowed, the unscrupulous merchants finally knew that it was difficult to proceed, and the price of rice did indeed fall!

The situation is urgent! We hope that the authorities will try it to relieve the suffering of our people. This would be a boundless act of merit!

### Labor-Management Dispute at a Textile Factory Leads to an Accident; Three Police Chiefs Injured; Representatives from Party and Government Agencies Dispatched for Investigation

[Reported by Our Newspaper] At around 2 p.m. yesterday at the Xin Yu Textile Factory located at 8 Changshou Road, Shanghai West, a labor-management dispute over compensation during the shutdown period led to a disturbance. Subsequently, the Putuo Road Branch dispatched three plainclothes police chiefs to investigate. The factory manager, Zeng Xiangxi, denied the factory's involvement. The workers believed that the police had let the factory manager go, leading to widespread outrage. As a result, police chiefs Wang Zhigang, Zhou Xueqin, and Cai Weiqing were beaten by the crowd. It is reported that Wang was severely injured in the chest and back by weapons such as iron bars. Zhou and Cai sustained lighter injuries. Upon receiving the report, Branch Chief Qi Jingzhi immediately dispatched seven armed police officers to suppress the situation and telegraphed the Headquarters for instructions. The Headquarters sent a red police vehicle. At that time, the workers had closed the gates, strictly prohibiting entry and exit. Meanwhile, the City Party Department, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the General Labor Union also heard the news and dispatched representatives to investigate the cause of the incident. By midnight, the police vehicles and armed police officers surrounding the factory had withdrawn. The injured police chiefs were sent to the police hospital for treatment. A reasonable resolution to the dispute is expected to be sought by various agencies this morning.

### Employees of the District Court Prosecutor's Office Demand Improved Treatment; Four Demands Proposed at Yesterday's Meeting

The Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office handles approximately 200 cases each month, making the workload quite heavy. With the current soaring prices, the salaries of judges and prosecutors are only 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Therefore, more than 200 employees of the District Court Prosecutor's Office held a meeting yesterday morning to appeal to various parties.

Following the Precedent of the Four Banks Before Approval

They also established the Court Colleagues Welfare Committee, which resolved and passed four demands: (1) The treatment of the court should be the same as that of the state-owned China Merchants Bureau. Before this demand is approved by the central government, it should still follow the precedent of the Four Banks, with prosecutors borrowing 250,000 yuan, clerks 200,000 yuan, recorders 160,000 yuan, bailiffs 140,000 yuan, and workers 120,000 yuan. (2) The city's housing tax and fines for violations of police regulations were originally court revenue but were transferred to the city government after the victory. These funds are now urgently needed to be used as a welfare fund for court colleagues. (3) Request the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau to allocate housing to be used as dormitories for court colleagues. (4) Request the Relief Administration to allocate clothing. Finally, they made a firm statement that they would continue to work as usual until all the demands are satisfactorily resolved. If it becomes unavoidable in the end, they will all resign and seek other means of livelihood.

Employees of Six Public Utilities Make Demands

[Reported by Our Newspaper] All employees of the six major public utilities—gas, telephone, British and French merchants' electricity companies—have recently collectively submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau, demanding improved treatment and a temporary loan of 150,000 yuan, among other conditions. Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau personally met with representatives of the six companies yesterday afternoon and considered the request for a temporary loan of 150,000 yuan to be inappropriate. He suggested pre-borrowing half a month's salary and advancing the payment of salaries. As for special allowances, Director Wu agreed to 7,000 yuan per month and decided to hold formal negotiations at 2 p.m. today.

In addition, workers at the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant went on strike yesterday due to excessively low wages, which made it impossible to maintain their current living standards. Labor and management are being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau this afternoon, and opinions are gradually converging. Work will resume today.

The Western Restaurant Labor Dispute Continues to Be Mediated

Yesterday, employees of Western restaurants and coffee shops hosted reporters at the Jin Gu Hotel, where Chairman Zhu Shifa reported on the mediation process of the Social Affairs Bureau, the issue of employees returning to work, and extra bonuses. The Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene both parties at 2 p.m. today to continue mediation.

### Two Robberies; One Victim Injured

[Reported by Our Newspaper] At around 10 p.m. last night, three bandits armed with firearms broke into the home of Zeng Xiangxu at No. 39, Lane 170, Qiqi Road, and robbed a large quantity of gold bars and cash. The homeowner resisted and was struck in the head with a pistol butt by the bandits. Upon receiving the report, the Xujiahui Branch immediately ordered police to pursue and arrest the bandits, but they had already escaped without a trace.

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Xu Dinghong, a native of Jiangbei, ran a business at the Caojiadu Five Relief Market and resided at No. 85, Xiaoxin Village, Changchou Road. At around 8 p.m. the night before last, four bandits broke in, one of whom was armed with a gun. Xu shouted loudly, and the bandit fired a shot at him, hitting him in the leg, causing him to faint from the pain. They robbed cash, woolen cloth, and various kinds of cotton cloth, totaling losses of more than 200,000 yuan. After injuring the victim, neighbors carried him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Upon receiving the news, the Jiangning Branch dispatched Section Chief Li Zhizhong to lead police to investigate in order to apprehend the perpetrators.

### Three Suspects in Forging Bank Drafts Questioned Yesterday

[Reported by Our Newspaper] In July of last year, Li Tingwu, Shao Yanling, and Zhu Honghai planned to forge 2,000-yuan bank drafts issued by the Hangzhou Branch of the Central Bank. On November 14, Shao contacted the Mei Zhun Color Printing Factory at No. 11, Lane 86, Maoming Road, to arrange for printing. The factory owner, Chen Xinxiu, initially refused, but after the persuasion of the accounting clerk, Xu Chengxiang, he agreed to print for a fee of 220,000 yuan. Zhu Honghai then contacted the Wang Baifu Printing Shop at No. 4, Lane 49, Rehe Road, to reprint the signatures and seals on the drafts. Later, the police discovered the forgery and handed the case over to the court. The court questioned the suspects yesterday and ordered them to be detained pending trial.

### Murder Case Occurs on Zhangjiabang Road, Nanshi

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Zhai Guirong, a 41-year-old Shandong native who ran a sesame cake shop at No. 84, Zhangjiabang Road, Nanshi, was suddenly approached by a young man in a raincoat at around 6 p.m. last night.

The agency began winding up its operations yesterday. In addition, the Shanghai Aviation Inspection Office was ordered to be abolished yesterday. In the future, people traveling by plane will be exempt from restrictions. However, passengers traveling to Guangdong and Beiping must still obtain approval from the Executive Yuan's Shanghai Office before purchasing tickets.

### Relief Administration Sells Flour at a Discount; Unit Changed to One Bag

Since the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration adopted the method of unlimited flour sales, the initial unit was set at 20 bags, which was later changed to five bags. The price was set at 6,000 yuan per bag, requiring 30,000 yuan for five bags. Considering the burden on general households and civilians, the Provincial Finance Department changed the unit from five bags to one bag starting from the 3rd of this month. The method of using warehouse receipts will still be adopted for the time being. In addition to the originally designated Postal Remittance Bureau, Shanghai Commercial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, China Industrial Bank, Continental Bank, Guohua Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Jincheng Bank, China Reclamation Bank, China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and China Communications Bank, three more banks, China National Goods Bank, China Enterprise Bank, and Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, have been entrusted to collect payments. The Relief Administration is also planning to select central locations in various districts within the city of Shanghai to directly sell flour in order to facilitate purchases by citizens.

### A Puppet Official Dies in Prison

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Zhang Guoyuan (courtesy name Chengzhi), the puppet vice president of the Judicial Yuan, was arrested after the victory and detained in the Nanshi Former District Court Detention Center. He died in prison on the evening of the 26th of last month due to illness caused by worry and depression. Zhang was 57 years old. He was originally an advanced revolutionary who participated in the National Revolution as a representative of the Hunan Army. After the success of the Northern Expedition, when the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, Zhang was a legislator. After the "August 13" Incident, Zhang retreated to Hong Kong. When the Pacific War broke out and Hong Kong fell, Zhang secretly came to Shanghai. In April of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], he compromised and became a traitor, serving as the puppet vice president of the Judicial Yuan. He was arrested after the surrender of the Japanese.

### Nine British Shipping Companies Resume Independent Operations

The British Far East Shipping Management Office is an organization established by the British government to manage ships during wartime. It was jointly formed by nine shipping companies in Shanghai: British, Changxing, Tianxiang, Moller, Baohe, Blue Funnel, Prince (Jardine Matheson Outer Department), Jardine Matheson, and Swire. The agreement was for six months. Today, the term has expired, and they will resume independent operations from the 3rd of this month. The British Company's office began operating yesterday. The Swire Company will temporarily operate from the Jardine Matheson office. Blue Funnel and Jardine Matheson Outer Department (Prince and Red Funnel) will continue to operate jointly.

### Passengers Found Without Tickets; Eesheng Ship Did Not Set Sail

The Eesheng ship of Jardine Matheson and the Fuzhou ship of Swire were originally scheduled to return to Hong Kong from Shanghai on Wednesday. Due to rain, loading was affected, so they were rescheduled to set sail yesterday afternoon. The Fuzhou ship departed on time. Before the Eesheng ship set sail, a large number of passengers without tickets and with black market tickets were discovered. The company immediately sent British sailors on board to evict them. However, these passengers believed that all expenses had been paid and refused to go ashore, so the eviction was ineffective. The shipowner also refused to set sail. The company then moved the ship from the Swire Wharf in Puxi to the Yitaixing Wharf in Pudong and sent personnel to the ship with ticket stubs to verify the tickets again in order to evict the passengers without tickets and with black market tickets. The issue had not been resolved by the evening. It is uncertain whether the ship will be able to depart this morning.

### General Assembly of the Shipping Industry; Telegram to the Government Requesting Relief

The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association held a general membership meeting yesterday afternoon at the association's premises on Guangdong Road. Representatives from more than 60 shipping companies, including Minsheng Industrial Company, attended. Chairman Yang Guanbei presided over the meeting. A unanimous resolution was passed to send telegrams to the Second Plenary Session currently being held in Chongqing, as well as to Chairman Chiang, Premier Song, and Minister of Finance Yu, requesting relief. The main points of the request were: (1) Please uphold navigation rights and prohibit ships flying foreign flags from operating on our domestic rivers and coasts; (2) In accordance with the usual practice of various countries, please compensate for ships that were sacrificed for the country; (3) Please have the government purchase surplus ships from the United States and sell them to private shipping companies at low prices, with payments spread over 20 years; (4) Please have national banks provide low-interest loans for ships at 80% of the ship's value, with repayment spread over 20 years, guaranteed by the government; (5) Please improve the allocation and coordinate military, public, and civilian transportation in a comprehensive manner. For military and public transportation, please adopt the delivery method as much as possible, with freight rates the same as civilian transportation and differentials adjusted according to the price index, in order to alleviate the difficulties of shipping. In addition, it was resolved to establish a Compensation for Losses Committee to be responsible for handling the claims for compensation for ships sacrificed by various members during the War of Resistance.

### A Large Number of Ships Will Be Shipped from the United States, Forming a Fishing Fleet, Making It Not Difficult for Our Country to Become the Far East Fisheries Leader

UNRRA Purchasing Director Hosts Reporters Yesterday

[This newspaper report] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will soon have a large number of ships shipped to our country. Mr. Swanson, the purchasing director of the Administration, who arrived in Shanghai a week ago, stated when hosting reporters yesterday, "UNRRA" will purchase items, mainly all kinds of large and small ships and navigation equipment, worth about 40 million US dollars. Second, fishing boats and various fishing supplies, worth about 35 million US dollars, part of which is donated to "UNRRA" by Brazil. Thirdly, medical supplies, worth about 15 million US dollars. In addition, there are also building materials, various hand tools, transportation and repair equipment, which will greatly assist in China's recovery. The total value of materials submitted to China from surplus U.S. military items is over 100 million US dollars. The total amount of assistance from UNRRA to our country is 67.5 million US dollars.

The total number of ships to be transported to China includes 40 transport ships and landing craft over 1,000 tons, 140 under 1,000 tons, 175 tugboats, more than 600 ships for deep and shallow water navigation, and oil storage ships. Recently, four ships have been test-sailed to Hankou and Changsha. UNRRA is now in urgent need of a large number of sailors, especially engineers who are proficient in using Diesel engines. Mr. Hanting, the shipping director of the UNRRA Shanghai office, stated that UNRRA also needs a large number of pilots who are familiar with the navigation routes of the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. They hope that this type of talent in our country can register with "UNRRA" or "CNRRA," which will provide them with an excellent job.

UNRRA plans to build a fishing fleet of 232 ships for our country. Currently, 55 fishing boats have been purchased in Australia and are expected to arrive in China within March and April. After all of them are in operation in the future, China will obtain a huge amount of 100 million pounds of fish annually. Mr. Shi said in response to reporters' inquiries that he has currently purchased 110 ships of various sizes, including 10 landing craft. In addition, after these ships arrive in China, they will be managed by "CNRRA."

### Community Service, Rising Prices Subdued, Store Prices Still Not Reduced

A Civil Livelihood Issue Worthy of Attention

Dear Editor: I am raising an urgent issue concerning civil livelihoods and request that it be published in the "Community Service" column. Since the victory, in just half a year, the people's livelihood has become increasingly difficult, and social order is disturbed and restless. Although the reasons are complex, the authorities' lack of control over financial and material resources, allowing them to flood uncontrollably, cannot be excused. Secondly, the selfishness and self-interest of merchants, disregarding the lives of the public and arbitrarily raising prices, is also a major reason. For example, a few days ago, the price of gold, rice, and various major commodities soared at one point, and the market was in chaos, unable to last even a day. Fortunately, after Chairman Chiang returned to Chongqing and decided to control foreign exchange, various major commodities fell back by 30-40%. However, the prices of essential daily necessities in the market have not decreased. Just pay attention to the prices listed in the windows of various stores, and you will understand. For example, before gold was 130,000 yuan per tael and rice was over 10,000 yuan per stone, a pair of small cowhide rubber-soled leather shoes was priced at over 7,000 yuan. Later, due to the soaring prices of gold and rice, the store increased the price to around 20,000 yuan (more than double). Now that the prices of gold and rice have fallen back to their original levels, the leather shoes are still selling for 20,000 yuan and have not returned to 7,000 yuan. These cold-blooded, selfish, and self-interested profiteers are overly sensitive. When they hear about rising prices, they immediately raise their prices, raising them again and again, and there are never days when they lower prices. They are even more bloodthirsty than those speculators who manipulate materials. Therefore, I request the opinion circles to come together to correct this and urge the police bureau and social bureau to quickly form economic police to monitor and investigate secretly and set fair prices, ordering all stores to abide by the law. The purpose is to prevent the profiteers' exorbitant profits and relieve the suffering of the people's livelihood. I, representing the opinion of the public, think that the gentleman will not reject it! From Tang Zhijun.

### Service Briefs

Lost and Found Package: Mr. Xu Baowang, a citizen, arrived in Shanghai on the 19th of this month from Tienshenggang, Nantong, by motorboat towing a wooden boat. The boat arrived at the Tianhoufu Bridge pier in the city at 4:00 PM on the 21st. Passengers disembarked one after another. Mr. Xu Binwang and others discovered a package. They waited at the pier, but no one came to claim it. To avoid fraudulent claims, they sent the package containing 21 pieces of clothing to the police headquarters for safekeeping. The owner of the lost item, upon seeing the report, is requested to go to the Southern Section, 5th floor, Room 501, First Division of the Criminal Police Department, City Police Headquarters, Fuzhou Road, to claim it.

### Idle Funds Absorbed at Low Prices, Gold Prices Rebound in Late Trading, US Dollar Falls Due to Abundant Supply

With restless hearts, a general psychology is that since the Bank of China will implement foreign trade foreign exchange next Monday, the gold market will inevitably be restrained by it in the short term. Speculators are enthusiastic about windfall profits and will have no chance to take advantage of them afterwards, so they have turned to other things. Those holding goods are also releasing goods to arbitrage. Securities firms have high expectations for the directors' meeting of the Industry Association, and after noon, they sold gold to cover short positions in stocks. However, miscellaneous bank idle funds believe that the decline has been huge, and there are many activities to buy at low prices, so the lowest opening price of 1.45 million gradually fell, and at noon it once broke through the 1.3 million mark, but it was still able to recover to around 1.4 million. Silver stores have resumed listing prices, but the selling price is too far from the market price, about 10,000 yuan higher per tael. Therefore, general idle funds are vying to collect in the black market, so the result is still a rise of 20,000 before the close. Gold jewelry listing prices fell from 150,000 yuan to 145,000, and finally remained at 150,000 yuan. Refined silver fell to 1,800, and the decline in silver dollars stopped at around 800 yuan. Secret interest rates were 18-24%.

The foreign currency US dollar also stabilized before weakening. The date for the Bank of China to openly buy and sell is approaching. Foreign currency cash has suffered a fatal blow due to the restrictions on entry and exit according to the customs announcement. Holders believe that the foreign exchange buying and selling methods announced this time are extremely thorough. In the near future, spot goods will be gradually eliminated. Under the convergence of a large number of physical goods and speculative traces, the supply exceeds the demand, losing its balance. Therefore, after opening at around 2,000 yuan in the morning, it once called for a high of 2,050 yuan, but was immediately dumped by the seller, and the 2,000 yuan mark was also difficult to maintain. Near noon, it hovered around 1,970 yuan, and in the afternoon it followed the downstream of gold, breaking through the 1,900 yuan mark. Finally, it was brought up by gold again. As a result, the previous close fell by 30 yuan again. Checks are also inevitable, and holders still have a large number of searches, resulting in a 30 yuan drop for old goods. Some people are still absorbing cheap new goods, with only a 3 yuan drop. The concept of light checks has resurfaced for the US dollar and gold, which have pulled apart to 710 yuan per ten taels.

### Securities Industry Discusses Resumption of Business, Chinese and Foreign Stocks are Both Active

Thanks to the popularity of public bonds, Chinese and foreign stocks, retail investors absorbed at low prices, Type C rose from 1,750 yuan to 1,900 yuan at the start, and sold for 1,850 yuan at noon. The process was mediocre, about half a percent better than the previous close, and about one percent for popular stocks. Chinese stocks are still approaching, and have also entered a trading environment after the rise. However, the prices called by various places are quite different. In addition to using automatic telephones, there is no other way to contact each other in the industry. Therefore, they are acting independently, and it is extremely difficult to make prepared estimates at the same time. As a result, it is half a percent to one percent better again. Foreign stocks immediately showed their sharp edges on the market. The Securities Industry Council discussed the resumption of business in the afternoon, and foreign businessmen also came to support the market, resulting in another one to one and a half percent improvement.

### Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth are All Weak

Yesterday, the yarn market declined in a straight line. In recent days, due to the news of the opening of foreign exchange, people's hearts have entered a state of depression. In addition, the money supply suddenly tightened yesterday, and customer sales tended to be sluggish due to the continuous rain. 20 count yarns have all entered the 1 million mark, and small yarns have plummeted to about 800,000, not much different from 16 count yarns. Looking at the various counts of yarn, there is a general drop of about 10%.

Yesterday's spot cotton trading was still flat, and the market situation was not very prosperous. The China Textile Construction Company is waiting and watching. Private yarn factories such as Shenxin Nos. 1 and 6 factories have slightly purchased. Zhoupu seed cotton has not been offered.

The cotton cloth market was full of selling voices, and the market appeared weak. At the same time, the China Textile Construction Company's supply of cotton cloth the day before yesterday was very generous. Those who have already obtained factory numbers are willing to transfer it at a small profit.

Also, the China Textile Construction Company sold 54,500 colored ball fine cloths, 25,500 multicolored leaping carp electric light twills, 52,000 80 count girl's bleached poplins, and 55,000 green mosquito net cloths.

### Rice and Grain Arrive Sparsely, Prices are High

Rice and grain arrived sparsely due to the continuous rain, causing people's hearts to turn bullish. As a result, prices rose by another thousand yuan, but store sales were sluggish, and very few transactions were made at noon, resulting in a stagnant situation. Flour from Qingdao and Tianjin was not selling well, and spot digestion was still active, with prices rising slightly by 100-200 yuan. Soybeans also increased by 300-400 yuan. The oil market remained soft, tending towards flatness and weakness. Raw peanuts stabilized, similar to sesame. Soybean cakes added 100-200 yuan, with arrival and sales being balanced. Bran was sluggish and depressed, with prices slightly down by 100-200 yuan.

### 300 Bundles of Newspaper Arrive

Cotton, cotton cloth, and transportation equipment have all arrived on the American President Lines' world-class ship "Sea Arrow," which arrived in Shanghai for the first time yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 PM. A large amount of materials was transported from New York, including railway tracks and railway materials, about 1,000 tons, belonging to the Relief and Rehabilitation Corporation. There were more than 7,000 bales of cotton and more than 3,000 boxes of cotton cloth, belonging to the Production Bureau. There were also more than 20,000 pieces of relief old clothes and shoes, 300 bundles of white newspaper, 600 tons of alkali (industrial raw materials), and more than 1,000 boxes of "Whiskey" foreign wine, totaling more than 8,900 tons.

### The Decline in Silk Has Stopped

120 denier artificial silk Tianqiao spot goods opened at 1.7 million yuan, and 720,000-730,000 had quite a few transactions. Later, it rose to 1.8 million yuan at the close. In the afternoon, the off-market price called for 1.85 million to 1.9 million yuan, but no transactions were made. Factory silk five tan heads have single order goods at 2.35 million yuan per tan, and other tan and dry warp were both more than 100,000 lower than the previous day. After the price of silk dropped, people asked about it, and all stalls in the market saw an increase yesterday. Meiya quilt covers rose by 60,000 yuan per hundred compared to the previous day, and Dachang khaki military cloth rose by 100 yuan per yard.

### Basketball League Fierce Battle, Last Three Minutes, Hualian Beats Giants, Kong Guangyi Scores Successively, Winning by Two Points at 30 to 28

In the continuous spring rain, the city gymnasium held its first grand event last night, with about 1,500 fans in attendance. In the basketball league, Hualian of the A1 group relied on Kong Guangyi's length in the last three minutes and finally defeated their enemy, the Giants, by two points at 30 to 28. The future of the championship has passed another hurdle. Hualian led by 15 to 11 in the first half. Neither side achieved the ideal brilliant performance. Hualian's strict defense was the key to victory, and the Giants could not break through. Carson was at a loss, losing a lot of rebounds. Li Zhenzhong is still the central figure of Hualian. In the other two games of the A2 group, the Red team defeated Xingzhong 64 to 47, with the first half being 32 to 28. The Green team of the women's group defeated Snow White by a large margin, 40 to 17, with the first half being 19 to 7.

The last major battle was between Hualian and the Giants. The former used the five tigers Zhenzhong, Guangyi, Chengzhang, Xuechong, and Liangxiong, and the Giants used the five generals Carson, Kaizimirov, Manick, Taobulinji, and Sitivenxun. After the jump ball, a seesaw situation appeared. The Giants took the lead in scoring, and Zhang Liangxiong immediately shot from afar, and Chen Xuechong took the lead with four against one. The Giants chased hard, and the score was constantly one point apart. The situation was extremely tense, until the score was tied at 11, when Wu Chengzhang shot successfully, and Kong Guangyi hit the net, Hualian led by 15 to 11 in the first half. After changing positions, the situation progressed in balance. Subsequently, Funike scored three points in a row after Chen Xuechong committed a foul. Chen Xuechong of Hualian came to his luck and scored three goals in a row. Zhenzhong did not want to be left behind, and Hualian seemed to be leading remotely by 25 to 16. The Giants adjusted Vanne in, which was very effective. In the last four minutes, the Giants chased to a tie of 28. The cheering of both sides was endless, and Kong Guangyi lived up to expectations by shooting from afar. Hualian narrowly won by two points with a score of 30 to 28.

### Review of "Knowledge and Culture" by Zhang Dongsun

— Fu Tongxian

Publisher: The Commercial Press

Date: First Edition, January 1946

Price: 1000 Yuan

Pages: 277

I.

Mr. Zhang's book "Knowledge and Culture" is a valuable book in the academic circles of our country. From his own tone, it can be seen that this is also a work the author is proud of. Therefore, we dare to solemnly recommend it to readers. This book was completed in April 1940. At that time, Mr. Zhang wrote to me telling me that the book would be published soon. I originally wanted to be among the first to read it, but it took six years to see it, so it can also be said that our meeting was long overdue.

This book is a statement of Mr. Zhang's views on epistemology. Regarding this aspect, I have had several discussions with Mr. Zhang, and it was not easy to change either side's views. For example, Mr. Zhang argued for the pluralism of knowledge in his Epistemology (World Publishing) published in 1934, and I disagreed with many points, and wrote an article "Is Knowledge Pluralistic or Monistic?" to criticize him (see Zhan Wenhuan's compilation of Zhang Dongsun's Pluralistic Epistemology). Later, I read his "Restatement of Pluralistic Epistemology" (published in January 1937 in the Festschrift for Mr. Zhang Jusheng's Seventieth Birthday), and although it was somewhat revised, I still felt unsatisfied. This time, Mr. Zhang's epistemology appeared with a new face. There have been considerable and important changes, and it is very close to my opinion. Therefore, this time reading Mr. Zhang's article, I felt particularly close to its meaning, and many of the words were exactly what I wanted to say. Therefore, I would like to give a brief introduction to Mr. Zhang's latest views in this article, and then state my personal opinions after seeing the changes in Mr. Zhang Gusheng's thought.

The purpose of this book is to establish an independent epistemology, especially to explain the relationship between knowledge and culture. Mr. Zhang's proposition is called "Multiple Interaction Theory." Here, Mr. Zhang wants to explain two levels of interaction. The first type of interaction is in terms of the structure of knowledge itself, that is, it shows that sensation, perception, concept, and external framework interact with each other. The second level of interaction shows that knowledge and culture interact with each other, knowledge is limited by culture, and culture is also influenced by thought. The book is divided into three parts: (1) From knowledge to culture, analyzing the nature of knowledge to show that knowledge is culture; (2) From culture to knowledge, explaining how the formation of theoretical knowledge is limited by culture; (3) Discussing the characteristics of Chinese thought, in order to prove the relationship between knowledge and national culture with examples.

II.

The first part explains the nature of knowledge. Human knowledge is an extremely complex organization. It can be analyzed into four organizational factors: (1) the external correlator; (2) sensation; (3) perception; (4) concept. They "are mutually dependent, mutually penetrating, mutually restrictive, mutually influencing, and mutually affecting." First, the external is something that must be acknowledged in the organization of knowledge, because if there is no external, then there is no way to explain why our senses have various changes. As for what this "external" is, it is best not to give a definite answer in the scope of epistemology, because the more we say, the farther away we are from this "external," and the less we will understand it. Therefore, Mr. Zhang said: "We have no choice but to admit it and not seek further explanation."

Second, sensation refers to our direct experience. But sensation is not just a simple reflection, but a mixture (called a "creator" by Mr. Dongsun). What appears in sensation, such as color, is not really such a thing, but is only the result of mixing. The mind "is only a series of increasingly high-level synthesis." Sensation is the result of the mind's lowest-level synthesis of the external. In direct experience, there is still no lack of discernment. As Kant said: "Intuitions without concepts are blind, concepts without intuitions are empty."

Third, perception refers to the entire realm of personal experience. Perception puts sensations in a whole realm and creates a "view." Perception has three characteristics. (1) Perception is organized from several sensations, such as the perception of distance, which is formed by the combination of vision and movement sensation. (2) In addition to sensation, "imagination" is also added to perception. (3) Sensation only provides perception with materials, but perception has its own realm. Therefore, perception is also a "creator."

Fourth, concepts gradually come from perception. According to Mr. Zhang's view, "The origin of concepts is due to the gradual fading of the images of concrete things into symbols, and then the transfer of symbols to the general, so there is the so-called 'universal'." However, the origin of this kind of concept is not completely limited to the concrete objects in perception, but more importantly, it comes from the relationships between concrete objects. When these possible relationships are transformed into concepts, there are logical concepts. These concepts can all be transformed into categories. And the emergence of categories and the formation of culture are just one thing. A certain culture includes a certain category. Therefore, concepts can also be said to be a manifestation of a certain culture.

As for talking about the "mind," it "is only an action, and the result of its action is constructed layer by layer. Each layer of creator has its own special function. Therefore, there is no boundary between direct experience and indirect speculation, but it is only a continuous construction." But there is a law between the layers: that is, the later synthesis must include the previous synthesis, and the lower layer is absorbed by the upper layer, so the part only provides materials for the whole. But the upper layer has the power to control the lower layer, which is "the whole determines the parts." Therefore, Zhang Gusheng said: "The external controls the sensory perception, and the sensory perception controls the concept. Conversely, the concept explains the sensory perception, and the sensory perception includes the external." This is Mr. Zhang's interactionism.

Why do we have this kind of knowledge? This is because knowledge can make it easier for us to adapt. Therefore, knowledge itself is a kind of life value. Culture is the process of human adaptation to the environment. Therefore, culture can be said to be the objectification and standardization of knowledge.

The second part of this book explains how knowledge is limited by culture. Mr. Zhang states this from four aspects: language, logic, philosophy, and social thought. First, Mr. Zhang believes that the language of a nation is determined by the history and culture of this nation. The mind of a nation can be seen from the characteristics of the abstract nouns used by this nation. For example, Chinese language has many moral nouns, which shows that Chinese thought focuses on human affairs. Second, logic does not express the rational function of human beings, it only adjusts the shortcomings of language. Different cultures have different language grammars, so different cultures also have different logics. The needs of culture are different, and the appearance of logic also changes accordingly. Third, philosophy is the highest theoretical knowledge, and its function also lies in the convenience of adaptation. Therefore, it is easily controlled by our own attitude. Therefore, the discussion of philosophers only gives us emotional satisfaction, in order to adjust the culture and turn back to change our attitude towards dealing with the world. Third, social thoughts (such as morality, politics, economics, philosophy, religion, etc.) are all due to the social need for individuals to unite. Social thought is used to maintain people's hearts. Therefore, when society has different needs, there are different social thoughts. Therefore, Mr. Zhang gave a definition of truth: all theoretical knowledge that can meet the social needs of a certain era is truth.

The third part of this book wants to use the characteristics of Chinese thought to prove the previous theme. Chinese and Western cultures have different patterns, so they have different patterns of thought, because thought is just an explanation of culture. Here, Mr. Zhang pointed out four characteristics of Chinese philosophy: (1) Chinese philosophers do not talk about ontology and causality, but only talk about possible changes and their mutual relationships, because Chinese society has an ethical order, which requires individuals to do their best to maintain the whole of society, and philosophy provides a reasonable defense for this order of seeking mutual relationships from various changes. (2) There is no distinction between species and classes in Chinese philosophy, which is also because the Chinese believe that each member of the whole is only a related symbol rather than a natural kind. (3) Chinese philosophy fundamentally does not pursue the "ultimate reality," because Chinese thinkers only solve political problems and social problems, and the concept of "essence" cannot be inserted at all. (4) Chinese philosophy does not talk about ontology, but only talks about the whole, advocating the unity of heaven and man, and the unity of all things.

These thought systems are all adapted to the social needs of the time. The ancient Chinese thinkers all belonged to the ruling class and the class that assisted the rulers, not the ruled class, so the problems they thought about were only "the way of inner sage and outer king," not the life skills of ordinary people. Zhang Gusheng said: "Chinese culture focuses on morality and self-cultivation only because the books passed down are all specially for the scholar class to read." "The intention is to train scholars to make their conduct particularly harder and more outstanding than ordinary people; therefore, when they come out to help the world, they can make the monarch Yao and Shun." After the unification of Qin, the emperors needed assistants who were only docile people, and Confucianism could best produce such people, so the ideology after Qin was dominated by Confucianism. Therefore, the task of scholars in the pre-Qin era was to assist politics; after the unification of Qin, the mission of scholars was to reconcile the interests of the people and the interests of the royal family, so that the monarch would not become tyrannical and unprincipled; in the Ming and Song dynasties, the society suffered more and more from chaos, and the scholar class needed to strengthen their self-confidence in their work, and the Neo-Confucianism of the Ming and Song dynasties did this work. By the Qing Dynasty, the monarch was already a foreign race, and the scholars no longer needed to make loyal remonstrances that would sacrifice their lives, so they tended to study "practical learning," and only planned for the life problems of ordinary people, and no longer needed to do the work of "making the monarch Yao and Shun."

Finally, Mr. Zhang uses the difference in the categories used in Chinese and Western philosophy to explain the difference between Chinese and Western cultures. In the comparison, first, Western categories are more complex than Chinese categories, so Chinese thought is relatively simpler; second, Chinese and Western categories are also different in kind, Chinese thought pays more attention to the aspect of realization, while Western thought pursues the ontology behind phenomena, Chinese thought is ethical, and Western thought is mysterious.

In short, human thought is a product of social culture, and the development of social culture is limited by thought. This cycle is unavoidable in any research.

III.

From the above simple introduction, we can see that three very important changes have taken place in Mr. Zhang's thought system. First, Mr. Zhang has abandoned the proposition of pluralism; second, he uses culture and sociology to explain the composition of knowledge; third, he admits that knowledge has the value of helping human beings adapt to survival. These changes are all very gratifying, because they all conform to the trend of new ideas. Now let's add some more explanation to these three points.

In the past, Mr. Zhang advocated pluralistic epistemology. He once analyzed knowledge into five factors: order, sensation, concept, hypothesis, and format. He said, "I think that in essence, there are five kinds that are independent of each other. Sensation cannot know external things; format cannot know sensation; hypothesis cannot know format; concept cannot know hypothesis... Because I admit that sensation, category, hypothesis, and concept each have their own sources and cannot be combined." At that time, I made the following criticism of Zhang Gusheng's view: "Mr. Zhang did not give us the reasons why the above five levels cannot be independent. Mr. Zhang said that they each have their own sources, but he did not tell us what the sources are... I mean, although the organization of knowledge cannot lack order, sensation, concept, hypothesis, and format, I further advocate that order, sensation, concept, hypothesis, and format are a whole, interconnected organism. These five raw materials in the organization of knowledge are like pulling one hair and moving the whole body. Without order, sensation cannot be formed; without sensation, concept cannot be formed; without concept, equipment cannot be formed; without equipment, format cannot be understood. This kind of correlation from bottom to top, I think can be used the meaning of "inclusion" in Morgan's emergent evolution theory. Conversely, format dominates hypothesis; hypothesis dominates concept; concept dominates sensation; sensation dominates order. This kind of practical effect domination from top to bottom, I use the relationship of "superiority" to explain. If the organization of knowledge does not have the two relations of superiority and inclusion, it is just a pile of loose sand, and there is no so-called knowledge at all... We believe that these raw materials in the organization of knowledge are a complete body of mutual connection." I put forward this opinion to Mr. Zhang in May 1935. In the restatement of pluralistic epistemology published by Mr. Zhang in November 1936, although he mentioned that these levels were mixed with each other, he did not accept the two relations of "inclusion" and "superiority" that I proposed. When he wrote the book "Knowledge and Culture" (April 1940), we can say that he completely accepted my proposal. Because he himself said: "Here I can say that it is the 'bottom-wrapping principle' of Sichuan's emergent evolution theory. However, he used it on the structure of the universe, and I used it on the structure of knowledge." This is completely consistent with what I said in the article "The Organization of Knowledge" in Philosophical Review in September 1936: "I borrowed the two concepts from Morgan's emergent evolution theory. Because I think that these two relations can indeed explain the organization of knowledge."

Secondly, Mr. Zhang has gone out of Kant, not only seeking the construction of knowledge from the order of logic, but also explaining the individual's heart from the heart of society, and explaining the pattern of thought with cultural pattern. This has already entered Hegel's circle. The self is composed of the non-self. Of course, Mr. Zhang is not willing to go out of the scope of epistemology and follow Hegel to talk about cosmic phenomenology, but we can still apply Hegel's dialectic to explain that the development of knowledge is inseparable from the social background. Mr. Zhang is walking on this road, but has not clearly admitted it.

Furthermore, Mr. Zhang believes that there is no useless knowledge, all knowledge is convenient for adaptation. He said that truth is theoretical knowledge that is suitable for the needs of the times. This is the theme of Dewey's instrumentalism, see his book "Logic." The meaning in knowledge is related to human needs. Human beings are born without innate formats, but only desires and needs. Meaning occurs in human beings' continuous adaptation to the environment and changing the environment to meet their own needs. Mr. Zhang seems to have not fully used this point, but in general, it is enough to satisfy us.

There are a few other more subtle and specialized places that seem to be worth discussing, but such a short space cannot allow it, so I will have to talk about it later if I have the opportunity. Finally, there is one point that is particularly worth mentioning, that is, Mr. Zhang expresses such complex thoughts with a clear enumeration of treasures, talking eloquently, making people never tire of reading, and the language is clear and without ambiguity, which is not easy to achieve in philosophical writing. The appendix at the end of the book has been published in magazines such as The Eastern Miscellany, so I will not repeat it.

### A Good Example for the Publishing Industry: British Newspaper Magnate Lord Northcliffe

— Qinghe

Everyone who studies journalism knows about the British Lord Northcliffe. He is the owner of The Times of London. His success has five reasons:

(1) He had a smart father and a wise mother.

(2) He has great courage, likes to be independent, and has the talent and patience to endure.

(3) He always has concrete plans and unchanging policies when doing things.

(4) He focuses on the overall situation of the business and does not spend effort on trivial matters.

(5) He was the first person in Britain to recognize the great power of newspapers.

His starting point is also very interesting. It was because a friend of his father gave him a box of toys, which contained some lead letters, which aroused his keen interest, although his father hoped that he would become a lawyer.

At the age of fifteen, he went to work as a reporter in a newspaper office. At the age of sixteen, he was able to write short essays and send them to major newspapers for publication.

Only new and strange things can arouse his attention, such as bicycles, engines, and buildings. In 1888, he founded a weekly magazine called "Answers." In 1894, he bought an evening newspaper for £25,000. At that time, the newspaper's business had failed and had already lost £300,000. After he took over, he made £14,000 in the first year.

In 1896, he also published the Daily Mail, which is now the most widely sold daily newspaper. In 1908, he became the owner of The Times of London, a newspaper that can influence public opinion. Lincoln once said that it is as great as the Mississippi River in the United States.

He wakes up two hours earlier than anyone else, and has already read the day's newspapers and knows tomorrow's comments by seven o'clock. By the time of breakfast, most of the important things of the day have already been done.

His greatest proposition is: "A person must constantly learn and must not be satisfied with the current position."

### Recommendation for Young People: A Book on Progressive Philosophy of Life

— Yang Congjun

"New Outlook on Life" by Luo Jialun, Commercial Press Edition

I often feel that among the vast group of young people, there is often a lack of motivation in life. Many young people lack a consistent life ideal, let alone a central belief. They lack a correct understanding of life. Why they came into this world and what they should do for the people seem to be rarely considered. Many people say that today's youth, whether in daily life or in work performance, lack enthusiasm. Everyone lacks faith in life and just drifts along with the turbulent times, languishing and degenerating in depression.

In an era of historical transition and the interchange of the old and new worlds, our most urgent task is to rescue young people from the abyss of depression and inject some light of life into their lives. We believe that those who care about education and culture should first take on the responsibility of "relieving the intellectual famine of young people." We must guide young people on the right path of progress on the multi-pronged journey of life and not let them wander at crossroads.

Guiding young people to absorb the ideas of a progressive philosophy of life can solve the famine of thought among them. The meaning of life must be understood correctly, and the purpose of life must be recognized clearly. Romain Rolland said, "Life is a battle." Yes, people living in a great era should fight against real life with a fighting spirit. Losing the power to fight will dim the light of life. But how to fight life, how to prepare the power to fight, it is very important to establish a kind of fighting philosophy of life, a kind of progressive and perfect outlook on life.

The recently published "New Outlook on Life" by Commercial Press is indeed a publication that is very suitable for the needs of young people. The author, Mr. Luo Jialun, is a senior figure in the educational and academic circles and a mentor of the life and thought of young people across the country. Although this book is only over a hundred pages long, it can represent a correct philosophy of life. Mr. Luo, with his unique insightful views, peered into the entirety of life. In this turbulent era, the reason why young people lack the motivation to live, why they are depressed, why they lack enthusiasm, why they feel confused and hesitant, why they are trapped in anxiety and boredom, is because young people have not established a correct outlook on life. Therefore, young people today must re-evaluate the value of life based on their own knowledge and experience. Mr. Luo's work first tells us that the new philosophy of life does not rely solely on authority and tradition, but must examine the requirements of reality and the conditions of life with reason. The new philosophy of life does not only talk about conscience and moral sense, but about the cultivation of the entire life and its character and demeanor, and the establishment of an ideal life from experience and habits. Mr. Luo also pointed out the importance of the value of life. The old values should not be completely obliterated, but must be re-evaluated to become new value standards in order to realize the ideal of a complete life.

Looking at the book as a whole, a central idea can be found: to improve life and transform life. The author encourages us to pursue a noble and great life, a solemn and magnificent life. He believes that life is dynamic, because the universe is dynamic and constantly moving. Life is a part of the universe, so it is also dynamic and constantly moving. As the author said, if we smash the static view of life and rebuild the dynamic view of life, how great, noble, solemn, and magnificent life should be! The author further points out the creative view of life and the view of a greater self. He wants us to constantly exert creative wisdom, not only to be worthy of our own lives, but also to be worthy of the accumulation of the blood and sweat of our predecessors. The view of life of the greater self is to integrate the "individual" and the "people" to increase the power of life and expand the meaning of life.

Seeing that young people are weak, lacking vitality and enthusiasm, Mr. Luo put forward the "life of strength," asking us to constantly work hard upwards, forwards, and outwards. At the same time, he also elaborated on "As Heaven maintains vigor through movement, a gentleman should constantly strive for self-improvement," asking us to always be the master of our will, not slaves. Creating a new life also requires starting with creating a new atmosphere. Mr. Luo is indeed justified in this point. The evolution of society is really not achieved by the majority of people who are addicted to the mire of the present, but by a few unique and outstanding people who transcend it. A mediocre life is indeed not worth living. We should have the awareness and confidence to establish a new philosophy of life. When Mr. Luo wrote these articles, the Chinese nation was suffering unprecedented disasters. He said many things to encourage young people to carry forward national integrity and establish a fighting outlook on life, which is very sufficient to cultivate broad and profound emotions and revive the decadent spirit!

This book is divided into sixteen chapters. It was originally a systematic lecture given by the author to all students after the National Central University moved to the west. It looks like zero articles, but because the author has a consistent cultivation of life philosophy, we cannot find any inconsistent or incoherent places in thought. I think that during the Anti-Japanese War, this was a major harvest of Mr. Luo's thought. We always feel that the traditional monographs on the philosophy of life that are divided into categories are too "textbook-like," but Mr. Luo's "New Outlook on Life" corrects this defect. He can use the famous sayings and deeds of Chinese and foreign thinkers to bring up the parts that are considered lacking or poor in the thoughts and lives of the Chinese people as the center of discussion, and develop many new ideas—ideas full of strength. The author also admits that this book is a summary of his personal efforts in thinking. I believe that the author did this work with infinite enthusiasm.

The author can also use his clear and lively writing style to extol the essence of his thoughts, so this book is very fluent to read and has none of the dry and boring defects of ordinary books on the philosophy of life. Here, let me quote a few paragraphs from his "Preface":

"The vast blood, gushing like rain, and the unprecedented flood that the era has set off, can not make us, who stand at the juncture of survival, have a new examination and understanding of the whole life question?

"We want to survive, and we want to survive meaningfully, so how can we not pursue the meaning of survival and the way to achieve this meaningful survival?

"In this creative universe created by true space and time, our lives are dynamic, real, and even more creative. Our thinking cannot go backwards. We cannot retreat with the times, nor can we roll forward with the times. We must grasp the giant wheel of the times and consciously push it towards our glorious ideals.

"We must wield the sword and cut off the stale. We must clear away the toxins of outdated, decadent, weak, dependent, cowardly, and all era-incorrect thoughts and lives. It is not only cleaning the place to cultivate new muscles, but also expecting to grow new bones.

"This great era requires us to have powerful thoughts, powerful actions, and powerful lives."

After reading the above paragraphs, we can know with what enthusiasm the author intends to influence the young men and women who are wandering in the vast society. I would like to once again recommend this collection of progressive philosophical essays on life, "New Outlook on Life," to the Chinese children who are full of hope with a sincere attitude.
