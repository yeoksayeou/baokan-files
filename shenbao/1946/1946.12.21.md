President Chiang and his wife were both present. The presidium was rotated to the second group, including Bai Chongxi, with Cheng Ji serving as chairman. After the formalities, the chairman announced that the agenda for the day was a report on the results of the comprehensive review committee's examination. Chen Cheng, convener of the comprehensive committee, then presented the report. Chen first reported on the scope of the group's review and the issues examined, then explained the review and amendment situation item by item (the full text is in the left corner, relevant content). At 10:50 AM, Chen delivered a lengthy report on countless items in one breath over the course of one hour and ten minutes. He paused to ask the chairman if he could take a break, but the chairman instructed him to continue. Exhausted, he sped through the remainder of the report, which was met with enthusiastic applause from the audience. At that point, the chairman announced that there would be no discussion that day. Secretary-General Hong then reported that representatives could submit opinions on the comprehensive review results in accordance with Article 24 of the Assembly's rules of procedure. Subsequently, female representatives such as Huang Peilan vied to speak, questioning why the comprehensive committee had omitted the report on the number of female representatives selected for the Legislative Yuan. The Secretary-General repeatedly announced that there would be no discussion that day, and then immediately adjourned the meeting. This concluded the first reading phase of the constitution-making process.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] The National Assembly Presidium held its 22nd meeting at 11:00 AM on the 20th, with over thirty attendees, including Bai Chongxi. It was resolved to extend the Assembly session by two more days, until the 24th. The thirteenth plenary session will be held at 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM on the 21st, with Hu Shi serving as chairman in the morning and Zhu Jiahua in the afternoon. It is also reported that the presidium held two meetings the previous day and yesterday, during which they discussed for a long time and drafted five articles on the procedures for implementing constitutional governance, which will be submitted to the Assembly for discussion.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The inaugural meeting of the First National Assembly Female Representatives Association was held at the Lizi Society this afternoon. The directors elected on the spot were Luo Heng, Qian Jianqiu, Bao Deming, Pi Yishu, Shen Huiyun, Zhou Shuyun, Zhang Mojun, Huang Peilan, Qian Yonghe, Lü Xiaodao, and Wang Liwen. The alternate directors were Zhang Bangzhen, Kuai Xia, Chen Yiyun, Wang Xiaoying, and Luo Jingxuan. The supervisors were Lü Yunzhang, Luo Jingxuan, Cui Zhenhua, Cui Shuyan, and Wu Yifang. The alternate supervisors were Ji Qingyi, Hu Lan, and Wang Xiaohua. All unanimously elected Madame Chiang as the chairperson and discussed fully supporting the National Assembly's quota for women, which should account for 20%.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Huang Boying, a National Assembly representative directly selected by the National Government, was unable to attend the Assembly due to circumstances. His name has been removed from the register, and Chen Gun will fill the vacancy by order.

### Provisional Meeting of the Comprehensive Review Committee; Final Review of Several Issues

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] The Comprehensive Review Committee for the Draft Constitution held a provisional meeting at 9:45 PM on the 20th to conduct a final review of several unresolved issues. Eighty-three people attended, including Lin Bin and Shi Shangkuan. Chairman Chen Cheng first reported on the issue of the capital city. As discussions among various parties are still underway, it will be reserved for final review.

Next, the committee discussed several unresolved issues. More than forty people, including Chen Cheng, proposed changing the word "all" in the second and third paragraphs of Article 58 to "attending," which was passed without objection. Next, the committee discussed the quota for women in elections, resolving that "various elections should stipulate a quota for women, and the specific measures shall be determined by law." The original wording passed by the First Review Committee, "at least accounting for 20%," was deleted.

Next, the committee discussed the quota for National Assembly representatives from inland areas with special customs, resolving that "various elections should stipulate a quota for National Assembly representatives from inland areas with special customs, and the election measures shall be determined by law." Regarding the issue of the Tibetan local autonomy system, the original provision stated that "the Constitution should guarantee it." Several representatives believed that the phrase "the Constitution should guarantee it" was inappropriate and unanimously agreed to delete "the Constitution," changing it to "The Tibetan local autonomy system should be guaranteed." Finally, the committee discussed adding clauses on recall, initiative, and referendum to the Constitution. This proposal had already been passed in principle and submitted to the editing group for textual amendments. Ruan Yisheng and others believed that the Chinese people had no experience with recall, etc., and if the Constitution only made provisions for the three types of civil rights for the president, it would inevitably cause problems in the future and increase the difficulty for future National Assemblies. It would be better to have these provisions determined by law. Jiang Yiping also believed that recall could be stipulated in the Constitution, but it seemed more appropriate to stipulate initiative and referendum by law. Ren Zhuoxuan held a different view, believing that the National Assembly did not have enough experience with elections, let alone recall, and this should not be a reason for not including recall, etc., in the Constitution. He believed that the Constitution should have some provisions in principle regarding the three types of civil rights mentioned above. Lin Bin also argued that it would be best to have provisions in principle to serve as the basis for future legislation. Other representatives also raised several amendment suggestions regarding the wording. Chen Cheng also believed that regarding recall, Article 132 of the Draft Constitution already stipulated that "those elected may be recalled by the original electoral district in accordance with the law," so there was no need to make further provisions. It was appropriate to leave the implementation of initiative and referendum to separate legislation. The representatives generally agreed and resolved that the five articles added by the First Review Committee regarding recall were already provided for in the original draft and would not be stipulated again. The exercise of the rights of initiative and referendum would be determined by law.

After the discussion was completed, Kong Geng and thirty other people made a temporary motion, hoping that there could be provisions regarding the transitional clauses for constitutional governance. Kong explained briefly that the main tasks of this National Assembly were twofold: to draft the Constitution and to determine the date of its implementation. The work of drafting the Constitution was already 80-90% complete, but it would be impossible to immediately implement the Constitution after its completion. However, constitutional governance "must be implemented to some extent." Before the president is elected, how the Constitution will be promulgated is a matter of great importance to the country, the nation, and the people's safety. He hoped that the "Law on the Implementation Procedures of the Constitution" could be attached to the Constitution, otherwise it would become baseless and lead to non-compliance with the law. He also declared that this matter was the responsibility of the representatives and had nothing to do with parties or stubbornness. Finally, it was unanimously resolved to submit this temporary motion to the presidium. At this point, a representative suddenly requested a discussion on the issue of the capital city. The attendees generally believed that this matter still needed to be studied and would not be discussed today. The meeting adjourned at around 11:00 PM.

Telegram: (1) News telegram permits will have prepaid telegram fees. If prepayment is not made, a store guarantee can be requested. (2) Ordinary news telegrams will be sent earlier.

### Conclusion of the Comprehensive Review Committee (Continued)

(3) The issue of adding clauses on the local autonomy system of Tibet: The medical report changed the clauses drafted by the Eighth Review Committee to the following: 1. The local autonomy system of the Mongolian leagues and banners shall be determined by law. 2. The local autonomy system of Tibet shall be determined by law. Because Tibetan representatives raised opinions, believing that Tibet and Mongolia were different, this letter was read aloud at the same time. Jiang Yiping said that this provision was the result of the hard work of the review committee, and if it was not added, Tibet would be treated the same as a province. Adding this article would provide some protection for the current system of Tibet. Tibetan representative Yexi Daje said, "Do not add it." Luo Jialun once said: Tibet is a part of the Republic of China. We welcome Tibet's inclusion. This shows that it is not divided, but unified. The chairman declared that Bai Chongxi, the convener of the Eighth Group, would report. Bai explained that at the time of adding Article "121", it was made clear that Tibet would still retain its current political system and would never be changed. However, the Tibetan representatives said that they came here to participate in the conference and were not ordered to discuss this matter. However, I told them that the constitution already stipulates that all ethnic groups are equal, and Tibet is one of the five major ethnic groups. The Tibetan government is also a local government, belonging to the local system. Therefore, it was classified into the local system group during the review. They asked whether Tibet should be included in the local system. I said that Tibet is a part of the Republic of China, which is recognized by the world. They did not want to include the word "Tibet" in the constitution. I said that it must be there. If there is none, Tibet will not be able to enjoy any national benefits. The situation in Tibet is special, and it has been like this since the history of the Republic of China. We should preserve its special system. Yexi Daje reiterated: We do not want to add such clauses, because we are here to participate in the conference to deepen feelings and promote intimacy with each other. If such a provision is made, it will definitely affect the feelings of both parties. Later, Jiang Yiping expressed that he could authorize the editing group to consult with the Tibetan representatives and then discuss it again. Soon after, Zhuan Qinian, Liu Zongping and others spoke, all expressing their willingness to add this article, but the wording could be modified appropriately. After discussion, the entire session declared that the former of the two added articles was passed without objection. (To be continued)

"The three foreign ministers exchanged views on the situation in China, and they agreed that there was a need for a united and democratic China under the national government, with broad participation of democratic figures in all departments of the national government, and a cessation of civil war. They also affirmed their determination to abide by the policy of not interfering in China's internal enemy."

### Stabilization of the International Monetary System: International Monetary Fund Announces Commencement on March 2nd of Next Year; Exchange Rates of Various Countries Do Not Correspond to Actual Currency Values

[United Press Washington 19th] The International Monetary Fund, established for a year, announced today that it will commence its currency stabilization work on March 2nd of next year. This is largely based on the current exchange rates of various countries. Among the 39 member states, the Fund has already stipulated legal parities for 30, based on existing regulations, but declared that it does not guarantee their value. The currency values of China, Vietnam, and the Dutch East Indies were postponed due to requests from China, France, and the Netherlands. Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Greece, Poland, and Yugoslavia also postponed the stipulation of their currency values at their own requests. The Fund acknowledged that the accepted exchange rates do not correspond to their actual currency values, but abandoning this would increase the risk of inflation for many countries. The Fund's Managing Director, Mr. Gutt, told reporters today that the Fund does not adopt a pegged exchange rate system, and each member state should maintain its own currency value. The Fund is aware that black markets exist in all countries, where the local currency value is below the legal exchange rate accepted by the Fund, but it does not take this into account. The Fund stipulates the legal parity of each country's currency and sets the deadline for commencing currency stabilization work as March 1st of next year. Member states must pay their respective shares of the total fund of $7.5 billion before this deadline. The United States contributes the most, reaching $2.75 billion. Once the full amount is collected, member states needing foreign currency for international trade and other transactions can apply to the Fund for short-term loans.

[Agence France-Presse Paris 20th] The International Monetary Fund held its sixth meeting here yesterday, chaired by Mr. Hill of the British Employers' Confederation, with the main topic of discussion being the U.S. proposal to expand world trade.

### Ultimatum Issued to Vietnam; France Commences Military Action; Overseas Chinese District Still Under Vietnamese Army Control

[Central News Agency Hanoi 19th] According to a communiqué from the Vietnamese government, French troops in Haiphong have issued an ultimatum to the Vietnamese government, demanding that the Vietnamese army remove all fortifications and obstacles in the city. There were no gunshots heard in the city today, and the surface appears extremely calm, but French and Vietnamese troops still confront each other on the streets.

Fortifications in the district are being strengthened.

All buildings belonging to the Viet Minh government here have been occupied by French troops, but no conflict has occurred. The reason for the French troops' occupation of these buildings is that Vietnamese troops often fire on passersby from inside the buildings. Furthermore, the Vietnamese Minister of Defense recently sent a letter to General Morlière, the French commissioner in Tokyo and Northern Annam, protesting the French army's attack on Vietnamese troops stationed at the border between Vietnam and China. A spokesperson for the French High Commissioner's office in Vietnam commented that the French army did not attack the Vietnamese army, but only retaliated when attacked by the Vietnamese.

[Agence France-Presse Paris 10th] According to unconfirmed reports here, Viet Minh troops have launched a strict offensive against French troops in Hanoi, and Mr. Santini, the French commissioner in Tonkin, has been seriously injured.

[Central News Agency Kunming 19th] Yang Jianzhong and Yan Renfu, representatives of the overseas Chinese community in Vietnam, flew to Kunming from Hanoi and are scheduled to fly to Shanghai and then to Nanjing on the morning of the 20th.

### Nguyen Tuong Tam and Others in Nanjing Report on the Political Situation in Vietnam

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 20th] Nguyen Tuong Tam, a member of the Central Standing Committee of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party, and Nguyen Hai Than, Chairman of the Vietnamese Revolutionary Alliance, held a press conference in Nanjing at 3 p.m. on the 20th to report on the general political situation in Vietnam. They stated that the two revolutionary organizations mentioned above, along with the Viet Minh (Vietnam Independence League), originally formed a coalition government in Vietnam to strive for Vietnam's independence. Unexpectedly, on September 14th of this year, Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the Viet Minh, secretly went to Paris and signed a humiliating treaty with the French government, forming a dictatorial government. All the senior positions are held by the French. The above two parties, seeing Ho's dictatorship, fled Vietnam to China to appeal to all parties, hoping to gain sympathy and to enable the Chinese people to understand the situation of the Vietnamese independence movement. Mr. Nguyen and others also said that the Nationalist Party they formed is based on the Three Principles of the People. They "cannot return to Vietnam for the time being."

### Exchange of Notes Between China and France on Temporary Measures for the Sino-Vietnamese Airline

(A) Note from Wang Shijie, Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, to Mr. Meyrier, Ambassador of France to China

In order to promote relations and exchanges between China and France, I, on behalf of the Chinese government, hereby propose to Your Excellency the following temporary measures for the establishment of an airline between China and Vietnam:

(1) The Chinese government permits French airlines to operate commercial flights between any location in Vietnam and Shanghai, and may use Guangzhou and Xiamen as technical landing stations.

Based on the principle of reciprocity, the French government permits the Central Air Transport Corporation or China Airlines to operate commercial flights between any location in China and Saigon, and may use Hanoi and Tourane as technical landing stations.

The designated company (Chinese or English) may load and unload passengers, goods and mail in Saigon, and the French airline may operate the same business in Shanghai.

(2) The flight frequency of the airlines of both parties shall be temporarily set at once every two weeks. The airlines of both parties may increase it to once a week after notifying the other party's government. In addition, they may apply for additional flights as needed, or apply for additional flight frequencies separately.

(3) The use of Hong Kong as a landing station may be stipulated in the flight routes of both companies.

(4) The implementation details of the agreed aviation business shall be in accordance with the documents agreed upon at the Chicago Conference, especially the provisions of the International Civil Aviation Convention.

Flight times, price lists, and transportation volume shall be agreed upon by the two companies and submitted to their respective governments for approval. The technical assistance and movements that the two companies can mutually provide on aviation within their respective territories shall be agreed upon by the respective companies.

If the above proposals are approved by the French government, this note and Your Excellency's reply shall constitute a temporary agreement between the two governments. The temporary agreement shall be valid for six months and shall take effect on January 1, 1947, the 36th year of the Republic of China.

Three months before the expiration of the agreement, the two governments shall exchange notes to extend the temporary agreement if necessary, and the term shall be stipulated in the exchange of notes. Otherwise, either government shall notify the other party of its intention not to extend the agreement three months before the expiration of the agreement.

Before the official commencement of air transport operations on January 1, 1947, in accordance with regulations, the aircraft of the aforementioned companies may conduct several test flights. These test flights may engage in commercial transportation on this route, transporting passengers, goods and mail, but both companies shall notify each other of the dates and number of flights so that they can be submitted to their national government for approval in advance.

Both parties also agree that within the validity period of the temporary agreement, the two governments shall negotiate a broad agreement within the scope of the agreements concluded in Chicago. If possible, the agreement should especially include the extension of the Chinese route to Paris and the extension of the French route to Tokyo.

I shall express my highest respect to Your Excellency the Ambassador again. To His Excellency Mr. Meyrier, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the French Republic to China. December 14, 1946, in Nanjing, Republic of China.

### Zhang Hanying Talks About Returning from Inspection: The Yellow River is Extremely Rich in Treasures; Flood Control is Not Without a Solution

[Central News Agency Nanjing 20th] The Water Conservancy Commission organized a Yellow River Exploration and Research Group this summer, and appointed Mr. Zhang Hanying, a member of the Commission, as the leader, and Liu Derun, Lei Hongji, Li Fudu, Zhou Li, Zhang Erjun, Tan Baotai and others as members. They set out from Nanjing in July of this year and conducted an on-the-spot survey along the river for four months. They have now returned to Nanjing. A reporter visited Zhang Hanying, who told them the following:

(1) Itinerary: After leaving Nanjing, the group went upstream along the river at the junction of Henan and Shanxi, and then followed the junction of Shanxi and Shaanxi to Hukou, and then up to Guide in Qinghai to study the upper reaches. Then, from Lanzhou, they followed the river to Ningxia, bypassed the Hetao in the north, and went east to Baotou to reach Guihua. The only section that could not be reached above the middle reaches was the section from Tuoketuo to Hukou.

(2) Research Objectives: One is to reduce the flood disasters in the lower reaches, and the other is to investigate whether there are any resources in the Yellow River that can be developed. Flood control requires equal emphasis on the upper and lower reaches. In the upper reaches, it is necessary to control floods and reduce sediment to prevent dangerous floods and excessive silting in the lower reaches. In the lower reaches, it is necessary to repair dikes and adjust river channels to keep the water flow in line. Unfortunately, the lower reaches could not be inspected because the old channel has not been restored.

(3) Building Reservoirs in the Middle Reaches: Only in terms of the upper and middle reaches, to control floods, reservoirs can be built in the Sanmenxia of Shan County and the Balihutong of Xin'an County. Building a dam in Xin'an can control the flow in the lower reaches to below 10,000 cubic meters per second. Based on this flow, adjusting the river channel in the lower reaches will definitely prevent floods from leaving the channel, and it can generate 1.2 million horsepower of electricity. However, the problem of reservoir siltation is very important. To seek relief, other projects must be implemented to reduce the downward flow of floods, such as bank protection, gully prevention, and land use. The construction of other Yongku projects can also reduce the severity of siltation in this reservoir. For example, building another reservoir in Shimen upstream of Longmen at the junction of Shanxi and Shaanxi not only has great economic value, but also helps the Balihutong to store water and prevent sand. The success of the Shimen Yongku not only controls a part of the flood and stores a part of the sediment, but also generates 800,000 horsepower of electricity, irrigates the Weibei Plateau and the lower reaches of the Fenhe River, and solves a part of the transportation problem. The purpose of the Balihutong Reservoir is to control floods, while the Shimen Reservoir is for multi-objective development and is very economically valuable. Cheap water and electricity are the source of industrial development. In the early days, the industrial reason was not yet developed, or the bitter origin could not be exhausted, but it could be used to raise river water to supply the fields on the highlands. This is what the local area urgently needs at present. The largest wealth in North China is land, and the reason why land production is not abundant is due to insufficient rainfall. Therefore, the electricity generated by the river water is used to raise the river water to irrigate the fields, which serves both purposes, and there is no worry that electricity will not be sold.

(4) Irrigation of the Sui-Ning Plain: The Ningxia-Suiyuan Plain is an excellent place to use the Yellow River to irrigate fields. Although it is currently in a rudimentary state, it has not been fully utilized. Ningxia and Suiyuan are located in the frontier, and the plains along the river are the granary of the border area, which is of great importance to national defense. The Anti-Japanese War has provided an example of this. Of the 10 million mu of land that can be irrigated in the Houtao, only one-eleventh of it is currently irrigated. The plains of Baotou and Guihua have not been calculated. The current irrigated area in Ningxia is about 3 million mu, which can be doubled after improvement. Outside the Ning-Sui Plain are the Helan Mountains, the Lang Mountains, and the Ula Mountains, which are also natural defense lines. Being there, one feels even more the need to improve Ning-Sui water conservancy in advance. In addition, when we traveled by sheepskin raft through the Yellow River gorges between Gansu and Ningxia, we felt that there were many places that could be utilized. If a dam is built in the Black Mountain Gorge to raise the water level, the sandy wasteland north of Tongxin City can be irrigated and cultivated. There are many other places that can be utilized.

(5) Gains and Losses of the Japanese Yellow River Management Plan: The purpose of the Japanese Yellow River management was to develop the electricity of the Fei River, without coordinating with other industries, which is not what our country needs. Therefore, its plan needs further study.

Zhang finally said that this inspection was limited by time. Not only did he not go to the lower reaches, but he also did not go to the major tributaries, which he deeply regretted. Because to manage the Yellow River, the upper, middle and lower reaches must be combined, and the main and branch must be planned together. However, based on the inspections so far, it is known that it is not impossible to prevent and control the Yellow River floods, and there are many treasures that can be used to develop the economic undertakings of the nine provinces.

### Ministry of Social Affairs Allocates One Million to Reward Workers of Zhongxing Coal Mine

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou 20th] Before the Communist army withdrew from Zaozhuang Zhongxing Coal Mine on October 8, they destroyed two generators.

The Ministry of Social Affairs has awarded a bonus of one million yuan to reward them.

### Editorial: The Beginning of International Currency Control

The International Monetary Fund announced yesterday the legal exchange rates of its member countries, scheduled to take effect on March 1st of next year. However, eight countries, including ours, did not participate and requested a postponement. This is a significant international event in recent times. Its importance lies not in the setting of exchange rate standards, but in the fact that member countries of the International Monetary Fund feel that there should be further international cooperation and control over their respective currencies. A country's control over its own currency is originally within its sovereignty, and it should have the freedom to handle it without international control. Therefore, regarding the regulation of its own currency exchange rate, that is, the increase or decrease in the external value of its currency, each country originally had full authority. However, the increase or decrease in the external value of a country's currency not only affects the economic prosperity of that country itself, but also often involves international interests. Therefore, in the past, in order to determine currency exchange rate standards, there were agreements between countries regarding currency exchange rates; such as during the Great Depression of 1929, there were agreements between Britain and the United States regarding currency exchange rates. At the same time, in order to stabilize our country's silver-based monetary system, there was also the Silver Agreement to stabilize the price of silver and maintain our country's monetary system.

The announcement of legal exchange rates by the member countries of the International Monetary Fund this time indicates a fact: that countries have accepted the principle of international control over the regulation of currency exchange rates. In other words, a country has transferred part of its sovereignty to an international organization in its control over its currency. This is the reason why the announcement of legal exchange rates by the member countries of the International Monetary Fund this time is a significant international event in recent times. As stated in the communiqué issued by the fund: "The main significance of this measure lies not in the announced exchange rates, but in the fact that the participating countries have established a system under which they pledge to cooperate in maintaining exchange rate stability, and will not change the exchange rates of their respective currencies except in accordance with the terms stipulated in the Fund Agreement, in order to cooperate in achieving the purposes of the Fund." What deserves our attention is "except in accordance with the terms stipulated in the Fund Agreement, the legal exchange rates of the respective currencies will not be changed." From this, it can be seen that the increase or decrease in the external value of a country's currency cannot be handled arbitrarily by a country, but must be done with international cooperation.

This is a good phenomenon of closer international cooperation. The currency chaos that occurred in Europe after the First World War is still fresh in our memory. In order to prevent the recurrence of this situation, the establishment of the International Monetary Fund is aimed at stabilizing the finances of various countries after the war. A country's financial instability not only causes suffering to itself, but also affects international affairs. The regulation of the legal exchange rates of various currencies this time, even if there are some discrepancies with the actual situation, is acceptable as long as the countries concerned are willing to accept it. Moreover, the regulation of legal exchange rates does not mean that the legal exchange rates will never change. On the contrary, an important responsibility of the International Monetary Fund is to review at any time whether it is necessary to change the previously set legal exchange rates. Therefore, the announcement of legal exchange rates by the member countries of the International Monetary Fund this time is only the initial step in the international control of currencies. The previously set legal exchange rates can be changed by the Fund if necessary in the future; the Fund can also use its funds to maintain the monetary systems of member countries. This is truly a good manifestation of the spirit of "one world."

What we regret is that such an important international initiative, without the participation of the Soviet Union, inevitably leaves some regrets in "one world." The Soviet Union is a socialist country, and its economic system is different from other countries; but what we do not understand is why there cannot be international monetary control cooperation in different economic systems. We believe that this shortcoming is definitely not a sign of the so-called "two worlds"; in the international control of currencies, just as in the international control of armaments, we also need the cooperation of the Soviet Union.

As for the postponement of the announcement of our country's legal currency exchange rate, it was originally inevitable due to the current objective facts. However, the postponement is only a matter of time, and the problem itself does not disappear due to the delay in time. According to the published legal exchange rates of various countries, most of them are based on the existing exchange rates, such as the conversion of 119.201 francs to one US dollar, which seems to be based on the existing official exchange rate. There are many problems surrounding our country's legal exchange rate. Since the International Monetary Fund can review the timing and change the legal exchange rate at any time, it seems that we do not necessarily need to overemphasize the announcement of the initial legal exchange rate. In that case, the financial authorities must have plans; in terms of the current situation, the request for our country to postpone the announcement of the legal exchange rate at this time seems to be a timely measure and should be commended.

### Full Line of Ping Sui Railway Open to Traffic; Operation of Jiaoji Railway is Good

[Report from Gui Sui by our newspaper on the 20th] The Datong-Zhangtan section officially opened to traffic on the 20th, with mixed trains running in both directions daily, offering only third-class passenger service and no luggage or freight service. With this, the entire Ping Sui Railway has been opened to traffic.

[Report from Beiping by our newspaper on the 20th] The deputy director of the Ping Han Railway Bureau stated that the Ping Bao section is scheduled to officially open to traffic on New Year's Day.

[Report from Jinan by Central News Agency on the 20th] Since the Jiaoji Railway fully resumed traffic on the 16th, the situation has been good in recent days.

### Commercial Vessels Successfully Sail Directly to Jingu After Passing Through Tanggu New Port Ship Lock, Opening a New Chapter in the History of Northern Shipping Lines

[News from Tianjin] In the past, northern shipping line vessels sailing to Tianjin from various ports, with a load capacity of 3,000 tons or more, were unable to enter the Haihe River due to the Lanmensha sandbar in front of Dagu Port. They had to anchor outside the Lanmensha and use barges to transport passengers and cargo to Tanggu or Tianjin, requiring a four- or five-day stop outside the port, resulting in significant delays and losses. Since the completion and successful trial voyage of the Tanggu New Port gate on the 15th of this month, the Xinhai Shanghai, a vessel of the Tongyun Company with a draft of 15 feet and 4 inches, arrived outside Ben Gukou on the 16th. Because the water depth of the Lanmensha sandbar was only 12 feet, it could not enter the port. On the 17th at 9:00 a.m., it sailed into Tanggu New Port, passed through the gate (which took only 21 minutes), and entered the Haihe River, mooring at the old Tanggu pier, unloading part of the cargo, and then continuing to Tianjin. Also, on the morning of the 19th, the Jingxing, a vessel of 3,500 tons, and the Zhongfu, a vessel of 1,200 tons, also passed smoothly through the Tanggu New Port ship lock. In the future, vessels of more than 3,000 tons going to Jin Gu from places such as Shanghai will not be obstructed by the Lanmensha sandbar outside Dagu Port and can enter Jin Gu, which is good news for northern shipping lines.

### Suppression of Bandits in Southern Jiangsu Basically Completed

[Report from Suzhou by our newspaper on the 20th] The reporter of this newspaper met a senior staff officer of the Wuxi Command Post who had just come to Suzhou from Wuxi on the 20th and talked about the issue of bandit suppression in southern Jiangsu. He replied in a very pleasant tone: After the suppression of bandits in southern Jiangsu was launched, it was divided into four suppression zones and three joint defense zones, with responsibility at different levels. Recently, the Wuxi Command Post has ordered the abolition of the command posts in the Taihu and Yangcheng areas and the Chengxi Joint Defense Zone. At present, only the Maoshan and Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui border suppression zones and the Pudong and Changdanyang joint defense zones remain in operation.

[United Press, Lake Success, 19th] The United Nations Security Council today unanimously approved a US proposal to send a committee to the Balkans to investigate disputes in the border areas of Greece and its neighboring countries.

Egypt and the United Kingdom abstained from voting, and the other nine countries voted in favor. However, because the discussion only involved procedural issues, the United Kingdom's veto power was not exercised. The passage of the resolution was due to mutual concessions from both sides of the dispute. Soviet representative Gromyko no longer insisted that the scope of the investigation include the domestic situation in Greece, and US representative Johnson also accepted Pieranti's proposal to expand the scope of the investigation, not limited to the border area. It was decided by a vote of eight to two that the investigation team would be composed of one representative from each of the eleven countries on the Security Council.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 19th] The Security Council today approved the establishment of an investigation team to go to the northern border of Greece to investigate disputes.

The team may go to northern Greece, and if necessary, may go to any area of Greece, Albania, or Yugoslavia for investigation in order to fully investigate the cause of the Greek border dispute. In addition, the Security Council has notified Secretary-General Lie to transmit this resolution to the countries concerned to facilitate the work. Each member of the team can choose their own assistant, and the Secretary-General has been asked to provide technical personnel.

### US Expands Bipartisan Cooperation; Currently Unlikely to Happen; Foreign Policy is the Responsibility of the President

[United Press International, Washington, 19th] The Republican Party's request to President Truman to expand bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy regarding China, Argentina, and Palestine has been met with a cold response from the White House. Republican Senator Vandenberg, who is about to become the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of the new Congress, made this request at a press conference here last Monday.

### The Most Lively Christmas in History in the United States

...In the past, Santa Claus used

cars to deliver gifts, but this year, he uses

airplanes and parachutes to deliver gifts, so that

in this way, the gifts really come like myths

said to be from heaven...

[US Information Service, Washington, 19th] Christmas celebrations in the United States will be ready this week. The commercial districts of various cities and towns are particularly crowded, and the sound of the Salvation Army's bells is scattered in every corner of the downtown area, collecting donations for the unfortunate. Department stores are crowded with people buying Christmas gifts, and people want to win the joy and surprise of their parents or children.

This Christmas is the most lively in the history of the United States. The merchant's trade volume in Christmas 1939 was US$4.5 billion, in 1945 it was US$8.5 billion, and this year it is expected to be US$10.5 billion.

According to the Department of Commerce, because there are too many shipments, there is no phenomenon of rushing to buy, but this year's Christmas is still the most lively. Although there have been many labor strikes recently, the production of consumer goods in 1946 has reached the highest figure. Companies give bonuses to employees, and they use them to buy Christmas gifts. As a result, tens of millions of yuan fell into the pockets of working people before Christmas. To give a few examples, Craven's Becan Electric Company issued a total of 1.5 million yuan in bonuses. Because various advertisements are very moving, Christmas shopping activities have already begun in mid-November.

In the past, Santa Claus used cars to deliver gifts, but this year, he has come up with a whimsical idea. The advertisements all depict the old man using airplanes and parachutes to distribute gifts. In this way, children are more convinced that Santa Claus can travel around the world on the same day and bring gifts to children.

Churches and radio broadcasting departments are broadcasting carols. Children, as usual, visit those who are sick and old in various families to give them comfort.

This year's Christmas Eve has been further promoted due to the successful conclusion of the United Nations General Assembly, as US representative Austin said, "The achievements of this time have foreshadowed that we can achieve security without war. With the effective promotion of the United Nations, peace will last forever."

### Shanghai Conscription is About to Begin; 40,000 Eligible Young Men; Organized into a 10,000-Man Strong Army; Training Focuses on Specialized Mechanization; Government Employees Must be Conscripted

[Reported by this newspaper] According to Lieutenant General Fu Zhengzheng, commander of the Shanghai Garrison District: According to central government regulations, this city is a conscription demonstration area, and the scale is larger than that of other provinces and cities. The so-called conscription is military service, which is the duty of every citizen, and the purpose is to train the people's physique and strengthen national defense. It is not the so-called "manpower requisition". Citizens of this city should work with peace of mind and not easily believe rumors. After conscription begins in this city, anyone who extorts, swindles, or evades military service will be severely punished.

The population of the Shanghai Garrison District is the largest of all districts in the country, totaling more than 8.8 million, and the jurisdiction covers 13 counties and cities. One is the Shanghai Group District, and the commander of the group district is Li Xiankai. The second is the Wuxian Group District, including Wuxian, Changshu, and Wujiang, and the person in charge is Commander Du Xu. The third is the Songjiang Group District, including Songjiang, Chuansha, Nanhui, and Jinshan, and the commander of the group district is Lu Yide. The Wuxian and Songjiang Group Districts have been established one after another and have begun conscripting soldiers. The Shanghai Group District is now in operation, but the address problem has not yet been resolved.

It is learned that about 1% of the residents of this city are eligible for conscription, that is, 40,000 people. After excluding those who are physically weak, deferred, or exempted, a lottery will be drawn from them, and the planned establishment is about 10,000 people. The Shanghai Group District has a higher level, and after enlistment, the training focuses on special forces, special industry soldiers, and fortress soldiers, all of which are mechanized weapons training. The service period is two years for ordinary soldiers and three years for special forces. After the expiration of the term, they will be discharged. Then, the second batch of training will be selected, and they can be called up for enlistment in the event of war.

Lieutenant General Fu went to Beijing on official business today, and plans to go to Chongqing around the 20th to end the original officer corps affairs, and return to Shanghai around the end of the year. During his absence from Shanghai, Deputy Commander Li Muliang is responsible.

### Australian Commercial Counsellor Hosts Press Conference to Inspect and Develop Trade in China

[Reported by this newspaper] Australian Commercial Counsellor Wooden came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago and held a cocktail party yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m. to entertain the press in this city. Mr. Wu stated that the purpose of this trip to China is to inspect the industrial and commercial situation in China as a basis for future trade development between the two countries. At present, the volume of trade between China and Australia is very small, because the output of various industrial and commercial products in Australia has recently been reduced due to the influence of labor, and due to war damage and inconvenient transportation in China, foreign trade has not yet entered the right track. It is hoped that there will be more development in the future.

When reporters asked for his opinion on the exchange rate between China and Australia, he said that the exchange rate between Chinese legal currency and Australian gold pounds is calculated based on US dollars, with four US dollars equal to one Australian pound, but in fact it should be a ratio of six to one.

Mr. Wu has been away from China for six years. From 1938 to 1941, he served as the vice president of the Australian Trade Commission, and then went to India and Singapore. He was captured by the Japanese during the war, and only regained his freedom after victory.

### Ohardt Case: The Only Female Defendant, Mrs. Mueller, is on Trial

Her job was to translate Russian telegrams intercepted by Italian telegraph operators into German. After the Japanese surrender, no one came to take over this translation agency. She and another translator, Stocke, completely burned all the translated telegram archives.

Mrs. Mueller is not the wife of Dr. Mueller, one of the defendants in the current Ohardt Bureau case. Her husband is now in Germany, and they have been separated since 1941.

### Immediately After Leaving Prison, Shen Fuchen Counter-Accuses: Ding Guitang is Accused of Collaborating with the Enemy; How is the Truth Being Investigated

[Reported by this newspaper] Ding Guitang, Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs and Director of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, was recently accused by Shen Fuchen, a former customs guard, of collaborating with the enemy, committing malfeasance for personal gain, oppressing the innocent, and harboring personnel, and reported to the relevant authorities. All of Ding's illegal acts from 1936 to 1946 were listed, and the case is currently under investigation by the agency that accepted the report.

Ding Guitang issued a statement on the case yesterday, saying: "After the victory, I was ordered to take over the customs, and everything was handled in accordance with the government's orders. Later, Commissioner Li Du, by the order of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, established the 'Examination Committee for Customs Officers in Occupied Areas', which was responsible for examining whether customs officials in occupied areas had any suspicion of collaborating with the enemy, etc., and the Customs Administration appointed many people as members of the Examination Committee. Shen Fuchen has been working in the customs for ten years. The committee found that he had reported the names of senior officials in the occupied areas in the rear to the Japanese customs authorities, so it was decided that Shen was suspected of collaborating with the enemy. The matter was submitted to the Chongqing Customs for approval by the Customs Administration, and Shen Fuchen should be dismissed and sent to the court for investigation. At that time, I was serving as the Commissioner of Customs, so I followed the telegram order and sent Shen to the court for investigation. In fact, this was not my idea." He then made a statement on the various accusations: "I have been serving in the customs for nearly 30 years and have always abided by the law. Sometimes, I have offended people because I was ordered to recruit and execute personnel. If I am indeed guilty of all the charges, I will be punished by law. If it is determined to be a false accusation, I will also pursue it according to law."

It is reported that Shen Fuchen was accused of being a traitor after the victory. After three months of investigation by the court, it was finally determined that there was insufficient evidence to release him.

### Ordered to Thoroughly Investigate the Armory Explosion Case; Vice Minister Qin Arrives in Shanghai for On-Site Inspection; The Trial May Be Completed and Returned to Beijing Within a Week; Director Yang Reports on the Process and Believes There is No Conspiracy

[Reported by this newspaper] Qin Dechun, Vice Minister of National Defense, was ordered to come to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the explosion case at the armory of the First Supply District of the Jiangwan Logistics Command and arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. Yang Jizeng, Director of the Ordnance Administration, Fu Wen, Commander of the First Supply District, and Mao Chenghua, Director of the Ordnance Department, all went to welcome him. After Vice Minister Qin got off the car, he was accompanied by Commander Fu to the reception center of the supply district for rest, and met with reporters from various newspapers and made a statement saying: "The government attaches great importance to the explosion case at the Jiangwan armory. As it is located in Shanghai, which is of international concern, it is a very unfortunate event. As for how to handle this case, it can only be decided after meeting with Director Yang, Commander Fu, and others. I have received the reports from Commissioner Lei Shaojie and Deputy Director Ling Chengxu in Beijing, but because they are both preliminary investigations, they can only be used as a reference during the preliminary hearing and must be discussed with all parties. Only after on-site investigation can the truth be clarified." Qin continued to say that he planned to spend a week in Shanghai to complete the trial of the case and then return to Beijing to report.

Qin immediately exchanged views with Director Yang. Yang told him about the investigation process and stated his feelings, saying: "The cause of the explosion, based on reports from all parties and the results of on-site investigation, should not involve any conspiracy. Because the destroyed truck at the explosion point was heavily damaged on the side facing the armory, while the outside part was not damaged at all. The bodies of the soldiers killed in the explosion were lying on their backs, and the soldiers who were injured and escaped were all injured in the back. This proves that the explosion started from the inside of the armory and the bombs exploded from the inside out. Moreover, five trucks of hand grenades were transported by the Zhejiang Supply Bureau that day. Three trucks were delivered in the morning, and most of the wooden boxes containing them were damaged. The wooden boxes of the two trucks delivered in the afternoon were intact. Therefore, the cause of the explosion may have been that the grenades exploded when they fell to the ground due to the damage of the wooden boxes during the sorting. Based on his past experience, the primer may be shaken when the hand grenade lands, which may cause an explosion. The only regret is the escape of Wang Renshan, the director of the branch warehouse, and Wu Rubiao and Chen Hanwen, the warehouse managers. If they only escaped out of fear of guilt, it would only make the investigation of this case more difficult."

### Inspecting the Bombed Site; Inquiring with Director Fu

At 3:00 p.m., Vice Minister Qin, accompanied by Director Yang, Commander Fu, Director Mao, Military Judge Bao, and others, drove to the scene of the accident in Jiangwan for on-site inspection. They patrolled the bombed site for a week, starting from the easternmost explosion point. At that time, armory director Fu Jimin was still supervising the warehouse soldiers to clean up the remains. Shrapnel was still visible everywhere inside and outside the warehouse, and the wreckage of the destroyed trucks was still in place. Unexploded shells and grenades were collected and placed separately. Vice Minister Qin briefly questioned Director Fu on the ruins of the starting point of the explosion. According to Fu, on the day of the accident, he was in the dormitory about 500 meters away from the warehouse when he suddenly heard the sound of hand grenades exploding. Knowing that something was wrong, he rushed down from the building and went to the vicinity of the warehouse, where he saw shrapnel flying and smoke billowing, and the explosion became louder and louder and out of control. As for Wang Renshan, the director of the branch warehouse who was on the run, he usually lived a very hard life and often wore a pair of torn cloth shoes on his feet. His family did come to Shanghai the day before the explosion. On the morning of the accident, Wang took his wife out, and in the afternoon after the accident, his wife was still seen in the cloth area at 6:00 p.m. It is said that Wang already knew about the warehouse accident and told his wife that he would go to rescue it, but he has been missing ever since. As for the warehouse managers Wu Rubiao and Chen Hanwen, they were still on the scene when the accident occurred, and then they fled, probably out of fear of responsibility. Only the warehouse director's tone was firm when he stated his case, but he was haggard and had a dark complexion, which showed his worries and hard work in the past few weeks. Vice Minister Qin immediately comforted him and instructed him to make up for the loss, serve with peace of mind, and be extra careful to make up for his mistakes.

### School Sanitation Equipment Expected to Improve Next Year; Fee Standards Already Decided

[Special Report] The city's Health Education Committee, recognizing the importance of school sanitation, has actively implemented a plan after careful calculation. However, as the cost of carrying out this work is quite large, and it is impossible to rely entirely on the city treasury for funding, it has decided to request the Education Bureau to issue an order to all schools to collect student health fees starting from the next semester. The collection methods are as follows: (1) The amount to be collected will remain the same as the resolution of the Health Education Committee. Municipal elementary schools will temporarily collect $2,000 per student per semester, municipal middle schools will temporarily collect $3,000, and private schools may increase the collection standard by 50% compared to municipal schools. Tuition-free students are exempt from collection. Vocational schools will charge fees according to the middle school standard, and collection will begin in the spring of the 36th year [1947]. (2) The Education Bureau will order all schools to collect and remit the fees together when collecting tuition fees. (3) The funds will be used exclusively for improving the environmental sanitation of each school and purchasing sanitation equipment, and should be stored in a special account, available for use at any time, and must not be used for other purposes. Private schools may use the fees to pay the salaries of medical personnel.

### Cai Pei Sentenced to Death, Commuted on Appeal; Full Text of Supreme Court Judgment

[Special Report] Cai Pei, the traitor previously sentenced to death by the High Court, whose alias is Zi Ping, from Wuxi, is 62 years old. Before the war, he served as Director of the Counselor's Department of the Ministry of Communications of the National Government, Director-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Ministry of Interior. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he participated in the puppet organization and successively served as the puppet Mayor of Nanjing, Ambassador to Japan, Chairman of the Food Commission, and member of the National Government. He was sentenced to death by the High Court on July 18 of this year. The defendant Cai Pei and his defense lawyer Zhang Shizhao also appealed. Now, the Supreme Court has reviewed the case and changed the sentence to life imprisonment with permanent deprivation of civil rights. The full text of the Supreme Court judgment is excerpted below:

Verdict: The original judgment is revoked. Cai Pei conspired with the enemy country and plotted to rebel against his own country. He is sentenced to life imprisonment with permanent deprivation of civil rights. His property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, will be confiscated.

Reasoning: The original judgment in this case found that the defendant, the petitioner Cai Pei (hereinafter referred to as the defendant), formerly served as Director of the Counselor's Department of the Ministry of Communications of the National Government, Director-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Administrative Inspector of Jiangsu Province, and Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Ministry of Interior. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the National Government moved westward. He went to various provinces but lingered in Shanghai with the intention of waiting and seeing how things would turn out after the war suffered a slight setback. When Wang Jingwei established the puppet government in Nanjing, the defendant colluded with Zhou Fo Hai and Mei Si Ping and served as Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the puppet government in April of the 29th year of the Republic [1940]. In June of the same year, he was transferred to the post of Mayor of the puppet Nanjing, handling puppet municipal administration and recruiting refugees in order to implement the puppet government's so-called reconstruction plan. He gave speeches to students undergoing training in the capital, vehemently opposing resistance against Japan. He also gave a speech entitled "Reflections on the Anniversary of the Return of the Puppet National Government to the Capital" at the celebration of the anniversary of the puppet government's return to the capital. In the speech, he wantonly vilified our government. He also went to Japan to participate in the celebration of the 2,600th anniversary of the enemy country. In January of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], he was reassigned as Chairman of the Food Management Committee of the puppet government, drafting food plans. In March of the same year, he served as an Accounting Committee member of the puppet Executive Yuan. In December, he was reassigned as a political advisor to the puppet National Government. In April of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he was specially appointed as the puppet Ambassador to Japan. He gave a speech in Beiping, expressing his determination to strengthen "Sino-Japanese friendship." In May, he arrived in Japan to meet with the enemy emperor and visited enemy cabinet ministers Konoe, Koiso, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, Greater East Asia Minister Aoki, Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira, and enemy generals Abe, Matsui, and Doihara, discussing the enemy-puppet cooperation and overall peace issues. He also visited the ambassadors to Japan from the Axis powers of Germany and Italy to establish contacts. In November of the same year, the enemy and puppets signed the Alliance Treaty and issued a statement showing their determination to live and die together with the enemy. In January of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], he represented Chen Gongbo in presenting 800,000 catties of sugar to the citizens of the enemy capital to show goodwill. In May of the same year, he resigned. The enemy emperor awarded him the First Class Order of the Rising Sun. After returning to China, he served as a member of the puppet National Government until the enemy surrendered and he was dismissed. The evidence for these facts is his own confession, his confession to the Military Intelligence Bureau, and the files of the puppet organization's Xinwen Bao, Xin Zhongguo Bao, Shen Bao, as well as the records of the puppet Foreign Ministry's participation in the Japanese celebration and the work reports of the puppet Embassy in Japan. It is explained that his defense that he took puppet posts due to coercion is merely an empty claim. His statement that his remarks were not his true intention is also clearly a fabrication. His claim of protecting the mausoleum is his responsibility as the puppet mayor. The provision of information was never implemented and is therefore invalid. His rescue of underground workers was merely an occasional response to the requests of friends, driven by emotional impulses. Other acts of disaster relief and assistance to the sick, even if they did occur, were nothing more than implementing the policies of the cunning enemy to win over our people, and have nothing to do with benefiting the country and the people. These are not sufficient reasons to mitigate the sentence. It is considered that he committed the crime of conspiring with the enemy to plot to rebel against his own country under Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Punishment of Traitors Ordinance, which is not without merit. However, the participation of the defendant in the puppet organization was due to losing his position as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Ministry of Interior of the National Government, and failing to move westward with the government. After he took up the puppet post, after Liang Hongzhi and Wang Zhaoming formed the puppet government, he did not think of finding an opportunity to sneak into the rear and serve the central government, but always relied on the enemy puppets and held puppet posts. It cannot be relieved of the crime of treason, but compared to the ringleaders who deliberately used the enemy's force to subvert our government, the situation is different. Regarding the Father of the Nation's Mausoleum, the negotiation for the withdrawal of Japanese troops and the organization of a guard team for protection, although it was the duty of the puppet mayor, still reflects a slight reverence for the lofty and great Father of the Nation. The facts that he contacted Xu Mingcheng to provide information to the central government, and rescued and assisted the central underground workers Ma Yuanfang, Chen Lixing, and Wang Wenjun, have been proven by the witnesses Deng Jiecun, Yu Pangrong, and Wang Wenjun who appeared in court, and there are also letters from Xu Mingcheng, Ma Yuanfang, and Chen Lixing to prove it. Although the provision of information was not implemented, and the rescue of resistance workers, based on the process, was not entirely an emotional impulse. Taking these considerations into account, although it cannot be reduced to the end, measuring the situation and crime, it is not impossible to commute him from death. The original judgment was sentenced to death, and it is somewhat heavy. It should be revoked by this court, and sentenced to life imprisonment within the statutory original penalty, in order to show caution. The petition and the defense's intention to attack the original trial, the matters that are beneficial to the defendant, have not fulfilled the duty of investigation, and the application of law does not refer to the legal meaning of Article 3 of the Regulations on the Handling of Traitor Cases and the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan No. 3101, which is illegal. It is not sufficient to be taken, but the criticism that the original sentence is too heavy is not entirely without reason. Based on the above discussion, it should be based on Article 22, Paragraph 1, the former paragraph of the Special Criminal Cases Procedure Ordinance, Article 1, Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, Article 9 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors, Article 2, Paragraph 1, the former paragraph, Article 37, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and the verdict is as stated in the main text.

### Yu Qiaqing's Estate: Shanghai Tax Bureau Entrusted; Investigation Underway

[Special Report] Regarding the taxation of Yu Qiaqing's estate, this reporter made a special visit to Ge Yanshao, a helper at the city's Direct Tax Bureau. According to him, Yu's place of death was Chongqing, so the taxation of his estate is handled by the Chongqing Direct Tax Bureau. The Chongqing Direct Tax Bureau has sent an official letter to Shanghai, entrusting the Shanghai Bureau to investigate Yu's estate in Shanghai. After receiving this official letter, the bureau immediately ordered his heirs to report the details of Yu's estate in Shanghai. His heirs are three sons and one daughter. After discussing among themselves, they decided to report the estate figures in the near future. After the bureau completes its investigation, it will forward the investigation results to the Chongqing Direct Tax Bureau.

The court ruled that Hayes is entitled to extraterritorial rights under the Zi Ben Agreement signed between our country and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and therefore, the case against him will not be accepted. Regarding the case against Jin and Zhang and the plaintiff's request for compensation of 20 million yuan, the court attempted to mediate a settlement, but it failed. Yesterday, the court held a final hearing on the case and is scheduled to announce the verdict at 2:25 p.m.

### Delayed Payment of Land Value Tax: Exemption from Fine This Year

The Land Administration Bureau previously stipulated that overdue land value tax payments would be subject to a fine. The City Council has now sent a letter stating: "Please waive the penalty for those who pay land value tax overdue this year." The Land Administration Bureau's original intention in setting the fine was only to encourage all owners to pay land value tax as soon as possible. Therefore, in addition to urging all owners to pay land value tax as soon as possible, the bureau has ordered the land valuation offices in each district to comply and waive the penalty.

### Shanghai's 72 Japanese War Criminals: Their Heinous Crimes are Obvious; Most Have Been Arrested. Judicial Authorities Request Joint Cooperation from Legal Groups to Report on Them, Hoping Various Sectors Will Provide Strong Evidence.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The names of 72 major Japanese war criminals in this city have already been listed by the Ministry of National Defense, and an official document has been sent to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The Ministry of Judicial Administration has instructed the local judicial authorities in this city to be responsible for investigating their confirmed crimes. In order to gather collective wisdom, the judicial authorities have promptly copied and distributed the lists of war criminals, along with their ranks and crimes, to various legal groups and organizations in society, requesting joint cooperation in reporting them. They also hope that various sectors will provide strong evidence so that the war criminals can be brought to trial as soon as possible and given the punishment they deserve. Most of the 72 war criminals have already been arrested and are being detained in the Shanghai Prison at Tilanqiao. However, there are still some who have not been apprehended as of now, and they are currently being actively pursued. Here are some of the most famous and egregious offenders:

Okazaki Kahira, Counselor of the Embassy, assisted the military in disrupting our economy and planned to illegally plunder various materials in Central China.

Yano Seiki, Consul General, guided the head of the Japanese Residents' Association and the general Japanese residents.

Toyota Mu, Consul General, was responsible for guiding the general Japanese residents.

Iwai Eiichi, Vice-Consul, colluded with Yuan Ludeng and others to undermine our economy and engage in intelligence activities.

Hosono Yoshihisa, Judicial Consul, instructed embassy staff to illegally abuse Chinese people.

Kariya Kyuta, Embassy Appointee, used his position to oppress our good citizens and committed all kinds of evil.

Sasaki Shiro, Military Police Appointee, using the name of the military police and consular appointees, monopolized gambling tables in western Shanghai, profited from them, and established intelligence agencies to kill our patriotic youth. He is the most vicious of the ruffians, and currently possesses several hundred million yuan in private assets and two concubines.

Mitsui Yonematsu, Chairman of the China-Japan Trade Federation. The association was the largest military procurement agency in Central China. Using the power of the military, it forcibly purchased rice, grains, livestock, cotton cloth, cotton yarn, cotton, and oils.

Yoshida Yujiro, Standing Director of the China-Japan Trade Federation, was responsible for purchasing rayon, raw silk, fertilizer, pharmaceuticals, hardware, copper, iron, and various local products and groceries. The association was invested in by Mitsui & Co.

Yamamoto Masao, Branch Manager of Mitsui & Co., was the largest and most influential military procurement merchant in China. He used the power of the military to forcibly purchase and sell rice.

Reita Tatsuma, Branch Manager of Mitsui & Co., was responsible for purchasing grains, oils, raw silk, rayon, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, fertilizer, pigments, steel, hardware, machinery, sugar, paper, ginseng, medicine, tea, matches, and cement.

Tsuruta Takeshi, Branch Manager of Mitsui & Co., was responsible for purchasing tobacco, beer, woolen goods, wood, coal, seafood, and various local products, as well as handling water and land transportation and insurance businesses. (It is verified that Mitsui & Co. is one of Japan's largest financial groups. Successive Ministers of Finance were promoted by the group's influence. In this Sino-Japanese War, it first instigated the military and the government to establish the Asia Development Board to monopolize the economic power of our occupied areas. Later, due to the exposure of corruption among the personnel of the Asia Development Board, it was abolished and replaced with the Greater East Asia Ministry to avoid public criticism. In reality, it was just a change in name, and it implemented a controlled economy in our occupied areas, forcibly purchasing various major materials at the lowest prices and then selling them to our merchants at high prices, profiting from them. The group's senior staff members all accumulated great wealth.)

Awasawa Toshikaku, Chairman of Wanwa Company, was the largest military procurement merchant in Central China, purchasing rice, grains, yarn, hardware, steel, alcohol, and various local products and groceries. Because he used coercive means to purchase them, he obtained tens of billions of yuan (in puppet currency). Each senior staff member has privately amassed a great fortune. It is also verified that the company collected a large amount of alcohol, which was used to supply the army, navy, and air force. When the enemy army surrendered, he embezzled the military's alcohol, worth approximately hundreds of millions of yuan in puppet currency.

Sakurai Takeo, Shanghai Branch Manager of the Imperial Bank, and Kiyonaga Kenji, Sub-Branch Manager. This bank is operated by the Mitsui conglomerate, formerly known as the Mitsui Bank, now renamed the Imperial Bank. It normally manipulates domestic finance in Japan, bribes the military, and promotes war to fulfill its ambitions of economic invasion. It is truly the culprit of this Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, when the Allied forces entered Japan, they first dissolved this financial group. When the enemy army was fighting in Central China, it deposited most of the military funds into the Shanghai branch. This branch spared no effort in invading China's economy and disrupting its finances. It also provided low-interest loans to various procurement merchants to allow them to develop as much as possible. When the enemy army surrendered, it embezzled a large amount of the enemy army's deposits and distributed them to branch staff members at the section chief level and above. Therefore, each of the branch's senior officials possesses an extremely large amount of gold bars.

Medical and Health

(1) Stomach and Intestinal Noises

Zhang Tengfang asks: I am 29 years old. Last year, after eating, I would occasionally feel discomfort in my abdomen (slight bloating with noises). After a slight chill, I would feel slightly hot. A Chinese medicine doctor diagnosed it as stomach cold, but the treatment was ineffective. I reduced my diet and was careful about what I ate, and I felt slightly better. However, my bowel movements are often hard first and then loose, with many hard stools the size of beans in the loose stool, or hard first and then thin. But if I am careless with my diet, the previous symptoms will reappear, and recently they have worsened. My weight has gradually decreased, and I often have insomnia. I would like to ask the following questions: (1) Which part of my stomach is affected? (2) Which over-the-counter medicine is most effective, and what kind of supplements should I take to restore my health? (3) What are the methods of self-care?

[Answer from Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi] Based on your letter, you have a stomach ailment, probably due to indigestion. You should eat easily digestible and nutritious foods. Greasy or difficult-to-digest foods are not suitable. When you are sick, you can take digestive medicine, Liq. Taka Diastase, 2 cc to 4 cc.

### Production Loan Review Committee Decides on Two Major Points Yesterday

Old Debts of Industrial and Mining Enterprises May Not Be Deducted from New Loans; Debts to Commercial Firms Must Be Negotiated Independently

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Provisional Review Committee for Production Enterprise Loans held its fourth regular meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM on the fourth floor of the Bank of China Building, with over 20 committee members present. During the meeting, Chairman Huo Baoshu was in Beijing, so Standing Committee Member Li Fucun served as temporary chairman. Several important cases were discussed, and two points were announced after the meeting: (1) When industrial and mining enterprises apply for loans from the Production Loan Association, if they have already obtained loans from various national banks, the old debts will not be deducted from the new loans. (2) If there are old debts with commercial firms, the loan applicants should negotiate a solution with the commercial firms on their own and then submit it to the Production Loan Association for approval.

In addition, the committee has decided on the interest rate for production enterprise loans. The interest rate for national banks and commercial firms to grant loans is uniformly 4% per month.

According to Article 7 of the committee's regulations, "The Central Bank shall, at any time, accept mortgages from various banks based on the approved terms." It is learned that the committee decided at its third regular meeting that when national banks re-mortgage to the Central Bank, the loan amount will be calculated at 80% of the actual loan amount, and the interest rate will be 2.8% per month. When commercial firms re-mortgage to the Central Bank, the loan amount will also be calculated at 80% of the actual loan amount, and the interest rate will be 2% per month.

Based on the aforementioned determined re-mortgage interest rate, the actual interest earned by national banks for granting production vehicle loans is 8.8% per month, and the actual interest earned by commercial firms is 12% per month.

### Taiwan Sugar Corporation's Unprecedented Selling Pressure, Sugar Prices Continue to Rise Consistently

As the Lunar New Year approaches, sugar sales are booming, and there is a shortage of spot goods, the rising trend has intensified. Yesterday, the market rose across the board. Medium granulated sugar rose by 3,000 yuan, raw sugar jumped by 7,000 yuan, and Xinghua white and red high-quality goods were highly sought after. Green sugar also rose in price. The Taiwan Sugar Corporation broke its record for allocation yesterday, with 28,000 bags of medium granulated sugar, 18,000 bags of raw sugar, 6,000 bags of refined white sugar, 1,300 bags of Taiwan red sugar, and 1,700 bags of coarse sugar, totaling 55,000 bags.

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten, and numbered goods continued to rise in price. For example, Guang Bang's Runde green sugar rose by another 2,300 yuan, reaching as high as 100,000 yuan, and 95,000-96,000 yuan, accounting for more than 500 bags. More than 100 boxes of Qingyuan thin green sugar were priced at 96,000-97,000 yuan, an increase of 11,000 yuan. Shantou green sugar was relatively flat, opening at 103,000 yuan, accounting for more than 100 bags. Jian Bang's red Zhang Diao sugar opened at 110,000 yuan, with hundreds of bags traded.

### Industrial Raw Materials are Selling Well, Caustic Soda is in Short Supply, Users are Ordering One After Another, Chilean Nitrate Rises Sevenfold, Sichuan Wax Sells for 2 Million

Caustic soda is in short supply, and there are many buyers, so the market price is high. It is learned that ICI caustic soda will be directly distributed to various user factories starting next week. It is said that the price per barrel for the aforementioned distribution may still be over 600,000 yuan, and even if the allocation price is increased, it should not exceed 100,000 yuan. In view of the seriousness of the caustic soda problem, various user factories have placed large orders with a certain foreign firm in this city, with a price of 480,000 yuan per barrel, which can arrive in February next year, with a 30% deposit paid in advance. According to users in the market, various factories (whether printing and dyeing mills or soap factories) are currently in a period of intense production. Due to the shortage of caustic soda, it not only affects production costs, but also reduces output. It is hoped that relevant parties will understand the seriousness of this problem and clear the caustic soda accumulated at the docks in advance, so that the supply of caustic soda will increase and the problem can be easily alleviated. In addition, the market price of Chilean nitrate (also known as sodium nitrate) was 4 million yuan per ton two weeks ago, but yesterday the market price rose sharply to 28 million yuan per ton, and those who hold the goods are reluctant to sell them. According to raw material merchants, although a large number of imported specialty raw materials have arrived, they have not been delivered. The price of specialty raw materials related to dyes and pharmaceuticals and cosmetics has risen sharply due to the scarcity of goods in the market. Glycerin has been sought after by tobacco factories, etc. Yesterday, the price per lot exceeded 300,000, and there is a severe shortage of spot goods. The momentum of iron漲is still there. Sichuan wax has now risen to 2 million yuan per Dan for the rice heart tooth opening cake. According to people in the industry, the price of wax in Hankou has risen to more than 3 million per Dan, and since the city is currently experiencing a period of unusually prosperous sales, it is possible that it will double again.

Sesame oil from Bengbu, Hankou, and Wangbei arrived in good quantities, resulting in a stable situation and ensuring a sufficient supply.

### Interview with Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the Textile Construction Corporation - Steps for Improving and Promoting Cotton Planting

Import of Foreign Cotton is Currently China's Biggest Leak - Production Can Be Restored to Former Levels in Three Years

(Special Report from This Newspaper) Cotton is originally one of China's special products. Taking the annual production volume before the war as an example, it was already able to be self-sufficient. And the cotton for yarn spun by textile groups could even be supplied for export with a surplus. However, during the eight years of war, the countryside suffered thorough destruction. The normal production volume of cotton was the first to bear the brunt. Last year's situation need not be mentioned; this year, the national production volume is estimated to be 7 million dan (担) based on reliable estimates. However, the actual amount available for purchase and spinning by various yarn factories is minimal. As a result, we have had to resort to importing foreign cotton. Looking at the monthly import values published by customs over the past year, raw cotton has consistently been the top item, with import volumes far exceeding those of other imported goods. According to accurate estimates: out of the total national import value of over US$650 million in the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), raw cotton alone accounted for over US$160 million. What an alarming foreign exchange leakage! Therefore, it is imperative to improve the cotton planting plan and promote the movement to increase raw cotton production. Because the implementation of this plan fulfills many missions. It solves most of the rural economic problems, saves China from a huge foreign exchange expenditure, and resolves the raw material problem for cotton cloth, which has the largest consumption volume among the people.

With this premise in mind, the reporter had a long conversation with Mr. Wu Weijing, the current Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Corporation. Mr. Wu is an expert in the study of cotton trade and cotton production and sales. Since graduating from Tianjin Cotton College in his early years, he has dedicated half his life to the improvement of the cotton industry. He has traveled extensively to cotton-producing areas in China, Japan, and Korea. From hands-on experience and actual trials, he has found the basis for his improvement plan.

The Yellow River Basin - The World's Most Ideal Cotton Planting Area

Mr. Wu said it well, in terms of weather and soil quality, it is unlikely that one could find a more ideal environment for cotton planting than the Yellow River Basin. There, autumn brings clear skies and refreshing air, and the soil is mostly sandy loam, producing the largest cotton bolls. The Yangtze River Basin is also an ideal cotton-planting area, but the climate is not as dry as the Yellow River Basin. In conclusion, China's cotton-planting area extends as far south as Hainan Island, and as far north as beyond the Great Wall, to the northeast, Shenyang, to the east reaching the coast, and to the west reaching Sichuan. Therefore, except for Mongolia, Xinjiang, and mountainous areas in the southwest, almost no land in the country is unsuitable for cotton planting.

Pre-War Production - The Fastest Progress Was Made After the 16th Year of the Republic of China (1927)

Speaking of agriculture as a whole, China has had more than 40 years of agricultural improvement history. And to this day, the most remarkable achievement is cotton. From the perspective of production volume, according to records from the Yarn Factory Association in the 8th year of the Republic of China (1919), China's annual cotton production was estimated at 3 million dan (老秤), which had expanded to over 14 million dan (老秤) by the eve of the Anti-Japanese War. Among these, the decade from the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927) to the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) saw the fastest increase. In terms of quality, it has also progressed from the initial raw material for 10-count yarn to the raw material for 42-count and even 60-count yarn by the eve of the Anti-Japanese War. This improvement in quality is due to: (1) the rapid development of the textile industry; (2) the implementation of the legal tender policy; (3) the huge amount of cotton cloth consumed in China; and (4) the vastness of China's cotton-planting area.

Yunnan Kapok - Praised by Foreigners as China's Treasure

In addition to the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, there are three other areas worthy of attention: First, the kapok in Yunnan. This kapok is completely different from that produced in Guangdong. It is rich in crimp, has tensile strength, and can spin 60-count yarn. The biggest feature is that it is a perennial plant. Once planted, it can be harvested twice a year from the third year onwards. Once in June-July, and once in November-December. The most kapok is produced near Kaiyuan, Yunnan, with an annual production of 2,000-3,000 dan. Foreigners even praise it as China's treasure. Currently, there is a Yunnan Kapok Company jointly funded by the government and private sector, developing and propagating it there. Second, sea island cotton, produced on Hainan Island, can be said to be the most excellent cotton in the world. This cotton is similar to that produced in Florida and Mexico in the United States. The fiber is fine and long, and can be spun into 200-240 count western yarn. It is currently in the trial planting stage. Third, coarse lint from Xihua and Xiaogan. This cotton is the coarsest and hardest cotton in the world, most suitable for weaving carpets with wool. Before the war, annual exports often reached 200,000-300,000 dan. If it can be propagated and increased in production for export, the foreign exchange that can be earned each year would also be considerable.

Domestication of American Varieties - China Has Achieved Considerable Success

Next, talking about cotton experiments and promotion methods, they can be roughly divided into two types: One is breeding, which involves selecting superior cotton varieties with long fibers and high yields. When they mature and bloom, artificial pollination is performed to prevent mixing with inferior varieties, and then gradually expanding their propagation. The other is selection, which involves selecting particularly excellent cotton seeds, isolating them from other cotton varieties, and selecting other plots of land to nurture and propagate them. China currently mostly adopts the second method, selecting and purchasing excellent American cotton seeds, attempting to domesticate them, and then propagating them.

After China adopted the second method for propagation, there are currently three of the most excellent varieties: The first is StoneVille No.4, which is suitable for planting from the Yellow River Basin to the latitude of Tianjin and Baoding. Its characteristics are: (1) The fiber is 1 inch long and can spin 32-42 count cotton yarn. (2) The average diameter of the seed is 1 and 32/1 inch. (3) The yield is high. (4) It matures early. (5) The lint percentage is extremely high, with 33 jin (斤) of lint cotton ginned from 100 jin of seed cotton. Therefore, this variety has been extensively propagated in the North China area. The second is Delfos No. 531. This variety has established a foundation in the Yangtze River Basin. And especially this year's trial planting results are even more remarkable. Its characteristics are: (1) The fiber is 1 and 16/1 inch long and can spin 42-62 count cotton yarn. (2) The yield is also high. (3) The lint percentage is also good. However, the climate in the Yangtze River Basin is relatively humid, and the rainy season each year is suitable for planting, but the time is somewhat rushed. It is still in the trial planting stage, and large-scale production awaits next year. The third is Guannong No. 1, produced from eastern Hebei northward to the Liao River Basin. This variety was cultivated by the Japanese. Its characteristics are: (1) The fiber is 70% of an inch long and can spin 20-32 count cotton yarn. (2) It matures extremely early. The three varieties mentioned above are the most important of China's improved cotton varieties.

Improvement and Promotion - Mr. Wu's Plan is Divided into Three Steps

Finally, Mr. Wu presented his personal three-part plan for improving and promoting China's cotton. The first step is to establish original seed farms in all cotton-producing areas of the country. According to his estimation, there should be more than 20 original seed farms nationwide. Each farm should have a propagation farm built around it, forming a wave-shaped expansion. The second step is to implement centralized ginning. This will reduce the chances of seed mixing, and the lint cotton can also maintain consistency. This method was particularly effective when implemented by the Japanese in Northeast China. It can gradually eliminate bad seeds and purify the varieties. Therefore, machine ginning factories should be established in all improved cotton areas, with attached packing factories, oil pressing factories, etc., to facilitate the work. After the seeds and lint cotton have been processed through the above two steps, the final step is to inspect and grade the cotton, so that the quality of cotton is standardized. If this step cannot be achieved, then there will never be a way to sell national cotton at a good price.

If the above three-part plan can be fully implemented, it is estimated that China's cotton production volume can be restored to the state before the Anti-Japanese War within three years. This year, because the recovery has not yet been completed, it can only be called a preparatory year for cotton planting, with an estimated production of 7 million dan. Next year, preparations will continue, and it can be increased to 9 million dan. In the 37th year of the Republic of China (1948), it is expected to increase to 13 million dan, and in the 38th year of the Republic of China (1949), it is expected to reach the pre-war level, which is roughly 17 million dan. If the situation tends to stabilize, then with the cooperation of these three steps, a cotton production volume of 17 million dan should absolutely be achievable in three years.

Completing the Plan - The Following Conditions Must Be Resolved First

However, to achieve these three steps, Mr. Wu believes that the following prerequisites must be resolved: (1) Financial issues: The profits from the cotton spinning business of the Textile Construction Corporation should still be returned to the cotton spinning business. In particular, a large portion of the funds must be used to improve cotton, so that agriculture can be industrialized and mechanical cultivation and irrigation can be fully utilized. On the one hand, this saves labor, and on the other hand, it allows for large-scale production. Only then can the goals of improving quality and reducing production costs be achieved. (2) A large number of talents should be cultivated. Studying abroad is certainly necessary, but a large number of mid-level cadres should also be cultivated domestically. (3) A large number of excellent American varieties should be purchased to prepare for large-scale propagation. (4) A national cotton improvement organization should be established, dividing the country into regions based on differences in climate and soil quality. Each region should then set up several guidance centers as needed. With these three-level organizations, the work of improving and expanding the cotton industry should be more than sufficient.

This is a summary of Mr. Wu's plan to improve China's cotton industry. Mr. Wu is a person who advocates finding the basis for his plans from practical experience. Therefore, his plan should be more practical and further-reaching than general theoretical improvement plans. He has just extensively inspected the cotton-planting areas in Northeast China, the Yellow River Basin, the Pinghan Railway, and the Yangtze River Basin this autumn. He has brought back an optimistic outlook for China's cotton production situation. May the reporter personally witness, on a clear autumn day next year, that the fertile fields across the country have all become boundless cotton fields!

### Jingwu Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Yang Kaiyun Takes Fifth Group Championship

As a result, Yang Kaiyun reversed his losses to win the championship. Feng Hao was defeated by the dark horse Chen Zengliang, losing his chance at the runner-up title.

Yang Kaiyun initially lost to Chen Zengliang with a score of 2-1 due to unfamiliarity with his technique.

Yang's playing style changed drastically, and he defeated Feng Hao 3-1. This created a three-way tie. Chief referee Chen Linsheng decided to use a draw to determine a final elimination round. Both Yang and Chen were resting, while Feng Chen fought fiercely. Both focused on the loss and gain of this game's right to the finals, so more steadily and defensively. However, Feng Hao was more aggressive, resulting in many missed shots, ultimately leading to his elimination. Yang Kaiyun then played against Chen Zengliang again, and Yang, rested, avenged his first defeat and won the championship in the final group. The results of each player are as follows: Yang Kaiyun, 5 wins, champion; Chen Zengliang, 4 wins, 1 loss, runner-up; Feng Hao, 3 wins, 2 losses; Jiang Boquan, 2 wins, 3 losses; Zhu Kuangchen, 1 win, 4 losses; Zhu Zongze, 5 losses.

### The Eleventh National Assembly Meeting: Report on the Review of the Draft Constitution

The Presidium reports the list of candidates for the Comprehensive Review Committee of the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China. According to Article 9 of the Review Regulations of the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China, they are nominated separately by the representatives of each review committee and the Presidium. Following Article 6 of the Organizational Regulations of Each Review Committee of the National Assembly, the Presidium has designated Sun Ke, Chen Cheng, Chen Qitian, Xu Fulin, Kong Geng, Bai Yunti, Xi Yushu, Wang Shijie, and He Jihong as the nine representatives serving as conveners.

Report of the Credentials Review Committee of the National Assembly Representatives

The review of the credentials of the representatives was conducted by this committee in its first meeting held at 8:00 PM on November 29th, where three review methods were determined: (1) Review of the election certificates in accordance with Article 7 of the Wartime Regulations; (2) Mutual review of the election certificates by the review committee members themselves; (3) The committee members are divided into 19 groups according to their respective electoral units for review.

Draft Constitution

Report of the First Review Committee

A. Scope of Review by This Committee

The scope of review by this committee covers the "Preamble" and Chapter 1 "General Principles," Articles 1 to 7, Chapter 2 "Rights and Obligations of the People," Articles 8 to 25, and Chapter 12 "Elections," Articles 128 to 132, of the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China.

B. Reference Materials for Review

The reference materials for review by this committee include 122 relevant proposals, two volumes of compiled speeches by representatives, and the opinions of the committee members participating in this review.

C. Time of Review and Number of Meetings

The review by this committee began on December 6th. The address for the review meeting was the auditorium of the Lizhi Society. Subsequently, six meetings were held in the conference hall of the Central Party Headquarters, totaling seven meetings, concluding at 12:30 PM on the 14th of this month.

During the review meetings, all committee members devoted themselves to careful study and discussion of the articles submitted for review. Articles 1 and 7 were transferred to the Comprehensive Committee for review due to disagreements. Explanations of amendments and major debates are as follows:

(1) Regarding the "Preamble"

Regarding the "Preamble," committee members voiced many opinions. Some argued that the phrase "according to" was disrespectful, as it is often used in official documents like "according to the report of so-and-so," and should be changed to "in accordance with." After lengthy debate, Committee Member Zhi Ben explained that phrases like "relying on benevolence, based on virtue, indulging in the arts" are not used in a superior-to-inferior context, and that "according to" is different from "based on." Some argued that the title "National Father" should be added before the name of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and others argued that the phrase "Creator of the Republic of China" should be placed above the name of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. After a vote, with 157 members present, the original draft was maintained with a majority of 127 votes.

(2) Regarding Article 1

This article relates to the form of government, and the representatives attached great importance to it. Thirty-two amendment proposals were submitted, and the committee members spoke enthusiastically. Some, like Representatives Li Junfu and Xia Erkang, argued for the removal of the "Three Principles of the People." Many argued for amending it to "The Republic of China is a Republic of the Three Principles of the People." Their reasoning was that the Three Principles of the People are democratic principles. There were many other deliberative opinions, and after lengthy discussion, five proposals were put to a vote, with 129 people present at the time.

(1) Republic of China is a Democratic Republic: 11 votes in favor

(2) Republic of China is a Unified Democratic Republic of the Three Principles of the People: 0 votes in favor

(3) Republic of China is a Democratic Republic of the Three Principles of the People: 58 votes in favor

(4) Republic of China is a Republic of the Three Principles of the People: 48 votes in favor

(5) Republic of China is a Democratic Republic Based on the Three Principles of the People: 26 votes in favor

The results showed that none of the proposals received the required number of votes, except for "The Republic of China is a Unified Democratic Republic of the Three Principles of the People," which received no votes. At that time, it was already time to adjourn, and there was a proposal to amend it to "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic Based on the Three Principles of the People." After the meeting continued in the afternoon, according to Article 51 of the Rules of Procedure, it was reviewed again. After discussion, the two proposals with the most votes from the previous six proposals were put to a vote, with the following results:

(1) Republic of China is a Democratic Republic Based on the Three Principles of the People: 33 votes in favor

(2) Republic of China is a Democratic Republic of the Three Principles of the People: 107 votes in favor

Based on the total results of the vote on this article, it was amended to "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic of the Three Principles of the People."

(3) Regarding Article 4

Regarding the provisions on territory in this article, some advocated listing them, some advocated maintaining the original draft, and some advocated specifying national borders. In the end, it was generally believed that listing them had both advantages and disadvantages, but the majority believed that changes to the national territory should be subject to the resolution of the National Assembly, and that a general provision was appropriate. At that time, with 129 people present, the amendment was passed with 78 votes, and the wording was "The territory of the Republic of China is based on its inherent boundaries, and may not be altered without the resolution of the National Assembly."

(4) Regarding Article 7

This article, concerning the location of the capital, is of great importance. The representatives submitted a total of 21 proposals regarding this article, and the speeches on this article were well-argued and insightful. Among them, the largest number advocated setting the capital in Peiping. The discussion of this article underwent two heated debates on the 11th and 12th. Finally, all the amendments to this article were put to a vote. At that time, with 192 people present, the voting results were as follows:

(1) Delete the original text and do not specify the capital in the constitution: 67 votes in favor

(2) The capital of the Republic of China shall be located in Nanjing, Peiping, and Xi'an in principle, and shall be implemented separately according to the needs of national construction: 7 votes in favor

(3) The Republic of China shall have Lanzhou as its central capital, Nanjing as its eastern capital, and Kashgar as its western capital: 12 votes in favor

(4) The capital of the Republic of China shall be located in Lanzhou: 7 votes in favor

(5) The capital of the Republic of China shall be located in Xi'an: 7 votes in favor

(6) The capital of the Republic of China shall be located in Wuhan: 9 votes in favor

(7) The capital of the Republic of China shall be located in Peiping: 117 votes in favor

This article was amended to "The capital of the Republic of China shall be located in Peiping." After the decision was made, those who advocated maintaining the original draft requested that maintaining the original draft be put to a vote again. The result was 63 votes in favor of maintaining the original draft. The amendment "The capital of the Republic of China shall be located in Peiping" was still passed.

(5) Regarding Article 9

This article concerns the protection of human rights. The committee members all felt that it must be carefully reviewed, otherwise it would not be sufficient to protect human rights comprehensively. After a long discussion, the committee members had many opinions. Some argued that the establishment of this article should remove Article 24, otherwise it would be a restriction on this article, and the people would still not be able to obtain sufficient protection. Others argued that the facts of public order and other issues should be taken into account, and the government should not be restricted so strictly. As a result, for careful consideration, Zhang Zhiben, He Jihong, Ji Qingyi, Mou Zhendong, and Zou Liankui were designated as the text organizers of this article. After sorting out, the draft amendment was passed at the afternoon continuation meeting as follows:

"The freedom of the person of the people shall be protected. Except for arrests of offenders in the act, as otherwise stipulated by law; arrests and detentions shall not be made without the legal procedures of judicial or police organs. Arrests, detentions, interrogations, and punishments by courts without legal procedures may be refused.

When a person is arrested or detained on suspicion of a crime, the arresting or detaining organ shall inform the person and his designated relatives and friends in writing of the reasons for the arrest or detention. And, at the latest, transfer the person to the competent court for interrogation within twenty-four hours. The person or others may also petition the competent court to submit the person to the arresting organ for interrogation within twenty-four hours.

The court shall not refuse the aforementioned petition, and shall not order the arresting or detaining organ to respond first. The arresting and detaining organ shall not refuse or delay the court's interrogation.

When a person is illegally arrested or detained by any organ, the person or others may petition the court to investigate, and the court shall not refuse. And it shall investigate the arresting and detaining organ within twenty-four hours and handle it according to law."

At that time, with 121 people present, it was passed without objection.

(6) Regarding Article 16

The original draft of this article concerns the property rights of the people. During the discussion, it was generally believed that the property rights of the people should be protected. However, the right to survival and the right to work of those without property should also be protected. Otherwise, this constitution would only protect the property of those with property, which would be contrary to the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and would become a drawback that favors the capitalist class. Therefore, this article was amended to "The people's right to survival, right to work, and property rights shall be protected." At that time, with 88 people present, the amendment was passed with 71 votes.

(7) Regarding Article 21

This article is a provision on the national service of the people. However, the amendment by Representative Bai Chongxi and others considered that national defense requires not only military service but also labor service. During the review, the majority thought it was very appropriate. However, many of the review committee members felt that the state should also be responsible for providing relief and compensation for cases of disability or death caused by the people's service in the military or labor service. Therefore, it was decided to amend this article to "The people have the obligation to perform military service and labor service according to law" and to add the second clause as follows: "If a person becomes ill, disabled, or dies as a result of performing such military or labor service, the state shall provide appropriate relief or compensation to the person or his family." At that time, with 82 people present, it was passed with 53 votes.

(8) Regarding Chapter 12 Elections

This chapter is a provision on elections. During the review, it was generally believed that it did not comply with the previously passed Article 18 of the original draft constitution, which stated "The people have the right to elect, recall, initiate, and referendum." The draft chapter only provides for elections, which is a omission. The provisions on the right to recall are only provided for in Article 132, which is also insufficient. The name of this chapter is also proposed to be amended. After passing the original draft Articles 128 to 132, according to Proposal No. 366, an amendment by Representative Lin Bin and others, it was passed to amend the name of this chapter to "Election, Recall, Initiative, and Referendum." Article 133 was added: "Recall shall be initiated by more than one-quarter of the voters in the original electoral district and decided by a majority vote." Article 134 "The exercise of the right of initiative shall be carried out in one of the following ways, depending on the nature and complexity of the matter: One, drafting a bill. Two, formulating legal principles." Article 135 "The bill drafted in accordance with Article 134 shall be sent to the government's legislative organ to complete the legislative procedure; the formulation of legislative principles shall be carried out by the legislative organ in accordance with the principles to formulate laws or regulations, which shall be sent to the government for promulgation." Article 136 "Referendum shall be conducted when one of the following circumstances occurs, except as otherwise provided in this constitution: One, to abolish certain laws or regulations. Two, to change the legislative organ's decision that a complete bill is not established." Article 137 "After the referendum, it shall be implemented by the method and decided by the majority of the referendum voters, except as otherwise provided by law."

The amendment to this chapter was passed with a majority of 39 votes out of 65 people present.

In addition, regarding the explanatory note to this chapter, during the discussion of the original draft Article 128, Representative Xia Erkang strongly advocated amending this article to adopt the proportional representation system in large electoral districts. Although some representatives seconded it, the majority ultimately believed that this system was not suitable for the current situation in China. It was rejected, but Representative Xia still declared that he reserved the right to speak.

Conveners of the First Review Committee: Zhang Zhiben, Huang Shaogu, Xia Erkang, Li Junfu, Chen Yiyun, Zhuo Yishan, Qi Zhiyuan, Ren Zhuoxuan, Liu Yaozhang

Report of the Second Review Committee

The scope of review by this committee is Chapter 3 "National Assembly" and Chapter 14 "Implementation and Amendment of the Constitution" of the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China. In the first and second meetings, the proposals were not sorted out and issued, and the review was difficult, resulting in few results. Later, in the third meeting on the morning of December 10th, the representatives unanimously decided to entrust the conveners to sort out and summarize the proposals first and then submit them for discussion. The sorting principles decided by the meeting were three: (1) Review all relevant proposals without omission; (2) The attitude must be objective and subjective opinions must not be added; (3) The proposals of the same nature must be summarized and sorted into articles. The conveners convened a meeting to work immediately after the adjournment at 9:30 AM that day, and based on the above three principles, they made a sorting report on Chapter 3 and Chapter 14, which was completed at 10:30 PM that evening. Subsequent meetings mostly proceeded on this basis.

During the proceedings of the various meetings, whenever major issues were encountered and the opinions of the two sides were too far apart, the conveners and some representatives proposed that the different opinions of the two sides be recorded together and sent to the Comprehensive Review Committee for processing, but this was not adopted, so a voting method was used to decide the matter by majority.

In total, this committee held seven review meetings from the 6th of this month to 1:00 PM on the 14th, excluding five convener meetings. The representatives argued fiercely about the nature, organization, and political power of the National Assembly. The results of the discussion are as follows:

I. Add a new article to Chapter 3 "National Assembly":

"Article: The National Assembly is the highest organ representing the people of the Republic of China in exercising political power."

II. Delete the original Article 26, paragraph 1 "Legislators directly elected from each region and the Mongolian leagues and Tibet" and paragraph 2 "Supervisory Committee members elected by the provincial assemblies and the local assemblies of the Mongolian leagues and Tibet," that is, legislators and supervisory committee members shall not be constituent members of the National Assembly. Add three other clauses specifying the proportional election quota of regional representatives, representatives elected from each Mongolian banner and Tibet, representatives elected from occupational groups, and representatives elected from women's groups. The full text of this article as amended is:

"The National Assembly shall be composed of the following representatives:

1. One representative shall be elected from each county, city, and equivalent region, but for every 300,000 people exceeding 300,000, one additional representative shall be elected. The equivalent region of the county and city shall be determined by law.

2. The number of representatives elected from each Mongolian banner and Tibet shall be determined by law.

3. The number of representatives elected by nationals residing abroad shall be determined by law.

4. The number of representatives elected from occupational groups shall be determined by law.

5. The number of representatives elected from women's groups shall be determined by law."

III. Regarding the powers of the National Assembly in Article 27, the majority of the representatives believed that they should be expanded. In addition to the originally stipulated election of the president and vice president, it should have the power to elect the presidents and vice presidents of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Supervisory Yuan, as well as legislators and supervisory committee members. In addition to impeaching the president and vice president, it should have the power to impeach the presidents and vice presidents of the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Supervisory Yuan, as well as legislators and supervisory committee members. Add the powers of "initiating laws," "referring laws," "amending the constitution," and "other powers conferred by the constitution." The full text of this article as amended is: "The powers of the National Assembly are as follows:

1. Elect the president, vice president, presidents and vice presidents of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Supervisory Yuan, and legislators and supervisory committee members.

2. Impeach the president, vice president, presidents and vice presidents of the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Supervisory Yuan, and legislators and supervisory committee members.

3. Initiate laws

4. Refer laws

5. Amend the constitution, but not change the form of government

6. Other powers conferred by this constitution

Some representatives and representatives of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party stated on the spot that they could not agree to the above three amendments and reserved the right to speak at the general meeting. (To be continued)

Spring and Autumn

### The Soviet Union's Artistic Wasteland: Criticism from Female Writer Rubissa

— Liu Shi

People often assume that Soviet literature and art are entirely new and possess a progressive spirit; however, this is not always the case. At least in the realm of art, it is somewhat lagging behind. Modern new art, whether in painting or sculpture, often cannot exist in the Soviet Union. Progressive painters generally have no place to stand in the Soviet Union, a fact known to the world. Therefore, their talents can only develop abroad, especially in the art capital of Paris. For example, world-renowned artists like Kandinsky, as well as leading figures of the "Paris School" such as Marc Chagall and Chaim Soutine, were all Soviet-born painters. However, facing various restrictions and feeling stifled in their homeland, they resolutely left their country and sought refuge in the world's artistic center - Paris. There, they applied their uninhibited minds, fulfilled their highest aspirations, and became first-class talents in the modern art world. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union itself presented an artistic wasteland. Today, art in the Soviet Union can no longer be independent and has become a tool for government propaganda, which is not welcomed by progressive artists.

Recently, a book on Soviet art was published in the United States, titled "Art in Russia," written by Helen Rubissow, a Soviet female writer who went to the United States eight years ago. She resides in New York, specializing in writing art criticism, and no longer plans to return home. Ms. Rubissow is a graduate of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts in Russia. In her book, there are 160 illustrations, half of which are representative works by contemporary Soviet artists, and the other half are works by Russian artists who have emigrated abroad and are recognized as famous writers by the world. By comparing them, the so-called "modern Soviet art" is clearly exposed to what extent it is restricted and reduced in standard.

In this book, Ms. Rubissow says: "Since the October Revolution, the period of survival for emerging art in the Soviet Union has been very short. In his revolutionary declaration in 1921, Lenin referred to the works of left-wing modern artists as 'childish.' Since the publication of this declaration, progressive writers and painters have unanimously left their country one after another to develop their abilities in Europe and the United States."

She also said: "The flourishing emerging art scene in the Soviet Union at the time was akin to being doused with cold water. Artists felt deeply unaccustomed to various harsh restrictions and constraints. While the government wanted to promote the restoration of rigid, outdated so-called academic painting, writers who were infected with new ideas were uninterested in creating art unless they left the country. They neither liked to imitate, nor could their creations be freely expressed due to restrictions, forcing many writers to simply abandon their painting tools and stop playing this tune."

With the passage of time, after Stalin came to power, the number of painters willing to be employed by the government increased day by day. Stalin vigorously promoted the so-called "socialist realism." But what exactly are these so-called "socialist realism" paintings? According to Ms. Rubissow, "They are nothing more than stories conveying the 'sentimentalism' left over from the 19th century. Their themes are nothing more than mothers holding their children, trudging alone through snow-covered plains; or a young woman and her children sadly gazing at ruins; or a group of women watching soldiers bravely fighting. More recently, there have also been scenes of women watching tanks charging into battle in Stalingrad."

She also said: "...The Soviet Union restricts the scope of artists' work in such a way that if the content of a work (including color and composition) does not conform to the government's doctrine and theme, the writer will be summoned by the government for reprimand or even punishment. The writer's works are constantly being secretly investigated. And every writer must be absolutely responsible to the government, and the writer himself has absolutely no freedom."

Art that is controlled in this way is bound to be unable to approach world art. Modern art, represented by the "Paris School," is an art that expresses the writer's personality, ideals, and soul. From this perspective, if Soviet art is indeed as Ms. Rubissow says, then it is still circling in the mid-19th century, and it is enough to compare it to the works of the British "Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood" at that time.

### Introduction to Zhou Xiang's Painting Manual

— Ding Jianxing

My late teacher, Mr. Zhou Xiang, was an old Jiangnan painter. He was exquisite in metal and stone inscription, calligraphy, and painting; and he mastered the methods of various masters of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties with ease. He also believed that neglecting tradition and forgetting one's ancestors was something only uncultured people would do. Therefore, he created this painting manual based on his lifelong learning and experience to benefit beginners. When Mr. Zheng Wuchang saw it, he praised it, saying: "The lessons taught in this manual are credible and will be passed down to future generations. It and the landscape methods of the recluse of Yuequan can be equally valued for millennia." Mr. Chen Dingshan said: "I foresee that when this book is published, the Mustard Seed Garden Manual can be discarded." I have cherished the ambition of printing and distributing this work for nearly thirty years. Now, I am fortunate to have spent half a year preparing for its publication, which will be sold by the stationery department of Wing On Company. I have kept my promise, and I feel as if a heavy burden has been lifted. The only regret is that the cost is too high, and the price seems expensive. I hope that the virtuous people of the world will understand. As it is about to be passed down to future generations, I respectfully state the main ideas as follows:

This manual is compiled for those who seek to enter the world of landscape painting. Therefore, its arrangement follows the order of learning. The first volume is on methods of drawing trees, because drawing landscapes must start with trees. The second volume is on methods of drawing rocks, because the methods of drawing rocks in ancient and modern times each have their own schools. The third volume is on methods of drawing mountains, so that one can know the structure to write landscapes. The fourth volume is on landscape methods, so that one can have a slight understanding of the origins of landscape painting in ancient and modern times, and thus engage in emulating the ancients, enabling one to ascend the hall and enter the room. If scholars follow this order, study it carefully, and then obtain it, learning landscape painting will surely be successful.

Brief History of Musicians

### Schubert

— Tian

Schubert (Austrian) His best works during his lifetime were Symphonies and Lieder. His contributions to the latter, especially his insights, were numerous. Among his Lieder works, "The Beautiful Maid of the Mill," "Winterreise" and "Death and the Maiden" are the most famous. Born in 1797, died in 1828.

Anecdotes of Writers

### George Bernard Shaw

— Gan Si

George Bernard Shaw once lived in Africa. One day he was swimming in a pool, enjoying himself immensely. There were also many children swimming at the time, who did not recognize this great writer at all. One of the children was encouraged by his swimming companions to "push that old man's head into the water." They enticed him with a reward of one shilling.

The child accepted their conditions and swam towards the place where Shaw was lazily paddling. But as he approached the old man, he suddenly became frightened. Shaw turned his head, saw the child, and asked him what he was doing.

The child completely lost his courage, and when asked by the old man, he blurted out the whole story of their bet. Shaw gave the child a stern look and then said, "Okay, if you wait a moment and let me catch my breath, then I can let you push my head into the water."

After they did this, the child swam back happily to collect his shilling.

### Haiku

— Fei Cun

Grandiose and heroic events are best recounted in lengthy and comprehensive epic poems. Fleeting moments of inspiration should be preserved in concise haiku. As a primary school student said, "Write big characters with a big brush; write small characters with a small brush." This illustrates the idea that "content determines form!"

Japan has what is known as haiku poetry, with writers such as Kobayashi Issa, Basho, and Buson being among its renowned masters. Although my knowledge of what constitutes haiku poetry is limited, I privately believe it is roughly equivalent to what we in China call "short poems." Beyond mere imitation, I have even boldly adopted the name.

Going to work, the old father fearing the car at the crossroads, his silhouette.

Two

My elder sister returns with her nephews and nieces, sometimes sitting at the door, making new shoes for the children while softly humming familiar songs from her childhood, such as the pitiful autumn sparrow and children. I can't help but feel "the years have flowed away like water," a kind of helpless middle-aged sorrow.

Getting old, ah - the popular song from my sister's mouth, twenty years ago.

Three

A section of street near the French Concession's foreign cemetery is lined with old goods stalls, fortune-telling booths, magicians, wandering medicine peddlers, hoarse-voiced storytellers, and plaintiffs lodging complaints. The onlookers are mostly wanderers with no home and plenty of free time.

The bed also floated up, in the dark night like a sea.

Seeing the roof of the first house in my hometown, I quickly lowered the curtain of the sedan chair—a timid feeling.

### An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood 128

— Ye Jingfeng

Yuanzi had received special agent training, unlike other women, so after arriving at Konoe's secret residence, within a few weeks, she had already taken in the layout of the entire mansion. In addition, she contacted the people who needed to be contacted and understood the things that needed to be understood, all without leaving a trace. According to her investigation, Konoe's place was his villa, actually a key agency. Major national affairs, confidential meetings, and important documents were all handled in this villa. Only his close associates and special agents could enter and exit. In the year before the "July 7th Incident," due to secret agreements, traces of the Fifth Column were added. These Fifth Column members and Konoe were maintained by a so-called "subtle" relationship; nominally, they were his personal employees, serving as advisors, guards, translators, and so on. In reality, these people were the bridge between him and Hitler. One of the key members of this bridge, specializing in espionage, was that one-eyed gentleman, said to be named Divisha Deng.

However, the Japanese have a characteristic: even if you are his confidant, sharing life-and-death secrets with him, as long as you are a foreigner, not a subject of the Emperor, his relationship with you can only maintain eight or nine parts; no matter what, he will reserve one or two parts. It's like his villa building; important figures of the Fifth Column can come and go to places like the conference room, but the Japanese-style hall where Konoe meets with the Emperor is off-limits, even to one-eyed Deng.

Wouldn't this make the allied Fifth Column unhappy? Not necessarily, because every Japanese adult and nobleman has their own "affliction." He explained to the Fifth Column that this "imperial zone" was his Wushan balcony for playing with women and had no political significance, so he wanted "esteemed guests to stop here." Originally, there were only Butterfly Madame-type women serving and attending; even the private secretary could only stop at the first gate.

Thus, Konoe's villa itself was already secret enough; who knew there was a distinction between inner and outer circles? As the saying goes, "A short man has many bumps in his belly." No wonder Konoe's place had a secret within a secret area. However, is the distinction between these inner and outer circles the short man's only bump? No. According to Yuanzi's exploration, behind Konoe's low couch, on the right, was also his bedroom. Only "key concubines" among the concubines could enter here, especially that study. Without orders, concubines on duty were not allowed to take a single step. This was the inner layer of the inner circle.

Yuanzi operated within the inner layer circle for a long time, expending considerable effort. She measured the exterior walls of the building, installed a radio receiver on the screen behind the low couch, and took the opportunity to explore, discovering secret electrical voltage boosters and air circulation devices. Unable to calculate the internal and external power consumption, she concluded that there was a very strong and large underground room in this study.

Initially, the first war criminal of the First World War, German Emperor Wilhelm II, had a most sophisticated and well-equipped underground room, which served as the nerve center for launching the world war. Every night after midnight, he and his chief of intelligence would listen to secret reports from around the world and direct their subordinates to carry out secret operations in various countries. The Japanese were most fond of imitating the Germans, so Konoe also built such an underground room, on the one hand, conducting secret work and, on the other hand, using it as an unexpected air-raid shelter. The so-called unexpected was because the Japanese initially believed that foreign planes could never come to bomb the Japanese mainland.

However, Konoe was not a permanent prime minister. This kind of arrangement seemed excessively secret. Once he stepped down, what use would it be? It is not known that in addition to his position in the cabinet, Konoe controlled the operation of two or three secret societies; the Black Dragon Society was one of them. In addition, because he had some "imperial bloodline" connections, he was also a key figure in the "Tenko Shuyu" society. After invading the mainland, annexing East Asia, and dividing the world's hegemony with the Germans, and then having a showdown with the Germans to compete for world domination, Konoe was one of the key figures—secret worms—inherited from Ito Hirobumi and Okuma Shigenobu. Based on the slightest connection; could not each secret worm arrange a small secret underground room?

Free Talk

### North and South

— Shao Fu

According to a letter from a friend in Beiping, the conflict between northern and southern students in various universities is raging. Following the Third Academy of Peking University, Tsinghua University recently launched a poster war between northern and southern students.

We dare not dogmatically say that this is a spread from the dispute over setting the capital of the National Assembly, but it cannot be denied that it has an impact.

The issue of setting the capital naturally does not originate from regional concepts, but after reading the inquiries and replies of Tsinghua students, it is impossible to avoid some emotional reasoning. For example, southern students asked:

(1) Why were Zhou Zuoren and Qian Daosun, traitors, sanctioned by national law?

(2) During the enemy-puppet period, why did the enemy distribute flour to students of puppet universities?

(3) Why didn't you go to the interior?

Northern students replied:

(1) Zhou Zuoren and Qian Daosun were sanctioned by national law for being traitors.

(2) If northern students were traitors for not going to the interior, then all Chinese people who were once ruled by the Manchus would be traitors; how could you be an exception?

(3) The enemy-puppet authorities distributed flour, not exclusively to students. You (X)'s (X)'s also received it without going to the interior: according to logical principles, you (X)'s (X)'s are also traitors.

If this continues, it will easily hurt feelings, and extraneous troubles will erupt at the school.

Exploring truth, seeking right and wrong, especially in schools, we do not oppose debate, but if it goes off track, attacking and criticizing at will, it will lose the demeanor of research.

Universities in Beijing and Shanghai do not yet have such phenomena, and we hope that they will not occur in the future. Whether the South is strong or the North is strong, everyone is Chinese, and it is best to work together to make the entire China prosperous.

### Shanghai Traffic Relapse

— Wen Hu

Traffic in Shanghai has now reached a state of chaos again. Since Shanghai implemented traffic control, the chaotic situation seemed to have improved a bit, and most of the traffic police were more willing to work hard, but now it has returned to its "normal state," developed its old temper, and the enthusiasm of the traffic police seems to have faded like the yellow "pedestrian crossing lines" painted on the streets.

One of the rules of the previous traffic control was that "empty vehicles are not allowed to enter the central district," but now we can see empty rickshaws and pedicabs driving in the central district at any time and place and parking in places where they should not be parked; of course, these empty vehicles naturally have a corresponding obstruction to the passage of vehicles.

The strangest thing is that the Zhejiang Road Bridge suddenly prohibits trucks, rickshaws, and pedicabs from passing. Naturally, these wheels that are not allowed to pass all concentrate on the Xizang Road Bridge, resulting in North Suzhou Road and North Xizang Road being impenetrable. When it is crowded, it takes no less than an hour for a car to reach Nicheng Bridge from the Xizang Road Bridge via Suzhou Road, and sometimes even longer.

Recently, the traffic order on North Xizang Road and North Suzhou Road has been extremely chaotic, especially in the afternoon, when it is almost in a state of "hemiplegia." Now let me write down the congestion situation below:

Every day from afternoon to about 6 pm, the section from the intersection of North Suzhou Road and Wenchang Road to Xizang Road Bridge and then to Nicheng Bridge is the most congested place. When it is impenetrable, all vehicles cannot move a step. Once, I opened the window and saw the Xizang Road Bridge full of congested vehicles, not moving at all. I thought something had happened, but it was not so; it was just that the vehicles were so congested that they could not turn around and it was difficult to move forward or backward. That day, the vehicles lined up from the bridgehead all the way to the Farmers Bank warehouse on North Suzhou Road. The rickshaws and pedicabs were lined up very long, and the dark crowd of people was like the audience in a theater. Of course, rickshaws and pedicabs coming to this kind of road shout bad luck, because what can be reached in an hour now takes two or three hours. Those impatient passengers naturally do not wait long and pay the fare to "walk leisurely." Many business cars coming from the North Station turn around and take other roads when they see that the situation is not right. This is not the case every day, but I would say it is the case eight out of ten days.

However, the Zhejiang Road Bridge, which is only a river away, is very leisurely. Apart from a few trams and cars, there are no other vehicles. It is said that the reason why the Zhejiang Road Bridge prohibits pedicabs, rickshaws, and trucks from passing is because pedicabs collided with trams on the bridge, so it was done for "safety." Of course, we do not oppose this "wise" measure, but we are a little disapproving of this "throwing out the baby with the bathwater" move, because those vehicles that cannot be discharged have no choice but to crowd onto the Xizang Road Bridge. What's more, North Zhejiang Road is the only way for passengers to reach the North Station.

Now the congested traffic situation in Shanghai is naturally not limited to North Xizang Road. The above is just the facts that the writer has seen with his own eyes.

Now the writer puts forward a few questions, hoping that the traffic authorities will review themselves. (1) Is it necessary to change the routes allowed for trucks loading goods depending on the location of the warehouse and the traffic conditions of the pier? Because some routes prohibit the passage of trucks loading goods, some trucks must detour elsewhere to reach their destination. Such detours are enough to increase the congestion of vehicles elsewhere. (2) What remedies are there for the improper prohibition of rickshaws, pedicabs, and trucks from passing through the Zhejiang Road Bridge? (3) When vehicles are congested and cause a partial stoppage of traffic, will the vehicles that caused this chaotic situation be punished as they deserve?

Finally, I hope that the authorities will not restore Shanghai's traffic to the chaotic state it was in before (the situation on North Xizang Road has exceeded the past), and should review and improve it practically at any time and place, and must not "throw out the baby with the bathwater"!

### Luo Zhuoying, Chairman of Guangdong Province

— Jie Qing

The current chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government is General Luo Zhuoying, styled Youqi, from Dapu, Guangdong. He is 53 years old this year. Although Luo is from Guangdong, he served in the military in Jiangsu and Zhejiang for a longer period and has fewer connections with Lingnan.

Luo graduated from the eighth class of the Artillery Department of the Baoding Military Academy. He was in the same class and the same room as General Chen Cheng. They shared the same ideals and were very close. After leaving school, from 1922, Luo has been assisting Chen in military affairs and has been deeply relied upon. In 1925, when Chen served as the commander of the Capital Garrison, Luo served as the captain of the police art team guarding the gate of the National Government. When important central officials entered and exited, he had to stand at attention and salute as usual. At that time, Luo himself probably did not expect to have today's status.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, when Burma became critical, Luo, with the recommendation of General Chen, served as the commander-in-chief of the Burmese Expeditionary Force, a position of glory, envied by all.

Luo's complexion is slightly dark, a little overweight, short in stature, strong in physique, meticulous and gentle, and good at using soldiers, and is also known as the "Ever-Victorious General." Luo came from a poor family. In the midst of military affairs, he did not give up chanting poetry, and often published good works in the "Yuefu" poetry magazine edited by Yu Youren.

Luo's administration of Guangdong still does not depart from the strict methods of governing the army. Therefore, some people use "low air pressure" to describe today's administrative province of Guangdong.

This summer, Luo ordered civil servants not to wear Hong Kong shirts during office hours; recently, at the Guangdong Provincial Administrative Conference, he further stipulated that commissioners and county heads should wear uniform uniforms. From these two points, we can get a glimpse of his style.

### Stealing Urine to Make Secret Medicine

— Xue Zhen

A few days ago, the article "Little Brother Missing" in this publication mentioned a Chinese medicine called "X Shi" (presumably Qiushi). I remembered that a distant relative of a friend of mine was engaged in this business. One day we also talked about this issue, and he told me many valuable materials.

It is said that "Qiushi" is indeed a good medicine; it can treat postpartum disorders, pulmonary tuberculosis, hemoptysis, and other yin deficiency diseases. Assuming regular consumption, it has the effect of maintaining youth and prolonging life. Moreover, so far, there are very few people and places that manufacture this medicine.

The manufacturing method of "Qiushi" is a secret recipe, only passed on to sons, not to daughters, so as to prevent outsiders from learning it. It is said that the place of my friend's distant relative is one of the best of the few manufacturing places in the country. They do not work at all in spring, summer, and autumn. Only when winter comes do they become busy, trying to find buckets of boys' urine from all over the place. Generally, the source of this boys' urine is nothing more than elementary schools that are relatively close. Giving the school managers some bribes will allow you to collect and pick them endlessly.

When the manufacturing boss (that is, the person who knows this secret method) sees that it is enough, he mixes the medicine in a secret room that outsiders cannot enter, and pours the collected boys' urine into a large pot, heats it on a stove for several days and nights until it is dry, and then adds more, until the prescribed date arrives, then he puts out the fire, and shovels out the snow-white residue remaining in the pot, respectfully and carefully hides it or sells it. The steps of making the medicine are also completely successful. However, the smell is so bad that it stinks for ten miles, and the nearby residents complain and scold, saying that people want to be childless and grandchildren. Therefore, the burning place is mostly chosen in mountains and forests or remote fields to avoid disturbing others.

"Qiushi" is snow-white in color and salty in taste. Drinking it with hot water as salt soup in the morning is the most nourishing thing, but the price is surprisingly expensive. A bag can only be bought for tens of thousands of dollars, which ordinary people cannot afford.

Recently, cases of children often being found after being lost have been discovered in this city. It is speculated that the purpose may be to take their urine, which is also very likely. However, the amount of urine required for manufacturing medicines is absolutely large, and like the "Qiushi" manufacturing place I mentioned, it is far away in Taozhuang past Jiashan. If they cannot get boys' urine, they actually try to come to Shanghai, risking a similar violation of the law, to find it, which can be said to be at any cost!

However, regarding the efficacy of "Qiushi" itself, superstition is more than fact. Just imagine: Those urines may come from sick children. Those who make Qiushi do not know what the ingredients are in the urine and actually make medicine. Even if it is effective for certain diseases, this is still incredible today!

### Admonition

— Zan Ying

People who don't have time to exercise will definitely have time to get sick; people who don't have time to relax their nerves will definitely have time to suffer from insomnia.

People who are good at enriching their lives are also the people who understand exercise the most and often relax their nerves.

In a Nutshell

The Shen Bao's selection of the top ten news stories has been announced. After reading the top ten news stories in Shanghai, we feel very sad. Except for the second, seventh, and eighth items, almost none of them are not related to the current turbulent economic situation; grain loans, gold bricks, hawkers, Jiang Gongmei, Yu Xiangnong, Rong Desheng, and even the Shanghai Miss scandal are all caused by the endless high prices. I don't remember which of these "cases" it was, but one of the main criminals in the case confessed: "Rather than sitting and waiting for death, it is better to take the risk." At this time and place, these two sentences can especially be used as the conclusion for these many major cases mentioned above. As the year comes to an end and the weather is cold, the cases are all coming to an end, but the price of gold and rice will not stop jumping because of the new year. If we do another selection a year later, can we be allowed not to see these painful events again?

Too Much of Anything Is a Bad Thing

According to reports, Duval, a graduate of Abeville University, closed his doors and lived in Switzerland eighteen years ago because he was tired of modern life, spending eighteen years in a small world without ever leaving his home. Some people say that this is truly a monster of the atomic age, but I think it is far from it. Because college students are too lively now. For decades, from dancing and dating "sand crabs," they have evolved to the point of almost exploring the North and South Poles. Since the times have overcorrected, of course too much of anything is a bad thing. Therefore, Duval is no different from speaking in person, locking himself up first, and locking himself up for eighteen years to show his determination to reverse the declining social trends. Shanghai has the advantage of being the first to catch the trend. Unemployed college students who are interested in writing a long masterpiece such as "History of the Republic of China" may as well be "Chinese Duvals." Even if "his hair and beard hang down to his knees, and his body is covered with maggots—he is still "not mentally ill and is more intelligent than ordinary people," you can rest assured; however, the problem is that "newspapers and food" must be prepared in advance.

The True Meaning of "Neurasthenia"

I went to listen to Peking Opera with a friend, and they were performing "Catching and Releasing Cao." Cao Cao on the stage had already killed his way from behind the curtain to outside the curtain with a sword, met Lu Boshe, and slashed him down with a sword. My friend, who is a doctor, suddenly said with a sense of feeling: "Cao Cao must be suffering from neurasthenia." But looking at Chen Gong's panicked, frustrated, and fully displayed kind expression on the stage, I felt that his neurasthenia was even more serious than Cao Cao's. For example, now, someone is eager to help others and borrows a sum of money to a friend who is having a hard time getting through the year, stating that they don't want "high interest." This is of course the ultimate in benevolence and righteousness; but later, this friend actually absconds with the money and goes to the ends of the earth, leaving no trace, and as a result, the public is harmed by their poor financial management and commits suicide to die for friendship. What is the difference between this and Lu Boshe's kindness being killed? But at this time, we must not "suffer from neurasthenia" like Chen Gong and blame the world and people's hearts. We must watch coldly; this ungrateful friend may one day have a way to deal with the money he absconded with, speculate successfully, and become a celebrity. You can put on a dignified face and say: "I knew you would have this day, that guy deserved to die!" Many social celebrities are a bit "neurasthenic." You should follow this principle of responding to all changes with the same. Chen Gong was finally killed by Cao Cao at Bai Men Lou for a simple reason: he didn't understand this at all, and his "neurasthenia" was more serious than ordinary people!
