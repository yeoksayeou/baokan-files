### Over Four Hundred Reporters Travel to Cover the Public Trial of Top Traitor; Chen Pens a 60,000-Word Confession; Verdict May Be Announced Next Week After Court Hearing

[Special Dispatch from Our Suzhou Correspondent, 11:30 PM, 4th] The warm and bright weather brings joy to people, and the public trial of Chen Gongbo, the leading traitor, is sure to bring infinite excitement to those concerned. In recent days, the focus of conversation in the streets, alleys, taverns, and teahouses has been on this event. Reporters specially sent by various newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai to Suzhou for coverage have reached 455. Most of them are staying at the Le Xiang Hotel, and many citizens are flocking there to inquire about news, making the hotel no less than a news agency. The Suzhou newspapers hosted a reception this morning to show camaraderie among colleagues. In addition to reporters from various newspapers, "China Electric" and "China Film" have also specially sent personnel to Suzhou for photography and recording, totaling about 40 photography technicians. Originally, the Suzhou Power Plant generated electricity from 5:00 PM daily, but after repeated negotiations between "China Electric" and the High Court with the power plant, they agreed to generate electricity from 2:30 PM, but the power plant requested a subsidy for coal costs. More than 20 "China Electric" photographers and technicians spent this afternoon arranging lighting in the First Criminal Court and testing the light intensity, and everything is ready.

The trial will open at 3:30 PM on the 5th, and the High Court has completed all preparations. The public gallery in the First Criminal Court originally could only accommodate just over 140 people, but it has now been expanded. As of the time this telegram was sent by the reporter, more than 260 admission tickets have been issued. Although the High Court had previously announced that it would stop issuing tickets, special arrangements can still be made for important personnel to attend. Currently, long lines are arranged outside the courtroom to accommodate attendees. The High Court has also specifically stipulated that reporters are prohibited from running around arbitrarily to avoid interfering with photography and court order. It is reported that Chen Gongbo's son has come to Suzhou to attend the hearing, and the Military Affairs Commission has also sent important personnel.

The presiding judges have been decided: Sun Honglin, President of the High Court, will serve as the presiding judge; Shi Meiyu will be the chief judge; Chen Jiarui will be the associate judge; and Han Su will be the chief prosecutor. Yang, the clerk of the High Court, will continue to serve as the clerk. Yang has been extremely busy these past few days, dealing with various arrangements, and feels like he has no time to eat.

Regarding security, 21 armed court police officers are deployed. Six men led by Suzhou Police Chief Su Zimin are responsible for escorting Chen, four men are on guard in court, three men are monitoring the court order, and four men are guarding outside the court. Chen was originally planned to be transported from the detention center to the court by car, but it has now been decided to use an armored vehicle. It is expected that when the vehicle passes, tens of thousands of people will crowd the streets to see what fate awaits this great traitor. Chen has not hired a lawyer and is only represented by Gao Rong, a court-appointed lawyer designated by the court. It is reported that Chen has written a confession in prison, about 60,000 words long, and has also written two briefs of defense, which were submitted to the High Court a few days ago. In prison, Chen occasionally wrote poems to express himself, but the rhymes are poor, and the tones are discordant. In addition, the Military Affairs Commission has sent a sound film taken when the puppet government was established, which may be shown if necessary.

Chu, also a Traitor, Will Stand Trial with Chen's Wife; Trial Period Around Mid-Month

[Central News Agency, Suzhou, 4th] Chen has been interrogated three times by the Suzhou High Court Prosecutor's Office, and the chief prosecutor has collected two boxes of evidence of Chen's planning to organize a puppet government and collude with the enemy. Therefore, this trial of Chen will be much more convenient. According to reporters, after Chen's trial tomorrow, a verdict may be announced on the 11th of this month. Furthermore: Chu Minyi and Chen Bi jun, Chen's wife, will be tried at the Suzhou High Court in mid-month, following Chen's case. The time will likely be on the 15th and 16th. Lin Baisheng, the former puppet propaganda minister, has not been sent to Suzhou and is still detained in Nanjing. It is said that he will no longer be sent to Suzhou and will be tried by the Nanjing court. According to Shi Meiyu, presiding judge, the verdict for Miao Bin, which will be announced on the 8th, will be based not only on the law but also on public opinion. As for Zhang Beisheng, whose case has been remanded for retrial, the main point of the retrial is only whether the crime of "selling a friend for personal gain" by betraying Ma Yuanfang is established. The other crimes of clearing villages, blockading areas, and recruiting and training puppet troops still stand. These crimes alone are enough for him to receive the same sentence as previously handed down.

[Further Telegram] This morning, the reporter went to the Suzhou High Court. Presiding Judge Sun Honglin was sitting in the president's office, studying the piles of documents of this major traitor's case. Next to the case was a phonograph and several records, which will be important evidence during tomorrow's trial of the traitor. These records were obtained from the enemy by our side and contain a recording of Chen's speech on the third anniversary of the founding of the puppet Manchukuo in Changchun.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 4th] Shi Meiyu, Presiding Judge and concurrently President of the Nanjing Military Tribunal, spends three days in Suzhou and three days in Nanjing each week. When trying Miao Bin, he requested Miao to be a witness for the Military Tribunal, and Miao readily agreed.

### Provincial Autonomy Law Discussed by Special Committee; Political Consultative Conference Subgroup Continues Meeting; Youth Party Agrees to Attend After Mediation

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 4th] The joint meeting of the Political Consultative Conference's Comprehensive Subgroup and the Constitutional Draft Review Committee continued yesterday. Representatives from the Youth Party did not attend, but discussions continued as usual. Regarding whether the provincial autonomy law must be passed by the Legislative Yuan, and the entire political issue of central devolution of power versus local balance of power, if the true meaning of local balance of power is clearly defined and determined, then the question of whether the Legislative Yuan has the right to pass the provincial autonomy law can be easily resolved. Therefore, Wang Chonghui, Zhang Junmai, Qin Bangxian, Chen Qitian, Wang Yunwu and others were immediately appointed to form a special committee to study this issue. The committee is scheduled to meet this afternoon. Regarding the absence of representatives from the Youth Party, Sun Ke, Zhang Junmai, and others went to persuade them yesterday in their personal capacity, and all major issues were scheduled to be discussed at another meeting at 2:00 PM tomorrow (5th).

### Administrative Heads of Electoral Districts Should Not Be Elected National Assembly Representatives

Executive Yuan Answers Inquiry from Political Council

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 4th] Regarding the question of whether National Assembly representatives should also hold official positions, which was raised by someone in the Political Council a few days ago, the Executive Yuan has now formally responded with the following reasons: The National Assembly is organized by the people, and government officials also have national identity. If they are supported by the voters, there is no reason why they cannot be elected and also serve as National Assembly representatives. For example, the members of the British cabinet are entirely composed of members of Parliament elected by the people, and most other countries also have no restrictions on people's representatives also holding official positions. China's situation is unique, and the Premier's will has clear provisions on this. In order to prevent officials from manipulating the elections, during the last election of National Assembly representatives, it was specifically restricted that the administrative heads serving in the electoral district could not be elected as National Assembly representatives of that district, in order to strike a balance.

### Iranian Issue Achieves Agreement; Security Council Stalemate Broken; General Assembly Postponed Until Next Tuesday

[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 4th Broadcast: The Security Council's stalemate may be broken. At an informal meeting of members last night, unanimous agreement was reached to accept the Soviet Union's guarantee to withdraw troops before May 6. All parties believe that this agreement is the Security Council's unprecedented great achievement.

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 4th Broadcast: The Security Council convened on time today. Soviet representative Gromyko did not attend. U.S. Representative Stettinius proposed that since the Soviet Union has guaranteed that its troops will withdraw from Iran, the Council should postpone discussion of the Iranian issue until after May 6. After May 6, the governments of the Soviet Union and Iran should report to the Council whether the withdrawal has been completed, but within this period, if the Soviet Union, Iran, or any member of the Council reports that some development will hinder the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the Council should discuss it immediately. The Egyptian representative agreed with Stettinius' proposal and praised the Soviet Union's spirit of adhering to the Council's resolution. The Egyptian representative also stated: "We deeply hope that the world is now convinced that this only institution for maintaining peace is still strong and vigorous." Subsequently, representatives from the United Kingdom, France, Brazil, Egypt, Poland, and Mexico also agreed with the U.S. representative's suggestion, while the Australian representative abstained from voting. It is said that the Iranian issue was a challenge to the Security Council, and now the Security Council could not cope with it. The Soviet representative's withdrawal from the meeting was regrettable. At this point, Chairman Quo Tai-chi announced that nine of the eighteen members had expressed their agreement, and the Iranian issue would no longer be discussed. The U.S. representative's suggestion was adopted. It was also decided to postpone the General Assembly until next Tuesday.

[United Press New York, 4th Dispatch] Representatives to the Security Council here are extremely optimistic about the resolution of the Iranian-Soviet dispute. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes believes that there have been three important achievements in the past ten days: (1) Any country may bring to the Security Council any situation it deems to threaten peace; (2) No country can prevent the Security Council from proceeding with its agenda, and withdrawal from the meeting is ineffective; (3) No country can violate the working procedures of the Security Council, which are determined by the will of the majority.

[United Press New York, 3rd Dispatch] On Friday, the council members will visit the Long Island factory to inspect it as a new temporary site for the United Nations agencies, to replace the current Hunter College site.

### A Scene from the Moscow Soviet-Iranian Negotiations: Sincere Enthusiasm is Appreciated, Further Understanding is Hoped For; Iran Only Wishes for Peaceful Sleep; Sadar Said to Molotov in a Pitiable Tone

[Reuters Tehran, 1st Dispatch] (Delayed) An Iranian official who accompanied Iranian Prime Minister Sadar to Moscow for negotiations said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had told Sadar to make some concrete expressions of his willingness to cooperate with the Soviet Union. He said: "Please do not forget that we gave up all our rights in Iran 25 years ago." Sadar replied: "I am deeply grateful for your sincerity, but sincerity alone is not enough. We still hope that your country can understand this." Molotov also said: "We understand Iran, we know that Iran wants to move forward on the road to progress. Perhaps Canadian Prime Minister King does not agree with this statement (referring to the Canadian spy case). After the Second World War, small countries all want independence.

Editorial

### Removing Obstacles to Existing Private Enterprises

Yesterday, the *North China Daily News* published an article entitled "The Future of Private Enterprises," stating: "Although China is currently actively engaged in recovery, according to observations by figures in the production sector, the outlook for private enterprises in the short term is not optimistic. It is said that Chinese private enterprises once enjoyed the advantages of cheap labor and ample raw materials, but are now suffering from fierce competition from state-owned enterprises and government-subsidized enterprises, as well as competition from inexpensive and high-quality imports from abroad. China, having experienced years of war, is facing a shortage of raw materials, and the continued increase in production and transportation costs is putting private enterprises in a competition with government-operated enterprises that is bound to fail. The fact that most private enterprises need to borrow money from the government is enough to show that they are facing a serious crisis, and a return to normalcy seems unlikely in the near future." Although this is a foreign assessment, it is not far from the mark as an observation of the future of Chinese private enterprises.

Indeed, in the seven months since the surrender of the Japanese invaders, recovery and national reconstruction have become commonplace slogans. Although this period is not very long, if we try to think about what achievements have been made in these seven months, we cannot help but feel deeply moved. National reconstruction and recovery cannot be achieved merely by empty talk; there must be concrete facts, there must be accomplishments through action. Private enterprises, unfettered by cumbersome political institutions, should be full of vitality and marching towards recovery and reconstruction at this time of victorious nation-building. However, in the past few months, the situation has been such that private enterprises have not only failed to fully exert their vitality to dedicate themselves to recovery and reconstruction, but have instead shown a state of decline and stagnation. If this situation is allowed to persist without any attempt to remedy it, then it is unknown when recovery and reconstruction will be achieved, and the prospect of China's industrialization is unimaginable!

The formation of this situation is due to multiple causes. Broadly speaking, it stems from the government's indecisive policies towards private enterprises, which has led to a wait-and-see attitude among the people, and a reluctance to move forward. Although the current turbulent domestic political situation is also sufficient to deter general investors from taking risks, the people have some confidence in the evolution of the political situation, that no matter how rampant the Chinese Communist Party may be, the political situation in China will mostly rely on the efforts of the Kuomintang to stabilize it. What they deeply regret now is that the practices of the Kuomintang officials in charge are somewhat baffling to them. Although the Kuomintang's political program and policies have explicit provisions to protect private enterprises, and regulations to delineate the boundaries between state-owned and private enterprises, in reality, policy is policy, and action is action, and the two seem to have no connection. As for the doctrines taught in party ideology and civic education, that is one thing, but the methods adopted in actual governance are another. Because of this contradiction, private enterprises feel that they have no way out, and some pitiful national capitalists—hardly capitalists at all—have therefore failed to unleash their vitality, and recovery and construction are inevitably stalled.

To cite two recent examples: First, the establishment of the China Textile Corporation (Zhongfang) and the China Silk Corporation (Zhongcan) is said to be a temporary measure, and not a policy of state-owned enterprises expanding and penetrating into the territory of private enterprises; but in reality, the establishment of these companies has government backing and special preferential treatment. For example, the price they pay for fuel is different from that of ordinary factories. In such an unfair competition, where can private enterprises find a way out? Second, the Kuomintang's Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, on the last day of its meeting, passed Song Ziwen's proposal for emergency measures to accelerate economic recovery, stipulating that labor-management disputes should be mediated and arbitrated by the government, and that strikes and work slowdowns are not allowed without authorization. If arbitration fails, the government may take over the private enterprise. This is indeed a method that the United States has used, but we must first study whether mediation and arbitration can truly be impartial and reasonable. If the result of the arbitration is indeed beyond what the capital side can bear, can the state, after taking over, pay the wages as determined by the arbitration without incurring losses? The state has the power to incur losses, which is of course irrelevant, but how can it force private enterprises to incur losses? If this method is used casually, private enterprises may be taken over by the government at any time. This is probably contrary to the general policy of the government to reward and promote private enterprises within its capabilities. How can the people, under the threat of such policies, muster the courage to dedicate themselves to the development of private enterprises? The fact that it has become increasingly difficult to find buyers for factories being auctioned off in recent times shows this phenomenon. During the war in the United States, private enterprises were still unwilling to accept the government's takeover methods and filed lawsuits to the Supreme Court, arguing that even in times of war, the state had no right to take over private enterprises. The federal government was defeated and the interests of private enterprises were protected. Our country, at the time of the victory of the war against Japan and the reconstruction of the country, needs to support the development of private enterprises in many ways. The implementation of this policy should be carefully considered.

In addition, let us look at the current foreign exchange rate and how it affects domestic production. Calculated at an exchange rate of 2020 legal tender dollars per US dollar, the price increase of imported goods is only 700 times that of pre-war prices. Add to this the considerable devaluation of the US dollar and the duties to be paid, and the price of imported goods is generally not more than 1000 times that of pre-war prices. However, the price of our country's manufactured goods is probably at least 2000 times that of pre-war prices. How can they compete with foreign goods? Not only industrial manufactured goods are like this, but even agricultural products will suffer the same fate. The reason why general yarn factories are competing to buy American cotton and ignoring Shaanxi cotton is because American cotton is cheaper and the delivery dates are accurate, without the trouble of buying Shaanxi cotton. The *North China Daily News* said that private enterprises are suffering from fierce competition from state-owned enterprises on the one hand, and oppression from inexpensive and high-quality imports on the other hand, which truly reveals the location of the disease. Therefore, under this exchange rate, we must, in addition to the exchange rate, find ways to protect our country's private enterprises through tariffs. For industrial products that our country can manufacture, we should encourage the import of their raw materials and block the import of similar manufactured products, so that private enterprises can have some way out.

In short, the post-war recovery and reconstruction of China should prioritize the recovery of production, and the recovery of production cannot do without the cooperation of private enterprises. We would like to earnestly advise the authorities that vision must be far-sighted, and cultivating the wealth of the people is equivalent to increasing the resources of the country. Do not be shortsighted and always have the idea of "competing with the people for profit", and gradually damage the vitality of private enterprises' recovery intentionally or unintentionally. Maintaining law and order, restoring transportation, limiting the scope of state-owned enterprises, and settling labor disputes are all important measures to remove obstacles to private enterprises, and the government should make every effort to achieve these tasks.

Farmers in various townships of Wuxing have a strong interest in spring sericulture. However, the rural economy has been ravaged by the enemy and puppets, resulting in an inability to purchase seeds.

However, some unscrupulous merchants, with the sericulture season approaching, are collecting large quantities of spring seeds, and the black market price for brands such as Tiger, Plum Blossom, and Watermelon is as high as 6,000 to 7,000 yuan per sheet, manipulating profits and disregarding the hardships of farmers. The farmers in the six districts of the county reported to the Party and government agencies in joint names yesterday, ordering them to strictly prohibit and suppress the price of seeds, because the government stipulates that the price of each sheet of spring seed is 500 yuan, but these unscrupulous merchants dare to raise the price, which is detrimental to the countryside.

As for the silk merchants and cocoon merchants requesting loans, they are of a general commercial nature and the amount required is very large, so they will be handled separately.

The infants weigh an average of about three pounds each and are currently being cared for in the hospital. This is truly a sign of national prosperity for the new China. The father of the infants is a shop assistant in a Cantonese-style food store in the city and already has five children. Including the newborns and the couple, the family now has ten members. The difficulty of their livelihood is self-evident. Most countries have regulations for rewarding childbirth, and governments would surely reward a family with triplets. China does not yet have such a system, so we must rely on compassionate assistance from society to enable these infants, who represent national prosperity, to survive healthily. (The photo shows the triplets held in the arms of a nurse).

### Notorious Traitors in the "Loyalty" Prison; 21 Ounces of Prison Food Per Day; Sleeping on the Floor; Families Rush to Send Clothes and Bedding

Entering the solemn gates of the Shanghai Prison, one sees only high walls and iron fences, inevitably conjuring up images of unkempt prisoners spending long years in dark cells, sending a chill down the spine.

Because over seventy notorious traitors have been brought here, the reporter made a special visit to the prison authorities to inquire about them.

These traitors are now all held in the "Loyalty" ward within the prison. The "Loyalty" ward is a five-story cement building with 374 prison cells. Currently, important traitors are held one per cell, while those considered less important are held two or three per cell. Thus, the 374 cells can accommodate about 1,000 prisoners. For security reasons, the number of guards in the "Loyalty" ward is higher than in other wards.

When the traitors were brought in, they all had some money on them, but it is now held in safekeeping by the authorities. There are no beds in the cells. Except for those who are old or sick and have been granted special permission, regardless of whether they were once "Presidents," "Ministers," "Governors," or "Directors," they must now make do with sleeping on the floor, spreading out their bedding to experience this discomfort.

Because of their special circumstances, the traitors in the prison are treated differently from other prisoners. Family members and defense lawyers are not allowed to visit them. However, they are allowed to go outside their cells in batches to walk around during designated times, always under the watchful eyes of the guards.

The prison authorities do not differentiate the traitors from other prisoners when it comes to prison food. The "new rich" who were accustomed to delicacies and fresh fruits now receive the same prison rations as petty thieves: 21 ounces per day, plus vegetables. However, because family members are allowed to bring in changes of clothes and bedding every Thursday, and food every Tuesday and Friday, they do not eat much of the prison food.

With the public trial approaching, the families of the traitors are rushing to hire lawyers and prepare their defense. Thinking back to how they relied on the enemy to oppress and exploit the people, I wonder how they will try to justify their actions. Will they claim to have served the country as undercover operatives?

When leaving, I saw many family members lined up outside the gate to deliver clothes and bedding. Their masters have fallen, their dreams shattered. Countless eyes of soldiers and civilians who sacrificed themselves during the war of resistance are now watching them, and countless hands of suffering compatriots are raised to hold them accountable. Have they finally awakened? (By Mu Ren)

### Wage Index Out of Line with Economic Principles; Importance of Changing Customs Should Be Emphasized; Councilors Raise Questions at the Seventh General Assembly

[Our Correspondent] The Shanghai Provisional City Council held its seventh general assembly yesterday morning at 9:15 AM. Thirty-one councilors were present. Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian presented a summary of the Social Affairs Bureau's work as follows:

Social Affairs Bureau Report:

Economic Administration: (1) Company Registration: To date, 308 cases have been approved and filed. (2) Foreign Company Registration: Because the Foreign Company Law has not yet been promulgated, no registrations have been made. (3) Registration of Various Companies in Recovered Areas: 84 cases of license verification. Industrial and Commercial Registration: To date, 681 applications for registration have been received, covering 11,545 businesses. The registration fee has been reduced from 0.5% to 0.1%. Public Organizations: (1) Industrial and Commercial Associations: Before the war, there were 800,000 organized workers in the city, now there are 500,000 to 600,000 (excluding manual laborers who are not yet organized). There are 400,000 to 500,000 merchants and about 20,000 to 30,000 independent professionals. (2) Seventy labor unions have been reorganized, and 13 social organizations have been established. Labor Administration: (1) Handling Labor Disputes: From September of last year to the end of February, 489 labor disputes involving workers and 860 labor disputes involving shop employees were handled. 1,160 cases have been resolved. (2) Unemployment Relief: Jointly handled by the Ministry of Social Affairs' Special Envoy to Beijing and Shanghai. In August and September of last year, there were over 70,000 unemployed workers, now there are over 30,000 workers. Initially, cash was distributed, but due to its shortcomings, each adult worker now receives one and a half bags of flour per month, and each child worker receives one bag per month. (3) Preparing for labor welfare and organizing a wage review board. The main reasons for labor disputes are: (1) Workers suffered oppression from the enemy puppets for eight years, and are inevitably acting abnormally after liberation. (2) Price fluctuations and unstable living conditions make it difficult to maintain rational control. (3) Most factories are unable to resume operations, leaving workers without livelihood security. Labor disputes can be divided into two types: (1) Demands for improved treatment; (2) Demands for resumption of work, with the former being the majority. The bureau has decided to adjust treatment based on the cost of living index and will not agree to demands for adjusting base salaries. In the future, the handling of labor disputes will adopt two methods: (A) Holding factory meetings to implement coordination. (B) Handling everything in accordance with the law, and those who arbitrarily strike, be lazy, close factories, or suspend operations will be dealt with jointly by the security organs. Cultural Affairs: (1) Sixty newspapers have been registered, 247 magazines, 18 news agencies, 224 books, and 49 scripts. There are currently some small publications that are seriously undermining public morals. Such over-the-line publications will be dealt with by the police. (2) 41 theaters have been approved for registration, 90 theatrical troupes, and 19 bookstores. Social Welfare: 85 charitable organizations have been registered and 22 public welfare organizations. Relief Work: (1) Establishing refugee and child shelters, with a total of 1,305 people sheltered in Caohejing. (2) One public pawnshop has been established, and two more are being prepared. (3) Managing winter relief, establishing shelters to provide warmth, and those who can be repatriated are being repatriated, while the rest are being transferred to shelters.

Councilors' Questions:

After Director Wu finished his report, the assembly took a ten-minute break, and then Xu Yongzuo raised questions: (1) Although the commercial registration fee has been reduced, have any amended regulations been promulgated in other individual laws? (2) The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Fuel Committee handles the distribution of coal, which is exclusively for state-owned factories. Although private enterprises also have allocations, ordinary citizens have no opportunity to obtain it. What can be done about this? (3) There is considerable doubt about the cost of living index, especially the rent item, which is over 3,100 times higher. Even including fuel, it is still staggering. Please explain. (4) Since workers' demands to increase base salaries are not being changed, why have the base salaries of employees of major companies been changed recently? Shui Xiangyun hopes: (1) To make greater efforts in handling labor disputes to prevent them from escalating. (2) Over 1,400 workers have come to Shanghai from the interior, but only seven have been introduced to jobs. He hopes to establish a unified base standard for treatment. (3) Is it reasonable for shop employees to organize unions? (4) To pay attention to helping prostitutes and changing social customs. Pan Xulun had many thoughts on wage policies and the cost of living index, saying briefly: The industries most affected by labor disputes are currently those that are union-operated, public utilities, and cultural enterprises. Some people believe that the Social Affairs Bureau's current wage policy is speaking for the capitalists, which is arbitrary. Fellow workers in the labor community should use calm minds and broad vision to make accurate judgments. He believes that paying wages according to the cost of living index is not in line with economic principles. He previously made suggestions, but was opposed by Li Jianhua, director of the Labor Department. In reality, if wages are based on the cost of living index, it will not be sustainable by production, because China's current production index is far below the cost of living index. If it is implemented, it will inevitably lead to the bad consequences of "sitting and eating the mountain empty."

Director's Response:

Because Director Wu wanted to attend an important meeting of President Song, he did not have time, so he first answered the questions raised by the three councilors: (1) Industrial and commercial registration and other points have been seriously addressed. He first exchanged views with the City Chamber of Commerce and the special envoy of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and agreed to revise the various points, which were then passed by the Municipal Council before being submitted to the central government for review. (2) The Fuel Committee was originally a municipal government organization, but it was later managed by the central government. Initially, coal was exclusively for public utilities. Later, citizens were allocated fuel, and could purchase 50 pounds of coal dust and coal balls with their electricity bill, but the quantity was indeed small. (3) The cost of living index is divided into three types: workers, employees, and foreigners. The workers' cost of living index is entirely based on necessities such as food (vegetables, oil, flour, etc.), housing (including rent, water, electricity, fuel, clothing, etc.), and the items are relatively simple. The change in the base salary was caused by the prior agreement between labor and management, and the bureau naturally did not interfere. (4) The factory meeting system can enable labor and management to discuss various assets, production, and other issues, allowing the labor side to understand the difficulties of the management side and not make excessive demands. This system has achieved considerable results. (5) Giving work to workers from the interior is a matter of course, but because workers from both places often cannot cooperate, causing disputes, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been requested to allocate three factories specifically for workers from the interior, which has been approved and will be distributed soon. As for the same pay for the same work, it is not possible in the current state of China's industrial backwardness, and can only be applied within the same factory. If small factories also follow this method, they will inevitably be unable to sustain themselves. (6) Shop employees must not form unions according to the law. The most reasonable thing is to organize friendship associations. (7) Efforts should be made to change social customs. However, there is disappointment that some prostitutes still wish to return to their old profession even after being introduced to other jobs. (8) The current wage policy of the bureau is based on the common practice in Europe and the United States, that is, to implement maximum wages during wartime and minimum wages at peacetime to ensure a minimum standard of living. The current situation of most factories is poor labor discipline, insufficient equipment and power, and insufficient capital, which is the reason for increasing the production index. (9) Workers who have already obtained wages sufficient to maintain their livelihood and still make unreasonable demands should be stopped with action.

Due to time constraints, Councilors Lü Entan, Cao Jun, Li Bojia, Xu Shihao, and Zhao Banfu submitted written inquiries. The meeting adjourned at 12:15 PM. The second group review meeting was held at 3 PM in the afternoon. The third group review meeting will be held this morning, and the eighth general assembly will be held this afternoon, where the Police Bureau will report.

Group Review Meetings Hold Second Meetings Yesterday

The Municipal Council held its second group review meeting at 3 PM yesterday afternoon. The first group review meeting was postponed. The second group review meeting reviewed matters related to financial, economic, and construction issues. Xi Yushu, Wang Yansong, Xu Yongzuo, Shui Xiangyun, Shen Ding, Xi Bingcheng, Ye Fenghu, Pan Xulun, Xu Shihao, Zhou Xuexiang, and Wan Molin attended, with Wang Yansong chairing the meeting. Seven proposals were reviewed. The third group review meeting, which reviewed matters related to education and culture, was attended by Fei Cheng, Chuan Tongxian, Shu Xincheng, Ji Hao, Gong Pinwan, and Pan Xulun, and was chaired by Feng Youzhen. Four proposals were approved.

Yu Zhijing Replaces Zhao Zhiyou's Vacancy

### Li Deyu, Manager of the Bank of China's London Branch, Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing for Talks; Sino-British Trade Expected to Return to Normal Soon

[Our Correspondent] Li Deyu, Manager of the Bank of China's London Branch and Vice Chairman of the Sino-British Chamber of Commerce in London, has been managing the bank's affairs in the UK for seventeen years. He flew to Chongqing on the 10th of last month to report on his duties and arrived in Shanghai last week. The reporter made a special visit to him to inquire about the economic situation in the UK and the future of Sino-British trade. He provided a detailed explanation, which is summarized as follows: He said that the UK was greatly affected by the war, and its vitality was greatly depleted. After the war, its own economic situation was not good. It has now successively borrowed funds from the United States to replenish the factory machinery that was damaged during the war and to purchase food. After the domestic situation gradually improves, it will fully restore its export trade. It is estimated that the current export volume has reached 60% of the peak export volume before the war, and it is expected to continue to increase thereafter. At the same time, it is hoped that China can gradually export goods such as eggs, bristles, and hides, which were shipped to the UK before the war, to the country, so that British products can also be regularly imported into China, so that the system of exchanging goods for goods can be promoted to the fullest extent.

The reporter asked whether the Sino-British telegraphic transfer rate should be announced as soon as possible after the opening of the foreign exchange market. He said: It would be best to announce it as soon as possible, but at present, because there is not much Sino-British trade after the war, there is actually no need to formally announce it. At present, the settlement of remittances from this city to the UK is calculated at the rate of 3.70 USD per British pound, while the British side still hopes to calculate it at the original exchange rate of 4.03 USD. Currently, British merchants in China have not promoted normal trade between China and the UK because commodity prices in China are high and the UK's own economic situation has not recovered. However, he believes that this is an inevitable phenomenon during the transition period, and the prosperity of past trade will soon be restored.

### Adverse Weather Not a Hindrance; Jiangwan Airport Installs Blind Landing Equipment

### The Powerful Factions and Speculative Gangs Collude: Creating a "Fait Accompli" - Government Bonds Rise by Over a Thousand Yuan Yesterday

Yesterday, confidence in government bonds continued to rise. The scrapped New Harbor Notes have been recognized as Hong Kong legal tender by the Hong Kong authorities. General sentiment, interpreting this loosely, hopes that our authorities will also recognize the "fait accompli," pushing national bonds to an unbelievable level. One call elicits a hundred responses, with followers gathering in droves. At the same time, powerful factions are searching for "miscellaneous brands," hoping to achieve sudden success. Since these "miscellaneous brands" stand firm and unbroken, speculators feel even more excited about Category C bonds. The rise of one leads to the following of others, creating an endless cycle. Consequently, Category C bonds rose from around 3,100 yuan at the opening in the morning to approximately 4,100 yuan. Categories A and B rose from 1,950 yuan to 2,300 yuan, Category D to 2,500 yuan, and Category E to over 2,700 yuan.

### Weakness and Motherly Love

- Wang Wenxin

- Written to commemorate the first Children's Day after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War -

Yesterday was Children's Day. Looking at the myriad of weak and wandering children in the universe and the indifference of people in the world today, I cannot help but sigh sadly, cherishing the greatness of motherly love.

Old age and death are unavoidable phenomena for living things. The oldest animals live for no more than 500 years. Therefore, living things must give birth to young ones before individuals get old and die in order to seek the "existence" of repetition and expansion of the individual. However, all young ones must be weak. The more advanced the animals, the more fragile and unable to survive on their own when they are young. They cannot feed themselves when hungry, cannot clothe themselves when cold, do not know how to avoid danger, and cannot defend themselves against enemies. If all adults treat them with indifference and ruthlessness and do not like to help and nurture them, then all young ones will only wither away and cannot grow. The universe and all things will also return to illusion and reduction. Therefore, sympathizing with the weak, loving the weak, and nurturing the weak is the nature of all adults. Kang Qing said: "Like protecting a baby." Mencius said: "When people suddenly see a child about to fall into a well, they all have a feeling of fear and compassion." The reason why human beings can survive and prosper and all things can continue to grow is that there are weak ones to make up for the inevitable defects of old age and death, and that all adults can show special sympathy for the weak.

However, human sympathy is sometimes transferred by internal psychology and the external environment. Internal psychology, such as the desire for power, vanity, etc., is often enough to make people become cruel and unwilling to sympathize with the weak and suffering. The Latin poet Lucretius once said: "It is a pleasant thing to stand on the shore and see people struggling in suffering when the wind rises and the waves rise." The great philosopher Spinoza used to catch mosquitoes and flies and place them in spider webs to watch them being swallowed as pleasure. Nietzsche advocated that the strong should promote the demise of the weak in order to fulfill their responsibilities. These are all clear evidence. In terms of the environment, ignorance, poverty, famine, and war are also enough to make people become cold and ruthless. The Romans made people fight and kill animals for entertainment. The Spanish made animals fight and kill animals for entertainment. The Spartans killed weak babies. In China, it is popular in some places to drown girls, which is regarded as a matter of course. When people are poor and hungry, they sell their children, and even exchange children to eat. When people are fleeing in war, babies are weak and are discarded everywhere. These are all clear evidence. Russell said in "The Problem of China" that Chinese "thousands of people are waiting to die in famine, and people sell their children for a few dollars, and kill them if they cannot sell them," saying that the Chinese nation lacks sympathy and is cruel in character. However, everyone has the human nature of pitying the weak, and ignorance, poverty, famine, and war can indeed make people lose their nature. Since the start of this war, due to the protracted duration, the spread of the war, the extreme damage, and the excessive sacrifice, two-thirds of the world's people are struggling to survive in the fire, escape, and famine. Unconsciously, some people have become particularly focused on economics, reality, and snobbery. Under the circumstances of only knowing how to get rid of hunger, cold, and death, who can the tens of thousands of weak people rely on? In the migration of fleeing, it is inevitable that children are regarded by adults as only able to sit and eat and are sold. When getting on and off the vehicles, it is inevitable that they will be squeezed out because they are young and weak, wandering the streets. After being captured, sold, or picked up, it is inevitable that they will be killed and played with by the enemy, or enslaved or abused by living people. A scene of the suffering of the weak is gradually unfolding in the ruthless fire and hunger. If you pay attention to the streets at dusk and the fields of desolate villages, the sad stories almost make people suspect that they are in hell. Those who are in pain think of their parents. If you want to save the weak from danger and turn coldness into warmth, then it is only by promoting motherly love that you can save the lost opportunity of heaven and earth? (To be continued)

### Chairman Chiang's Political Report to the Political Consultative Conference - Full Text (Part 1)

Chairman Chiang delivered a political report to the National Political Consultative Conference on the morning of the 1st. The full text is recorded below:

Fellow members of the Political Consultative Conference: It has been half a year since Japan surrendered and the War of Resistance ended. The government's efforts to secure international and domestic peace during this period can be divided into the following six areas:

Striving for Internal and External Peace - Implementing Six Measures

(1) For the sake of world peace and security, co-signing the United Nations Charter with friendly nations, promoting the United Nations organization, and participating in the Security Council, with the aim of rebuilding international justice and the order of law. (2) For the sake of good neighborly relations with neighboring countries and stability within our borders, seeking solutions to outstanding border issues with relevant countries, the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance will enable the two major countries bordering each other to achieve a path of peaceful cooperation. (3) For the sake of freedom and equality for all ethnic groups within the country, assisting ethnic groups outside the provinces with concrete self-governance capabilities and the will for independence, and when they have reached a level of economic and political development where they can be independent, supporting their independence and self-governance. For ethnic groups within the provinces, granting them equality in politics and law, and granting them full freedom in belief and economics. (4) For the sake of stability in domestic social order, the cessation of party disputes, and the early end of political tutelage and the implementation of constitutional government, adhering to the consistent principle that "political problems should be resolved by political means," convening the Political Consultative Conference to jointly discuss methods for convening the National Assembly, study the principles of the draft constitution, and decide to expand the foundation of the National Government before the implementation of constitutional government, urging people from all parties and social elites to participate together, and formulating an Outline for Peaceful National Reconstruction as a guideline for governance during this transitional period. (5) In order to stop domestic military conflicts, issuing orders to cease conflict and restore transportation, and establishing the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation to implement the ceasefire orders. (6) In order to implement the military demobilization plan and consolidate the independent communist armies into the national army to ensure the unification of the army structure and military orders, the military subgroup meeting will develop a reorganization and consolidation plan, which the government firmly adheres to without wavering, and the sections that deal with the national army are being implemented faithfully in accordance with the predetermined steps.

The above six items are all efforts to seek a path to peaceful unification. If the direction of peaceful unification can be implemented effectively, the great cause of national reconstruction can proceed smoothly. If efforts towards peaceful unification suffer setbacks, the crisis for the nation and its people will worsen day by day. You all will surely show deep concern for these issues concerning the survival of the nation. On the diplomatic front, Minister Wang has already reported to the Assembly. The agreements of the Political Consultative Conference have been reported to you by Secretary-General Shao. I will now provide a simple explanation of the recent developments in the Northeast problem, the events of the Yining Incident in Xinjiang, the methods for resolving it, and the discussions on the revised principles of the Political Consultative Conference's draft constitution.

We know that the Northeast and Xinjiang issues have a significant impact on the nation's peaceful unification, and the constitution is the fundamental law of the state organization. These three issues are the most important diplomatic and political issues facing China today, and I believe it is necessary to present them frankly to the Assembly:

The Development Trend in the Northeast is a Diplomatic Issue

(1) The Recent Developments in the Northeast Problem: The Northeast problem is essentially a diplomatic issue. The focus of the issue is that we, the Chinese National Government, are receiving Chinese sovereignty in the Northeast in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and its annexes. The process of receiving sovereignty in the Northeast has already been reported separately by Foreign Minister Wang, and there is no need to repeat it at this time. What I want to add specifically is the recent exchange of documents between the Chinese and Soviet governments. On February 22nd, the Soviet Ambassador informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "the Soviet government informs the Chinese government that the Soviet army will have completed its withdrawal from Manchuria by the end of April of this year, in accordance with the government's decision." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied on the 27th that "the Chinese government agrees that the Soviet army can complete its withdrawal from Manchuria by the end of April of this year for the convenience of the Soviet side. Please inform us of the dates when the Soviet army will withdraw from various locations and, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, provide convenience and assistance to the Chinese government's troop replacements during the withdrawal." Foreign Minister Wang also told the Soviet Ambassador on the same day that "there is still more than a month before the Soviet army completes its withdrawal, and the Northeast railway network is extensive and transportation is convenient. The Chinese government's troops are fully capable of reaching the various locations where the Soviet army is withdrawing before the Soviet army withdraws. Please inform the Northeast Soviet Army Command to quickly discuss with our military delegation, headed by Lieutenant General Dong Yanping, the arrangements for the handover of defenses in various locations, so that our army can receive assistance from the Soviet side during the takeover." This is the recent negotiation process between China and the Soviet Union regarding the issue of receiving sovereignty in the Northeast.

I deeply believe that after hearing our report, you comrades will feel greatly hopeful about the clarification of the situation in the Northeast. We have always recognized that peaceful cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is not only a common need for both countries, but also a basic condition for peace in the Far East and security in the world. I am even more certain that the Soviet Union's need for peace to facilitate reconstruction is the same as our need in China. Our China will surely obtain the peaceful cooperation of the Soviet Union, and temporary twists and turns in any one place or event cannot shake our confidence. The basis for peaceful cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and its annexes. We can only abide by the spirit of the treaty and its annexes, and hope that the Soviet Union will jointly fulfill the spirit of the treaty and its annexes. This is the foundation of peaceful cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, and it is our two countries' valuable contribution to peace in the East and security in the world.

Before Completing the Takeover, There is No Internal Politics to Speak Of

Secondly, talking about the internal political problems in the Northeast, we can say that before the sovereignty of the nine provinces in the Northeast is fully received, there is no internal political problems to speak of. If someone raises internal political problems and uses them as conditions for negotiations with the central government during the period when the sovereignty of the Northeast has not been recovered and the diplomatic problems have not been resolved, it will inevitably hinder our receipt of sovereignty and increase diplomatic difficulties, then we don't know what their intentions are. If, under the current difficult diplomatic situation, there are still domestic parties taking advantage of this difficult diplomatic situation to demand that the government recognize their illegal status and special rights, seeking the interests of their own individuals or parties, and disregarding the life and death of the nation, then such actions that harm the country and the people should never be done. The central government's responsibility for the Northeast now is only to receive the territory and restore the integrity of sovereign administration. This is not only the government's responsibility, but also the demand of the nation and its people. The people of the Northeast have been separated from their motherland for fourteen years under the Japanese invading forces and the rule of the puppet Manchukuo. Their only hope now is that the sovereignty and administration of the Republic of China can be fully exercised in the nine provinces of the Northeast, allowing them to once again be protected by the laws of their own country and become free citizens of the Republic of China. When the nation's sovereignty is restored and administration is complete in the Northeast, the people of the Northeast will naturally enjoy the right to local autonomy in accordance with national laws. But now, the truly patriotic compatriots in the Northeast do not want to use the name of local autonomy at this time to hinder the government's receipt of sovereignty and divide the territory of the Northeast. This is out of their sincere patriotic desire, and we must not let them down.

The Kuomintang Has Struggled in the Northeast for Fourteen Years

For fourteen years, the military and civilians of the Northeast, under the leadership of members of the Chinese Kuomintang, have armed themselves to resist Japanese occupation and oppression. From September 18th to the day of the Japanese surrender, the number of people who died and were imprisoned during these fourteen years, excluding the more than 100,000 army officers and soldiers, the number of cadres sacrificed by the Chinese Kuomintang, such as Zhang Tao, Wei Zhongda, Yu Zhonghe, and Hui Dashan, reached as many as 1,432. The Japanese and puppet Manchukuo's control was strengthened day by day, and the armed activities of the masses and the underground work of comrades became more and more difficult. However, when Japan surrendered, there were still 2,700 members of the Chinese Kuomintang who were released from the Japanese and puppet prisons in Jilin, Changchun, and Harbin. May I ask, how many members of the Communist Party were there? The trust of the people of the Northeast in the Chinese Kuomintang, and the achievements of the Chinese Kuomintang members' hard work in the Northeast, these figures are the most accurate proof.

During the period when Japan occupied and controlled the Northeast, the Communist Party did not have any armed forces to speak of. The discovery of the Communist Party's troops in the Northeast only happened after the Japanese surrender. The Communist Party troops that entered the Northeast from Rehe Province, and the Communist Party troops that crossed the sea from Yantai with a small number of weapons, were all empty-handed. These several troops combined are what they call the "Democratic Allied Army." Their only work now is to obstruct the government's troops from receiving sovereignty, and to demand a special political situation. It must be known that obstructing the receipt of national sovereignty is obstructing the implementation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, and is also threatening peace in the Far East and security in the world. For the sake of national sovereignty and international peace, our National Government can never recognize the actions of the Communist Party's so-called "Democratic Allied Army" in obstructing the receipt of sovereignty and its so-called "elected government," which is an illegal organization. If they can practice and fulfill the reorganization and consolidation plan without obstructing the government's actions to receive sovereignty, then our government, with a benevolent heart, should give them a legitimate and honorable way out and an opportunity to be loyal to the motherland. This is a point that we must clearly recognize and firmly grasp regarding the Northeast problem.

On January 10th of this year, government representatives and Communist Party representatives, with the assistance of General Marshall, jointly declared a method to stop conflict and restore transportation, stipulating that "Section 2 of the order to stop conflict does not affect the National Government's troops entering the nine provinces of the Northeast or moving within the nine provinces of the Northeast in order to restore sovereignty." This clause was established based on the above understanding and is still valid today. However, the Communist Party's troops in the Northeast are now obstructing the government's actions to receive sovereignty in various parts of the Northeast, causing armed conflicts, disrupting local social order, and harming the lives and property of the people. This is something that we are very saddened by. The National Government is concerned about the suffering of the local people and hopes that the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation will carefully select an executive team to send to the Northeast to stop the local military conflict. From the time General Marshall proposed to the Military Tripartite Conference on the 11th of last month to the 27th of last month, after multiple meetings, an agreement was reached. Under the following conditions, the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation will carefully select an executive team to go to the Northeast: (1) The task of the team is limited to military mediation work; (2) The team should work in the areas of both the government army and the Communist Party army, and avoid entering areas still occupied by Soviet troops; (3) The team should go to the locations of conflict or the closely contacting points between the government army and the Communist Party army to stop the conflict and make necessary and fair mediation. All parties also agreed that the three-person meeting would continue to discuss military issues in the Northeast, and that political issues would be discussed separately to seek a solution quickly.

Peace, Struggle, and Unity - Handling the Communist Army in the Northeast

What I want to add here is that in the last few meetings, the Communist Party representative specifically raised matters that he requested to be recorded: "The government should guarantee to discuss with the Communist Party the interim measures for relevant political matters in the Northeast in accordance with the methods stipulated by the Political Consultative Conference. The government does not interfere with or hinder the currently elected local governments, pending the resolution of political issues." Based on this, it can be clearly known that the Communist Party representative's opinion obviously wants to use the so-called "Democratic Allied Army" of his Northeast Communist Party troops and the so-called "elected government" that they illegally created to obtain the basis for his cooperation in obstructing the government's attempt to receive sovereignty. The government representative could not agree to this and has resolutely rejected it. This is an important point in the meeting process, so it is necessary to report it to the Assembly. Secondly, it is the policy adopted by the government on the Northeast problem. The government's only goal in the nine provinces of the Northeast is to receive sovereignty and implement the nation's administrative power. The mediation of military conflicts is only carried out under the premise of not affecting the government's receipt of sovereignty and exercise of national administrative power. As for all illegal regimes that violate the will of the people of the Northeast and hinder the sovereignty and administration of the Northeast, they cannot be recognized by the National Government and the people of the whole country. We hope that the Communist Party troops in the Northeast will stop trampling on the people, coercing the people, forging public opinion, and obstructing the actions of the national sovereign administration. In particular, we hope that they will accept the consolidation plan, join the national army, and work hard for the nation and its people. We have always firmly believed that the sentiment of loving the country and loving the nation is shared by all Chinese. We should use the spirit of peace, struggle, and unity to handle the problem of the Communist Party troops in the Northeast. We firmly believe that this is the only correct way to solve the Northeast problem. (Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd, telegram, full text to be continued).

### The Relighting of Tieling

— Special Correspondent Han Qingtao, Shenyang News Report

A train of soldiers traveling on what used to be the "South Manchuria Railway," now the "China Changchun Railway," is an unprecedented event for us!

The "South Manchuria Railway" posed too great a threat to us in the past. Countless people have been beaten and kicked by Japanese soldiers and police, and countless lives have been lost. The September 18th Incident also started with the so-called "explosion incident" created by the Japanese.

Those who could boarded this troop train from Shenyang to Tieling, first loading the train in HuangguTun, and then pulling it to the Shenyang Station on the "China Changchun Railway." Once the train started, it was advancing on the China Changchun Railway. The first thing that caught the eye was the large [bridge] where the Japanese assassinated Zhang Zuolin. The Beining Railway passed under the bridge, leading to the Shenyang General Station.

At "Beidaying," [there is] a low group of dwarf Japanese trees, leading to several large buildings. The puppet Manchukuo army received training here. Next to this section of the railway, the Japanese erected a structure representing the explosion of the rails. There is also a permanent monument. The shamelessness of the Japanese warlords looks quite pathetic today!

North of Beidaying, there is a very large factory, said to be thirty or forty *li* in circumference. Its name is the "1918 Factory," and it manufactures light tanks... The Japanese orchestrated a masterpiece to destroy our Northeast. Scene after scene flashed before my eyes.

The Factory Chimneys Do Not Smoke

Workers Hope to Resume Work Soon

The double-track railway allows smooth passage for the Soviets. The trains sped along the route without stopping, frequently passing other trains head-on, flashing by. The 120 *li* distance between Shenyang and Tieling was covered in two hours.

Tieling is a city with a population of over 50,000. The area around the station has many new buildings, and the streets are wide. It used to be a Japanese residential area, but now many doors are closed, and everything changes with the times.

The city area is narrow and muddy, with mud and water all over the streets. To pass through, one must wear high rubber boots. Many large stores are located on these streets. The reporter arrived in Tieling on the third day of the National Army's entry into Tieling. The Tieling market has already returned to normal.

Tieling originally had more than ten large factories and twenty small factories, producing light metals, paper, bricks, cloth, etc. At the same time, the Japanese, because the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant was a bombing target for our side, planned to establish a steel branch plant in Tieling. Before it was completed, it was attacked.

Most of the machinery in all the factories was taken away by the Soviet army. The small remaining portion was moved to Faku by the Communists, so now the chimneys of the major factories are not smoking. In the past, in addition to male workers, most women and children in Tieling worked in factories, about 20,000 people. Now that there is no work to do, everyone unanimously [hopes] that they will strictly punish [those responsible] and allow the few small factories that can operate to resume work as soon as possible.

Local Gentry Patrol at Night

Most Koreans Changed Their Japanese Names

Tieling has over ten thousand Japanese residents, mostly "South Manchuria Railway" employees and technicians from various factories. They were subjected to the exploitation and rape of the "big noses." At the same time, our poor people and vagrants took the opportunity to seize some of the remaining items. On the eve of the "August 13th" liberation of the Northeast, our compatriots released from prison rioted in the Japanese area every night to take revenge. The local gentry, believing that this should not continue, personally led security personnel to patrol at night, thus stabilizing order. Koreans, numbering three thousand in the county, are mostly rice farmers. Another part are workers in various factories. Most of them changed to Japanese surnames, bullied others, and committed all kinds of evils. The number of compatriots harmed by them is too great. Today, we do not demand anything from them and allow them to live freely. Everyone hopes that the Korean government will punish these people.

Japanese Residents Plan to Hold a Song and Dance Performance

National Troops Decline Their Consolation

Five *li* away from Tieling, the Japanese spent three or four years building a steel bridge two *hua li* long on the Tiefa County Road, which was just completed. On the eve of surrender, they blew it up. This is truly a loss for us. Now, in addition to a few Japanese residents being recruited to work, some are setting up stalls on a street near the station, selling food, cigarettes, and worn clothing to make a living. On the day the reporter arrived, the Japanese residents planned to hold a song and dance performance to慰劳 the National Army. The National Army authorities informed them that they were staying temporarily and declined.

The "South Manchuria Railway Hospital" is a well-equipped hospital in Tieling, with the best X-ray equipment, etc. Currently, there are 21 Japanese doctors, dozens of Japanese female nurses, and more than ten Japanese staff members working as usual. In addition to anesthetics and antipyretics, the medicines are also very complete. Many Chinese and Japanese people come there to see a doctor every day.

Local Politics Undergo Changes

The Eighth Route Army Took Away a Large Number of People

According to a local elder who told the reporter, after the "August 15th" liberation, Tieling fell into chaos. A temporary county government maintenance association was organized to maintain治安. More than 100 employees of the county government continued to work as usual. The chairman of the maintenance association was Zhuang Shaoyu, the former puppet Manchukuo Tieling County Chief. The vice-chairman was Zhang Jingze, the former puppet Manchukuo Tieling Mayor. A local gentry, Wang Zigui, was also pushed to be a vice-chairman.

The Soviet army arrived in Tieling on August 22nd. In addition to the Japanese, we also suffered many damages. Later, the Communist army came, and the appointed County Chief was Liu Weidong, who was good to the people. This time, when the Communist army withdrew from Tieling, Liu Weidong left with them, and Zhuang Shaoyu was also taken away. In addition, many people followed the Eighth Route Army. Most of them were unemployed workers, and there were also a few teachers. When the Communist army first arrived, they forced local people to enlist, so the number taken away was quite large.

Before the Communist army arrived, two Kuomintang departments were competing to recruit party members and engaged in fierce mutual attacks. One of them unscrupulously recruited hooligans. When the Eighth Route Army came, these hooligans switched their allegiance to the Eighth Route Army. They had served as secret agents in the puppet Manchukuo. When the National Army arrived, the two departments were still arguing. The reason for this phenomenon, it is said, is that one was a former worker in the area who was arrested and imprisoned, and was released after liberation. The other thought that the former was in trouble and newly [arrived].

The newly appointed Tieling Mayor and County Chief, Li Guiting, arrived late. It was the fourth day of the National Army's entry into Tieling before news arrived from Shenyang. The military person in charge there believed that this style was a failure, so he sent an urgent telegram to Shenyang to inform the administrative persons in charge in Kaiyuan, Sipingjie, and other places to go to take over with the army to avoid interrupting government affairs.

The Battle of Balizhuang Was Fierce

Deputy Commander of the 89th Regiment Was Wounded

The National Army's expansion towards Tieling started on March 19th from the Wenguantun Station north of Shenyang. The march was extremely difficult because the bridges were destroyed by the Eighth Route Army, and there was also deep melting mud. On the morning of the 23rd, they reached a place five or six *li* away from Tieling. At 9:30 in the morning, they began to make contact with the Communist army. The left wing captured Toutaizi and Ertaizi after fighting for two and a half hours. The right wing captured Balizhuang at 7:00 a.m. on the 24th.

The battle of Balizhuang was quite fierce. On the National Army side, Luo Shunfu, the Deputy Commander of the 89th Regiment, was wounded. More than 30 other soldiers were wounded and killed. Eighty-three Communist soldiers were captured, along with six unidentifiable rocket launchers and many guns. It is said that the Communist army suffered heavy casualties, with 431 bodies left behind.

The Communist army defending Tieling consisted of the 24th Brigade of the New Fourth Army, the 19th Regiment of the Liaobei Provincial Security Army, the 71st Regiment, the 5th Special Task Regiment, and the Tieling Security Brigade, totaling more than 3,000 people. On the 23rd, four trains arrived from the north, belonging to the New Fourth Army’s [number omitted] Brigade. On the morning of the 24th, another 3,000 people arrived. As soon as they got off the train, they retreated to the mountains and villages together with the retreating Communist army.

The Joint Middle School Has Started Classes

Students Are Scattered in the Surrounding Villages and Have Not Returned

Everything in Tieling has been settled. The joint middle school has started classes. The school is at the request of more than 600 students from the existing two male, one female, and one middle schools in Tieling. There were originally more than 1,000 students. Many are scattered in the surrounding villages and cannot come for the time being.

When the reporter went to visit, a classroom was having a composition class. The teacher had already written "A Letter of慰问 to the National Army" on the blackboard as the topic, and the students were writing and thinking. Then, they visited a health room with ultraviolet light and other equipment. According to the school teacher, the other equipment is also complete, but unfortunately it is not intact now.

There were originally nine elementary schools. When the reporter was in Tieling, they had not yet started. The middle school teachers are mostly temporarily taking on obligations for the education of the youth in their hometown. After the city and county take over, there should be new decisions.

The prices of food in Tieling are still quite low, while the price of cloth is higher than in Shanghai. Generally speaking, prices have risen four or five times successively since the "August 15th" liberation. Rice is 30 yuan per kilogram, sweet potato starch is 25 yuan per *manzhi jin*, pork is 28 yuan, millet is 4 yuan and 50 cents, corn flour is 3 yuan and 50 cents, and cabbage ranges from 1 yuan to 1 yuan and 50 cents. According to the *manzhi jin*, which is equivalent to 15 *liang* in the mainland, the official exchange rate of 法幣 is 13 yuan for 1 yuan of the Northeast circulation currency (puppet Manchukuo banknotes), and the Red Army tickets have the same value as the Northeast circulation currency.

The people of Tieling hope that good mayors and county chiefs will be sent to use the county government officials who have not left to implement good county administration in order to restore the prosperity of Tieling. The newly appointed mayors and county chiefs must not neglect this point! (Shenyang, March 28th.)

### An Export Merchant

— Yang Cheyi

In order to manage foreign exchange, the authorities require that all foreign exchange from exported goods must be purchased by designated banks. This undoubtedly greatly benefits the national economy. However, for the sake of the future of industry and commerce, it is absolutely impossible to increase the burden and difficulties of merchants. If there is no perfect method, it is necessary to avoid losing sight of one thing while attending to another. I have a few opinions to contribute to the relevant authorities.

According to the current method of foreign exchange management, merchants must entrust the bill of lading for all exported goods to a designated bank for negotiation. When the goods arrive abroad, the foreign importing merchant must prepare the foreign currency of the total value of the goods and redeem the bill of lading from the bank in order to take delivery of the goods. According to the above situation, merchants need to have two copies of funds in order to do an export business once, because one copy of funds is used to purchase goods domestically, and one copy of funds is used to redeem the bill of lading abroad. Although the goods can be mortgaged and a portion of the funds can be borrowed from the bank, the current high interest rates are definitely not affordable for export merchants.

Recently, the price of goods and foreign exchange have not been parallel, and there is actually no profit to be made from exports. In addition to the above-mentioned difficulties, the remaining export merchants will inevitably be unable to move forward and will transfer their capital to speculative businesses. This will have a great impact on the national construction plan, and there is a real need for improvement.

In terms of foreign exchange management, various countries have already implemented it in the early stages of the war. For example, in British Malaya and other places, for all exported goods, a bank guarantee must be provided. The exporting merchant must promise to remit the foreign exchange of the value of the goods back to the place of origin through the bank within six months in order to obtain export permission. In pre-war Japan, for all exported goods, the bank was entrusted to negotiate the bill of lading. After the bank completed the investigation and considered the actual situation feasible, it would lend the full amount to the exporting merchant without interest or with the lowest interest. When the goods arrive abroad and the bill of lading is received, the total value of the goods must be repaid to the bank within one month. According to the former method, foreign exchange can be managed without affecting the merchant's funds and business. The procedures are convenient and the difficulties are reduced. The latter is a good method to encourage exports and promote production. The above two methods are generally easy to implement, and are specially presented for the consideration and adoption of our wise authorities.

Random Thoughts

### Remembering the Poet Yang Yunshi "Triple Sequel"

— Tang Liyan

Military horses lightly carry the youth, clothes covered in dust. Forcing joy to temporarily drown sorrows, secretly grieving the spirit. The tears of a lifetime are worth the price of gold, only bestowed upon heroes and beauties.

Branches dazzle the eyes, piled with red snow. Rouge cannot buy a good spring to return. Beyond Luofu, there is no spring scenery, from now on, Yang Qi will not paint eyebrows.

At the Binjiang Tower, an impromptu farewell to A Mei, saying:

The color of the wine is like the waves of the river. Autumn willows at the inn send off many guests. Who cherishes this farewell the most today? A beauty sings the Yellow River with tears in her eyes.

The painted curtain, bright and clear, rolls up the autumn smoke. Tears fill the golden goblet, words fill the strings. Drink one more cup, do not laugh at me, the country is all before the beauty.

Hand-pouring grape wine, urging a toast. Affectionate, I cherish Du Wei Niang. After the devastating weather of the Double Ninth Festival, the autumn rain is silent, and the river willows are yellow.

For years, Fan Li has had no home. In front of Xisai Mountain, it is like Ruoye. Do you ask when I will return, carrying Xishi? The spring breeze flows, peach blossoms are emerald.

This is Mr.'s promise to welcome you in the spring with A Mei. Later, a letter was received from A Mei in Shanghai, with eight chapters of melancholic poems, and at Zhengzhou, there were four poems on the photo of Lady Changmen, saying:

How can I bear to drink and hear songs again. Consuming my sorrows, what can I do? Since the poem of Chu Tian was composed, there has been much rain and clouds on the river.

The feather clothes startled and broke the sorrow of pipes and strings. The sound of trumpets and drums travels east, the iron cavalry comes. From now on, Jiangshan will cease to sing and dance, for whom will she dress up by the zither platform?

The Han Emperor valued beauty and lost the goose in shock. Ashamedly, he bought a painter with gold. All the talents of hegemony are hard to find a master, every year, he is drunk and passes Xin Feng.

Year after year, destitute again this year. Pawned all the spring clothes to buy drunk and sleep. The life at the end of the world is barely satisfactory, the general treats me generously, and the beauty pities me.

In Beijing, listening to songs at a banquet, it was as if the traces of the Han chariot were evident, four poems said:

The hall is full of clear voices, the songs of Ziye. Hearing it again after ten years, so many regrets. There is no sorrow, only the moon in the sky, does not shine on the mountain passes, but shines on the embroidered silk.

I am ashamed of Du Sijun for the clear words. The lights illuminate the bustling building, connecting to the evening. Today in Southern Hunan, I miss his demeanor. The trees are still like this, let alone the adjutant?

The clouds press the palace city, the jade trees are tall. Newly woven orange fingers break through the cold night. After Mei Cheng left, the unrestrainedness ceased. This world is too lonely.

When the strings are mournful, the frost and fog are clear. The waist of Chu is finely woven, the affection of yesteryear. Women are drunk tonight, they love to hear the sound of hunting in the autumn fields.

It is truly lingering and affectionate, with deep emotion. But Mr. has been wandering for years and has no strength to welcome Mei. It was once reported that Yang Yunshi's biography said that Peng Pei knew about this matter and competed to contribute money to get her removed from the register, which is not the case. Mei Mei passed a good scholar. Mr. also took in a Di Mei Nan in Shenyang (Mei Nan's story has a separate biography) because she resembled Mrs. Protector. Not long after, Mei Mei broke up again and heard of Mr.'s whereabouts at sea and arrived. Di Mei Nan treated her with special care. Four years had passed, the face and peach blossoms, [everything] was intact, recounting her floating life, reminiscing about the past and present, she could not help but be confused about her own life. Mr. gave her a poem, saying:

The roads are strange, the years are decisive, and grace is severed. There is no news, all the soul is dissipated. Where is Cui Hu guided at the end of the world, the peach blossoms are red to the door for thousands of miles.

The brush is put down and everyone is spreading the poem of Mo Jie. It seems that everyone is sighing together. In the Ning Wang residence, spring is like the sea, tears are still seen by the cake seller.

The bridge of ten thousand miles breaks the intestines in vain. The spring breeze is still Duan Wenchang. The greenness of Li is all over the road south of the Yangtze River, do not sing Luo Fu on the road.

The unfaithful are famous for special and non-existence. The scenery is like this, do not hesitate. Wen Jun does not envy the poem of Changmen, I still pity her, let alone the old slave.

The cloud window, the fog pavilion, the fragrant red plum. Foolish happiness can eliminate the face and guess. Last night, the curtain was rolled up in the fragrant snow, Shuangcheng smiled and embraced Lühua to come.

The powder wall is towering, embroidered with red waves. The old poems and paintings are still on the gauze cage. The clear night breeze and moon are clearly present, is it a dream again when we meet? (To be continued)

### A Discussion on Suicide

— Ren Jun

Suicide, as an act, seems to be unique to human society, the spirit of all things, and does not exist in general animal societies. This is probably because animals are just animals, with simple minds and no knowledge. They are only harmed and have not thought of suicide.

However, even within human society, it seems that one cannot generalize. The facts tell us that in so-called civilized societies, the occurrence of suicide is clearly more frequent than in uncivilized or semi-civilized societies. Therefore, if someone wants to regard suicide as one of the "malignant epidemics" brought about by modern civilized society, I think it is understandable.

Precisely because of this, suicide has gradually become one of the social problems in modern times and is often studied and explored.

Generally speaking, there are at least two different views on suicide at present. One view is that suicide is a brave act, the result of being unusually serious, persistent, unwilling to be perfunctory, and half-hearted. The other view is the opposite, that suicide is an expression of cowardice, evidence of not daring to face reality, overcome reality, and not having the courage to live on. Why do such extremely different views arise for the same act of suicide? I think that this is entirely due to the fact that people often examine a phenomenon from different perspectives. That is to say, the former looks at it from the perspective of individual behavior, while the latter looks at it from the perspective of society.

Among the countries of the world, the most popular suicide seems to be our "neighbor," Japan. Is that not so? Their "seppuku" and "shinju" (love suicide) are as well-known in the world as their cherry blossoms and Mount Fuji. In Japan, not to mention individual suicide, but also "group suicide" of the whole family is commonplace. Newspapers in Tokyo and Osaka often carry this kind of cruel and tragic news in large, bold font on the first and second pages. And the annual statistics of suicides often number in the tens of millions. Among modern writers, there are also many who commit suicide. For example, Ryunosuke Akutagawa and Takeo Arishima, who are quite well-known to the Chinese people, both died by suicide. The poet Harutsuki Ikuta, seems to be also.

Russia also seems to be one of the countries where "suicide disease" is quite popular. Taking writers as an example, there are quite a few who commit suicide. As everyone knows, the poets Sergei Yesenin and Vladimir Mayakovsky both died by suicide. Even Maxim Gorky attempted suicide once in his early years, fortunately unsuccessfully. Regarding the suicides of Mr. Yesenin and Mr. Mayakovsky, there is a famous anecdote. - Originally, after Mr. Yesenin committed suicide, Mr. Mayakovsky wrote a poem of mourning, the words of which were: "It is not difficult to die in this life; it is much more difficult to live on."

From this poem, it is clear that Mr. Mayakovsky did not quite approve of Mr. Yesenin's suicide; however, later, Mr. Mayakovsky also repeated the same tragedy as Mr. Yesenin due to various reasons. This was not only completely unexpected, but he himself, on that day, probably never thought of it.

In our China, in several large cities, especially in Shanghai, which is known as the "source of all evils," the news of taking poison and jumping into rivers has become one of the main sources of information for filling the social news pages of various newspapers. As for modern celebrities, as far as I know, since the Republic of China, those who have committed suicide include the old literary scholar Wang Guowei, an expert in the study of ci and qu; the new literary scholar Gu Zhongqi, a novelist, and Zhu Xiang, a poet. Hong Shen, a playwright, a few years ago, out of unbearable pressure in life, swallowed a large amount of red potion in an attempt to commit suicide, but fortunately he was rescued quickly and did not die.

Even a small ant is afraid of death and greedy for life. Who is not as eager to "live" as I am? A person who cannot get life and has to seek death, is there anything more tragic and worthy of sympathy in the world than this? But sympathy and agreement are not synonymous. Because suicide is ultimately one of the social pathologies that violate human nature, we hope that it can be completely eradicated as soon as possible, just as we hope that all malignant epidemics can be completely eradicated as soon as possible.

But how can we realize our hope? This is naturally not something that can be fully stated in a few words, so I will omit it for now.

However, one thing is absolutely certain, and that is: when people no longer feel "better to die" for various reasons, I ask, who would voluntarily seek death!………

### Double Flying (2) (4)

— Zhao Qingge

Master Mo suddenly opened his eyes, his mind still mixed with "drunkenness" and "dream" emotions! He looked around and realized that he was lying on the bed in his study. (Ever since Lihua was born and he was driven out by his wife, he had not lived with her.) On the desk, an oil lamp was burning, half bright and half dim. Lihua was leaning over the desk, murmuring something. Master Mo thought for a while, he remembered drinking with Master Weng in a small tavern, but he couldn't remember how he got home after that!

"Xiaohua!" Lihua heard Master Mo calling and hurried over.

"Dad, you're awake!"

"Mm! What are you doing?"

"I'm reading, Dad! You almost scared me to death just now! Uncle Weng sent you back, you were so drunk you couldn't even walk. Moshneg had to carry you to bed. You fell asleep as soon as you lay down." Lihua said, smiling, describing Master Mo's drunken state.

Only then did Master Mo understand how he had returned.

"Why aren't you asleep yet? What time is it?"

"It just struck eleven. Mom hasn't come back from the theater yet. Brother went to sleep. I was afraid you'd wake up wanting a drink, so I didn't dare leave. Dad, are you thirsty?" Lihua said, pouring a bowl of tea and handing it to Master Mo.

Master Mo took a few sips of water and held Lihua's hand tightly, both moved and troubled. He was moved that such a young child understood filial piety and knew how to care for him. At the same time, he was troubled that Madam Mo had gone to the theater alone and hadn't returned so late, which meant she was with Madam Weng again. Thinking of this, his memory gradually returned - he remembered that he had asked Master Weng to drink precisely because of Madam Weng's problem, and that he got drunk precisely because of Madam Weng's problem. He remembered that Master Weng said he couldn't solve the problem and didn't want to investigate it. He also advised him to treat everything as a dream and not to take dreams seriously, but he now strongly disagreed. He clearly saw these facts before him, which were not dreams! These facts deeply stimulated him and tormented him. He couldn't always endure everything numbly as he did when he was drunk!

Like a fire, it burned Master Mo's heart, and he felt hot all over! It was as if countless maggots were gnawing in his chest, and he coughed urgently, choking out a lot of phlegm.

"Dad! Quickly drink some water! Don't drink anymore alcohol. Look, you're coughing again!" Lihua said, pouring another bowl of tea and feeding it to Master Mo.

Master Mo didn't say anything. He just held Lihua's small hand tightly and didn't let go. It felt like a thousand words were stuck in his throat, and he didn't know where to start, only staring pleadingly at Lihua with his eyes.

### Qingming

— Shi Di

The mouth of April blows in a dark cloud, and even the spring breeze cannot blow in a trace of warmth. Teary eyes blur the simplicity of the spring fields, and a hoarse throat still sobs against the wind.

The yellow earth of the new spring has no trace of green, and the silver-gray paper ingots turn into flying ash. The yellow light on the scorched face also disappears, and the withered heart is still a mass.

I urge you to sprinkle yellow earth and put away your tears, grit your teeth and shoulder the burden at hand. When you look back tomorrow, flowers will bloom on tomorrow's mound.

### Answering Readers

Mr. Zi Jiwen: When I was young, my parents arranged a marriage contract for me. After I grew up, I was forced to marry a country woman who was illiterate, short, and ugly. I have no feelings for her at all. I have asked for a divorce several times, but without success. Considering the circumstances of both families, it seems difficult to resolve this through proper channels. Therefore, I plan to publish a statement in the newspaper to sever the marital relationship. If the other party does not deny this statement within a certain period, will this statement be legally effective? In the future, will there be no interference from either family regarding our marriages? Please provide public guidance so that I may follow it.

Answer from Lawyer Zhu Ya: The requirements for divorce are clearly stipulated in Article 1052 of the Civil Code. Your reasons and methods do not meet the requirements for divorce. Although you are dissatisfied with the country woman, a wife's virtue and gentleness are paramount. If you can guide her well, you may have a happy future. The parents of both parties have no right to interfere legally.
