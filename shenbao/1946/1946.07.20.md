[This Newspaper, Kuling, 19th Dispatch] According to information received: Chairman Chiang will issue a proclamation within the next two to three days, the contents of which are extremely important and aimed at the current situation.

Marshall will not descend the mountain for another two or three days. At 4:30 this afternoon, Chairman Chiang and the Ambassador held a one-hour discussion, the content of which was not released. At 7:30 in the evening, Ambassador Stuart received reporters from this newspaper for a ten-minute conversation. The reporter asked three questions, which the Ambassador answered one by one: (1) What is the Ambassador's impression of Lushan? (Answer) Very good, very good. The trees have grown up and are much better than they were twenty years ago. (2) What are the Ambassador's views on the UNRRA's order to suspend the shipment of some relief supplies to China? (Answer) China's most serious problem at present is transportation. Given this undeniable fact, I hope all parties will be patient regarding the UNRRA's aforementioned measures. (3) What is the Ambassador's view of the situation in China? (Answer) I am neither pessimistic nor optimistic. However, I will do my best with the greatest enthusiasm to fulfill my responsibilities.

[Central News Agency Reporter Hu Dingfen, Kuling, 19th Dispatch] "Important developments in the current situation are expected in the next two or three days." This hint was given to reporters by the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart Leighton, today at the creek near his residence. The Ambassador visited Chairman Chiang at 4:30 PM on the 19th for his first meeting since taking office, and left after more than an hour. The Ambassador, suffering from a cold, did not accompany Chairman Chiang and Marshal Marshall to see the moonrise over 向鄱口. After returning to his residence, he took a walk by the creek. The reporter approached him to exchange greetings and ask questions amid the gurgling water. Besides asking the reporter to pay attention to the important developments in the situation in the next two or three days, the Ambassador also felt that the future of the situation was particularly optimistic because China's current difficulties were not external threats but domestic personnel issues. If the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could put themselves in each other's shoes and understand each other, various problems could be gradually resolved. When the reporter asked about the "content of today's conversation between the Ambassador and the Chairman," the Ambassador replied, "The Chairman and I have been old friends for many years, so the conversation was very relaxed and pleasant." When the reporter asked, "How long does the Ambassador plan to stay here?" he replied, "I will fly back to Nanjing tomorrow noon."

Since you call on the people with democracy, constitutionalism, peace, and unity, may I ask what your intention is in such rhetoric? This kind of propaganda constitutes open defamation and insult to individuals.

### Chen Cheng Talks About the Conflict in Northern Jiangsu; The National Army Was Forced to Defend Itself; The Communist Army Forged Orders Before the Attack

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] Chen Cheng, Chief of Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, met with reporters from this newspaper alone at his private residence at 8:30 PM tonight to talk about the current situation in Northern Jiangsu. It is said that the National Army in Northern Jiangsu was completely forced to take self-defense actions and never attacked the Communist army. The situation in the three areas of Datong, Jinan, and Xinyang is the same. Chief of Staff Chen also told reporters that before launching an offensive in Northern Jiangsu, the Communist army forged an "order" claiming that it was obtained from the National Army and presented this "order" to Special Envoy Marshall in an attempt to reverse black and white and cover up its crimes. The content of the "order" stated that the National Army, in coordination with the Navy and Air Force, would launch an offensive against the Communist army on the 15th of this month, including (1) the Eighth Army of the Army, directly commanded by the Ministry of National Defense, (2) the Navy, which was in charge of the Second Fleet. Marshal Marshall, a world-renowned military expert, smiled at this naive forgery "order". Chief of Staff Chen said with a smile that the National Army has never had the number of the Eighth Army in Northern Jiangsu. Furthermore, the Ministry of National Defense has a machine to command the national army, so why bother to directly command an Eighth Army. As for the Chinese Navy, it has never had the name "Second Fleet," and the coast of Northern Jiangsu is all sandy beaches, so the Navy cannot be used at all. From this analysis, the Communist army's inferior means of forging documents have been self-defeating. But the Communist army, with this ridiculous forged order, launched an offensive in Northern Jiangsu on the 13th, claiming "preemptive strike," which is clearly a planned conspiracy. Chief of Staff Chen finally said that facts speak louder than words, and the people of the whole country are the best judges. I certainly don't want to say more.

### Good Wheat Harvest; Food Situation Improves

[Reuters, London, 18th] Reverend Allen, a missionary in China, said at a meeting of the China Aid Committee today: "It is expected that the food problem in China will be resolved by the end of August. The wheat harvest in China has broken a four-year record, so the food situation has improved. In terms of health, the spread of tuberculosis is the most terrifying. The number of students with tuberculosis has increased by 15 percent."

### Central Committee Member Pan Gongzhan Meets with Reporters; Expresses Opinions on the Current Situation; Chinese Politics is Like a Burst Appendix - Urgently Needs a Doctor to Cut Away the Rotten Part

[This City News] Almost every reporter has this experience: "Important figures in power are much harder to see than those out of power." If every important figure is difficult to see, then Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan is an exception.

On the morning of the 19th, he received reporters at his private residence wearing a white silk long gown. Beneath his graying short hair was a kind and amiable face, making the reporter forget that he was an important figure. He readily expressed some views on political and economic issues to the reporters. He compared the stalemate in Chinese politics to a patient with a burst appendix, urgently needing a good doctor to diagnose and treat, and the rotten part must be cut away in order to prevent the patient's life from falling into danger. He believed that looking at the Twenty-Four Histories of China, there was only suppression of internal chaos. The so-called civil war, only the American Civil War could be called that. The communist troops in northern Jiangsu, although they have agreed to withdraw the troops originally stationed in the area, but the government cannot hand over the regime, then how can the government's military administration be unified? The peaceful unification of the country cannot be realized entirely because the Communist Party does not have the sincerity to negotiate.

Regarding Mr. Huang Yanpei's letter to the Communist Mao Zedong, Mr. Pan believes that why did Mr. Huang not publicly publish the letter? There are so many refugees in northern Jiangsu, why did Mr. Huang not go to northern Jiangsu? Mr. Pan said with a sigh, "Return from Yan'an" has harmed many people. Before the truth about the murder of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, members of the Central Executive Committee of the Democratic League, in Kunming is revealed, reporters should not immediately report it as a political assassination. The government must thoroughly investigate this incident.

On China's current economic situation, Mr. Pan believes that politics and economics are intertwined. Unless politics returns to normal, China's economy cannot be fully improved.

He also said: "Although American goods are flooding China now, however, at present, before China's industry and commerce have recovered, the import of American goods can also delay the rise in domestic prices, but we must distinguish between the need for imported goods."

### The National Flag of the Kuomintang: Never a Specially Licensed Monopoly

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Central Propaganda Department stated that the manufacture of the national flag of the Kuomintang is freely manufactured and sold by merchants in various places in accordance with the specifications and sizes determined by the Central Government. No merchant has ever been specially licensed to operate it exclusively. Unexpectedly, unscrupulous people have set up a China Kuomintang Political Flag Manufacturing and Sales Office in Shanghai, claiming national patent rights, and setting up branches in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and other provinces, advertising themselves in newspapers. Such illegal organizations have also been discovered in places such as Wuxi. The personnel they send impersonate the name and force people everywhere to purchase at high prices. The Central Propaganda Department has specially sent letters to the provincial and municipal governments to strictly ban such illegal organizations, and investigate and deal with such swindlers. If people in various places encounter the above situation, they can send them to the local authorities for handling.

### Zhang Jia'ao Talks About the Northeast: The Takeover Problem Still Has a Considerable Difficult Period; Reorganizing the Currency System Must Be After the Military and Political Situation Has Come to an End

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 19th] A reporter visited Zhang Jia'ao, who came to Peiping the night before, and asked a few questions. He replied as follows: (1) Regarding the unified takeover of the Northeast, it is still in the takeover period. After the various economic institutions are taken over, they will be assigned to various departments for operation according to their nature. The first priority is to resume work, but due to the limited power supply, there are still many difficulties. The Xiaofengman Power Plant is still in the hands of the communist troops on the way to Shenyang, so it cannot be used. As for the takeover situation, it is difficult to say whether it is more chaotic than within the Guannei (inside the Pass), because the situation in the Northeast is special, and there are many military units, so it is not as easy as in Peiping, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai. However, inspection work can be done without problems. There will still be a considerable difficult period in the future. Zhang replied to the question of whether "military decisions determine politics" and "politics determine economics" is putting the cart before the horse, "This is the problem of whether the hybrid egg comes first or the egg comes first. It is really difficult to say." As for how to operate the entire Northeast in the future, Zhang said that it is only in the academic research of all parties. (2) On the currency system, Zhang said that it can only be reorganized after the political work has come to an end. The issuance of banknotes will also depend on the need, and there is no need to change the exchange rate with legal tender. More than 13 billion counterfeit Manchukuo currencies were issued. (3) On the transportation problem, the transportation controlled by our side is less than one-third. Air and water transportation are out of the question. In the area controlled by us, no one participates in the Changchun Railway, except for a few Soviets in Shenyang. It is rumored that the Soviets have made new demands on us, or it is said that the Soviets have "no work to do." Therefore, the situation on the Changchun Railway from Hailar in the west to Manzhouli and from the east to Suifenhe is unknown. (4) The takeover of Lushun and Dalian is indefinite. (5) The cause of death of some of the Soviets who were killed in Changchun has been found. (6) Korean residents have also begun to be repatriated, and the Japanese residents are planned to be repatriated before the severe winter.

### Japanese Prisoners of War in Communist Areas of the Northeast Have Not Yet Been Repatriated

[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 18th] Since the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war in the Northeast area began, about 400,000 people have been repatriated to the area where the new army is stationed. As for the large number of Japanese prisoners of war in the Communist area, the result of the repatriation plan has not yet been negotiated.

### The Nanjing High Court Publicly Trials Zhou Zuoren, a Traitor; His Confessions Are Evasive and Without Solid Evidence; Former Manchukuo Ambassador to Japan Sentenced to Twelve Years

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The trial of the traitor Zhou Zuoren began at 10:00 a.m. on the 19th in the High Court of the capital. It lasted two hours. Because the evidence still needs to be investigated, the court ruled that the trial would be held again on August 9th. Zhou Zuoren was slightly famous as a young man. Today, there were many young men and women in the audience. In the first part of the trial, the defendant replied to his experience before surrendering to the enemy. He was quite proud of his long tenure as a professor of arts at Peking University for 20 years. He cunningly claimed that his motive for surrendering to the enemy was to "maintain education and resist enslavement." The presiding judge reprimanded him for losing his integrity as a teacher. Zhou Zuoren replied, "The first and second-class educators have all left. People like me, who are third and fourth-class, have to come out to do their best, so that they don't read bad people of the fifth and sixth-class." He also said that he stayed in Beiping in the autumn of the 26th because he was old and was entrusted by Jiang Menglin, the president of Peking University, to be one of the "four professors staying in Beiping" to take care of Peking University. However, he stammered about his appointment as the Dean of the Faculty of Arts of the Puppet Peking University in the 28th year, the employment of puppet professors, the appointment as the Standing Committee member of the Puppet North China Political Affairs Committee and the Director of the Department of Education in January of the 30th year, as well as the President of the East Asia Cultural Association, the Deputy Director of the North China Comprehensive Research Institute, the member of the Puppet Xinmin Association, and the Director of the Puppet North China Xinbao Newspaper, etc. He felt quite embarrassed in his answers. However, he still tried to prove that he was conducive to the War of Resistance by citing the assassination on New Year's Day in the 28th year, the debate on the "Problem of Chinese Central Thought," and the feelings of North China after the victory that he had lost his home as the president of the university. The court instructed that the evidence must be accurate and powerful, and he was given a three-week extension to collect it before the public trial. Zhou Zuoren was escorted back to prison in a fluster with sweat all over his body.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Wang Yunqing, the former ambassador of the Puppet Manchukuo to Japan, was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment by the High Court of the capital today, with 10 years of deprivation of civil rights, and his property will be confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for his family.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 19th] Sun Shiqing, who served as the Director of the Education Bureau of Beijing during the enemy's occupation, was sentenced by the Hebei High Court to 10 years of imprisonment, with 6 years of deprivation of civil rights, and his property was confiscated.

### The Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference Opens in Hangzhou Today; The Provincial Government Held a Pre-Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Proposals

[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 19th] Zhang Mengqi, the newly appointed Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department, arrived in Hangzhou by express train on the morning of the 19th. After getting off the train, he went to the Provincial Party Department to rest. It is heard that Zhang will participate in the Provincial Administrative Conference on the 20th.

This newspaper believes that the Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference is of great significance, so the Hangzhou office will host all the attendees at the British Dahua Restaurant on Yanling Road in Hangzhou at noon on the 20th, and will not invite the press in Hangzhou to attend.

[Another Telegram] Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Shen has repeatedly convened the heads of various departments and bureaus for secret discussions and research on proposals for half a month in order to convene the Provincial Administrative Conference. Currently, the central proposals of the conference have been held twice in the review meeting and four times in the discussion meeting.

Editorial

### Two Inexplicable Things

Perhaps because the weather is hot, people are psychologically irritable. In addition, many things at home and abroad are often unexpected. Therefore, the news reported in the past few days often makes ordinary people incomprehensible. Let's take two things to prove my point. But we still hope that everyone can calm down, restore their senses, and not let their emotions run wild and their minds be frightened, which will only make national affairs worse.

First, what we find most strange is that Mr. Zhou Enlai openly stated in his speech to reporters in Shanghai the day before yesterday that Mr. Chen Lifu's mission to Shanghai was to "strengthen secret agents and arrange new political assassinations." He even falsely accused that "the names of many democratic people are already on the black list, and their lives are already in Mr. Chen's hands, so the Kunming incident can happen at any time in Beijing, Shanghai and other places." This kind of statement from the mouth of the leader of the Communist Party is not only a faux pas, but simply violates criminal law. Announcing this publicly to 60 or 70 Chinese and foreign reporters, no wonder Mr. Chen wants to send a letter to question Mr. Zhou and ask him to bear the legal responsibility for insults and defamation. But why is Mr. Zhou's emotions so agitated? Thinking about it, it is incomprehensible. Some people believe that from the recent secret documents of the Chinese Communist Party, it can be seen that they are arranging to create massacres in various places. Is Mr. Zhou saying these words because they themselves want to do it, sacrifice a few "democratic people" who have already been used, and then use them as an excuse to attack the government? According to the Chinese Communist Party's doctrine that "everyone is a tool and everything is a process," and the Chinese Communist Party's past practice of shouting that others are going to attack before they do, it may be possible to infer that this is the case. But judging from human nature, we are still unwilling to believe it and dare not believe it. Because if the Chinese Communist Party really does this, everyone will only provide them with tools. Who else would be willing to be friends with them in good faith? Therefore, after hearing Zhou Enlai's emotionally激越 (stirring) speech, we still don't understand what he really meant.

Second, what we also find strange is the rash action of LaGuardia, the director of the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (UNRRA), to suspend the transportation of materials to China. UNRRA is an organization jointly organized by various countries, and China is a major participating country. Everyone knows that China's eight years of resistance against Japan is in dire need of relief. Why did UNRRA lightly believe the false reports of some people in the China Branch and take such a reckless action? What is especially ridiculous is that LaGuardia himself has not even figured out the names, positions, and nationalities of the 225 people who filed the complaint, and suddenly issued this unexpected order based on his personal subjectivity! Recently, we heard a responsible senior official say that UNRRA used to supply many Chinese people with unnecessary materials, and even "fake goods" and "bad goods" were mixed in. We don't understand why UNRRA doesn't conduct a thorough investigation itself first? Moreover, UNRRA ships materials to China ship by ship without consulting China's opinions in advance, nor notifying the Chinese government. When the ship arrives at the port, it still can't produce a manifest. There is actually such a relief agency in the world. How can we blame people for distributing it slowly? As for whether it is necessary for so many foreign friends from the "UNRRA" branch in China to come to China batch by batch, let alone say, they must first take care of their food and lodging before participating in China's political role, colluding with the Chinese Communist Party from the inside and outside, and destroying the unity of China's administrative system. Is this really the original intention of relief? We think about it, think about it, and can't figure out why these foreign friends from "UNRRA" want to do this? LaGuardia said that he didn't like any foreigner, but he was hired by President Song because of his love affair. Could it be that he can make things difficult for the Chinese people who are being relieved because of this bit of spite? What is even more incomprehensible is that the "UNRRA" in China has been so corrupt in the past, the "UNRRA" has insulted China so much, and this part of the foreigners in the "UNRRA branch" has reported so recklessly, but the director of our "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (行總) didn't know anything about it beforehand? If he knew, why didn't he report it to the government and the society? Why didn't he explain the truth to various countries in advance? Why didn't he argue according to reason at the Far East Commission meeting afterwards, but instead agreed with the opinions of the representatives of other countries, thinking that LaGuardia's policy was not entirely wrong? Some people also said that Director Jiang is wholeheartedly dealing with more important matters these days, so no wonder him. If so, what else can we say!

### Correspondences from Various Places

The Huai River Rises and Floods

Affecting the Reconstruction of the Huai River Embankment; Bengbu City Intensifies Flood Prevention

[Our newspaper, Bengbu Correspondence] Anhui Province is now in the major flood season. The clouds and rain are transporting cotton. The water levels of the Huai River upstream and downstream are rising continuously, which has greatly affected the reconstruction of the Huai River embankment undertaken by the Guidance Committee. The section from the Over-the-River Mouth on the left bank of the Huai River to Shaojia Avenue is basically completed, with a total length of 29.8 kilometers. The section from Zhengyangguan to Sanhejian cannot be constructed due to the overflowing river water, and has been temporarily suspended. A part of the Huai River embankment in Fengtai has been forced to stop construction due to the surging floods, but a part is still being processed and rushed to repair. Although the embankment from Huaiyuan to Linhuai has not been fully completed, the built embankment has reached the high level of major floodwaters. It can be used for flood prevention and will not overflow. However, the water level of the Huai River has been rising continuously in recent days. According to the observation report here on the 15th: the Huai River water level in Bengbu was 18.81 meters at 7:00 a.m., 18.82 meters at 1:00 p.m., and 18.825 meters at 7:00 p.m. If it continues to rise, the Huai River embankment may inevitably be submerged. The flood prevention agencies in Bengbu City have intensified prevention.

Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Provisional参议会 (Provisional People's Council) of Fengxian County

The Provisional参议会 (Provisional People's Council) of this county held a meeting of the Standing Committee at 3:00 p.m. on the 16th. The head of the County Land and Food Department was invited to attend. The meeting was chaired by Speaker He to discuss the issue of grain requisition in this year's land tax. Considering that the main agricultural products of this county are cotton and wool (70% cotton and 30% rice), all grain requisition in this county should be based on the standard of 70% cotton and 30% rice to show fairness and relieve the people's difficulties. It was decided that the council would submit a special report to the higher authorities for adoption, and compile statistics on the annual crop yields, grain tax, and rural economic situation of this county for provincial reference.

Soldier of the Songjiang Jinshan Team Executed for Drug Trafficking

He was immediately escorted to the Third District Security Command for interrogation. Later, the prisoner confessed to drug trafficking without denial. He was sentenced to death according to law. At noon on the 18th, the unit took the prisoner to Yanjiatan, Maluqiao to verify his identity and execute him by shooting.

Changshu County Government Thoroughly Investigates Two Cases of Malpractice

The two major malpractice cases of the County Tenant Rent Committee and the Hupu Branch of the Autonomous Tax Department have been thoroughly investigated separately for severe punishment. Yan Shen, the former director of the Tenant Rent Committee, was decided by the Provisional参议会 (Provisional People's Council) to be escorted for handling, and the county magistrate immediately ordered his arrest at the police station. Gu Xia, the director of the Hupu Branch of the Tax Department, abused his power for personal gain and altered tax tickets. After the county government sent personnel to investigate and verify the facts, it ordered an investigation. Magistrate Pan also stated at the morning meeting that malpractices by tax personnel must be punished and will not be tolerated.

Wuxi River Water Has Receded and Rice Prices Have Fallen

In early this month, there were several days of heavy rain in the county, and the river water rose by two feet. Low-lying fields were about to become marshes, and farmers were extremely anxious. The weather was clear with strong winds, and the river water has receded. The danger of low-lying fields has been lifted. On the 17th, the market price of white rice fell. High-quality white japonica rice was 56,000 yuan per stone, japonica rice was 23,500 yuan, and foreign indica rice was 21,000 yuan. The prices of other items such as Du wheat, foreign wheat, warship brand flour, and southern river soybeans also fell.

### Stalin Intensifies Purge of the Military; Reorganization of the Soviet High Command; Wartime Hero Zhukov Demoted

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 19th (Broadcast): The highest Soviet authorities have implemented a military purge. Georgy Zhukov, the commander of the Soviet forces that captured Berlin, has been transferred to a less important military post. Furthermore, other highly prominent military leaders have been dismissed. The purpose of the purge is to eliminate pro-British and American elements. The British side is paying close attention to this.

[United Press, New York, 18th] Stalin has implemented a purge among high-ranking military officers, demoting General Georgy Zhukov, the Soviet Union's number one wartime hero, to a regional commander. While no official announcement has been made regarding the reorganization, it is understood that such a reorganization is already underway. So far, the main casualty known is Zhukov, who was transferred to the post of Commander of Soviet Ground Forces three months ago and also elevated to membership in the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. He is now being transferred to the Odessa Military District. It is rumored that Zhukov is not the only casualty of this reorganization. However, no other changes are yet known. It is rumored that, in essence, this military purge is already underway, although not as severe as the 1937 purge, when high-ranking Red Army officers were all dismissed and accused of collaborating with Trotsky and other political enemies, and subjected to the death penalty. Zhukov's demotion does not seem to be due to differences in political views, but rather suspicion of disloyalty to the country. While serving as the Soviet representative to the Allied Control Council in Berlin, he became a friend of Eisenhower. The successor to the post of Commander of Soviet Ground Forces has not yet been announced. He remains a member of the Politburo, the highest organ of the Soviet Communist Party. The Odessa Military District is in charge of southern Russia and the Balkan border area. Before the war, Odessa was an important military district in western Russia. The Red Army newspaper "Red Star" recently launched a major propaganda campaign to rectify Red Army discipline, with particular emphasis on the security of the Soviet Union.

### Under the European "Iron Curtain"; Britain Pursues Dual Diplomacy; On One Hand, Considers Granting the Soviets Huge Loans to Restore Trade; On the Other Hand, Agrees with the US to Unify the German Economy

[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] Whether the European "Iron Curtain" can be lifted, or whether it will deepen further, will be known within a few days. Well-informed sources have recently said that the British government is holding talks with the Soviet Union in London, while also conducting negotiations with the United States in Berlin, hoping to improve the current situation. Britain now has two paths to follow: one is to strive to establish a closer relationship with the Soviet Union, and the other is to stand in opposition to the Soviet Union and divide Germany in two, thereby dividing Europe and even the entire world. Regarding this matter, the British Minister of Commerce, Cripps, is currently in London negotiating with the Soviet representative, Kransov, preparing to establish a commercial agreement as a basis for clarifying the general relationship between the two sides. In addition, British representatives are also in Berlin holding talks with the US side, hoping to prepare for the economic unification of Germany in the British, American, and French occupation zones. If the Soviet Union does not fully agree, it will be implemented regardless of Soviet objections. The above two talks are taking place in secret, but according to reliable sources, since last year, commercial relations between Britain and the Soviet Union have been interrupted due to the Soviet side's refusal to allow the import of British goods. These goods are worth about 11 million pounds and are ready for shipment. As of the end of April this year, about 140 British manufacturers, including the automobile and textile industries, have suggested to the British Ministry of Commerce and Supply that they plan to restore commerce with the Soviet Union and grant the Soviet Union a 50 million pound credit loan for a term of ten years. The talks currently underway in London are based on this suggestion. However, the Soviet side believes that the value of the various goods is too high and has not agreed to accept them. Fortunately, the Soviet Union has transported a large number of gold bars into Britain, which may serve as a guarantee for the ten-year credit loan. As for the talks being conducted by British and American experts in Berlin, their primary goal is to separate the eastern and western parts of Germany. The main points are: (1) The UK and the US should make full use of all assets in their occupation zones and should not import goods from the Soviet Union; (2) The UK and the US subcommittees should formulate plans for their respective occupation zones to encourage production and determine prices; (3) If the UK and the US are unable to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, they should mutually agree on price levels and use the Mark as an exchange tool; (4) When the talks reach the final stage, France should be invited to participate. To this end, well-informed sources concluded that the talks currently underway in London are quite optimistic and seem to want to establish a reasonable agreement. The talks being conducted in Berlin, on the other hand, could separate Western Europe from Eastern Europe. Their nature is completely different.

### Foreign Minister Wang Departs Tomorrow to Attend the Paris Peace Conference; Ambassador to the UK, Zheng Tianxi, Accompanying Him

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The National Government today specially appointed Foreign Minister Wang Shijie as the head of the delegation of the Republic of China to the Paris Peace Conference.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Wang Shijie, the head of the delegation of the Republic of China to the Paris Peace Conference, and his party are scheduled to depart for abroad on the 21st, accompanied by the newly appointed Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Zheng Tianxi.

[Our Own Dispatch, Nanjing, 19th] Today at 7:20 PM, the reporter met with Foreign Minister Wang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He stated that if there are no problems with the plane, he will leave Nanjing for India by air on the morning of the 21st, and then proceed to Paris to attend the Peace Conference. The length of his stay will be decided after arriving in France. In other news, our delegation to the Peace Conference will be composed of Foreign Minister Wang, Director Wu Nanru, and Ambassadors Qian Tai and Fu Bingchang. In addition, the Ministry will send Secretary Shu Kai of the Secretariat, Ye Yi, and two cipher clerks to accompany them. It is heard that during Foreign Minister Wang's absence, the affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be temporarily handled by Vice Minister Gan Naiguang. As for the position of Director of the European Department, it will be temporarily filled by Counselor Ye Gongchao. Rumors that Director Wu Nanru will be appointed as an envoy to a certain European country are awaiting verification.

The British Representative Lineup

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 19th (Broadcast): The lineup of British representatives to attend the Peace Conference has been decided. In addition to Foreign Secretary Bevin, there are also Alexander and Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, among others.

### Atomic Bomb Test Exercise; Explodes Fifty Minutes Earlier Than Scheduled; Power Equivalent to 400,000 Depth Charges

[Our Own Dispatch] San Francisco, 19th (Broadcast): During the atomic bomb exercise held on Bikini Atoll today, the dummy bomb, a magnesium flash bomb, exploded suddenly fifty-one minutes before the scheduled time. Although the premature explosion and bad weather forced most of the aircraft to return to base, another dummy bomb exploded at the specified time, and the exercise was not disrupted. According to Blandy, the cause of the premature explosion is unknown. According to the explanation of staff officers, it was caused by an error in the electrical circuitry, and it suddenly exploded at 8:14 AM. Blandy said that the premature explosion has little to do with the actual atomic bomb test, because the electrical circuit for initiating the bomb was not adequately protected. He also said that when conducting the real underwater atomic bomb explosion, the accuracy of the explosion time is guaranteed. When the magnesium flash bomb exploded, a violent shock occurred in the air above, and forty-seven aircraft participating in the exercise were forced to retreat, leaving only nine to observe the weather.

[Special Dispatch from Central News Agency Reporter Song Dehe aboard the USS Appalachian en route to Bikini, 18th] The second atomic bomb test at Bikini, as far as the reporter is concerned, will be more spectacular and more dramatic than the one held on July 1st. According to the current plan, when the atomic bomb is tested on the 25th of this month, the reporter will be able to observe it from a closer location. This explosion is expected to inflict greater damage on the target ships. US Navy officials today told reporters that this second atomic bomb test will be an underwater explosion. It is estimated that its impact on the ships will be four times stronger than the previous air explosion. According to their rough estimate, the atomic bomb exploded on that day will be equivalent to 400,000 depth charges. It is understood that the test bomb will be placed between 18 feet below the surface of the water and the bottom of the lagoon (about 120 feet). This fifth atomic bomb placed underwater will be like an underwater-controlled mine.

[United Press dispatch from the USS Appalachian, the viewing ship for the atomic bomb test, 18th] On the 25th of this month, its mechanism is based on the speed of sound. This speed is about every five seconds in the air; but in the lagoon it is about two miles per second. Vibrations in the water and lagoon travel at the same extraordinary speed as the explosion. The bomb's entire atomic energy enters the water, and just as an aerial explosion dissipates into the air, the Bikini coral reef may suffer a catastrophe. But not all of the atomic energy enters the Bikini water. The exact proportion is a military secret and a point of contention among scientists. These vibrations are expected to touch the bottom of the Bikini coral reef.

The Soviets Send More Personnel to Observe the Test

[United Press reporter's special dispatch from a ship en route to Bikini] In addition to the two scientists previously designated, the Soviet Union has added one more person, Lieutenant Commander Kokarov, as a "news representative" to observe the underwater explosion test of the atomic bomb at Bikini. With the exception of the United Kingdom, all other invited countries have sent two people. China has also sent two scientists to participate.

### US Personnel to Attend the United Nations General Assembly

[United States Information Service, Washington, 18th] President Truman today announced the list of US representatives to attend the next session of the United Nations General Assembly at a press conference. Senator Austin will be the senior US representative at the meeting. Other US representatives are Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Republican Senator Vandenberg, and Representative Bloom, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Mrs. Roosevelt. The President also appointed the following rotating representatives: Republican Representative Eaton, Democratic Representative Douglas, foreign policy advisor Dulles of the 1944 Republican presidential candidate, and Stevenson, who attended the Allied Committee in London in 1945 on behalf of Stettinius.

Advance Arrangements

[Reuters, New York, 17th] The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to be held here on September 23. In addition to the delegations from various countries and their entourage, hundreds of journalists will also attend to cover the event, and the crowded situation is already expected. Mr. Barnes, the Director of the News Department of the United Nations, has specifically notified reporters from various countries to contact him before July 1 to arrange the necessary conveniences on their behalf.

On the fourth of this month, the Philippines held its independence ceremony. The picture above shows President Roxas being sworn in, and the picture below shows the crowded situation of the audience during the flag-raising ceremony. (Photos by the United States Information Service)

### International Trusteeship of Trieste; Italy Expresses Opposition; Labor Unrest Increasingly Serious

[United Press, Rome, 18th] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi declared today that Italy had lost 600,000 people in defending Trieste during World War II. If the port is placed under international trusteeship according to the decision of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the new Italian Republic will collapse. Italy hopes that the future Paris Peace Conference will reject the international trusteeship plan.

[United Press, Rome, 18th] The nationwide labor unrest in Italy continued to spread today. The Prime Minister believes that the development of the petroleum workers' strike has become a national emergency and has ordered the military and police to stop it. At the same time, the general strike in Turin began yesterday and has spread to public utilities.

### Soviets Interfere in Hungary's Internal Affairs; Britain Issues Protest

[United Press, London, 18th] The Foreign Office announced today that Britain has protested to the Soviet Union over its excessive interference in Hungary's internal affairs. According to a Foreign Office spokesman, the Soviet Union has requested the Hungarian government to dismiss the Deputy Minister of Justice and to cancel the privileges of three anti-Soviet parliamentarians. The British government believes this is inappropriate and has issued a protest.

### Soviets Confiscate Austrian Property; British and American Protests Rejected

[United Press, London, 18th] The Soviet Union has confiscated Austrian property as reparations, and the United Kingdom and the United States have protested, but the Soviet Union has rejected them. According to well-informed sources, the Soviet occupation authorities have made it clear that Soviet policy will not change regarding the receipt of 22 million worth of Austrian industrial equipment and other property confiscated by Germany after 1938.

### US Army Department Strictly Prevents Communist Spies

Secret Weapons Manufacturing Plant; Suspects Fired

[United Press, Washington, 18th] The Army Department announced today that five union leaders, some of whom are physicists and chemists, have been fired from the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland for national security reasons. This move proves that rocket missiles and other new weapons are being manufactured at the plant. According to the department's news office, one of the five employees is a woman and has been fired. This is still in accordance with the Army National Defense Regulations. Of the approximately two million employees hired by the Army during the war, only dozens have been fired for violating these regulations.

### Cripps Reports on His Mission to India in the British House of Commons; He Met with Representatives of Various Indian Factions with Sincerity; Helping Them Narrow Their Differences and Complete the Constitution as Soon as Possible

[Reuters, London, 18th] Cripps, one of the British cabinet representatives to India, recently stated in the House of Commons that the situation of this cabinet delegation to India was very different from when he was ordered to go to India in 1942. He said that the whole world is now politically aware, and so are the people of India. The House of Commons should know that the situation in the spring of 1946 is very different from that in 1942 or 1939. India is now deeply politically aware after the war, and the pressure that could be applied before the war is no longer appropriate. The steadfastness of delegation leader Lawrence in handling negotiations in India is commendable and has led to the current outcome. Some people criticize our talks as a waste of time, but in fact, this is very valuable to our mission. Contacting the various factions of 400 million Indians is very helpful in determining the direction of negotiations. We are not overly optimistic about the agreement reached at the round table conference held by the delegation with the Muslim League and the Congress Party in Simla. In Simla, we failed to bring them closer, and the meeting ended after two weeks. We returned to New Delhi and announced our views. We did indeed make every effort in Simla to generate a plan suitable for negotiation, so that we were able to issue a statement on May 16 after returning to New Delhi. Although we failed to announce a plan to prove our identity as the Indians had hoped, the purpose of our trip was not to implement a plan on India, but to help the Indians reach an agreement among themselves. We do not want to interfere in the organization of India's future constitution, but want to invite representatives of various factions in India to organize a constitutional assembly to discuss major plans together, because this is entirely a matter for the Indians themselves. Therefore, our basic policy is only to make suggestions to enable Indians to reach an agreement themselves and organize a constitutional assembly. That is why. This suggestion has been highly praised by all parties. Before we left India, representatives of all parties expressed their desire to promote the work of the constitutional assembly and provided suggestions on how to make it work, but it must be based on the conditions of the May 16 statement in order not to harm the interests of other relevant parties.

### US Loans to the Soviet Union

Truman Says Not Being Considered

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] President Truman said at a press conference today that the government will not ask Congress to allocate funds for loans to foreign countries. When Congress meets next time, the case of increasing the capital of the Export-Import Bank by 1.25 billion will be automatically brought up for discussion, but I approve the Treasury Department's allocation of 100 million to the Philippines to help the country start rebuilding commerce. When asked about the possibility of the US granting loans to the Soviet Union, the President replied that, to my knowledge, any plans for such loans have not been considered.

### Daladier Discusses Wartime Behind-the-Scenes Politics in the French Constituent Assembly; Communists Object to Daladier's Qualification as a Deputy

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 18th] After French former Prime Minister Daladier was elected as a deputy to the Constituent Assembly, the Communist Party raised an objection, saying that his election should be invalid. Daladier immediately replied at length, involving many contradictions in the Communist Party and the use of French foreign policy at that time. He said, "Some say that I am a Munich traitor who offered France to Hitler. In fact, France was ready to help Czechoslovakia in April 1938. At that time, the Soviet Union was not trusted by Czechoslovakia, and British Prime Minister Chamberlain and the government took a reserved attitude and did not believe that Hitler had any malice towards Czechoslovakia, which was contrary to what France saw. Without large-scale aid from Britain, France was unable to fight Germany. After the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union were openly negotiating, the Soviet Union secretly negotiated with Germany and established a non-aggression pact. According to the leader of the Socialist Party, Blum, this move by the Soviet Union was decided in April 1938.

### Gospel for the Disabled; The US Creates Hydraulic Leg

[United States Information Service, Washington, 18th] Two recent "compensations" have arrived in the United States from Germany. These compensations will greatly benefit those disabled during the war. One is a suction belt. With this belt, the disabled person does not need to wear a medical belt. The other is a hydraulic leg, which can be used to install an artificial knee that is close to normal. Artificial limb artists are now testing the best way to produce and use this suction belt. The hydraulic leg should be installed before production. The National Research Council is currently stepping up testing and research on this only hydraulic leg prototype in the United States.

### Crossing the Illinois Prairie: A Visit to President Lincoln's Hometown - Scenes Remain Unchanged, as if Stepping Back a Century

— Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing (Concluded)

Hall, Lincoln's predecessor as postmaster, came from New Jersey. After resigning from the post office, he built a "two-story" wooden house and set up a small store selling various groceries. It is said that Hall was a rather "important" figure in New Salem Village at the time. After Lincoln resigned as postmaster, he followed Hall's path and opened a "Lincoln Grocery Store." The Lincoln Grocery Store was built under a large locust tree and was the last of the dozen or so humble houses in the village to be built. In front of the door was a dirt road, and presumably muddy and slippery on rainy days, Lincoln paved a few scattered stones, but the stones were very smooth. I worry that Lincoln must have fallen on rainy days.

The Lincoln Grocery Store contains various simple daily necessities from the United States a hundred years ago, as well as woodwork made by Lincoln himself. Opposite the grocery store is Lincoln's home. Lincoln married and had children in the village in 1842, which can be seen in Lincoln's letters. One of Lincoln's children died young in that village. In Lincoln's so-called "home," there is a "grandfather clock," a kitchen, and a very simple fireplace for heating in winter. There are also several double-decker beds, which every family in the village has. The tour guide said: Parents sleep on the upper bunk, and babies sleep on the lower bunk. There were two doctors in the village, and the doctor's house was slightly more "spacious." Later, after Lincoln was elected president, the doctor moved away from the village. The United States is a very young country, but the people of the young country also "yearn for the past." Their enthusiasm for yearning for the past is admirable, and they want to maintain the "realism" of the objects, which is rare in other countries. Only one house in the entire village is modern, and that is the Lincoln Memorial Museum. The museum displays letters that Lincoln sent to his family elders, written from the White House after Lincoln was elected president. The letters contain many words of nostalgia for that small village. In addition, there are weapons used by the assassin who murdered President Lincoln, and digging tools and hammers used by traitors who later attempted to steal Lincoln's body. Also on display is the piano used by Lincoln at his wedding, as well as books with Lincoln's handwritten annotations. Lincoln lived in New Salem Village for six years before moving to Springfield. That was after Lincoln's marriage. There is a so-called Lincoln Home in Springfield, which is the second noteworthy place I want to talk about. It is a modern Western-style house, not far from the current Illinois State Capitol. It is now managed by the state government as a park, surrounded by white walls. Lincoln's house is on a street corner, bordering roads on both sides. The house has two floors, and there is a very small garden in the back. The house is white, and the window sills are green. There are five rooms inside. The upstairs is not open to the public. There is a government administrator downstairs. Visitors must write down their names and resumes before entering. The first room is a parlor, with an old sofa. The administrator said: That was Mrs. Lincoln's sitting room. Although old, it is incomparable to the humble farmhouses in New Salem Village. In Lincoln's study, there is a Mobil kerosene lamp, oil paintings and vases, an old-fashioned fireplace, a child's seat, and the silk that Lincoln once used. Lincoln lived in this house for seventeen years (1844-1861), so it is called "Lincoln's Home." On the door of the house, there are two bronze plaques. One says "Lincoln's Home," and the other contains a poem by Vachel Lindsay, describing Lincoln's tall, thin figure, how he entered and exited this house, and describing a large group of children playing in front of the door. This poem is very famous in the United States, excerpted from Lindsay's "Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight." The Illinois government has grand notices in New Salem Village and the "Lincoln's Home" in the city, preserving the antique charm, and inserting large American flags. The number of stars on the flag is different, representing how many states the United States had at that time. After seeing the Lincoln Home, it seems like we have returned to after 1861. Lincoln was elected president, and the North-South war broke out to liberate black slaves. After four years of fighting, Lincoln succeeded and died. Lincoln was assassinated by rebel forces in 1865 and transported back to Springfield for burial. Lincoln's physical body died, but Lincoln's spirit lives on forever! No one does not admire Lincoln's greatness, especially after you visit Lincoln's tomb. The tomb's architecture is very simple and solemn, all made of granite. The burial chamber is under the granite. Visitors can enter after signing their names. On the walls of the burial chamber are Lincoln's writings, proclamations, and the most famous Gettysburg Address of November 19, 1863. In the center of the burial chamber is Lincoln's coffin, on which is written "Now he belongs to the ages." On the stone wall in front of the burial chamber are engraved the names of Lincoln's family and their dates of birth and death. The cemetery is near the suburbs of Springfield. From afar, you can see large lawns, green shade, and the tall granite tomb tower. The names of the forty-eight states are engraved around the tomb tower, and bronze statues are installed at the four corners, all in the uniforms of soldiers from the North-South War era; infantry, artillery, and other unnamed martyrs, these people followed President Lincoln and laid the national foundation for the United States. A large bronze statue of President Lincoln stands in front of the tomb. Every day, many American men and women come from all directions to pay their respects to Lincoln, the most outstanding figure of their history. The Lincoln Cemetery is also a public cemetery. All around are filled tombs, which are the American people who have died. Lincoln's impression on the American people is profound. Without Lincoln, the unification of the United States would not have been established so completely; without Lincoln, the industrialization of the United States might have been delayed for decades. The Civil War was not Lincoln's goal. Lincoln's contribution to the United States was a strong unified state, and accelerated industrialization. These two magic weapons were precisely the important factors that the United States later used to defeat Spain, defeat Germany twice, and defeat Japan once. Lincoln laid an unshakeable foundation for the United States' current position as a world leader. Who says President Lincoln has died? Lincoln is living forever! (Sent from Jacksonville, Illinois)

### He DeKui Responds to the Case of Senator Wu Yifang's Accusation: Asks Himself if His Actions Are Upright and Open, Regarding His Relationship with the Enemy and Puppets

[Report from this newspaper] When the Standing Committee of the National Senate of Nanjing held its regular meeting yesterday morning, Standing Committee Member Ms. Wu Yifang (President of Jinling Women's University) accused He DeKui, the current Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, of being a suspected traitor, and said that she had photos as evidence. All sectors of the city were shocked upon hearing the news. At 5 p.m. yesterday, reporters from various newspapers went to the municipal government to interview Secretary-General He DeKui. At that time, He had just returned from the review meeting of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. He immediately received the reporters in the conference room of the municipal government. He, wearing a white summer cloth long shirt and holding a black paper fan, was very calm. He smiled and told the reporters: Regarding the transmission of this unexpected news, I would like to state three facts: (1) After the Pearl Harbor Incident on December 8, 1941, the British and American General Manager, directors, director-general, head of the finance department, and staff of all ranks of the Shanghai Municipal Council continued to serve in the Municipal Council in accordance with the intentions of the US authorities. Therefore, I should also continue to serve. (2) I served in the Municipal Council with the British and Americans. The Japanese enemy did not appoint the retained British and Americans, nor did they appoint DeKui and others, because the Municipal Council was an international organization. (3) Later, rumors spread that the puppet regime in Nanjing was going to take over the Shanghai Municipal Council. I immediately resigned. Therefore, when the traitor Chen Gongbo came to take over, I had already left. At that time, the enemy and puppets tried their best to win me over, but I refused them all. Therefore, my actions were upright and open. I would also like to state that I have never belonged to any party or faction. During the Shanghai Municipal Council era, on June 1, 1932, I was recommended by the Chinese directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council to serve as a co-manager. After six years, I was promoted to deputy director-general, also for nearly six years. During the period of the city's occupation, I only served as a consultant to Chinese commercial and industrial circles, such as banks and spinning mills, to earn a living. After the restoration, I served as the chairman of the Committee for the United Allied Forces Reception of Compatriots in Concentration Camps of the Three People's Principles Youth League, as well as a member of the Shanghai Municipal Real Estate Management Committee, deputy director of the Housing Rental Management Committee, and deputy mayor of Shanghai. Later, the deputy mayor system was abolished, so I was renamed Secretary-General. For more than ten years, I have been dedicated to my duty, law-abiding, and clean, without any hypocrisy. However, I may occasionally offend people due to official duties, but all of them are for the public good, without any personal prejudice.

He then told the reporters about the joke made by the square weekly "Jeep," saying that a few months ago, "Jeep" published a news item that "Deputy Mayor He tried his best to protect Ding Jiwan." For a while, rumors abounded, and some people even reported to Chairman Chiang, the Executive Yuan, and the Control Yuan. In fact, there was no basis at all, and the publication immediately published a correction in the next issue after the incident. The unfounded rumors also broke down on their own. Therefore, he said that he did not take the news of being accused of being a suspected traitor very seriously, and said that it could be verified by the facts.

He also said: He and Wu Yifang were not familiar with each other. Before August 13, they met once on a ship, and he had a very good impression of her, and he believed that Wu Yifang would not have any ill feelings towards him. This accusation was probably instigated by others. As for the report that there were photos as evidence, he had no idea and could not guess. During the occupation period, he maintained contact with the central government all along. Yu Bingjian, the current director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, knew very well about the patriotic work he did. Moreover, he had never left Shanghai for more than ten years. His every move was known to Chinese and foreigners in Shanghai, so there was no need to repeat them.

According to reports, He is from Jinhua, Zhejiang Province. He studied at Peking University and was at the top of his class. In 1917, he was sent to the United States for further study, ranking first in the Ministry of Education's examination. In 1919, he obtained a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin, and in 1921, he obtained a master's degree in business administration from Harvard University. After returning to China, he served as a professor at Shanghai Datong University and Nanyang University, director of the business department of Guanghua University, and English secretary of the Economic Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association. He studied the Shanghai Municipal Council for many years. Therefore, the board of directors of the Municipal Council decided to unanimously approve his appointment as co-manager. He's involvement in commercial and industrial circles began after the occupation. During that time, he once assisted the Xinwen Bao newspaper in handling student loans for the poor. Later, he heard that the traitor Chen Riping was going to join the Xinwen Bao, so he immediately resigned.

### Zhang Zhiben Talks About Investigation and Reception Work: Welcomes the People's Secret Reports but Requires Listing Facts - Those Who Violate the Law and Neglect Their Duties Will Be Dealt with Impartially

Zhang Zhiben, the head of the Investigation Team for the Reception Work in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the morning of the 18th. Yesterday, he received reporters from the Central News Agency at his private residence and said: This team is composed of the Central Supervisory Committee, the Control Yuan, and the National Senate. In order to facilitate the investigation work, it is now divided into three groups: Shanghai-Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Anhui. The Beijing-Shanghai group is responsible for me and Cheng Zhongxing, Fan Zhengbo, Wu Wangji, and Secretary Xu Longchuan. Cheng and Fan are both in Shanghai. Wu and Xu will also come here in a few days and can start work. The location of the team's office has been temporarily decided to be at the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office. The working period is set at fifty days. The Shanghai reception work began in August of last year. It has been a year in the blink of an eye. To investigate the reception work of one year in fifty days, the time is very tight. In addition, the enemy and puppet property reception work in the Shanghai area is the most complicated. Therefore, we must take the most economical and effective steps to actively handle it. We hope that the city's party and government agencies, mass organizations, and the press will contact this team to assist in the investigation and provide specific materials for this team to refer to. At the same time, this team hopes to have not only a "radio receiver" but also a "radio transmitter" so that it can publicize the materials to the people of the country at any time after the investigation work begins. This point really depends on the assistance of the press. When reporters asked Zhang whether he accepted the people's "secret reports," he said: "Secret reports" are naturally very good, but the "secret reporters" need to have a responsible spirit. It is said that in the past, the city set up secret report boxes. Among the "secret report" letters received, there were actually names such as "People from the Southeast, Northwest, East, and West" and "A Member of the Nation," and the content of the secret reports often attacked individuals and could not provide correct evidence, which would inevitably lose the meaning of "secret reports." In the future, if there are secret report letters that list the facts and are responsibly signed, this team will welcome them very much.

Talking about the past reception of enemy and puppet property in Shanghai, Zhang said, "I have indeed heard some rumors, and there are many accusations about 'receiving materials' and 'losing people's hearts.' It is also said that there are some edible and usable materials in the warehouse that are being watched to rot without being processed. They only know how to 'receive materials' but do not know how to 'use materials.' All of these are manifestations of dereliction of duty. This team will thoroughly investigate them. If there are situations of abusing power, violating the law, neglecting duties, or being negligent in handling, as long as there is correct proof, this team will deal with them impartially, just like a judge trying a case. If the plaintiff submits evidence, the judge can make a judgment based on the articles of law, without any difficulty."

Regarding how to eliminate corruption, Zhang said: "Corruption is naturally a bad phenomenon, but on the one hand, we shout loudly that 'civil servants cannot live,' and on the other hand, we say that 'civil servants are corrupt,' which is somewhat contradictory. I think that corrupt people are ultimately a minority. We cannot universally apply this kind of 'shameful name' to civil servants, so that those who cherish their own reputation will also have a sense of black and white being difficult to distinguish, leading to a general psychology of 'good people do not become civil servants' and 'civil servants must be corrupt.' It must be known that the country has its own laws to punish those who are truly corrupt and neglect their duties. Just submit the evidence, and the government will punish them immediately. We should not make general accusations, which will only cause suspicion among foreign friends. We must correct this kind of concept. As for the improvement of the treatment of civil servants, it is also an urgent task at hand."

### Mobilizing Northern Jiangsu Refugees to Clear Accumulated Garbage

[Report from this newspaper] Since the Health Bureau started the second expanded epidemic prevention campaign on the 18th, according to statistics, more than 1.53 million people have been vaccinated. The Epidemic Prevention Committee, in view of the fact that there are many cholera patients in the Pudong area and it is difficult to provide relief, is now accommodating and treating them at the Municipal Third Hospital on Dongchang Road, which has 30 beds. In the Xujiahui area, factories and shops voluntarily donated materials to set up the Xuhui Temporary Epidemic Hospital, which has 25 beds and is completely free of charge. The Epidemic Prevention Committee, in order to promote environmental hygiene and hope to directly reduce the epidemic, has set up a cleaning zone system, clearing accumulated garbage in phases, and using 150 northern Jiangsu refugees and more than 300 vagrants from the Caohejing Work-Study Institute. They gathered at 3:00 a.m. yesterday morning and set off with the original cleaning team, and formulated a citizen's cleaning agreement, asking various districts and guarantees to persuade citizens to pay attention to it together.

Yesterday, 61 people were infected with cholera and 3 died. Including the previous cases, there are a total of 2,361 people infected and 170 deaths.

Shanghai Epidemic Hospital Broadcasts to Raise Funds

At this time of rampant epidemics, the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital has exhausted the 20 million yuan it previously raised. The hospital's directors Liu Hongsheng and Zhu Zikui and others have initiated a broadcast fundraising preparation committee, and invited reporters to the Lake Society. Wang Xiaolai, Deng Qingshan, Dou Yaoting, Huang Zhensheng, Wang Yunkang, Bao Xiaodie, Tang Baoqi, and committee members Gong Zhaoxiong, Lu Jiying, Xu Jingyong, Zhou Yixing, Yan Xiaofang, Lu Jinrong, and others attended. According to Dou Yaoting, the hospital has been in operation for 29 years, with a long history, and has always taken serving society and helping the poor and sick as its mission. During the epidemic season of summer and autumn every year, it suspends the diagnosis of ordinary diseases and specializes in treating cholera, dysentery, and other epidemic diseases, day and night, regardless of the poor or the rich, providing diagnosis and medicine free of charge. For poor patients who need to be hospitalized for medical treatment, the required medicine and meals are also free of charge, and the number of free beds is expanded as much as possible to accommodate the poor and sick. In addition to the special, first-class, and second-class wards that charge fees, 100 third-class beds and outpatient medicine are completely free. Now, the cost of medicine is high, and all expenses require 3 million yuan per day. In order to raise funds to provide relief, from the 25th and 26th of this month, they will perform Peking Opera on the Jiancheng Radio Station (call sign XGSH, frequency 840) from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., and on the 27th, they will broadcast comic Shanghai Opera and Yue Opera on the Minsheng Radio Station (call sign XPOC, frequency 1040), and on the 28th, they will broadcast on the Jianshe Radio Station (call sign XACS, frequency 940) from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will be generous in donating money to benefit the patients, so that not only can the epidemic be curbed, but society can also avoid the danger of spreading. It was submitted to the joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for discussion and approval, and then submitted to the Standing Committee, the Supreme National Defense Conference of the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the two financial and economic departments for adoption and implementation.

Treat the Symptoms Urgently, Do Not Pursue Lofty Goals

According to convener Luo Qinghua, the six-person group summarized opinions from all parties and focused on the current economic crisis. Based on the principle of treating the symptoms urgently, they made practical arguments without pursuing lofty goals. As for the basic economic plan, the economic policies of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are the most noble and progressive guidelines of the near century, and Chairman Chiang's book "The Destiny of China" has extremely detailed enlightenment. It is heard that the Supreme National Defense Conference and the Central Design Bureau have also formulated various specific plans such as China's five-year industrialization plan, and the plans are already very beautiful. We only need to wait for the government departments in charge to earnestly follow and implement them, without further discussion. This time, the committee's research on emergency rescue plans was very cautious. The colleagues all deeply understand the government's current difficult situation and dare not make excessive demands or extravagant hopes. Therefore, the content of the plan is humble and without lofty arguments. All the points mentioned are what the government can and should do. They all believe that the prerequisite problem is that the government's current financial policy must be re-recognized, and the entire economic policy and financial measures must be thoroughly reformed with the greatest determination. All sectors of agriculture, industry, and commerce must unanimously support the policies, try to overcome the difficulties, and rebuild the economic foundation.

The Last Moment, Rise Up Together

The current moment is the most critical period, but it is also the last opportunity. It is hoped that the government and the people will rise up together, seize this last opportunity, and not procrastinate or delay. Otherwise, the opportunity will be fleeting. Once the economy collapses, the country and the nation will be doomed, and no one under the overturned nest will be spared.

### Korean People Traffic Drugs: A Den Cracked in Hongkou

[Report from this newspaper] On the 17th, at noon, Zhu Changhua, police officer No. 1662 of the Hongkou Police Bureau, was patrolling through the shantytowns in Shunxing Lane, Qiujiang Road, when he discovered Xu Jinwen and Tan Bingrong smoking morphine. He also found five small bags of morphine in Xu's pocket, so he took them to the bureau for interrogation. According to their confession, the drugs were purchased from Koreans Wu Quan and Zheng Yizhe, whose location was in Room 32, Taifu Lane, Qiujiang Branch Road. The section member Jiang Tianfu, led by police chief Xu Daren, police officers Li Chunhe, Zhu Changhua, and Yang Weiguang, went to the address. They found a bag of morphine weighing about five maces and two scales in the quilt. Wu and Zheng were arrested on the spot. After questioning, they initially denied it, but after several hours of preliminary interrogation, they finally told the truth. They confessed that there was also a large trafficker, Korean Hong Qishan, living in the pavilion room at No. 12, Lane 173, Qiujiang Road. The original handler rushed to break in at midnight. At that time, Hong was out and his wife was home. He was allowed to search the room, and as a result, 38 small bags of morphine, a large bag weighing five maces, a bag of white powder, a bag of lime, and a bag of fragrant powder were found in a small closet. They were all taken to the bureau for filing. The fugitive Hong Qishan is still being hunted down.

### Our New Fleet Returns: Sails for Nanjing from Shanghai This Morning; Moored at Wusongkou Yesterday to Load Supplies

[Report from Our Newspaper] The eight warships gifted to us by the United States, carrying several hundred Chinese naval officers and soldiers who received training in the U.S., arrived at Wusongkou at dawn yesterday. Reporters and others rushed to the Coastal Defense Command Post of the Taiwan Garrison at Wusongkou at dawn. Together with Director Guo, Staff Officer Tang, Battalion Commander Qiu, and others, they boarded a small motorboat to welcome the Chinese naval officers and soldiers who had returned triumphantly after completing their studies, as well as the new-style warships gifted to us by our friendly nation (two new escort destroyers, four mine-laying and mine-sweeping ships, and two anti-submarine ships). The reporters and others boarded two boats separately, skimming across the vast expanse of sea and sky, and circled around the eight warships for inspection. The young men on board waved and cheered, also using signal lamps to greet the welcomers. They gazed at Shanghai, which they had been away from for nearly nine years, filled with boundless joy. Subsequently, naval officers stationed in Shanghai boarded the Taikang warship, and the reporters followed suit, but were immediately refused entry. It was said that this was an order from the local naval office. The reporters requested to stay a little longer for an exterior inspection, but were sternly refused, and had no choice but to disembark.

Soldiers Aboard Eager to Read Shanghai Newspapers

At this time, the returning soldiers on board still expressed their passionate enthusiasm, eagerly reading the newspapers that the reporters brought aboard. They said, "It's been a long time since we've read newspapers from our homeland." Xu Heng, a famous swimmer, is currently the captain of the Yongning warship. He disembarked yesterday to talk with reporters. Mr. Xu's spirit remains strong, and he is extremely interested in rebuilding our nation's new navy. He earnestly hopes that the domestic press will do more to promote the understanding and interest of the Chinese people in the navy. He told the reporter: "After our training in Malta, we were originally prepared to participate in the War of Resistance, but the war ended earlier than expected, causing us to miss the opportunity. However, upon our return this time, we swept a mine in Tokyo Bay and the Pacific Ocean, as a token of our desire. After leaving the United States last August, we went to the U.S. naval base in Cuba (Guantanamo) for sea trials and exercises. The famous Missouri and Roosevelt warships often participated in the exercises together. We stayed there for a total of three months. Until October 6th of last year, we again visited overseas Chinese in San Diego on the west coast of the United States. Their enthusiasm truly made us feel ashamed! Later, we also visited the local situations in Zhanba and Mexico City, and were inspected by their authorities. Then we went back to the west coast of the United States to repair the ships, and then transferred to Pearl Harbor to load supplies, passing through Honolulu, Midway Island, and other places before heading to Japan. We stayed in Yokosuka for three days before returning to Shanghai."

The eight warships were lined up in a straight line outside Wusongkou. When the reporters were inspecting them, the warships slowly advanced, with a gentle breeze and slight waves, stretching out endlessly. Lieutenant Colonel Lin Yun also accepted the reporter's photography on the warship. It is reported that Mr. Lin will lead the fleet to Nanjing at 4:00 AM this morning, and will return to Shanghai around the 24th.

Loading Supplies: Sumptuous Menu

The eight warships passed through Shanghai this time to follow orders and load supplies. Reporters learned the statistical figures of the supplies as follows: 3,000 catties of beef, 3,000 catties of pork, 5,000 catties of white rice, 550 eggs, 3,000 catties of bananas, 5,000 oranges, 3,000 lemons, 3,000 catties of watermelons, 5,000 catties of cabbage, 2,000 onions, 2,000 catties of tomatoes, 5,000 catties of potatoes, 5,000 catties of beans, 400 fish, 1,000 catties of green onions, and 3,000 catties of cucumbers. These supplies are prepared for use during their stay in Nanjing. It is said that during their training in the United States, all supplies were the same as those of the U.S. military. As for living allowances, the soldiers received about 30 to 60 U.S. dollars per month. Future treatments have not been fully determined.

As for the number of officers on each warship, there are approximately eight officers and one hundred soldiers. They are all energetic and physically strong and will be the new force of the Chinese navy!

[Report from Nanjing on the 19th] When our new fleet comes to Nanjing, Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng will personally preside over the inspection ceremony.

### Rules for Managing Restaurants in This City Revised and Passed; Penalties for Tax Evasion and Banquet Levies Re-Established

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the Municipal Council revised and passed 23 articles of the rules for managing restaurants in this city. The main points are as follows: (1) The scope of management includes hotels, Western restaurants, tea houses, Chinese-style wine shops for on-site consumption, beer for consumption inside and outside the premises, foreign liquor for off-site consumption, temporary bars, Western-style hotels, coffee rooms, noodle shops, dim sum shops, and places that sell food and beverages in public entertainment venues and hotels. (2) Anyone opening a restaurant must obtain a permit according to the procedures before opening. Those established before the promulgation of these rules should apply for the procedures within one month after the promulgation of these rules. (3) The permits are renewed once a year, and the permit will be revoked if the business has not started within one month of obtaining the permit. (4) Restaurants should have appropriate facilities for garbage disposal and drainage, wire mesh disinfection, and stoves should not be installed in the store. (5) Employees and shop assistants must undergo a physical examination once a year.

The Municipal Finance Bureau discovered that banquet hall merchants often conceal and evade tax payments when collecting taxes on behalf of the government. Those who are caught with account books will be required to pay the total amount of evaded taxes. However, often only a portion of the invoices can be seized. Upon reviewing the account books, it is found that the amounts are not recorded, which is obviously to evade taxes. If only the discovered tax-evading invoices are used, the amount is very small. Even if they are prosecuted, it is not enough to deter the stubborn. Yesterday, the Municipal Council decided to calculate the tax based on the number of days on which the evasion was discovered, and fine them accordingly.

### A Devil During the Enemy-Puppet Period: Xue Gengxin Cannot Escape the Law; Imprisoned in the Zhongzi Jail Under Strict Guard Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] Xue Gengxin, who was once prominent during the enemy-puppet period, originally served as a translator in the French Concession Police Department before the war. During the war, he was once promoted to Chief Inspector of the Political Department, and later transferred to the position of Chief of the Huangpu Branch of the Police Bureau. After the establishment of the puppet secret service headquarters, Xue served as the leader of the intelligence group in "76," using his special power to arrest and kill patriotic heroes on a large scale and hinder our underground work. After the victory, knowing that his crimes were monstrous, he hid in North China. After multi-faceted searches by the relevant authorities, he could not escape the law and was finally escorted to Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday morning, under strict guard, he was escorted to the High Court in Tilanqiao. After the year, age, and origin were asked, he was ordered to be detained in the Zhongzi Jail. The High Procuratorate will open a court to investigate his crimes in the coming days.

### Liu Yangshan and Others to Be Sentenced on the 26th

[Report from Our Newspaper] Liu Yangshan, from Henan, is 45 years old this year. He was formerly a member of the Kuomintang, but later joined the puppet government. He successively served as Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Puppet Central Headquarters, Standing Committee Member of the Puppet Dedication Machine Movement Committee, Chief Supervisor of Training of the Puppet Youth League, and Chairman of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Party Department. After the victory, he was arrested by the authorities and transferred to the court. He has been interrogated several times on record. Yesterday morning, the collegiate panel re-examined the case. Liu argued that he had led the "Youth League" to promote the "anti-gambling, anti-dancing, and anti-drug" movement, which dealt a significant blow to the enemy and puppet's poisoning policy. After the victory, he also assisted in the takeover matters, so he asked himself to contribute to the party and the country. The trial of the case concluded, and the court ordered the sentence to be pronounced at 9:30 a.m. on the 26th of this month.

On the same day, the enemy collusion cases of Qian Xiaomin, acting director of the Wuxi Station of the Puppet Political Security Bureau, and two Italians, Kang Sidan Dingni and Qie Erxi Ai, were concluded, and it was decided that they would be sentenced on the morning of the 26th.

During the War of Resistance, the original site of Chengming College of Arts and Sciences on Jiaotong Road was seized by Zhenyun, son of former President Wang Xishen, with the force of puppets, who used his deceased father's name to sell the property. After the victory, the college discovered this, and after ineffective negotiations, filed a lawsuit with the court. Yesterday was the date of the High Court hearing.

### Two Robbers of Hawkers Arrested

[Report from Our Newspaper] In the vicinity of Zhoujiaqiao Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai, at around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, two robbers robbed a hawker of more than 9,000 national currency, and headed north along Zhongshan Road towards Zhenru. After receiving the report, the Zhoujia Police Station of the Xinjing Police Bureau sent a patrol officer to pursue them.

### Zhongyuan Shipping Company Sues Maersk for Breach of Contract in Purchasing a Ship and Demands Compensation

[Report from Our Newspaper] The first Sino-British international civil lawsuit was heard in the District Court yesterday. The plaintiff in the case was Zhongyuan Shipping Company, and the defendant was the British merchant Maersk (i.e., Laisi Shipping Company). On November 28th of last year, Zhongyuan Shipping Company purchased the "Wenifu Lei Maersk" ship from the British merchant Maersk, stipulating that the ship would be delivered when it arrived in Shanghai, with a total price of 75,000 pounds. Unexpectedly, after paying in installments, the plaintiff suddenly received a notice from the defendant on March 8th of this year, requesting to terminate the contract and return the deposit of 52,000 pounds and interest of 25 pounds, 5 shillings, and 6 pence. Zhongyuan Company then requested the defendant to compensate for the losses suffered due to the failure to perform the contract in accordance with Article 260 of the Civil Code, amounting to 774,479,944 yuan in legal tender and 13,088 pounds in British currency. The defendant stated that the seller of the "Wenifu Lei Maersk" ship was originally British Maersk Co., Ltd., located in London. However, the plaintiff proved from the defendant's letters that the Maersk shipping companies in London and Shanghai were originally one company. Moreover, the contract stated that delivery was required upon the second payment. Although the defendant received the second payment, it did not deliver the ship but returned the payment, which shows the intention to terminate the contract. The defendant replied: Because the British Wartime Transportation Bureau issued a ban on the transfer of various means of transportation, the ship was not allowed to be sold. Regarding this point, the defendant was forced to do so and had sent a letter to the plaintiff stating this, so please reject the plaintiff's lawsuit. The plaintiff firmly believed that the contract stated that the delivery date was the second payment, so the sovereignty of the ship undoubtedly belonged to the plaintiff. Since the defendant had breached the contract, it was natural to request compensation for losses. At this point, the court ordered the debate to end, and the sentence was set for the morning of the 24th. If the defendant loses the case, the amount of compensation will be determined in due course.

### Truck Accidentally Collides with Wooden Electric Pole, Eight People Thrown Out of the Cab

More than a dozen fishmongers from the Ningbo gang in the vegetable market on Caishi Street, as usual, chartered a truck to the fish market to purchase fish at around 4:00 AM yesterday. The truck driver was instructed to drive east along Zhongzheng East Road. When turning north on the Huangpu Bund Road, the driver was driving too fast and could not brake in time, so he accidentally collided with a wooden electric pole in front of the Gedeng Building on the Yangjingbang Bund, immediately throwing eight fishmongers, including Xu Zhanglong, Chen Abiao, Wang Fuzhang, Liu Zichun, Weng Fuquan, Yao Aqin, Ling Aqin, and Shi Axing, out of the car.

### Fire at Baishu on Zhongzheng East Road; Tianyi Guiyuan Store Carelessly Spreads to Neighboring Stores

### Shanghai Warehousing Industry Also Complaining

[Report from Our Newspaper] Members of the Shanghai Warehousing Industry Association increased the warehouse rental fee by one time from June 1 this year due to the high expenses of each item, which is 160 yuan of national currency per cubic foot. Yesterday, the person in charge of the association told reporters: This regulation also varies slightly depending on the warehouse buildings and equipment of the members, but the highest fee may not exceed this book. Up to the month before, the association had registered about 70 members, with capital ranging from 500,000 yuan to tens of millions of yuan. However, due to the sharp increase in imported goods in the city, most of the warehouses are full, but the actual situation cannot compensate for the monthly losses. Because the enemy-puppet materials sealed and stored in the warehouses after the victory have not yet been processed by the authorities, and the monthly warehouse rental fee paid for these sealed materials is only 25 yuan of national currency per cubic foot, resulting in the recent inability of a few members to continue operating. Therefore, the association, from the standpoint of the industry, sincerely hopes that the authorities will consider the difficulties of the business, expedite the clearance of sealed materials, and reduce their responsibilities.

### Shanghai Salt Loan Syndicate Formally Established and Convened a Meeting; Banks and Shops Eager to Subscribe to Loans

Zhou Jiyao (China Farmers), Zhong Long (China Trust Bureau), Shen Shuping (Postal Savings Bureau), Xu Guomao (Commercial Bank Representative), and Xu Wenqing (Money Shop Representative) were elected as members, and Jiang Jinren and Cen Lisan were hired as secretaries of the syndicate.

### After the Administration Headquarters Reorganizes its Structure, Materials are Speeded up for Inland Transportation; 20,000 Tons Out of 70,000 Tons of Inventory Have Been Shipped; Hope that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Will Withdraw its Order Soon

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since Liu Hongsheng, the executive director of the "Administration Headquarters", recently reorganized the agency, his authority has greatly increased. The most urgent task among his newly added tasks is to speed up the inland transportation of materials so that the director of the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration," La Guardia, can withdraw his order soon. The LST and LSM ships managed by China Merchants Bureau, totaling about 21,000 tons, will independently bear the transportation task. According to statistics from the "Administration Headquarters," if the ban is lifted and the quantity of materials coming to China remains unchanged, then 175,000 tons of ships per month will be needed for transportation, which is far from the total tonnage currently owned by China Merchants Bureau. Therefore, some related parties are not optimistic about whether the transportation tools will be sufficient in the future and whether La Guardia's ban can be lifted soon, because these ships must also send refugees in addition to transporting materials.

### Yanjing University's Restoration to its Former Grandeur: Not Easily Achieved in the Short Term; Acting President Lu Zhigong Tells Reporter

[Our Peiping Correspondent, 19th] Yanjing University, which is reopening in Peiping, is currently facing financial difficulties. According to Acting President Lu Zhigong, who told a reporter: Yanjing University's funding relies heavily on American donations, but due to high inflation, one US dollar is currently worth less than thirty cents in pre-war Chinese currency, so the school's income only covers one-third of its expenses, with the remaining two-thirds needing to be found domestically. The engineering college that Yanjing University planned to add this year will remain merged with the science college due to financial difficulties, with engineering courses being added to the physics and chemistry departments. Most of the school's equipment was lost after the Pacific War and has yet to be recovered. The equipment currently in use is mostly borrowed from the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. There is also a significant shortage of professors, especially in the Journalism and Economics departments, which have the largest number of students. Several American professors that Provost Stuart was planning to hire have been unable to come to China due to transportation and domestic order problems. The restoration of Yanjing University to its former grandeur will likely take one or two years to achieve.

### National Jiangsu Medical College: Relocating and Reopening at the Foot of Beigu Mountain

[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent] The National Jiangsu Medical College, formerly the Jiangsu Provincial Medical and Political College, moved west in response to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War.

It is reported that 20 outpatient clinics have already been built, and the remaining classrooms, laboratories, dormitories, and affiliated hospitals will be actively repaired during the reconstruction period so that they can be used. The campus is located at the foot of Beigu Mountain in Zhenjiang, covering an area of over 180 acres. Classes are expected to begin in the fall after the complete reconstruction.

### The South China Football Team's Visit to Shanghai: Sports Association Issues Statement: Recounts the Welfare Foundation's Negotiation Process

The City Sports Association yesterday issued a statement regarding Li Huitang leading the South China team to Shanghai at the invitation of the China Welfare Fund to participate in charity matches. The statement recounts the negotiation process between the Welfare Association and the City Sports Association as follows:

"On the 17th, various newspapers in this city published reports that Mr. Li Huitang was invited by the China Welfare Fund Committee to lead the South China Football Team to Shanghai to participate in charity football matches. In order to be cautious, the association deems it necessary to recount the negotiation process. In late June, a sports news report in a certain newspaper stated that Mrs. Sun had initiated the invitation to Mr. Li Huitang to lead the team to Shanghai to hold charity football matches, and the preparations were reported in the newspapers from time to time. On the 2nd of this month, the China Welfare Fund Committee sent a representative, Ms. Tan Liuqingxuan, with a letter to Zhou Jiaqi of the Football Committee, stating that they planned to hold charity football matches in mid-month in order to raise funds for disaster relief, and they had invited Mr. Li Huitang of the South China Football Team to preside over the matches. They requested assistance in inviting the participating teams, referees, and organizing the match schedule. Mr. Zhou Jiaqi replied with the reasons for holding the matches in late August, citing that the football season had ended and the various difficulties of holding them at an unsuitable time. On the 12th of this month, the Football Committee received a second letter from the China Welfare Fund Committee, which briefly stated: "Disaster relief is as urgent as putting out a fire. The South China team has decided to come to Shanghai and is preparing to depart. In order to alleviate the various difficulties of your association (Football Committee), the Welfare Foundation has contacted various teams and related parties and has been kindly promised support and assistance. Therefore, as soon as the South China team arrives in port in the coming days, our association will decide on the match date and ask for your guidance and full assistance." The Football Committee of the Sports Association, because this matter concerned the duties of the association, submitted it to the Council of Directors for discussion. At the meeting held at 2:00 PM on the 13th of this month, the two letters sent by the China Welfare Fund Committee to the Football Committee regarding the proposed hosting of the South China football team's visit to Shanghai to participate in charity matches were submitted. The decision was made that: (1) According to Article 3 of the Regulations for Sports Competitions Organized by Municipal Mass Organizations established by this association, "Municipal mass organizations that wish to raise charitable funds by holding public competitions and issuing tickets must obtain prior approval from this association before publicly selling tickets." (2) The football season has passed. Based on the above two points, it is difficult to comply. The aforementioned decision was sent to the Welfare Foundation for their review on the 15th of this month. After Li Huitang and others arrived in Shanghai, the association also notified the South China Football Team of the resolution of the Council of Directors at noon on the 17th, and because the team members are all amateur athletes, the association hoped that they would respect the resolution of the association's Council of Directors. Fearing that various circles are not aware of the true situation of the negotiations, this is specially declared as above, in the hope that all parties will be aware."

### 23rd District Negotiates with Highway Bureau: Allocating Buses to Run on Songhu Line: Will Stop Once Railway is Restored

The traffic between Wusong Town, which belongs to the jurisdiction of the 23rd District (Wusong) of this city, and Shanghai used to be maintained by the railway. Since the road was destroyed by the enemy, it has been cut off. After the victory, although local gentry and merchants have repeatedly appealed to the two road management express runs to restore the route, the bureau has been unable to realize it due to a lack of materials, and it is still blocked, causing inconvenience to merchants and travelers. Yin Gongtian, chairman of the District People's Congress of the district, and others, in view of the need to restore transportation in order to prosper the market, initiated the organization of the Wusong Transportation Promotion Association, and have negotiated with the Directorate General of Public Roads of the Ministry of Communications to sign a contract to dispatch a number of buses to run on the Wusong-Shanghai public bus line to maintain transportation. It will be stopped once the railway is restored. The district office has been asked to submit it to the Public Utilities Bureau for approval.

### City Chamber of Commerce Petitions Government to Improve the Method of Returning Factories: Losses Borne by the People, Benefits Fully Enjoyed by the Nation

[This Newspaper Report] The City Chamber of Commerce, based on a proposal from the Shanghai Paper Industry Association, intends to request the government to change the principles for taking over enemy and puppet assets. It sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan a few days ago. The full text is as follows: To the esteemed Executive Yuan of Nanjing, the Chamber of Commerce convened the ninth members' meeting on June 23. According to the proposal of the Shanghai Paper Industry Association, it is intended to request the government to change the principles for taking over enemy and puppet industries. The reasons stated within are: upon investigation, each factory in the recovered areas was forcibly seized by the enemy and puppet regimes, occupied for eight years. The factory buildings and machinery were occupied, and the raw materials and finished products were plundered. (Omission)

Heavy Losses Make Production Impossible

After the factories are taken over, resuming production requires painstaking management. Given the post-disaster situation, with a hundred holes and thousands of wounds, for the sake of economic recovery and promoting production, the government should provide assistance and encouragement to achieve the goal of national construction. However, it is heard that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau are handling the return of private factories based on the condition that only the undamaged machinery and equipment are returned. The raw materials, finished products, and materials stored in the factory when it was taken over must be nationalized. Even the factory buildings and equipment that were dismantled and transformed by the enemy must be considered as newly added or installed by the enemy, and the original owners must be charged for them.

Nominal Return, Only the Shell Remains

Under this situation, the nominal return of private factories only leaves the shell. Without newly adding raw materials and materials, it is impossible to start work and maintain production. (Omission) Logically speaking, the factory land and machinery and equipment are the mother of production. Because the enemy occupied private factories, the added raw materials, manufactured goods, and transformed equipment are all interdependent, like mother and child, and cannot be separated. In other words, the occupation of private factories is the cause, and the aforementioned products are the result. They should naturally be enjoyed by the original factory owners who were occupied, and should not be regarded as war trophies of the state. Among them, there are factories whose raw materials and finished products stored in the factory when they were occupied were also plundered by the enemy. If the current proposed method is followed, the losses will be borne by the people, and while it is nominally possible to claim compensation from Japan in the future, it is actually far off and amounts to quenching thirst with plums. The benefits will be enjoyed by the state, and a part of the people's losses will be divided as the state's exclusive benefit. Considering that the state and the people originally belong to one body, sharing weal and woe, this is completely contrary. It is proposed that the general assembly suggest that the government change the principles for handling the takeover of enemy and puppet properties.

Proper Method, Recommended for Implementation

All raw materials, materials, finished products, and newly added or transformed equipment taken over from occupied private factories should be handed over to the original factory for valuation and used to offset the losses caused by the enemy's occupation, seizure, and destruction. If there is any surplus, it can be nationalized and deposited in the treasury, but a reasonable deadline should be given for phased repayment to benefit recovery and production. (Omission) It is found that this case was previously forwarded to the National Political Council for a proposal. The Executive Yuan replied to the Secretariat of the National Political Council, stating that the Nationwide Enterprise Takeover Committee in the recovered areas had reviewed and decided that if the original telegram from the City Chamber of Commerce was followed, not only would the occupied factories that had already been processed by various administrations have to be re-liquidated, but the future work of clearing and claiming compensation from Japan would also be fragmented. It requested instructions on whether to approve the request, or to give each occupied factory the right to prioritize claims and compensation when handling compensation from Japan. The Executive Yuan rejected the matter based on the council's decision, and the Secretariat of the National Political Council forwarded the reply to the City Chamber of Commerce. The council's reply only focused on the difficulties in official procedures, and did not consider the points in the original telegram that "the occupation of private factories is the cause, and the aforementioned products are the result, they should naturally be enjoyed by the original factory owners who were occupied, and should not be regarded as war trophies of the state," and "the nominal return of private factories only leaves the shell," and "if the current proposed method is followed, the losses will be borne by the people."

Claims from Japan are Distant and Uncertain

"While it is nominally possible to claim compensation from Japan in the future, it is actually far off." In the council's reply, Item 445, these were not taken into account at all. It only knows how to plan from the perspective of public interest, which is not the position that a country should have, with the people as the basis. In accordance with the public opinion of the industry, a renewed request is made, hoping that the esteemed Executive Yuan will review, approve, and implement it. (Omission)

### After the Diversion of Floating Capital, Chinese and Foreign Stocks Soar, Both Gold and Foreign Currencies Become Dull

At noon, it retreated to within 2500 yuan. There was a slight rebound in the afternoon. As a result, it closed down slightly by 30 yuan compared to the previous close. Due to reports of the appreciation of the Hong Kong dollar, the Hong Kong dollar rose slightly upon entering the market. It was slightly flat at noon, and the result was the same as the previous day. The Hong Kong dollar was sold at 565 yuan, the Indian rupee at around 670 yuan, the British pound at 8900 yuan, and the US dollar was nominally flat but informally dull.

Government bonds remained stagnant. Both buyers and sellers were waiting for an opportunity. From an initial level of around 900 yuan in the morning, Tong Bing fell to around 800 yuan before slightly stabilizing. There were not many transactions. At noon, it hovered around 850 yuan. As a result, it closed down slightly compared to the previous close. Jia and Yi were the same. Tong Ding rose slightly, and Wu was flat. Chinese stocks presented a spectacular speculative scene. Before 11 o'clock, they were still in a flat state, but after 11 o'clock, a large amount of buying emerged.

The high prices near noon were 670 yuan for Yongsha, 4750 yuan for Meiya, 315 yuan for Jingfu, 310 yuan for Xinguang, and 235 yuan for Qinxing. In the second half of the time, Jingfu was again raised above Xinguang, with each showing its own abilities. As a result, Yongsha and Jingfu each rose by 15%, Meiya rose sharply by more than 20%, and Xinguang and Qinxing each rose by 10%. Unpopular small and medium-sized stocks saw a 70% increase. Veteran stocks were stable. Bids after the close were initially low and then improved, with erratic pricing.

Foreign stocks were flourishing, with the bullish trend starting earlier than Chinese stocks. Securities firms were actively involved, and the buying trend intensified. Yisha rose from 9200 yuan to 10,800 yuan, and Yinglian rose from 9500 yuan to 11,000 yuan. Other stocks were also affected and rose quite a bit. Steel and pharmaceuticals had strong buying interest and high bids. Near noon, it entered a consolidation phase.

### Yarn Market Declines in a Straight Line, Cotton Prices Rise by 3,000 to 4,000 Yuan, Opening Prices for Textile Construction Also Increase

Yesterday, the yarn market declined in a straight line. At the opening in the morning, selling pressure was strong. Traders from all over felt that the local yarn price was stagnant and could not rise sharply along with Shanghai, so they stopped buying. The decline was significant, with 20-count yarn falling by 30,000 to 80,000, and fine yarn also falling by 80,000. The number of transactions was extremely small, and sentiment turned weak. At noon, the Textile Construction Company opened yarn sales as usual. The opening price for 20-count yarn was higher than Wednesday, because the yarn sold in the previous period was Lima, and the yarn sold in this period was Fengnian.

Yesterday, a New York American cotton telegram suddenly soared by 95 to 100 points per pound, with the recent price being US$35.65 and the forward price being US$35.82.

The seller's asking price for Hankou pig bristles is US$4.30 to US$4.40 per pound, and the buyer's bid is US$4.15 and US$4.10. Due to the influx of goods and the increase in sales, prices are weak.

The US government recently sold the first batch of 5,100 bales of Japanese raw silk at a price of US$8.18 per pound, which affected the market price of Chinese raw silk.

### Report from Zhejiang Administrative Conference - Our Newspaper's Hangzhou Dispatch, 12th Day - Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

Unfolding China's landmass, on the southeastern edge lies a peach-shaped area, smaller in area than any other piece of land; this is Zhejiang Province. The total area of Zhejiang Province is 153,968,424 *shi mu*. Although the area isn't large, it has 21,762,248 people. On average, each person has 7.7 *shi mu* of land. As Shen Honglie said, "Zhejiang is a healthy person. The people have a relatively high level of knowledge, and their lives are quite good." Indeed, Zhejiang's land is fertile, its agricultural products are abundant, and coupled with its geographical proximity to the sea, it produces many outstanding talents.

Warm Hometown: Zhejiang

In a healthy province, the male and female population statistics should not differ greatly. Zhejiang has 11,758,194 men and 10,004,054 women, a difference of just over a million. The proportions are not far apart. Due to the relatively similar male and female ratios, a simple and unadorned social custom prevails. There are few frivolous women and few shallow men. Moreover, the entire territory consists of arable land, with 37,790,697 *shi mu* of farmland and 100,912,934 *shi mu* of mountainous land. There are no barren, deforested mountains; instead, there are lush forests, providing resources for production. With just a little effort, one can obtain enough to be fed and clothed. The transportation within the province is also very developed, with 301,791 *shi mu* of roads and 3,578,653 *shi mu* of rivers and lakes. Besides trains and automobiles on land, there are various human-powered vehicles. Besides steamers and motorized boats on waterways, there are various boats of different sizes. Therefore, many people come to Zhejiang from afar, lingering in this warm hometown of abundant food and clothing.

Fallen into an Abyss of Suffering

For the past eight or nine years, the flames of war have spread throughout Zhejiang Province. Thirty counties fell into enemy hands, and nine were recovered. In the thirty-first year, twenty-two counties fell, and fifteen were recovered. In the thirty-second year, thirty-nine counties fell. After bloody struggles, twenty-nine counties were recovered. This repeated falling and recovery brought the entire production to a standstill. People fled their original posts, and coupled with the layers of exploitation by the enemy and puppet regimes, a beautiful Zhejiang was transformed into a tattered ruin riddled with holes. Eagerly awaiting the arrival of victory, the "selfishness" and "negligence" of the officials caused Zhejiang to fall into an abyss of suffering once again. The people of Zhejiang urgently long for good governance by officials more than anything else. Indeed, in the county seats of Zhejiang today, there are many dilapidated walls and ruins. In the countryside, there are many barren fields. The people cannot make a living, and those who resort to desperate measures are everywhere.

A Landmark Important Conference

Chairman Shen Honglie of Zhejiang, upon taking office, inspected the seawalls and urged their urgent repair. Then, he inspected various counties to learn about the people's suffering. Upon returning, he explained the importance of recovery. He revealed that this year's priorities were public security, followed by relief, and then transportation. Next year, he aimed to have each county effectively assume its responsibility for security, and each township to achieve the goal of education. He also broadly promoted water conservancy loans. At the same time, he believed that the current natural disasters were caused by the gradual deforestation, so he planned to focus on agricultural production in the western Zhejiang plains and on afforestation in the eastern Zhejiang mountains, dredging various rivers and streams to prevent a recurrence of future disasters. He also did not advocate empty talk, striving for practicality. This year, he would consolidate the generally good situation and then seek development, rather than focusing on immediate attractive figures and reports, but rather on practical content. Shen Honglie is indeed doing this, and doing it tirelessly. I interviewed the respected and upright Mr. Zhu Xianwen, the Speaker of the Zhejiang Provincial Provisional Assembly, who told me, "Chairman Shen can be considered diligent in his duties and loving to the people." We welcome a good official who is diligent in his duties and loves the people. Conversely, we oppose a "negligent" and "selfish" corrupt official. We want to see Mr. Shen continue to work actively. On the 20th of this month, Mr. Shen will convene a provincial administrative conference in Hangzhou, which can be considered a landmark and important conference in Zhejiang's politics. The past is gone; we wish to encourage those who come after!

Public Security, Officialdom, Relief

According to Chairman Shen's disclosure: Zhejiang Province prioritizes public security this year, because only after the public security problem is resolved can the people truly recover. This is indeed an enlightened view. However, this reporter believes that during the maintenance of public security, it is even more necessary to concurrently address the clarification of officialdom. Because if officialdom is not clarified, then in addition to visible bandits, there will still be invisible bandits. Invisible bandits can lead to visible bandits. Chairman Shen has declared that he will not use personal connections, and up to now, he has indeed not used any personal connections. We believe that Chairman Shen is determined to clarify officialdom. However, the prerequisite for clarifying officialdom is to improve the treatment of public officials. Currently, senior county-level officials receive only 50,000 yuan per month. How can they support a family? Regarding this, we hope that there will be a concrete resolution in this administrative conference.

Chairman Shen also revealed that another important goal this year is relief, such as solving the universal problems of food, clothing, and shelter in thousands of counties. If the problems of food, clothing, and shelter cannot be solved, all public security measures are empty. This is also a crucial plan. However, solving the problems of food, clothing, and shelter is indeed not an easy task. We hope that each district and county will have a concrete plan to submit for everyone to study. We know that this relief plan must first have money. Zhejiang Province is now truly in dire straits, with its finances stretched to the limit. Where will this huge sum of money come from? If each district and county has a meticulous plan, perhaps using work as relief, or intensifying production, there may be a chance of success. Therefore, we are willing to learn of feasible relief plans in this administrative conference.

Sluggish Export Products

This province was originally a society with abundant agricultural products. Geographically speaking, Zhejiang is not suitable for industry but suitable for agriculture. Its agricultural products, in addition to grains, wheat, and beans, also include tung oil and tea leaves, which are all major export products. These many export products are now on the verge of stagnation. How should they be improved? How should production be increased? How can people who produce these many products live and work in peace? This is indeed a very important issue at present. We know that these many products can also be industrialized, that is, the original agricultural products can be processed through industry and then sold abroad. However, these plans require people with great courage and foresight to implement them. We hope that each district and county will study these special products with past export achievements and provide concrete opinions, because the result of these exports is also to increase the wealth of Zhejiang.

The administrative conference will be attended by more than 130 people, including provincial government members, department heads, district commissioners, county magistrates, and section chiefs and above from various departments and bureaus, for ten days. During these ten days, we believe that there will be very good resolutions, especially since Chairman Shen has provided appropriate suggestions in advance. Following these suggestions, there will definitely be good opinions. "Zhejiang is a healthy person," but now it is suffering from a serious typhoid fever. Officials are originally doctors, and the administrative conference is equivalent to a doctors' conference. Let's see what good medicine this doctors' conference will use to treat this seriously ill patient? What good prescription will be implemented to perform the art of resuscitation?

### Anti-Treason Work in Hong Kong

— Special Correspondent Lin Youlan, Hong Kong Dispatch, 13th Day of This Month

At the beginning of this article, the reporter would like to specifically explain the meaning of "traitor" (奸): Because the connotation of this word "traitor" may be different in Hong Kong and in the mainland. This difference is precisely the point of this article. In Hong Kong, the objects betrayed by a "traitor" are divided into (1) the Allied nations (including China and Britain), (2) Britain, and (3) China. The first type is called a "war criminal," the second is called an "enemy collaborator," and the third is called a "Han traitor" (漢奸) - the Han traitor referred to in our country's regulations for punishing Han traitors refers to this type. This article will also discuss the progress of the anti-traitor campaign in Hong Kong based on this distinction.

War Criminals on Trial

According to an announcement by the British Army Headquarters in Hong Kong, there are currently more than 200 war criminals imprisoned in Chi Ma Wan Prison. How does Hong Kong interpret "war criminal"? According to the chief prosecutor at the public trial of the first batch of war criminals by the Hong Kong Army Military Tribunal, international law stipulates that the most important actions of an occupier should be to respect the lives of the local people, not to disturb their peaceful lives, not to interfere with their religious beliefs, and not to threaten them with illegal or criminal charges. Anyone who fails to comply with these rules is in violation of the law and against the customs of war, and is regarded as the most important major war criminal. All the people belonging to this category are Japanese soldiers.

From the public trial of the first batch of war criminals on March 28 to the present date of the draft, six batches have been tried, totaling 23 war criminals. Five were sentenced to death, and the rest were sentenced to imprisonment, ranging from eight years to as little as two years.

The public trial of war criminals is the same as the public trial of other criminals, allowing civilians to observe. However, war criminals are only tried once by a military tribunal, and a judgment can be made immediately. "Enemy collaborators," however, are tried twice, first by the magistrate's court - called the Summary Court during the military administration - and then by the High Court. Although there are witnesses giving testimony and defense lawyers making arguments, the procedure is relatively fast. From the day of arraignment to the day of judgment, it takes no more than a month, so six batches were tried within 100 days. Although four batches of enemy collaborators have been brought to court, the first batch of six people has not been adjudicated yet, due to individual trials. The public trials of the various batches of war criminals are briefly described below:

(1) The first batch of 15 war criminals was charged with torturing and killing residents of Silvermine Bay, Lantau Island, from August 18 to August 26, 1945. The trial began on March 28 and ended on April 25: Lieutenant Abo Yasuo (commander of the Japanese army squadron stationed there), Lieutenant Matsumoto, and Sergeant Uchida were sentenced to death. Warrant Officer Yanagisawa and Corporal Kamishiro were sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. Sergeant Yoshikawa was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. Sergeant Kodama was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Sergeant Sukito, Corporal Jun Take, Corporal Nishizawa, and Corporal Uemura and Corporal Okamoto were sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Warrant Officer Ando, Sergeant Shiromori, and Private First Class Takahashi were acquitted and released.

(2) War criminal Matsuda Kenichi, a sergeant in the Japanese military police, nicknamed "Tiger Boy," was sentenced on May 10 to eight years' imprisonment for torturing a Chinese man, Li Jinman, to death. The verdict was on May 14.

(3) War criminal Inoue Kinio, an interpreter for the Japanese military police, nicknamed "King of Torture," was charged on May 22 with torturing prisoners of war and civilians and sentenced to death on May 27.

(4) Four war criminals, Japanese military police, were charged on May 30 with torturing seven Chinese people. On June 11, the verdicts were: Corporal Sano sentenced to eight years' imprisonment, Warrant Officer Kurosawa sentenced to six years' imprisonment, Sergeant Iida (nicknamed "Watering King of South China") sentenced to three years' imprisonment, and Sergeant Sakamoto acquitted.

(5) War criminal Omura Kiyoshi, a warrant officer in the Japanese military police, was charged on July 2 with torturing six Chinese people and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment on July 4.

(6) War criminal Sergeant Kawamoto of the Japanese military police was charged on July 9 with torturing a British man to death and sentenced to death on July 10.

Nono Kenosuke, the former commander of the Japanese military police in Hong Kong, Major General Okada, who represented the Japanese army in Hong Kong in the surrender, and Lieutenant General Sakai Takashi, who commanded the Japanese army's attack on Hong Kong, have also been listed as war criminals in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Army Military Tribunal is currently collecting evidence. Except for Sakai Takashi, who is being tried in Nanjing by our country, the other criminals will be brought to trial one after another in the coming days.

Enemy Collaborators

The Hong Kong government formally announced on February 7: All those who "during the Japanese occupation, adhered to or assisted the Japanese; or acted in a way that was detrimental to the war aims of the Allied nations; or who committed offenses against the defense laws of the Hong Kong government; or who committed serious crimes against the criminal laws of Hong Kong" shall all be treated as war criminals (War Criminals). In this way, war criminals are no different from what our country refers to as "Han traitors." When the first enemy collaborator, Huang Zuo, was publicly tried, the chief prosecutor formally defined High Treason for enemy collaborators as "committing treason against the 1351 Treason Act (Edward III, Chapter 2) within the territory of Hong Kong and its dependencies." In other words, those who were disloyal to the British Crown or "who acted as traitors when the British Crown and its subjects were openly at war with the Japanese military and civilians." Therefore, there is a prerequisite for enemy collaborators: he or she must be British, or have British nationality, or at least have sworn allegiance to the British Crown. Because of this key point, Huang Zuo's defense lawyer made a lengthy argument: Huang is Chinese and should not be governed by British law. He also said that Hong Kong was no longer a British territory after its fall, but a Japanese-occupied territory, and its residents were not required to be loyal to the British Crown. Xu Guozhen's defense lawyer, another enemy collaborator, also said: "The defendant is not a British citizen. All Chinese people are free to travel between China and Hong Kong. It can be argued that Chinese people in Hong Kong do not have to be loyal to the British Crown."

On the eve of the war criminals' trial, the authorities specially displayed 168 photographs of war criminals in two batches in central locations in order to collect evidence from the general public. In Chinese and English, it said: "Do you know him?" and "If you have information about any of them committing war crimes, such as brutal acts, torture, etc., please write down the photograph number and come to Room 305, 4th Floor, HSBC Building." However, there was no such procedure for the trial of enemy collaborators. Most of the witnesses who testified in court about the past enemy collaboration activities of the enemy collaborators were British intelligence agents and their families who had been tortured by the enemy collaborators. One of them was even the government prosecutor who is now serving in court. After Li Jie, one of the enemy collaborators, was sentenced to death, he angrily defended himself in court: "I feel extremely unfair about the verdict, because the statements made by the various witnesses contain many errors and are mostly fabricated. Although I am now sentenced to death, I am not afraid of death. However, I am extremely eager to make the whole story of this case public to society, so that people of reason in society can make a fair judgment. What I find even more unfair is that there are many more important traitors in Hong Kong who are still at large, or have been arrested but ultimately released, while insignificant people like me are being severely punished."

Huang Zuo, the first enemy collaborator, was hanged at Stanley Prison on July 10. - He was the second person to be hanged after the British army re-entered Hong Kong. The first was an adopted son who killed his adoptive mother. According to the list of the first batch of enemy collaborators published by the Hong Kong government, there are six in total. In addition to Huang Zuo, there are also Su Liang, Xu Guozhen, Li Jie, Li Caishi (Portuguese), and Jining (Swedish). Since being brought to court on February 19, they have been individually tried in public. Huang was charged with a total of thirty-one counts of crimes. Xu confessed that the former Mayor of Guangzhou, "Chen Ce, was his indirect superior" and was sentenced to death on July 27. Su Liang is still on trial. Li Jie, nicknamed "Number One Secret Agent of Kowloon," "whose brutal behavior was even worse than the enemy's," was sentenced to death on May 30. Li Caishi, who was accused of "colluding with the enemy to bring the Xian ship from Australia to Hong Kong," is still in custody awaiting trial. Jining, who was accused of "directing the enemy artillery in Kowloon to use Hong Kong as a target for shooting," was acquitted at the public trial on April 17 because his defense lawyer argued that "according to the British government's grace measures, those suspected of assisting the enemy, but found to have no brutal behavior, cannot be prosecuted." This grace measure has benefited many other "enemy collaborators" who have not yet been announced! But Jining was ultimately deported from Hong Kong for life by the Hong Kong government.

The second batch of enemy collaborators consists of five Indians and two Chinese. The third batch consists of three Westerners, one Indian, and five Chinese. The fourth batch consists of nine Chinese. All of these have been brought to court one after another. Except for the three Westerners who have been released on bail, none of the other prisoners have been convicted. According to a report on May 4, the authorities were preparing to deport a batch of enemy collaborators, including four Westerners, one Indian, and ten Chinese. Some of those who are being held in prison have already shouted out to request that the judge make a speedy judgment this month.

### An Interesting Episode at the British Commonwealth Conference

There was an interesting episode at the Commonwealth Conference: When British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons that Britain was preparing to completely withdraw its troops stationed in India, opposition leader Churchill questioned whether the consent of the Commonwealth nations had been sought in advance for this policy decision, or whether they were being asked to approve it after it had become a *fait accompli*. Attlee replied that consent had been obtained in advance. But this was not actually the case. Canada protested first, saying that consent had not been obtained in advance. Australia also complained, saying that at a time when the Commonwealth nations were discussing how to strengthen their participation in imperial decision-making, the government had made this important decision without first obtaining the consent of the Commonwealth nations. Thus, there was another verbal storm in the House of Commons, which was resolved only after much explanation. At the same time, it seems that the Commonwealth nations are exerting considerable indirect influence on the mother country's foreign policy. (Xueyan, dispatch from London, 30th)

### Provisional University Students Want to Continue Their Education

Editor: Our school - the Shanghai Provisional University Preparatory Class Attached to the Special Shanghai Provisional University Preparatory Class of the Ministry of Education - completed its second semester exams on the 7th of this month. It can also be said that the Provisional University Preparatory Class will be eternally gone. Recalling the four months since the opening of the preparatory class, we have reviewed the entire middle school curriculum, and undergone two rigorous semester written exams. Although we students come from all directions, our goals are the same - hoping to be recommended to a national university. Now that the semester has ended, the Ministry of Education and the school authorities have not announced anything regarding the further education of our preparatory class students. Thinking of this, we envy the students who skipped grades during the puppet regime. Those who were in the same grade as us or lower in the past are now studying in their second or third year of university, and the Ministry of Education is very forgiving of these students, as evidenced by the screening measures. Now, the Shanghai Education Bureau has begun to conduct screening for graduates of secondary schools in the recovered areas, according to the order of the Ministry. We do not know if we will also have to undergo the same screening? We request that the Ministry of Education announce the two major issues of the recommendation of students from the Provisional University Preparatory Class Attached to the Shanghai Provisional University and the screening as soon as possible, so as to avoid students waiting too long and missing the date of the university entrance examination! (Wang Bomin, Cai Zhongzheng, Liu Dagui)

### Hoping for Middle School Evening Classes

Editor: Universities such as Shanghai University and Soochow University have evening classes, purely for working youth, but they require a high school diploma. I am a primary school graduate, and I should go on to further education, but due to circumstances, I had to abandon my studies and go into business. But I still cannot forget my desire for education. Although I am supplementing my education in a tutoring night school, it is a school without a system. There must be many others with the same situation as me. Therefore, I hope that each university's evening classes will have a complete middle school evening class attached. Those who graduate from the middle school in the evening class can enter the university class, so that we, the general primary school graduates, can also study hard and obtain a bachelor's degree. I wonder if the school authorities can adopt this? (Luo Jiawei, Shanghai)

### The Dispute Between Long-Term and Short-Term Workers

Mr. Editor:

We are laborers working at the Tongji Textile and Dyeing Factory at 20 Anda Road. For the past two months, we have consistently arrived early and left late, fulfilling our duties. Now, the factory has no shortage of goods, with vigorous imports and exports. However, on the morning of July 2nd at 9:00 AM, the factory suddenly dismissed over forty of us. At that time, we immediately appointed a representative to ask for the reason for the dismissal. They said that the factory has rules stipulating that workers who have been at the factory for three months are promoted to long-term workers. Since you have only been here for a little over two months, you are still considered temporary workers, and the factory can terminate your employment at any time.

However, according to the regulations of the Social Affairs Bureau, the compensation for temporary workers must exceed that of long-term workers by 35%. Yet, our compensation as temporary workers is only four-fifths of that of long-term workers. Furthermore, the factory is not lacking business. If it were lacking business and completely shut down, we would not make unreasonable demands, preferring to face unemployment.

At the time, we immediately requested the Third District Dyeing and Weaving Industry Labor Union to send representatives to demand reinstatement from the factory. The labor union sent members Xu Wenhua and Li Sixun to the factory to demand reinstatement again. The factory director, He Yutang, presented the following conditions to the labor union members: this group of workers, who entered the factory before June 30th, must have their past two months of work nullified, and they cannot continue from the later date to be promoted to long-term workers. Otherwise, they will definitely be dismissed.

We respectfully ask people from all walks of life for guidance. Is this reasoning correct? What will we do to survive after losing our jobs? (Tongji New Workers)

### Unwilling to Be Ruled by the Reds

We are a group of refugees from Northern Jiangsu. Our hometowns have been occupied by the Communist army since the victory and are now called the "Liberated Areas." After experiencing the Communist army's policies of "three resources," "three equalizations," and "three clearances," tens of millions of our compatriots are in dire straits. We are unwilling to endure their oppression (which is fundamentally not allowed to exist) and have successively fled south, gathering in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, numbering no less than three million people. The intermittent ceasefire negotiations, such as allowing the CCP to station two divisions in the Northern Jiangsu region, stationed in Huai'an and north of it, we firmly oppose. Because isn't this just like the era of the enemy puppets? Separating Huai'an into "Central China" and "North China" regions, to divide the whole and then return to the Communist Party's jurisdiction, we demand that the government preserve the unity of military and administrative orders in Jiangsu Province; not only Northern Jiangsu, but all parts of the country should also have the power to unify military and administrative orders. Although we refugees are currently receiving the government's attention and relief, as well as sympathy and donations from all sides, providing temporary comfort, it is not a long-term solution. We must eventually return home, and we ask the government and fair-minded people to assist us. (Refugees from Huai'an, Huaiyin, Lian'shui, Si'yang, Suqian, and Mudu Counties in Pudong, Zheng Qing, Shen Qicai, Xu Canwen, et al.)

### The Voices of Public Toilet Management Workers

Recently, there have been reports that public toilets have increased the price of defecation three times in a row, increasing the burden on citizens. We, the workers managing public toilets, would like to offer an explanation and appeal to the authorities for assistance: (1) We workers purchase toilet paper for defecation from contractors, and after paying the contract price, what remains is barely enough to maintain our families. Outsiders are unaware of the truth and mistakenly believe that public toilets are absolutely free. This is a misunderstanding. (2) In the past few months, the cleaning department was responsible for assessing and paying sales fees, which were paid according to the actual situation. However, starting in June, the authorities changed their policy to focus on increasing revenue, contracting the public toilet department to merchants at a price about ten times higher. Merchants, whose purpose is to make a profit, pass on the contract price to the workers. Therefore, each public toilet pays tens of thousands of yuan, and it is difficult to bear this huge compensation without increasing the price of defecation. Therefore, we have made a slight increase. (3) From this day forward, all of us workers have been ordered by the Lei Bureau to reduce sales by 20 yuan each time. Not only can we not maintain our livelihoods with this, but we must also compensate with huge amounts of money. We are forced to appeal to the authorities and request: (1) Please adjust the selling price to 40 yuan. (2) Reduce the contract price by four-tenths. (3) Fix the long-term contract price and limit price changes within one year. In summary, we hope that the relevant authorities will adopt our requests. We are extremely grateful!

### Answers to Readers - Legal Advice

(1) Gao Junyong asks: My friend A lived with his adopted daughter-in-law B in the winter of 1927. Without marriage, they cohabited for five years and had a son. Later, in 1933, they became enemies because of economic pressure, causing B to abandon her husband and son and leave home without a trace. Later, in 1939, she cohabited with a pseudo-squad leader C and has been living together for seven years, without having any children. My friend A is very honest, but although he knows about this, he is afraid of C's power, so he has not dared to sue in court until now. Now, B is homesick (the son is already seventeen years old), has repented of the past, and is willing to reconcile. However, C is obstructing her from the middle, threatening her verbally, causing A great mental pain. Therefore, I am asking the following questions on his behalf, hoping that you can answer them in your column. I would be very grateful! 1. Although A and B were not formally married and there is no evidence (such as betrothal cards), they cohabited for five years and had a son. Can they be considered husband and wife in law? 2. A and B have not gone through the procedures for ending cohabitation and have been separated for fourteen years. Can the name of husband and wife still be established? 3. Is C guilty of occupying another man's wife? What kind of crime is it? However, they have been cohabiting for seven years. Can it be said that A has tacitly approved and obtained legal cohabitation? 4. Can A formally sue C for hindering the family?

[Lawyer Duanmu answers] 1. They cannot be considered husband and wife. 2. There is no name of husband and wife. 3. B is not a married woman. 4. A cannot sue C for hindering the family. 5. B cannot be charged with bigamy or adultery.

(2) Huang Yao asks: Zhang Jun's family has lived in a traditional single-story house (a total of three rooms) at No. X Changping Road for generations. From April 1940, he rented it to Jiang Jun for a term of four years (without a lease agreement). He had collected rent monthly for four years. In April 1944, Zhang Jun's children increased in number, and his own residence was not enough. He asked Jiang Jun to move out and take it back for his own use, not collecting rent until now for two years. However, Jiang Jun still makes excuses and refuses to move out, and repeated reminders have been ineffective. He had no choice but to apply to the Shanghai Municipal Housing Lease Management Committee for mediation, which was also unsuccessful. Now there are several questions: 1. Which articles of law has Jiang Jun violated in this case? Is there any conflict between Zhang Jun's facts and the law? 2. What evidence should Zhang Jun present to the court when he sues to take it back for his own use? 3. How should we deal with Jiang Jun's lies? 4. Is it possible for the court to rule that "the defendant continues to live there"? What is the reason? I have asked for your advice and would be grateful if you could provide a public reply.

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers] 1. Jiang Jun violated Article 450, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code. 2, 4. Taking back for personal use requires proof from the police, self-governing organization, or housing lease management committee. 3. If Jiang Jun is lying, you must present evidence.

(3) Zhang Lide asks: A owns a large foreign-style house. During the enemy-puppet period, it was sold to a Japanese company. Because foreigners cannot obtain ownership of real estate in China, a Chinese B was used as the nominal buyer. The sales contract was kept by the company. After the victory, before the Japanese residents were sent to the concentration camp, A repurchased the house and sales contract from B at the original price and gave B a considerable reward, stipulating that if a problem occurred, B would claim to be the actual buyer. Now A has sold the house to a certain organization. (1) Is this property enemy property? (2) What is B's legal responsibility? (3) Is the sales contract between A and the organization valid? (4) Is the price obtained by A unjustly enriched? If it is unjustly enriched, who should it be returned to? (5) If A cannot hand over the price, what should be done?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers] (1) Since it was purchased with funds from an enemy Japanese company, it is enemy property. (2) B has no right to dispose of the property. (3) The sales contract between A and the organization is not legally valid. (4) The price received by A from the organization should be returned to the original owner. If it cannot be returned, there is no choice but to seek a court decision.

### Old Man Qingxia's Heartfelt Plea: Please Help Kind-Hearted Philanthropists Relieve the Lonely, Widowed, Poor, and Sick

Respected Sir: I have been reading your newspaper daily, disclosing relief efforts and widely publicizing them, which shows your enthusiasm for public welfare and diligent work. I am deeply impressed! Furthermore, I am grateful to the directors of the Jialin Student Loan Fund and all the patrons who have successively allocated funds to join, allowing the lonely, poor, and sick to receive relief. This demonstrates the enthusiasm of people in society, which I am very fortunate to see! Now, I have collected another 500,000 yuan in legal tender. Please check and receive it. My efforts are limited, and I cannot provide as much assistance as possible. I rely on your newspaper to further expand fundraising, gathering strength to benefit society. The merits and virtues are immeasurable. I specifically ask the chief writer of the Social Services column of the Shen Bao to write peacefully. Respectfully, Old Man Qingxia, the 17th.

### Street Education

During the War of Resistance, "Military Affairs First"; during the period of national reconstruction, "Education First." Many educators have issued urgent appeals, calling for speeding up the restoration of the education sector, demanding that the authorities allocate more education funds, and people across the country have united to make efforts to relieve out-of-school children.

Indeed, how much work have the children done?

Tuition fees are so expensive that the majority of parents with meager incomes feel overwhelmed, and how many school authorities are truly teaching children well? Teachers' lives are difficult, and they have no choice but to exert their best efforts to teach part-time everywhere, so they are mentally exhausted during class, and revising homework is even more exhausting.

We sympathize with the teachers. We forgive their difficulties. But we also cannot deny a fact, which is that, under the current circumstances, children can really learn very little in school. We do not approve of turning innocent and lively children into hunchbacked and nearsighted little scholars. All we ask is that the school give them a healthy life, a pure atmosphere. The purpose of publishing these photos here is to draw everyone's attention - please take a look, is this kind of life healthy? Is it pure?

These are all innocent children! But on the streets, they learn to play cards and fight crickets. They don't have books that suit their tastes, so they sit quietly in front of small bookstores, calmly accepting the toxins of gods, monsters, superstitions, and pornography in those small books. They don't have appropriate places to exercise, so they kick soccer balls and play games on the crowded and messy street corners, and how many speeding cars in Shanghai threaten these small, lovely lives every day!

We are not qualified to condemn the children, they are innocent. We only hope that the millions of citizens of Shanghai will calmly think: have we fulfilled our responsibilities as parents? (Pingzhai)

### Exercise should be promoted, but how many jeeps and cars are speeding on the streets of Shanghai every day!

### He is quietly dreaming of swordsmen and immortals. When will someone come to relieve their "spiritual food" famine?

### They use discarded tram tickets as poker chips, and even the younger brother who hasn't learned to speak watches with relish.

### It's not that they don't want to work hard. It's not that they can't keep order. They just don't have a reasonable environment.

### Literary Sensitivity

— Kai Yin

Literary workers are always at the forefront of the times, and the creation is a soul adventure. We say that literary workers must have a sensitivity different from ordinary people, and its significance lies in the fact that sensitivity is a sign of prescience. Without sensitivity, a writer cannot grasp the most tempting things in the vast life and express the most important things. Sensitivity is the intellectual antenna of literary workers.

Sensitivity and so-called "nervousness" are absolutely different. The former is a premonition of undiscovered things based on the correct position, while the latter is a kind of self-consciousness, a kind of morbid illusion. Usually, when self-consciousness develops too abnormally, it forms signs of nervousness. The literary sensitivity we are talking about should be the recognition of objective necessity through subjective and calm observation. Because of sensitivity, the writer's subject matter will never be exhausted. He will never live in the crowd in a muddled way, but will always retain a deep concern. If the literary worker himself is numb and indifferent to things, then his sensitivity is definitely not healthy.

Secondly, some people confuse the meaning of sensitivity with inspiration, which is wrong. Inspiration is extremely abstract. It is only the harmony of emotional development with the desire to write. Its main significance lies in the success of a creation because of the burning of the desire to write. But sensitivity is different. It is the pursuit of concrete things between the present and the future. It is in the observation of life, not in the practice of writing. Those who emphasize inspiration are mostly romantic writers. They think that when inspiration comes, ideas will flow like a spring, and then a great work is produced; but sensitivity is not like this. It is like a news reporter's nose. It can also predict the possible development of things that are still brewing, or it can obtain a line for interviewing news. Sensitivity works at any time in daily life. It requires profound observation, and without the guidance of sensitivity, failure is inevitable.

For example, Newton, because he saw an apple falling from a tree, most people would not pay attention to it, but he was surprised and researched the reason. This can be said to be a kind of sensitivity to natural phenomena, which is precious.

Writers, like social natural scientists, need a calm mind to observe things, analyze phenomena, and need a cautious and careful research attitude. Sensitivity is just one of the conditions.

### Silhouette (Novel) (Part 2)

— Zhong Yi

Ru Ji exhaled a large mouthful of thick smoke, peering at Xiao Shi from within the smoke, remaining silent. Then, after taking four or five more puffs, he said weakly,

"I know, I know I shouldn't do this, but the environment doesn't allow me not to! I feel a strong force driving me; I desperately need that silhouette!" As he spoke, he nodded resolutely.

"..." Xiao Shi now began to feel that it was useless to try and dissuade him; because he had already stated that he "needed" that silhouette! He needed to eat; could you persuade him not to? More persuasion would not only fail to change his mind but might even strengthen his conviction, making it even more unshakable! So, he closed his eyes and pondered quietly, his forehead crisscrossed with wrinkles. For the moment, he seemed to have forgotten that a friend was sitting in the room, he was only concerned with engaging his own mind.

Ru Ji looked at his watch again, lazily picked up his hat, and seemed about to leave. He stuck the remaining short cigarette in his mouth, puffing it diligently, and said softly, "I'm sorry to have made you waste so much time for nothing, Xiao Shi. I feel quite relieved now, because the frustrations accumulated in my heart have been poured out and vented! Alas, but who knows what the future holds? If you don't mind the trouble, I think—I still want to borrow your ears as a tool to wash away my troubles! At this moment, I want to—"

Xiao Shi, in his state of contemplation, hadn't heard a word of Ru Ji's until Ru Ji uttered the words "I want," and then he awoke as if from a dream, quickly walking to Ru Ji's side, placing his hand on his shoulder, and said cheerfully,

"Hey, Ru Ji, I've found a solution! I can save you! I can make you happy!"

Ru Ji held his head high, playing with the smoke as usual, waiting a while before asking indifferently,

"Really?"

"Oh, would I lie to you?"

"Then please, what's your solution? Tell me."

Xiao Shi twitched his nose, holding Ru Ji's hand and saying,

"This... it's not convenient to reveal just yet, because you're too stubborn. If I told you, you might disagree, or be unwilling, and all that, so I think it's safer not to announce it! In short, Ru Ji, I vow to do my best to help you solve this problem! As for what steps to take, you don't need to worry about that!"

"No, please tell me!"

"No, I can't tell you! You lack patience! It's really late now, you should go home. I'll call you in a couple of days to discuss things!"

Xiao Shi's so-called "solution" was not really a clever plan. He was simply planning to shift Ru Ji's thoughts from Min Yu and the silhouette to somewhere else, to make him forget the silhouette and seek happiness and interest in other things! If such a solution could be realized, it would of course be extremely satisfactory; in fact, there was no other way to alleviate Ru Ji's pain! However, Ru Ji himself seemed to have tried this method before, and the result was failure. For example, he let work and reading occupy his time, he went to Wuxi, and so on, but the result was always an inability to break free, always unable to jump out of the walls built by painful memories!

Then, looking at it this way, this method has no effect, so how can Xiao Shi be so confident in telling him that he has a solution to save him? It turns out that Xiao Shi, while contemplating, carefully analyzed the matter and discovered the crux of Ru Ji's failure! He believed that Ru Ji's method—which was actually his own method—was absolutely flawless in principle. The reason for his failure was entirely due to the inappropriate choice of goals for shifting his thoughts, thinking that books, work, new environments, and so on, were lifeless things. Things without life, their ability to attract attention, was of course inevitably weaker than things with life and vitality! So, Xiao Shi was prepared to guide Ru Ji's thoughts towards a goal with life and vitality!

He remembered that on the day of his engagement, there was a young and beautiful Miss Sun Yun among the guests, who attracted the attention of all the guests present! This Miss Sun was a very close classmate of his fiancée. As for her appearance and figure, she was indeed worthy of the word "beautiful"! Miss Shi—his fiancée—was also beautiful, but Miss Shi's beauty was quiet, gentle, and virtuous, while Miss Sun's beauty was lively and light! Such a lively, intelligent, and beautiful Miss, no matter who saw her, could not help but envy her! So, Xiao Shi believed that if he introduced her to Ru Ji, Ru Ji would definitely not be able to resist her allure! At the same time, Ru Ji himself was also a fairly handsome young man; Miss Sun's beauty, paired with Ru Ji's handsomeness, seemed to be a perfect match!

However, before Ru Ji had seen her, before he had forgotten Min Yu, he was probably not going to agree to this proposal, because he was very stubborn. So, the only way was not to let him know in advance, and to see how he reacted after a sudden introduction? Was Min Yu's magic stronger, or was Miss Sun's temptation stronger? If it was the former, then of course he would continue to miss his lost Min Yu, if it was the latter, then he could turn back to the shore and approach Miss Sun! According to Xiao Shi's estimation, although Ru Ji was fond of Min Yu, she ultimately had no feelings for him, so his plan would definitely be victorious!

Miss Shi lived in a school dormitory, and only stayed at home two days a week. Originally, she was prepared not to live in the dormitory after she got engaged, but she thought that the home environment was too noisy and not suitable for studying, so she still decided to stay at school. Whenever she returned home on Saturday, Xiao Shi would go to the Shi's house to chat with her, and on Sunday, Miss Shi would come to Xiao Shi's house, or go out to play.

This Sunday, Xiao Shi agreed with Miss Shi to invite Miss Sun and Ru Ji to go to the movies together. Miss Shi naturally expressed her support for Xiao Shi's plan. They expected that in the cinema, going in would be two couples and two singles, but coming out would be two couples!

When Ru Ji arrived at the cinema, the other three had been waiting for a long time. Miss Shi and Miss Sun were waiting by the escalator inside because they disliked the dust at the entrance of the cinema, but Xiao Shi was afraid that Ru Ji would not be able to find them when he arrived, so he stood alone at the entrance waiting.

"Sorry, sorry, I'm late!" Ru Ji panted.

"It doesn't matter," Xiao Shi replied with a smile. "You don't need to apologize to me. It's true that you should apologize to them later!"

"Them? Who?" Ru Ji said with a smile, "Oh, I see, Miss Shi is here too, isn't she?"

"Yes... you'll understand in a moment, let's go in!"

Pushing open the glass door, Ru Ji's eyes scanned around, and suddenly he shouted softly,

"Silhouette! Silhouette!"

Xiao Shi was taken aback at first, then looked at Ru Ji's face and suddenly said,

"You remembered that silhouette again?"

"No, Xiao Shi, it's here! The silhouette is here, I've reunited with her!"

"Where? Where?" Xiao Shi asked anxiously.

"Standing by the escalator, wearing a pink short coat!... Alas, I want to go up! I want to..."

Xiao Shi was stunned listening to his words! He grabbed Ru Ji's sleeve, his lips trembling, unable to speak! After half a moment, he managed to squeeze out a sentence with great effort:

"That, that's my fiancée!" 3/5, 3/29. (The End)

### Lovers Flying Together (90)

— Zhao Qingge

"Xiao Hua, let me introduce you to Mr. Dong Shaoling, the Chinese teacher at our school," Liu Ziyun said, pointing to the man. "His knowledge is very good, and you can learn a lot from him in the future. He is not only knowledgeable but also talented; he can play instruments, sing, and act! He goes to see your plays almost every day. He greatly admires your art."

Hearing this, Zhang Xuan widened his eyes, glared at Dong Shaoling, sneered, and said coldly,

"Mr. Dong is so knowledgeable and talented that our Xiao Hua is simply too good for him."

"Master!" Li Hua walked towards Zhang Xuan with a stern face. "It's getting late, you can go back." Saying this, she gestured for him to leave.

"What?" Zhang Xuan looked very resentful, and said with a sneer! "It's getting late, but the guest hasn't left yet, has he?"

Li Hua was simply furious and shouted sternly,

"Master!"

"Okay, my Ink Boss! Don't worry, I'm leaving now. Since you hate me, I'll go sit in the outer room, come on, let's warm up the voice for Little..." Saying this, Zhang Xuan picked up his Erhu and glared at Dong Shaoling again, then stumbled out.

"Mom, my master is so rude, I can't let him come to our house again!" Li Hua said angrily to Mrs. Mo.

"Tsk, tsk, tsk, that's just him, don't pay attention to him." Mrs. Mo comforted Li Hua, and then went out as well.

At this time, the Erhu sounded outside, and Li Yun sang: "Selling the Horse". Liu Ziyun and Dong Shaoling looked at each other silently. Dong Shaoling looked a little uncertain and kept gesturing for Liu Ziyun to leave, but Liu Ziyun refused to move, and gestured to stop Dong Shaoling.

"Mr. Liu! This, this is why I didn't want to tell... my identity," Li Hua said sadly after a moment of silence.

"Xiao Hua, I expected that you must have many difficulties in your heart. Come to school tomorrow and talk to me. Don't be so depressed, be careful you'll ruin your health." Liu Ziyun went over sympathetically, stroked Li Hua, and said comfortingly.

"Sigh!" Dong Shaoling sighed deeply, said nothing, put on his hat, and prepared to leave.

"Mr. Dong!" Li Hua looked up, with tears in her eyes, and said to him: "I'm really sorry!"

"It's nothing!" Dong Shaoling was also a little embarrassed. He urged Liu Ziyun again. "Let's go!"

Liu Ziyun then nodded, picked up his raincoat, and patted Li Hua.

"Don't be sad, come to school to play tomorrow!" After saying that, Liu Ziyun went out.

### Hard Is the Road

— Shao Fu

The traffic situation in Shanghai, if it continues like this, will be a terrible future.

Taking the Route 1 trolleybus from the end of North Sichuan Road to Shanxi Road takes an average of 50 minutes, and the waiting time, from 10 minutes to half an hour, depends on your luck.

The chaotic, disorderly state of the roads is fully demonstrated on Nanjing Road and Beijing Road, making one suspect that they are fleeing or that enemy planes are attacking, otherwise how could there be such a hurried look.

Military trucks and jeeps crash around; three-wheeled vehicles and rickshaws weave around in the gaps;… we can't help but admire the bravery of these drivers, and even more admire their skills.

Many drivers are very proud, they don't take traffic violations seriously, they say, even if you drive a car without a license now, it's no big deal to be fined 1,000 yuan? Yes, compared to the old days when the concession would arrest you and put you in the Western prison for two days, it's really no big deal. Just two hours before I wrote this article, the rickshaw I was in crossed the Nanjing Road and Chengdu Road intersection under a red light, passing through two policemen without any trouble.

Shanghai makes newcomers dizzy, and traffic chaos is a major reason. It would be shameless of us to say that this is the face of urban prosperity!

Some people suggest banning three-wheeled vehicles and rickshaws, and we absolutely agree, but we hope that before the ban, transportation tools for millions of citizens to travel must be arranged first: and before this step, traffic management must be strict and thorough, don't just hold a few meetings, issue a declaration, post a few slogans, and have a few conductors decorating the intersections during the "movement" days, and then everything is back to normal.

We citizens silently pray that the municipal authorities will immediately take the most appropriate measures!

### Resurrection

— Dongfang Jing

"Soviet scientists have found that 51 civilians who died have come back to life as a result of experiments."

In the past, people were divided into two major categories: living and dead. Between life and death, there is a clear boundary. Once you enter the "other world," you can never return to the human world—unless an incredible miracle occurs.

For most of them, the period of revival was very short, only a few hours or days. They eat, drink, talk, and even write letters, but the damage to vital organs ultimately cannot be saved.

Of the 51 people, 12 are still alive, living normal lives.

The method used by these Soviet scientists is very simple: after death, rescue as quickly as possible, injecting warm blood, mixed with adrenal compounds and glucose, into the brachial artery—the shortcut to the heart. Under high pressure, this mixture can cause the heart to contract, causing blood to flow from the arteries into the veins.

At the same time, doctors use artificial respiration to restore the dead person's breathing, which often needs to be continued for a long time, perhaps up to an hour after life is restored, until the patient can breathe freely.

The results of Soviet medical experiments tell us that the weakest part of the human body is not the heart, but the nervous system. It is the first to die from long-term anemia.

Dr. Negovsky announced to the world: "We cannot give up our efforts because the patient's heart and breathing have stopped, we should continue to fight for the patient's life, especially those who die suddenly… Hearts that have stopped beating can sometimes beat again."

Now, science has a different explanation for life and death. There is no definite distance between life and death. Even if a person enters the realm of death, he still has a chance to return to the living world.

This means that after you die, you still have a chance to come back to life. This is not just a sensational theory, but 51 people have already been saved from death using this new method.

Currently, to save a dead person, the time of death cannot be too long, about five minutes or so. But, the important thing is that dead people can be saved. Those who die from fainting, excessive bleeding, or other curable diseases have gained new life.

This resurrection technique was researched by Dr. Negovsky of the Soviet Ministry of Health and his deputies. Initially, they used this technique to save fallen soldiers, and now it is used on civilians. They also provide all data and technology to doctors in the United States and other countries.

From Life to Death in Several Stages

The basis of Negovsky's resurrection technique is that the various parts of the human body do not die at the same time. He discovered: "Death is not the sudden cessation of life; from life to death, there are several transitional stages."

Therefore, although the heart stops, other parts of the body may still be alive. A doctor can declare this person dead, but it is not "biological death" (all parts of the human body are dead), and he often has a chance to be resurrected.

There was a private in the Red Army named Zhirimanov who was seriously injured in the hip and had completely lost consciousness when he was taken to the hospital. He was carried to the operating table, but the situation was getting worse and worse. Finally, the heart stopped, breathing stopped, and nerve reflexes disappeared.

The surgeon routinely reported: "Death due to syncope and excessive bleeding."

At this time, Dr. Negovsky walked in. Three minutes later, he started working. One minute later, he started working. One minute later, Zhirimanov's heart began to beat; three minutes later, he began to breathe; within an hour, he regained consciousness.

Soon after, he fell asleep. Called his name, he opened his eyes and answered questions. He wanted water to drink. His breathing was normal and even, and his pulse was normal.

Today, Zhirimanov is doing very well, and he simply cannot believe that he is a person who has died once.

What Is the Afterlife Like?

A reporter asked him if he had seen anything interesting in the other world. Scratching his head, he apologized and replied: "Actually, I didn't see anything. At the moment of death, I had already lost consciousness, and I didn't regain consciousness until after the surgery. It was like having been anesthetized."

Dr. Negovsky said that the first thing dead people lose is consciousness; and the last thing to recover after resurrection is consciousness. The patient does not know the beginning of death, so he knows nothing about everything after death.

Zhirimanov is one of the 51 dead people saved by Dr. Negovsky. So these people all died because their internal organs or limbs were seriously injured, and ordinary rescue methods were ineffective.

### Where Have the Fake Self-Defense Corps Helmets Gone?

— Cai Lin

During the period of occupation in this city, all the poor Shanghai citizens, in addition to bearing all kinds of exorbitant taxes, had to pay a "Baojia donation," and within the Baojia column, there were countless inexplicable donations. In short, nothing was spared, and everything from air defense and fire fighting to the tools used for mines, self-defense kiosks, and corps uniforms, all this was scraped from the people's heads, causing the people to be bruised and bleeding, and complaints were endless.

Many of the receivers after the victory seemed to focus on the big picture, thus ignoring the small things, just like the large number of self-defense corps helmets in the city mentioned in this article, which the public has completely forgotten, is this not sad?

Moreover, these helmets are now becoming waste, so why not use them? Besides, everything belonging to the public, whether it's a blade of grass or a tree, should be returned to the public without exception. What I mean is that this large number of helmets should be investigated by the military organs of this city, tasking the Baojia chiefs to pursue them, ordering those who hide them to hand them over, and those who have lost them must compensate according to the market price, because they are useless to the possessors, and many comrades in the army are still lacking helmets, so taking them back and returning them to the public is not troublesome, so why not do it?

A Few Words

### The Sale of Jiang's Case Materials Is a Long Way Off

— Wuling Ren

The High Court recently pronounced judgments on many traitor cases, with many sentences ranging from two to three years, which may have made many people feel relieved, but it must also have made many people feel chilled.

Boy Scouts at the North Railway Station persuade travelers to get vaccinations, even begging, which shows the low level of knowledge of the general public. Some people are afraid of trouble and small pain, but they are not afraid of life-threatening dangers, and some people are probably even unaware of the meaning of vaccination, which is even more pitiful.

The previous few hurricanes in the Pacific were fortunately extinguished, allowing Shanghai to avoid being attacked, but as soon as one wind disappears, another wind rises. Whether Shanghai can always be safe is still unknown. The news of hurricanes existing for one more day means that the people of Shanghai will have one more day of worry.

Regarding the materials involved in Jiang Gongmei's case, many of them have already rotted. According to reports, the authorities concerned "will draw up detailed methods in the coming days and present them to the commander for approval before unsealing and selling them." The news of the rot of Jiang's case materials seems to have been seen as early as two months ago, and now we are only hearing about the submission of the application for unsealing and sale, but "in the coming days," "will," "draw up," "present for approval"... it seems that it will have to go through several stages, and even if "approval is granted for sale," I am afraid that this batch of materials will have reached the stage of "waste utilization."

The wife of Wu Shibao, the demon of "No. 76," defended her deceased husband in court, saying that Wu had never fired a gun or killed anyone. Indeed, I also believe that Wu Shibao would not go to the execution ground to personally shoot "criminals."

### Dedicated to My Deceased Wife, Feng Jun (13)

— Zhou Shoujuan

Your spirit of urging me to work hard and showing consideration for the servants was something no ordinary housewife possessed. Every day you would rise before dawn, often ahead of Auntie Ye, first sweeping the bedroom. Then you would go downstairs to the kitchen, light the briquette stove, and then boil water to cook porridge, so that the children could get up, wash, and have breakfast without being late for teaching, studying, or work. When Auntie Ye went to the market for groceries, you would busy yourself selecting and washing rice, preparing everything in advance, and then have your own breakfast, sometimes even forgetting it and skipping a meal. Seeing that you ate little and had so much to do, and that you were working so hard, I always advised you to rest more. You would reply, "Auntie Ye can't manage everything alone. The children will be back for lunch, so I want to prepare everything early, so I can feel at ease." I couldn't convince you otherwise, so I had to let you be. After a short rest in the afternoon, you would busy yourself with needlework, putting on your glasses and working tirelessly, even mending our torn clothes and unraveling shoes and socks. Although the children had all grown up and wore leather shoes outside, the cloth-soled shoes they wore at home were all made by you. Over the past twenty-nine years, including those for my mother, you must have made thousands of pairs. Making the uppers was not considered difficult, but the fine, dense stitching of the soles was both laborious and time-consuming, even causing calluses to form between the two fingers that held the needle. In short, you were always trying to save me money and plan for me, day in and day out for twenty-nine years. As for entertainment, during these nine years of national crisis, it was practically nonexistent. Sometimes, because my mother, your mother, and your aunt all loved to play mahjong, you would reluctantly join in, which for you was simply an obligation and not entertainment.

Last winter, our family had already decided to move back to our old home in Suzhou. I repeatedly invited you to go out and see a technicolor movie and have a Western meal that you loved, but you declined time and again, saying, "Dear, save your money. Let me rest at home; you go by yourself." When you did go out, the farthest you would go was to your mother's house on Dihua Road. You wouldn't even venture into the Jing'an Temple area, saying, "Once I go there and see the dazzling shop windows, I can't help but spend your money." Once, the newspaper office sent over several thousand dollars in manuscript fees. I casually handed them to you, and you took them in your hands, and tears welled up in your eyes. You sobbed, "Dear, this is what you earned with your heart's blood over the past month. How can I bear to spend it?" I quickly said, "Writing this kind of article is easy, it doesn't take much effort. Besides, since you are so considerate of me, I would be willing to pour out my heart's blood!" After much persuasion, you finally accepted.
