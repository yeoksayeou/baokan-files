### Process of Resolving the Yining Incident; Minister Zhang Reports at the Second Plenary Session; Emphasizing Improving Politics to Stabilize Xinjiang

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] The fifteenth meeting of the Second Plenary Session was held at 10:30 AM on the 12th, after the memorial service for the death of Sun Yat-sen. 288 members attended. Zou Lu presided over the meeting, and Zhang Zhizhong made a report on the plan to resolve the Xinjiang issue, which lasted for one hour and thirty minutes. The chairman then reported on the review of the report on border issues, and committee member 麥斯武德 made comments before the meeting adjourned. Zhang's report first mentioned the Yining incident in Xinjiang, which occurred in July 1944 and gradually expanded until July of last year. He was instructed by the central government to go to Dihua twice in September and October of last year, accompanied by Liang Hancao, Deng Wenyi, and others. The Yining people's representatives 拉合木臣, 阿不都哈依爾吐烈, and 阿合買提 also came to Dihua to discuss. He then detailed the negotiations and the terms agreed upon by both sides to resolve the armed conflict peacefully. Regarding diplomacy, he emphasized that from the perspective of the entire country, especially from the perspective of resolving the Xinjiang issue, it is necessary to seek friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union with the utmost sincerity. Secondly, he discussed his opinions on governing Xinjiang, arguing that: (1) Except for national defense, diplomacy, currency, transportation, and judiciary, which should be handled by the central government, local autonomy, ethnic culture, and economic construction should be fully developed locally. (2) The importance of Xinjiang Province to the country should not be ignored. (3) One should not "nickel and dime" from a financial point of view. Regarding the railway from Xinjiang to Lanzhou, it should not be postponed indefinitely because the project is huge, the road is desolate, and it cannot be profitable. He also called on the General Assembly to pay great attention to Northwest transportation and quickly open up railways. His conclusion was: First, use the power of the Three Principles of the People to protect Xinjiang; second, use improved politics to stabilize Xinjiang; and third, use sufficient economic power to build Xinjiang. Zhang's report greatly moved the entire audience, and applause continued. Subsequently, the chairman announced the start of the review. Committee member 麥斯武德 from Xinjiang spoke, briefly stating: The people of Xinjiang need the country, and they also need their homes and houses. Xinjiang is the door to China, and the people of Xinjiang have been guarding this door for thousands of years, fulfilling their responsibilities. At the same time, they also hope that compatriots in the interior can consider the needs of the border people. I am willing to do my best to promote the connection between the border people and the central government. Finally, I would like to represent the border people and those who love Xinjiang: pay tribute to Minister Zhang. Editor's Note: The process of the Yining incident was detailed by this newspaper on the third page of February 9th and 10th, titled "An Outline of the Situation in Xinjiang" and "Prospects for a New Zhang," which can be used for reference.

### "Wang Mansion" Interior Scene

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in Nanjing, Shen Shi

Record of Talks with the Children of Traitors (Part 1)

Traitor Chen Bijun Willing to "Die"

Since the victory, no Nanjing news reporter has been allowed to see any of the captured traitors. Since the deportation of traitor Chen Gongbo, traitor Chen Bijun, and traitor Chu Minyi to Suzhou, the traitor concentration camp at No. 25 Ninghai Road here has lost the object of capturing the ringleader first, and everyone has stopped trying to find a way in.

Yesterday evening, this reporter received a phone call, which turned out to be an invitation from the Nanjing office of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, inviting us reporters to visit the handover of the property of Wang Mengjin, son of the traitor Wang Jingwei, and to visit the Nanjing residences of the traitors Wang and Chu. Unexpectedly, there was an unexpected harvest. Early in the morning, I rushed to No. 4 Chibi Road, where I was greeted by Wang Wenxun, the third daughter of traitor Wang Jingwei. During the conversation, I saw the following letter from traitor Chen Bijun in prison:

To the High Court, I will definitely not hire a lawyer. If I am sentenced to death, I will not appeal, in order to show that I am not afraid of death and that I am doing a peace movement for everything. All other slanders will be clarified without argument. I only hope that all comrades in the peace movement and those who have been affected by the peace movement will be released as soon as possible, otherwise the country will sacrifice too much. The government often pays attention to their individual cases and also often thinks of their families, because their families outside are actually more suffering than those who are detained. In the midst of sadness and poverty, the elderly turn to the ravines, and the young are forced into detours, which must be carefully considered.

"As for myself, I can afford to die, but I cannot afford to be imprisoned. Therefore, various diseases have occurred one after another in the past two years, and I have been fighting against the disease every day for six months. The cost of medicine is too high to be imprisoned for a long time. If I am not sentenced to death, then whether to appeal depends on the length of the prison sentence. It is best to die once and for all. The anger of the outside world is also vented, and comrades may be released because Chen Bijun's death has vented their anger. But no matter what, there is no need to support my family and my children. My personal and public wishes have been fulfilled, so I will not appeal after death."

The above words were written on an old sheet of rough-edged paper. The handwriting is scribbled, the ink is very light, and there are many strokes. According to Wang's daughter, this is a handwritten note that she obtained when she visited traitor Chen Bijun in Suzhou recently. Although she did not get to meet her, she regarded it as a treasure and was unwilling to show it to others. After repeated requests from reporters, Wang's son Mengjin's wife took it out of her handbag. After reading it, we felt that although it was full of high-sounding rhetoric, it was still valuable news material. Finally, we asked Wenxun whether she would follow her mother's orders. Wang's daughter said tactfully, "As children, we must consider the situation at that time before making a decision."

Wang Wenxun Selling Pillowcases?

No. 4 Chibi Road is one of the ordinary upper-class houses in the Nanjing residential area. It is said that this is a temporary rental after Wang's family was driven out of their residence at No. 34 Yihe Road. The furnishings in the house are very messy, but the messiness still does not lose a sense of wealth. Wang's family, except for Wang Jingwei himself who is dead and Chen Bijun who is imprisoned in Suzhou, are all imprisoned at No. 25 Xianhai Road: the eldest son Mengjin, the second son Wendi, the eldest daughter Wenxing, the eldest son-in-law He Wenjie, and a one- or two-year-old grandson. Currently, the only family members living with Wang's daughter are Mengjin's wife Tan Wensu and her two daughters, as well as Chu Minyi's eldest daughter Mengyuan and two so-called "classmates," accompanying them in their loneliness. Tan Wensu is a typical Cantonese woman, short, shy, and unable to speak Mandarin. Chu Mengyuan is rough, full of rural vulgarity, and deeply inherited from her father and mother. Therefore, our conversation partner naturally fell to Wenxun, the daughter of in the above.

Speaking of this Wang Wenxun, according to the impression we got after talking to her for 20 minutes, we feel that she is indeed worthy of being the daughter of in the above. 23 years old, graceful, graduated from the Education College of the Pseudo-Guangzhou University, independently ran a work-study society in Guangzhou, and went to Japan for medical treatment. She was also at the bedside when in the above died. She speaks fluent Beijing dialect, is eloquent, and speaks like a waterfall. At first, she answered the reporters' questions, but later she seemed to be giving a speech, greatly elaborating on her "late father"'s "peace movement." The conclusion is, "Chinese history likes to judge heroes by success or failure, but I always think that my late father was a failed patriot." In the meantime, a wave of her hand, a bend of her waist, countless gestures. According to senior colleagues familiar with Wang in the above, she is simply a living Wang Jingwei, but she resolutely refused to be photographed, saying that she had never been photographed. According to her, since the victory, she has almost searched every military and political leader who came to Nanjing for the destruction of her father's tomb, and also wrote the same five long letters every day, presenting them to Chairman Chiang by various means, with the aim of recovering the bones of Wang in the above. It is said that since Wang's tomb was destroyed on November 22 last year, the whereabouts of the dead bones have not been found. What is said is done, truly such a woman. For example, when the reporters said they wanted to see the Wang in the above spirit hall that her family enshrined, she made things difficult for us for a long time because of the so-called "due courtesy" issue.

### Second Plenary Session Commemorates Sun Yat-sen's Death; President Chiang's Personal Address; Encouraging Peaceful Struggle to Build a New China

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] The Second Plenary Session held a memorial service for the death of Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 AM today. President Chiang presided over the ceremony. After performing the rituals, he delivered a speech on the spot, first putting forward Sun Yat-sen's last teaching of peaceful struggle to save China when he died, believing that our current task of saving the country and building the country must take this last teaching as the center of our efforts. In other words, we must use peaceful methods to achieve our goal of struggle. On the one hand, we must be broad-minded, tolerant, sincere, and trustworthy. On the other hand, we must firmly believe in our revolution and nation-building. On the one hand, we must recognize the times and the environment, serve the people earnestly, and alleviate the suffering of the masses, so that the masses can recognize our sincerity in struggling for the country, and we can quickly unite as one to jointly work hard to solve the national crisis and complete the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People, so as not to fail the painstaking efforts of Sun Yat-sen's repeated teachings.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The heads of various institutions in Nanjing visited Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum at 8:00 AM on the 21st anniversary of his death. Chief of Staff Yi Su presided over the ceremony on behalf of the Army Headquarters. After all the participants performed the ceremony, they circled the coffin once and retreated. Citizens freely visiting Sun Yat-sen's remains were extremely enthusiastic. More than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life in Nanjing held a commemorative meeting for the Tree Planting Festival at the Dahua Theater in the morning. Secretary-General Chen Zuping of the Municipal Government announced at the meeting that the Municipal Government will formulate a ten-year afforestation plan, hoping that Nanjing will become a city with lush forests in ten years. After the meeting, the representatives went to Qingliang Mountain in the drizzle to plant trees. The Municipal Government plans to build a mountain forest park there, partly to commemorate the victory of the War of Resistance and partly to commemorate the first anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death after the victory of the War of Resistance.

[Another Dispatch] General McClure, head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China, went to Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum at 10:00 AM on the 12th to pay his respects and presented a wreath on behalf of all U.S. military personnel in China.

[United Press, Tianjin, 12th] General Lokey, commander of the U.S. Third Amphibious Force, entertained reporters here today on the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, comparing Sun Yat-sen to U.S. President George Washington and saying: "On this anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, the American people truly share your hope that a unified China will become the result of your efforts." Today's commemoration should also remind you of the important responsibilities ahead. I, along with all the personnel of the command, wish to commemorate with you and wish you success.

### President Song's Report

(Continued from part four, conclusion)

Full Efforts to Restore Transportation, Materials to Arrive Soon

Third, the response strategy is to restore transportation as quickly as possible. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the government placed the highest priority on restoring transportation. However, due to the presence of anti-government forces in various parts of the country, focused efforts were made to destroy railways and coal mines. Important railway lines north of the Yangtze River were repaired and destroyed repeatedly. Therefore, trunk lines such as Pinghan, Jinpu, and Longhai were never fully repaired. Now that the situation has changed, the Ministry of Transportation is working hard on restoration. Steel rails totaling 280,000 tons, four million sleepers, and 300,000 tons of cement have been ordered from abroad and will arrive soon. Regarding these materials, it is not that our country lacks the funds, but that various countries are competing to purchase them for post-war needs. Therefore, despite exerting great efforts, we can only transport them in batches, which is very different from the pre-war situation where supply was readily available as long as funds were available. Regarding ships, the total tonnage of ships along the coast and rivers of our country, including both Chinese and foreign, was 1.5 million tons. After this war, only a little over 100,000 tons remain. Therefore, water transportation is almost zero. After the end of the war, most of the ships owned by various countries are ocean-going vessels, and there are very few vessels for coastal and river navigation. Our country has already purchased them from various countries. The United States has a large number of ships, but because the United States selling surplus ships must be approved by Congress, the procedures take several months. The government has exhausted all means and has purchased and long-term leased a total of more than 370,000 tons of ships, some of which have arrived, and others are still on the way. We are now in the process of contacting and purchasing a large number of ships. At the same time, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is also leasing ships and purchasing landing craft to facilitate water transportation. In the past, Japan relied on the connection between the shipping industry and the textile industry to absorb a large amount of foreign exchange from abroad. Now that Japan has collapsed, our country's ships, in addition to domestic use, should not ignore the great source of wealth in the Nanyang transportation industry. Regarding roads, after eight years of hard fighting, many roads have been severely damaged. They are now being repaired by region. Most of the original trucks in our country are old and dilapidated. The government has now purchased 25,000 trucks, which can be transported in the near future. After that, road transportation can be gradually strengthened. The plan to increase and restore transportation has already been decided. After this, as long as we work hard to implement it, although this kind of work has time limits, we can hope that it will definitely improve day by day.

Opening Up Foreign Trade, Adopting Flexible Exchange Rates

Fourth, the response plan is to open up foreign trade. The official exchange rate set by the government is 20:1 for US dollars. This has been in place for many years. This ratio is completely divorced from the general market, so foreign trade has almost completely stopped. Recently, the Supreme National Defense Council passed the "Measures for Opening Up Foreign Trade" last Monday, and the Executive Yuan announced and implemented it on the same day. The main meaning is to temporarily adopt a flexible exchange rate. After a considerable period, a permanent exchange rate will be determined. Starting from the 4th of this month, the exchange measures have been decided and implemented. Now foreign exchange and all prices are showing a considerable decision. After the opening of foreign exchange, foreign trade can be smooth. All kinds of materials can be increased according to the needs of the people. The inflow of floating capital into the speculative market to promote price fluctuations can also be brought into the commercial track. Foreign raw materials and machinery can also be imported in a continuous stream due to the restoration of foreign trade, which can be used to match the development of domestic industry, which is enough to increase production and achieve the effect of stabilizing prices. Therefore, opening up foreign trade can stabilize people's hearts at home and guide investment abroad, giving our economic construction an important boost. I have never dared to express too many opinions on economics, finance, and finance, but I feel that the government's opening up of foreign trade measures is indeed certain. The quantity of our country's exports and imports can be based on pre-war statistics. Now that we have foreign credit loans, we can purchase a large number of things. There are also a large number of supplies for post-disaster relief. There is no doubt that the amount of exports and imports can be offset. I have heard people who do not understand the content say that the government's allocated 500 million US dollars of legal tender reserve can be used up in three months. I dare to say responsibly that the measures currently adopted can be maintained and used for a long time, and there is absolutely no danger of exhaustion.

Overcome All Difficulties and Establish an Economic Foundation

I believe that our party, led by the President, has won the victory of the War of Resistance and will definitely be able to lead the people of the whole country to move towards the road of construction. Now there is a plan to overcome the current economic environment. Although this plan is ordinary and requires a considerable period of time, it is indeed down-to-earth. I am convinced that if we use the same determination as the War of Resistance, we will be able to overcome all difficulties. We will be able to see some results in the next two months, and make more progress after four months. It is possible to lay the foundation for the preparatory work for national economic construction by the end of this year.

### Hull is Concerned About World Affairs, Calls on All Countries to Cooperate, There Should Be No Suspicion in the World Community

[United Press, Washington, 11th] Former Secretary of State Hull, in view of the world's unease, issued a statement today, calling on all countries to cooperate, recognizing this as the only way to maintain peace. It is said that the completion of the United Nations organization depends on the spirit of cooperation, and this spirit of cooperation is fundamentally related to the attitude of each country in the world community. In this kind of world society, there should be no suspicion and distrust among them. The relationship between the five major powers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France and China is particularly important. If these countries cannot recognize their common welfare, it will cause indescribable disasters. The current "impatience" between countries should be due to war fatigue. This spirit must be overcome by examining each other's views with compassion and patience. We who survived the gunfire must not allow mankind to tend towards suicide again due to lack of vision, selfishness, inability to tolerate each other, or provocative actions.

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Senator Connally, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said at a meeting of the committee today, advocating that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union meet again to frankly discuss various issues.

### Special Article: Personal Views on Principles for Revising the Draft Constitution

— Wu Shangying

The Political Consultative Conference has modifications regarding the constitutional provisions, established a Constitution Draft Review Committee, based on the principles of modification, taking into consideration the amended draft from the Constitutional Government Preparation Committee, the research results of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association, and opinions submitted from all sides; compiling and organizing these into a revised version of the May 5th Draft Constitution to be submitted to the National Assembly for adoption. As an expert, I participated in the Review Committee, and heard opinions from all sides, mostly focused on the two issues of the relationship between the National Assembly and the legislative and executive branches, with differing views on each. The significant reason for these differences lies in the acceptance or non-acceptance of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's theory of the division of powers, while superficially claiming to accept the legacy of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution. Amidst this ambivalent thinking, there is a difficulty in reconciling such positions. Furthermore, speaking practically, various political parties inevitably have their own vested interests, so the reason for modifying the May 5th Draft Constitution may lie in this rather than in other factors; hence it is dismissed as a political issue. Since there are so many contradictory facts among them, it is beyond what theory can reconcile.

Now, I ask to look at this issue with the most objective attitude, excluding partisan bias and emotion, and express some opinions as a reference. My humble thoughts may be deemed acceptable by the wise and virtuous of the party and the nation.

Regarding the chapters of the May 5th Draft Constitution concerning the National Assembly and the central political system, the Political Consultative Conference considers this type of system to be indirect democracy, which cannot achieve the purpose of democratic politics; therefore, it is proposed that the members of the Legislative Yuan should be directly elected by voters, with their powers equivalent to those of parliaments in democratic countries. The appointment of the President of the Executive Yuan should be nominated by the President and approved by the Legislative Yuan, and he should be responsible to the Legislative Yuan; if the Legislative Yuan passes a vote of no confidence against the entire Executive Yuan, the President of the Executive Yuan may either be dismissed or request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan. Whether this method is more appropriate than the original May 5th Draft Constitution should be comparatively studied. Now, I will mention the main points of difference:

(1) In the original May 5th Draft Constitution, the President, Vice-President, Political Councilors, Ministers of various ministries, and Chairmen of various committees of the Executive Yuan are appointed and dismissed by the President, and each is responsible to the President; and because the President is elected by the National Assembly, he is responsible to the National Assembly.

(2) According to the modification principles decided by the Political Consultative Conference, the entire Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan; and the Legislative Yuan is directly elected by voters, so when the Legislative Yuan passes a vote of no confidence against the entire Executive Yuan, the President of the Executive Yuan may either be dismissed or request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan, to show the intention of being responsible.

(3) In the May 5th Draft Constitution, the National Assembly has the power to impeach the President, Vice-President, and the Presidents and Vice-Presidents of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuans, as well as members of the Legislative and Control Yuan; because they are all elected by the National Assembly, the National Assembly has the power to impeach them, which expresses that each of these officials is responsible to the National Assembly.

Looking at the above points, the National Assembly in the May 5th Draft Constitution represents the people in exercising central governing power and has the power to elect and impeach central officials; when disputes arise between the executive and legislative branches, they can be resolved by impeachment when necessary. This does not damage the President's position and prestige, nor does it cause national affairs to fall into stagnation, and there is no concern about the government's position being unstable.

Now, according to the modification principles decided by the Political Consultative Conference, the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan; when the Legislative Yuan passes a vote of no confidence against the entire Executive Yuan, the President of the Executive Yuan may either be dismissed or request the President to dissolve the Legislative Yuan. When the Legislative Yuan is dissolved, it is necessary to hold another election; during the election period, political affairs will inevitably be in a state of stagnation, and the election is time-consuming, which greatly affects political affairs. Even in normal times, there will inevitably be political tides and unrest in the political situation. How is this better than the National Assembly exercising the power of impeachment, which can be resolved directly and quickly?

Those who advocate the method of no-confidence and dissolution as a balance between the legislative and executive branches argue that because the Legislative Yuan is a directly elected body, the Executive Yuan being responsible to it is closer to the ideal of democratic politics. However, in the May 5th Draft Constitution, both the President and the Legislative Yuan are elected by the National Assembly. Furthermore, the powers of recall, initiative, and referendum are all exercised by the National Assembly rather than directly by the people. The Legislative Yuan is responsible to the National Assembly, and the Executive Yuan is responsible to the President, all of which are indirect democracy and further away from the ideal of democratic politics.

We should know that what China needs most at the present time is political stability. Dictatorship and autocracy make the people dissatisfied and cannot seek the welfare of all the people; therefore, they cannot achieve the purpose of political stability. If there are political tides and the government is constantly in a state of unrest, it also cannot achieve the purpose of political stability. The experience of parliamentary disputes in the early years of the Republic of China can serve as a warning; therefore, the National Assembly system in the May 5th Draft Constitution may be different from parliamentary politics in Europe and America, and the exercise of civil rights may be indirect, but it generally reduces the risk of political tides and unrest in the political situation compared to the parliamentary system. At the same time, it can effectively supervise officials below the President, preventing it from degenerating into autocracy. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, after years of comparative research on the political systems of various European and American countries, came to this conclusion and established it as the Outline of National Reconstruction, which is worth careful consideration. There is no need to be rigid about European and American precedents and be trapped by prejudices, causing the mistakes of the early years of the Republic of China to be repeated.

Some say that the term of office of the National Assembly representatives in the May 5th Draft Constitution is six years, and in the fifth and sixth years, they can no longer reflect the correct public opinion at that time; this can be solved by shortening the term of office, or imitating the election method of the United States Senate, where a certain number of members are re-elected every one or two years, which can facilitate communication of public opinion. There are many ways to remedy this.

In short, there is no absolute perfection in political systems. The fundamental plan still lies in implementing local self-governance, cultivating the people's strength, and making them effective supporters of constitutional government, so that there can be hope for the path to democracy. The third clause of the Outline of National Reconstruction states: "Next is civil rights, so the government often guides the people's political knowledge and ability so that they can exercise their right to elect, their right to recall, their right to initiative, and their right to referendum." In the future, all parties and factions should jointly take responsibility for the arduous task of cultivating the people's strength and intelligence, and establish this democratic foundation, so that the implementation of constitutional government will have a bright future.

Speaking of the so-called terms "cabinet system" and "presidential system," the cabinet system originated in the United Kingdom, or is called parliamentary government, and the British often call it responsible government, where the majority party in the House of Commons organizes the cabinet to govern; its cabinet members are all members of the House of Commons, and they combine executive and legislative duties. When the House of Commons does not trust its policies or does not pass its proposed budget or other bills, the cabinet either resigns or requests the dissolution of Parliament to appeal to the national citizens for another election. This system gradually spread from the United Kingdom to the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Romania, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Greece. According to Garner, a professor of political science at the University of Illinois in the United States, in his book "Political Science and Government," the chapter on cabinet government states: "Even China and Japan have some elements of this system."

The so-called presidential system is practiced in the United States and is adopted by most Latin American countries. The powers and terms of office of the president are stipulated in the constitution; he has full power to select his administrative personnel (or can be directly called his administrative subordinates) without interference from Congress, but the appointment must be formally approved by Congress. All administrative personnel are responsible to the President; the President is the head of the executive branch and has the power to ask Congress to review the laws and budgets he proposes and to veto resolutions of Congress, but he has no power to dissolve Congress and order another election.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen praised the American presidential system a lot; his constitutional ideals were partly adopted from the American system, and the provisions of the May 5th Draft Constitution regarding the duties of the president are slightly tinged with American colors and have a basis. However, the American president has no power to dissolve Congress. If conflicts arise between the executive and legislative branches, the president can only use his prestige to appeal to the national people, such as giving public speeches everywhere, or using methods such as the "fireside chats" of the late President Roosevelt in recent years. Therefore, presidential government relies heavily on the president's personality and prestige. The National Assembly that Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated adopting, with the powers of election, recall, initiative, and referendum, to resolve conflicts between the executive and legislative branches, is precisely to remedy the shortcomings of the presidential system. The revisions to the principles of the National Assembly proposed by the current Political Consultative Conference really need to be reconsidered; it is no wonder that they have attracted the attention of domestic sages. However, there are criticisms of the May 5th Draft Constitution that are not entirely appropriate, such as the editorial in Ta Kung Pao on the 14th of this month, which even called the May 5th Draft Constitution the most undemocratic constitution, which is really lacking in consideration.

Or perhaps it is thought that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Five-Power Constitution can only be implemented in a one-party government, and when Dr. Sun Yat-sen decided on the principles of the Five-Power Constitution in the past, he may not have thought about the existence of multiple political parties in the country. Mr. Fu Sinian talked about using multi-party politics, and could not think of any other way besides parliamentary politics. I think there is no need to look at it this way. The National Assembly of the Five-Power Constitution is the highest organ representing the people in exercising central governing power; its members are elected by the national voters through universal, equal, and direct methods, and all parties and factions can freely compete in elections, so multi-party politics can be used, and it is not biased towards one-party politics.

Moreover, even more importantly, the political experience since 1946 has failed to achieve constitutional politics, not because of the existence or quality of the constitution, but because of whether the constitution can be effective. Some say that the constitution is not suitable for national conditions, so it cannot be implemented; to which one can only agree with a "yes, yes." May I ask, does the constitution stipulate that the president should publicly swear to uphold the Republic of China, and does that violate Chinese morality or is it not in line with national conditions, that Yuan Shikai dared to become the Hongxian Emperor? May I also ask, is serving the country and the people honestly and legally violating the teachings of our sages and worthies over thousands of years, is it not in line with national conditions, that the corruption of officials is heard every day? Our ancient sages said it well: "When the people are numerous, what more is to be added? Enrich them. When they are enriched, what more is to be added? Teach them." Now, our country has a population of 450 million, which is already numerous, but how many can avoid hunger and cold? Therefore, the government's first responsibility is to give everyone the opportunity to make a living. Guan Zhong said: "Only when the granaries are full can etiquette be known. It has never been heard from ancient times to the present that a people who are lacking can be governed." It is necessary to give everyone the opportunity to find food, and then one can talk about compulsory education, giving everyone the opportunity to be educated. When everyone has food and knowledge, they will naturally ask about politics and naturally reach the road of democracy. At that time, whether it is Yuan Shikai or any one of the 450 million compatriots, no one would dare to play the Hongxian trick again. Ordinary officials dare not be corrupt, and do not need to be corrupt; in the end, everyone must have food to eat first. The second clause of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Outline of National Reconstruction states: "The first priority of national reconstruction is the people's livelihood, so the government often cooperates with the people to jointly plan the development of industries to meet the four major needs of the people: food, clothing, housing, and transportation; to provide sufficient food, to promote the development of weaving to enrich the people's clothing, to build various types of houses according to large plans to make the people live happily, and to repair roads and canals to facilitate the people's transportation." The third clause talks about civil rights as the next priority. According to Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the people's livelihood comes first, so if the people have no food to eat, then civil rights have no foundation. This time, the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the joint declaration of our allies, and the loud cries of leaders and politicians of various countries also take raising the people's living standards as the first thing; indeed, the nation takes the people as its foundation, and the people take food as their heaven. Only by recognizing this purpose, implementing it, not engaging in empty talk, not covering up, and having all comrades of the party jointly pursue this goal to establish the foundation of democratic politics, can the ideals of the Three Principles of the People naturally become a reality; and the constitutional system will inevitably become better and better day by day. National peace can be expected, and world harmony can be achieved. The so-called freedom of belief, freedom of speech, freedom from want, and freedom from fear are all within it.

The Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption from Business Tax.

Wuxi suffered severe military disasters, and the city's houses were completely destroyed, which meets the requirements for exemption for three months. Therefore, the business community unanimously strives to achieve this goal.

Changzhou

The Former Director of the Puppet Jiangsu Political Affairs Department Was Detained. Xu Gui, also known as Xu Danchu, who once served as the Director of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Political Affairs Department, hid in Shanghai after the victory to avoid arrest. He then secretly came to Changzhou, residing in Baima Sansitu Street, changing his name to conceal his identity. Recently, the county government received a secret report that Xu was in Changzhou and ordered the political police to go to the address and arrest him. During the interrogation by the military law adjudicator, he confessed that he had served as a member of the Puppet Military Commission, a member of the First Front Army, a commissioner of the Fourth District of the Huaihai Province, and concurrently as the director of the political affairs office, the director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, and the director of the Political Affairs Department. After obtaining the confession, the county government dispatched police the next day to escort the suspect to the Jiangsu High Court for investigation.

Jiangyin

The Provincial Order to Purchase 50,000 Shi of Military Rice. Last year, the provincial government did not assign Jiangyin to purchase military grain because the county's order had not been restored and it had suffered the greatest sacrifices and losses during the War of Resistance. Now, the provincial government believes that the amount of grain collected from various counties is insufficient, so it telegraphed County Magistrate Fang to assign the purchase of 50,000 yuan, with the price set at 5,000 yuan per shi. Local people believe that this price difference is still limited compared to the rice price of more than 7,000 yuan last winter. Now the rice price is 23,000 to 24,000 yuan per shi, which is a huge difference. There is little surplus grain among the farmers at this time of year when the old grain is running out and the new grain has not yet arrived, and purchasing is very difficult. They request the provincial government to appeal.

Zhenjiang

The Provincial Government Held a Committee Meeting. The Jiangsu Provincial Government held its 17th committee meeting yesterday (10th), passing the organizational regulations for the provincial state-owned real estate administration and branch offices.

Several people from the "New Fourth Army" recently came to the Jinsha Second-Class Post Office in Nantong County, claiming to be ordered by the "Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government" to forcibly take over all the property of the post office and expel the staff.

Ningbo

Traitor Zhao Huchen Sentenced to Death. Zhao Huchen, a well-known traitor in this county, formerly worked in the puppet Ningbo Security Team, committing many evils that the people hated. After the liberation of Ningbo, he was arrested by the Zhenhai County Government and sent to the Sixth District Security Command. Commander Yu presented the case to the Provincial Security Command, which has now ordered that Zhao Huchen be sentenced to death for conspiring with the enemy and resisting the country.

Planting New Trees in Front of the Memorial Hall

At 10:10 a.m., in the drizzle, the memorial ceremony was held. Mayor Qian presided over the ceremony and gave a speech after the ceremony. He briefly stated: "The meaning of planting trees is very significant, not only does it enhance the beauty of the city, but it also helps the health of the citizens. In the past, during the period when the enemy and puppet occupied Shanghai, the trees in Shanghai were severely damaged by the enemy and puppet. The municipal government has already paid attention to this, so it has instructed the competent authorities to supervise the progress and ask the entire citizens to assist in promoting it." After the speech, he walked to the base of the Zhongzheng Memorial Hall amidst the melodious sound of military music and began planting. Mayor Qian planted the first juniper, followed by Deputy Mayor He, Deputy Commander Li, Chairman Wang Lin, each planting one tree. The Public Works Bureau also allocated several lawns in the park as places for the press, financial community, judicial community, and heads of various central agencies of the city to plant trees. A total of more than 300 trees, including cypress trees, poplar trees, locust trees, juniper trees, and French sycamore trees, were planted.

### The Prerequisite for Industrialization in Sichuan Province; The First Priority is to Solve the Transportation Problem; Sichuan Financier Yang Can San Speaks in Shanghai

(Reported by this newspaper) Yesterday, the reporter visited Yang Can San, a giant Sichuan financier. Yang is the chairman of Juxingcheng Bank. The bank has branches in various cities in the Yangtze River Basin. He himself has just come to Shanghai from the rear area. The main points of what he said are recorded as follows:

(1) Foreign Exchange: According to Yang, although Chongqing has also opened up foreign exchange, there have not been many applicants because the procedures are cumbersome. Inland floating capital has flocked to Shanghai, mainly because the call loan interest rate in this city is higher, and there are more ways to use funds.

(2) Construction of Sichuan Province: Plans for the construction of Sichuan had been advocated by people of insight such as Yang before the war. The prerequisite for industrialization is to solve the transportation problem. Although the highways in Sichuan Province can be said to be smooth, they are still heavily blocked to the outside world, making it difficult to import machinery. Even after industrial products are manufactured, transportation and sales will be very difficult. Sichuan is now concentrated with talent and has many raw materials, but it must wait until the transportation problem is resolved before it can move towards industrialization. It is expected that it will take at least several years before there is any progress.

(3) The Export Industry in the Yangtze River Basin: After the war, the people in the area were excited and eager to restore the previous export trade. Therefore, a large number of such enterprises were established in cities along the river, but the prospects are not optimistic. Currently, only pig hair can be exported in large quantities from China. The output of silk and tea has fallen sharply, and it is difficult to expect development until the transportation problem is resolved.

In summary, what Yang said is that solving transportation is the top priority of all problems. For example, it is not easy for the relief goods from the Relief and Relief General Office to arrive in Shanghai and to be transported to the inland. The inconvenience of transportation leads to a large difference in prices inside and outside, and the fluctuation of funds affects the entire financial situation.

### New Type of Gasoline Train to Operate from the 15th

Each vehicle has 68 seats and is currently only available for use by public officials or for sightseeing.

### The Yangtze River Water Level Rises Slightly; The Minzu Cargo Ship Departed Yesterday

Large ships on the Yangtze River line can gradually move. The Minzu and Jiangan were scheduled to set sail yesterday, but the Minzu set sail at about 2:00 p.m. yesterday due to the delay in loading fuel, and the Jiangan was rescheduled to depart this morning. The Minyu is scheduled to sail to Yichang on Friday morning, and will sail to Hankou on Saturday after the repairs are completed.

### Trucks Stole Copper and Iron; Bandits Fired Guns to Resist Arrest; Four Giant Transport Vehicles Were Intercepted; All Except Drivers and Laborers Escaped; Gunfire in Wusong Late at Night

The goods produced by the Zhonghua Steel Factory, a Japanese-owned factory in Xujiazhai, Zhanghuabang, Wusong, are mostly military supplies. After the victory, the出　　(likely referring to 接管: taking over) Committee sent personnel to take over. A lot of iron and steel raw materials were piled up in the factory. In recent months, there have been no less than ten thefts. The loss of machinery and property is heavy. The 9th squadron of the 3rd Battalion of the Wusong District Guard Corps is only two miles away from the factory. It sends out patrols every night to strengthen security. At about 7:30 p.m. the night before last, about 20 members of the Guard Corps were on patrol. At about 9:15 p.m., they saw a giant truck at the door loaded with a large amount of steel, driving out of the factory. The members of the Corps shouted for them to stop, but the bandits on the truck actually

Fired Guns to Resist Arrest. The members of the Corps returned fire, and fought for more than ten minutes, about forty or fifty rounds, without any casualties. The Xitangqiao Police Station to the south suddenly opened fire. Inspector Guo led all the police officers and arrived following the sound. Who knew that the bandits who fired the guns in the darkness had already escaped. Only No. 14363, No. 35681, No. 35741 were intercepted.

Three Transport Trucks and a giant Jeep truck No. 41056. Three Chinese drivers, Gao Jusheng, Zhang Jintao, Huang Shousheng, etc., and another White Russian named Demushafu, along with 14 laborers, were taken into custody at the police station. The next morning, they were sent to the Jiangwan Branch Bureau for verification. When the incident occurred, the Shanghai Municipal Management Bureau and the responsible branch bureau received telephone reports one after another and dispatched armed police vehicles to the countryside to suppress the bandits. Due to the rain and mud, they arrived at 11:00 p.m. The reporter went to the scene of the incident yesterday to investigate. According to Qian Jiafu, the squadron leader of the 9th squadron of the Guard Corps, and Jiang, the deputy captain of the squadron, the area is surrounded by

Warehouses everywhere. Theft cases occur frequently. They hold weapons and brazenly park several trucks in front of the door, then break in and tie up the guards one by one, move a large amount of materials, and drive away before dawn. The whole process is the same. According to Yu Jie, the director of the Jiangwan Branch Bureau, the facts are roughly the same, but one American-style Jeep car has been stolen and driven away by the American side, carrying some copper and iron. The remaining

Three Transport Vehicles are still stored here. The vehicles are probably rented from a transportation company. Since the police officers who investigated the theft have not yet returned, the full truth is not known. According to the arrested drivers, they only knew that they were going to the countryside to load wheat and did not know about stealing copper and iron. When asked whether the case would be sent to the Municipal Police Bureau or the Garrison Headquarters, it was said that the entire process of the case had to be thoroughly investigated before a decision could be made. The judicial authorities have been ordered to arrest the fugitives and bring them to justice.

### The U.S. Will Do Its Best to Provide Information; To Assist in the Trial of Japanese War Criminals

### Water and Wood Workers March in Procession to Petition, Tailoring and Fashion Store Employees Go on Strike, Posting Slogans and Assaulting Many

New Problems Arise After Department Store Labor Dispute is Resolved

(Our Newspaper Report) The labor unrest in the city's water and wood industries has intensified since two workers in Hongkou were mistakenly injured and killed by members of the Security Corps due to a conflict. Yesterday morning, workers in these industries formed a procession to petition, posting slogans along the way to attract attention from all sectors. In the afternoon, they also gathered for discussions at the Carpentry Workers' Union in the Nanshi district. To uncover the

True Story of the Labor Unrest, our reporter paid a special visit to a construction company yesterday. A representative explained the situation as follows: The workers' wages were originally 1,050 yuan per worker (excluding meals). After the cost of living rose sharply, the workers requested an adjustment in their pay and have held several consultations. Finally, on March 6th, representatives from the Construction Industry Association and the Water and Wood Industries Workers' Union reached a final decision together. From March 16th, the wage for carpenters was adjusted to 2,600 yuan per worker and the wage for plumbers was adjusted to 2,570 yuan per worker, both excluding meals. At the time, five representatives from the Workers' Union and nine workers signed the agreement. A notice was published in the Shenbao and Xinwen newspapers on March 9th, 10th, and 11th and a formal notification was sent to the Social Affairs Bureau for record. However, the workers were not satisfied and have not resumed work to this day. Moreover, the worker representatives have been avoiding meetings for some reason. The construction company believes that since the worker representatives were legitimately elected, the decisions they made are valid. Now, some workers are overturning the previous agreement and making new demands, which the company cannot accept. The matter is still pending arbitration by the Social Affairs Bureau.

Department Stores (Our Newspaper Report) Regarding the labor dispute involving Yong'an and the ten other major department stores, the Social Affairs Bureau decided that the maximum base salary for employees should be 60 yuan, calculated according to the cost of living index. Therefore, the companies were supposed to resume operations starting Monday. However, the management felt dissatisfied and intended to apply for further arbitration. Upon hearing this news, the employees gathered their representatives again yesterday and petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau. Director Zhang received them and stated that he would do his best to uphold the established principles.

Hotel Workers Due to the soaring prices of goods in the city, the hotel industry submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval to increase room rates by 40%. However, the industry has not increased workers' wages accordingly. This has led the workers' group representatives to question the union and demand that wages be increased in proportion to the room rate increase. The union immediately sent a letter to the industry association requesting a response. As of yesterday, the hotels had not taken any action on the wage issue. It is reported that the workers believe this is a deliberate delay and are planning to respond with a work slowdown.

Woolen Cloth Industry Labor Unrest (Our Newspaper Report) The employees of various woolen cloth and fashion stores in the city receive meals from their employers but no salary. They rely solely on commissions deducted from customers' custom-made clothing. Now, due to the soaring prices of goods, the employees are jointly demanding that the employers provide additional salaries and allowances. The terms are as follows: Employees of stores on Ma Road and Hubei Road should be paid wages in three grades: 40,000, 50,000, and 60,000 yuan. Employees of stores on Avenue Joffre and Route Say Zou should be paid wages in three grades: 50,000, 60,000, and 70,000 yuan. Employees of stores on Nanjing East Road and Nanjing West Road should be paid in three grades: 80,000, 90,000, and 100,000 yuan. After the employees submitted their demands to the stores on the 9th, the employers argued that the employees' commissions already exceeded these amounts and therefore could not accept the demands. Because their demands were not met, employees of dozens of stores, including Hongxiang Fashion Company, began a work slowdown yesterday.

### A Gang of Japanese Attempted Robbery, One Killed in the Act

The remaining three Japanese men were captured and taken back to the squad headquarters, reported to the battalion headquarters, and then transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for further investigation.

(Our Newspaper Report) At approximately 7:30 AM yesterday, at the temporary business office of the Victory Rubber Company at No. 261 Zhejiang Road, a bandit suddenly knocked on the door with a gun, falsely claiming to want to buy rubber. After being tricked into opening the door, the bandit immediately closed it and forced the apprentice Xu Shaoqiu to hand over the keys. At that moment, the store owner Li Meisheng arrived and knocked on the door. Alarmed, one of the bandits opened the door and fled first, while the other bandit also ran out, fleeing along Zhejiang Road to Hankou Road, turning west onto Guangxi Road. Li quickly followed in pursuit, shouting "Thief!" along the way. A passerby, Zhang Liangen, happened to be passing by and, upon hearing the shouts of "Catch the thief!", saw a man running towards him who looked suspicious. He bravely stepped forward and grabbed the man around the waist. The bandit, in a panic, pulled out a gun and fired two shots, one bullet hitting Zhang's left arm, causing him to fall near the entrance of the sanitation sub-office. The bandit eventually managed to escape. The injured Zhang was later sent to Renji Hospital for treatment in a police car.

### Weight Limit for Newsprint Mail Relaxed

(Our Newspaper Report) The Executive Yuan’s Temporary Office in Shanghai formerly instructed the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) to temporarily halve the original limit for airmail to the north from 400 kg per flight to 200 kg because of the large number of personnel arriving from the northeast to be transported. Because correspondence is important to the public and cannot be restricted, the post office temporarily stopped accepting newspaper mail starting on the 6th of this month. It has been learned that the Civil Aviation Administration of the Executive Yuan has sent a letter to CNAC, increasing the weight limit to 350 kg to serve both needs. The CNAC’s northern flights are only three times a week: two to Tianjin, one to Jinan. Each flight can only carry about ten passengers, but there are already over a thousand government employees registered to fly north, so limiting mail volume is still ineffective. It has been reported that a request is being prepared to the National Ship Allocation Committee to allocate more ships for transportation.

### Bank of China Continues to Supply Gold Bars, Market Gradually Stabilizing, Down 50,000 from the Previous Day

The gold bar market was extremely stable yesterday. Opening prices were flat, hovering around 1.7 million for a time. Market participants lacked enthusiasm, and long positions were also settled, falling to 1.64 million. Around 10:00 AM, prices struggled slightly at 1.65 million, and the Bank of China sold 340 bars at this price. Market participants, learning from the losses of the previous day, tightened their stomachs, and the market situation was therefore more stable. As of noon, prices were still hovering around 1.67 million, extremely sluggish. The afternoon was the same, with a lack of activity from all parties. Jewelers' quoted prices remained unchanged, and speculators disappeared. As a result, prices fell by another 50,000, with jewelry gold at 180,000 yuan, silver at 1,800 yuan, and silver dollars remaining unchanged. Black market trading was not active due to a lack of speculation, and demand was not great. Credit remained loose, with interest rates ranging from 1.5 to 1.8 cents.

Foreign exchange USD was mediocre. The capital reported a rise, and the opening was stable, struggling around 2,100 yuan. Importers favored telegraphic transfers to Hong Kong, and buying interest declined slightly. Later on, it consistently succumbed to around 2,060 yuan, with no significant changes. The afternoon was the same, with a relaxed trend. As a result, prices fell by another 50 yuan compared to the previous closing. Old Hong Kong goods were still stimulated by telegraphic transfers and rose by another 5 yuan. New goods were flat and weak, falling by another 2 yuan. US telegraphic transfers were not seen. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were between 430 and 450 yuan. Rupees remained at the original price of 540 yuan.

### Retail Investors Greedy for Cheap Bonds, Public Debt Slightly Rebounds

Public debt is still a target for retail investors. Regardless of the actual substance, floating funds are used as chips for speculation. This phenomenon will continue until after the principal and interest are formally repaid. During this period, there will still be general small accounts, voluntarily taking cheap positions. Type C opened at 1,450 yuan in the morning, and the lowest was 1,400 yuan. It hovered around 1,550 yuan for a long time. Ultimately, due to the stock market's resurgence and under the mobilization in the case, it rose again to 1,700 yuan before noon and then stabilized slightly. As a result, Type C bonds, which rose by 150 yuan, were the hottest, while the rest fell by 50 to 100 yuan.

### Several Issues Remain Before Stock Exchanges Reopen

[Our Newspaper's Report] It was reported yesterday that the city's stock exchanges will gradually resume operations, with the gold exchange taking the lead. Yesterday, this reporter revisited a relevant party, who informed us: the reopening of stock exchanges will still take some time. Firstly, the various companies still have a variety of procedures to complete. Furthermore, regarding the external shareholders of the former Public Association of All Industries, the issue of their legal status is still under consideration before the new Company Law is finalized and promulgated. As for the rumor that Mr. Yu Huancheng will assume the position of Chairman of the Board, there is indeed such talk. During a recent meeting of the directors and supervisors of the Securities Industry Association, Mr. Du Yuesheng expressed that he was physically weak and ill, and feared that he would be unable to continue serving as the Chairman of the Association. Given Mr. Yu's qualifications and reputation, he would certainly be competent for the role, but no decision was made at the time.

### Spot Cotton Market Continues to Rise

Yesterday, New York American cotton futures and spot prices fell by nine to thirteen points. The near-term price was US$26.90, the forward price was US$26.53, and the Mittineague spot price was US$27.32. The local cotton market continued to rise. However, due to the closure of the spot yarn market, most factories adopted a wait-and-see approach. The Jin Fang Jian Company purchased 200 bales of Mittineague cotton at a factory price of 90,000 yuan. Fellow traders purchased Pu Zi cotton seeds at a price of 19,000 yuan, an increase of 2,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The cotton cloth market remained sluggish, with buyers still taking a wait-and-see approach. The Jin Fang Jian Company continued to sell cotton cloth as usual yesterday.

### Refined Sugar Remains Tight

Due to the scarcity of sugar leaving warehouses, the market remained slightly tight. First-grade white sugar was offered at 53,000 to 54,000 yuan. The lack of stock of refined sugar led sellers to adopt a wait-and-see approach, and no transactions were made.

### Northern Goods Arrive in Large Quantities, Prices Fall

Three ships carrying northern goods from Tianjin arrived in Shanghai, totaling more than 15,000 pieces, causing market weakness. "Tong Shou Yuan" dates were offered at 40,000 yuan, and "Jiang You Tou Rong" sauce at 50,000 yuan, both lower than before, and there were very few buyers.

### Tea Market Transactions Scarce, Prices Stable

"Jing Ming Qi Qiang" tea has always been welcomed by local and out-of-town buyers, and its sales volume has been considerable over the years. The new crop is about to come onto the market before the Qingming Festival. Recently, traders have been gathering funds to absorb the new crop. Therefore, buyers are hesitant to move forward, resulting in sluggish transactions. As for prices, large dealers are still holding firm, but general small dealers are eager to sell, resulting in prices remaining stable for now, but the underlying support is weakening.

### Enemy Property Administration Distributes Cooking Oil

Entrusting Vegetable Oil Factories to Handle

The Shanghai Office of the China Vegetable Oil Material Factory has recently been entrusted by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration to handle the distribution of cooking oil for the first time.

### Fuel Problem is Severe: Restaurants Use Charcoal, Rice Husks Used at Cooked Water Shops

The coal market at 405 Tianjin Road was previously ordered by the authorities to prohibit illegal trading, otherwise, severe punishment would be imposed. The industry association issued strict notices informing everyone. However, hoarding and price gouging could not be avoided in practice. Recently, many coal shipments have been transported to Shanghai, mostly from Qinhuangdao in Shandong and along the Yangtze River. Most of them are bituminous coal, followed by white coal and coal dust. On average, about 15,000 to 20,000 tons arrive each week. Therefore, the coal reserves in this city have gradually become sufficient. However, it needs to be widely distributed to meet market needs. Since the market price of coal has repeatedly risen, the general public has been severely threatened. Restaurants, cooked water shops, and bathhouses are particularly hard hit. It is now learned that most restaurants have switched to burning charcoal (steel charcoal), and cooked water shops have switched to burning rice husks to reduce costs. According to unofficial estimates, the current daily consumption of steel charcoal is around 300 "dan," and the daily consumption of rice husks is around 7,500 "dan." Steel charcoal costs 7,000 yuan per "dan," and rice husks cost 2,500 yuan per cart.

### Fuel Control Committee Orders Dyeing and Weaving Industries to Register Factory Coal Usage

The registration forms have been distributed by the association to the manufacturers, who should fill them out truthfully as soon as possible. Those who have not yet started work should apply for a delay in handling coal allocation. (Wu)

### Yuan Nails Fall Back

Last week, the price of domestic "yuan" nails rose due to enthusiastic purchases by Hankou buyers, causing some price bubble, which pleased traders. However, this was a fleeting moment, and prices soon fell back. Each barrel fell by about 20,000 yuan. Currently, 4-point nails sell for 110,000 yuan, 5-point nails sell for 100,000 yuan, 6-point nails sell for 90,000 yuan, 1-inch nails sell for 75,000 yuan, 1.5-inch nails sell for 68,000 yuan, 2-inch nails sell for 65,000 yuan, 2.5-inch nails sell for 63,000 yuan, and 3-inch nails sell for 60,000 yuan.

### Speculative Funds Concentrate on Chinese Stocks, Wing On Cotton Mill Breaks 4,000 Barrier

After the initial stabilization, Chinese stocks became popular, and the situation was heated. After the gold market was controlled, speculative funds concentrated on stocks. Wing On Cotton Mill rose from 3,400 yuan, Mei Ya from 2,500 yuan, and Jingfu from 155 yuan, gradually increasing. The afternoon closing slightly retraced after the gains. Compared to the previous closing, Wing On Cotton Mill and Mei Ya each rose by 200 yuan, and Jingfu rose by 20 yuan. New Guang actively participated, and Dong Xing did not want to be left behind, each rising by 5 yuan, but it was difficult to buy. In the afternoon, those with next-day delivery were further pushed up. Wing On Cotton Mill rose to 4,100 yuan, Mei Ya to 3,150 yuan, and Jingfu to 200 yuan. The underlying sentiment was remarkably bullish. Since foreign stocks closed earlier, the various stocks in the afternoon were slightly lower than the previous closing, and the situation was confusing.

### China Textile Construction Company's Daily Output: More Than 10,000 Bolts of Cotton Cloth and 43,000 Bales of Yarn

Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs transferred the puppet textile factories to the China Textile Construction Company for takeover, it has been actively restoring production. According to the company, it currently has 20 units of factories taken over. Except for a small portion that is still being sorted out, 17 units are currently in full operation, including: Factory No. 1 and 2, Factory No. 5, Factory No. 7, Factory No. 9, Toyota Factory No. 1 and 2, Japan-China Factory No. 3 and 4, Japan-China Factory No. 5, 6 and 7, Japan-China Factory No. 8, Tongxing Factory, Dakang Factory No. 1 and 2, Shanghai Factory No. 3, Shanghai Factory No. 4, Shanghai Factory No. 5, Yufeng Yarn Factory, Mingmeng Yarn Factory, Gongda Factory No. 1, and Hengmeng Yarn Factory.

The daily output of cotton yarn is more than 43,000 bales, mostly 20s, 32s, and 42s yarn. Other products such as socks and military blankets are also produced, but they account for only a small number.

### Group Procurement is Gradually Being Launched

Since the restoration, due to various obstacles such as transportation and finance, the source of materials is severely insufficient, resulting in soaring prices and shrinking production. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs previously issued an order to various industries, advocating group procurement to remedy the situation. Assistance is being provided for transportation and capital turnover. It is learned that many industry associations are very sympathetic and are forming "procurement groups" to equip themselves with vehicles and ships to transport materials. They are also applying to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and relevant agencies to facilitate the transportation of raw materials and goods needed by various industries from various regions, for the use of the industry members. It is reported that dozens of industry associations such as beans and rice associations are already working on it.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Daily necessities: Candles slightly hardened due to absorption by buyers, but soap and matches had few transactions.

Cigarettes: Sales were sluggish. Except for the British American Tobacco brand, which remained stable, the others all fell.

Western medicines: The market was quite tight. After the Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory temporarily stopped shipping goods, people were optimistic about the future.

Education and Sports

### US Education Committee Suggests Revising Doctoral Degree Procedures

[US News Agency, New York, 11th] According to the New York Times, the US Education Committee recently suggested revising the procedures for obtaining a doctoral degree and actively improving the facilities of US university graduate schools, so that students engaged in advanced academic research can obtain greater convenience. Hollis, a senior expert at the US Education Office, conducted an investigation into the work of graduate schools. He pointed out that US higher education institutions' graduate schools are not well-managed. Hollis' report emphasized that US graduate schools generally produce too many narrow-minded experts, whose education is limited to adapting to professional technical skills. According to Hollis, research training rarely allows students to obtain a rich personal and social life within their professional scope.

(Criticizing Doctoral Dissertations) He suggested that research work should originate from the scholar's personal and professional interests. Doctoral dissertations that are only made to meet degree requirements do not contribute to scholarship and may even narrow the education they receive. Dr. Hollis analyzed the records of 22,509 people who received doctoral degrees between 1930 and 1940 and found that 65% held teaching positions in universities, 20% were engaged in industrial research, 10% worked in government agencies, and 5% taught in schools below the university level. 13% of doctoral recipients had jobs unrelated to their training or did not require higher education knowledge. A total of 27% entered careers outside of education. According to the results of Dr. Hollis' interviews with the employers of these doctoral recipients, they all agreed that greater attention should be paid to the personality of the students when selecting and training them.

(Not Limited to Intellectual Training) They emphasized that the ability to cooperate with others and develop a normal sensitivity to social responsibility are as essential to career success as specialized skills. Dr. Hollis concluded that in the next ten years, society will need fewer doctoral graduates, but those with more sound education and capable of practical work. He specifically suggested that the scope of future doctoral training should be broadened, and not limited to intellectual training.

### The Pain of Being Without a Country! Changchun Student Representatives Arrive in Peiping to Speak Out

[Dahua News Agency, Peiping News] More than 500 male and female students from eight schools including the Changchun Military Officers' School in Northeast China have arrived in the city of Peiping after traveling through mountains and rivers and risking their lives. There are more than 30 people in Tianjin, and most are stranded in Jin County. According to representatives of various universities in Northeast China who came to Peiping, before the victory, most university students were forced by the enemy and puppets to serve in various places. After August 15, transportation could not be restored for a while, so the students were scattered. After that, they gradually gathered in Changchun. In early September, the students themselves organized remedial schools, and the University Alliance was established afterwards.

Unanimous Decision to Retreat

Unexpectedly, the Northeast issue became increasingly complicated. After a meeting, more than 500 students unanimously decided to make a general retreat from Changchun to Peiping. Early in the morning of the 20th of last month, they went to Shenyang by car in batches and arrived in the evening. Because the land that the National Army could truly control was still in Huanggu Village, they moved to Huanggu Village in batches. Then they took a bus to Jin County, where the Northeast Security Command prepared food and accommodation. Due to various difficulties, only a few could come here one after another. They have now contacted the special envoy of the Ministry of Education in the Northeast region, who said that the Northeast Provisional University Remedial Class will be established in Jin County, so students staying in Jin County can stop their journey. The main purpose of their trip to Peiping is to hope that the authorities can give them appropriate jobs, and the second is to obtain travel documents.

Unwilling to Be Slaves Again

The students have suffered all kinds of hardships for fourteen years and deeply feel the pain of being without a country. They will never be slaves again in the future, and they swear not to give up the rich treasures hidden in the black waters and white mountains of Northeast China. Many students in Northeast China

Organized armed groups to deal with lawless troops, and some students covered the landing when the National Army was stationed, which proves the students' patriotism in Northeast China.

### A Tragic History of Education: Principal Disappears Because the School's Life Cannot Be Maintained

[Our Newspaper, Xianju News] Xianju County's Simple Normal School has been exempted from the county's land tax, and the school's student public rations are not available. Since the start of school, very few students have come to school. The salaries of teachers and staff are meager, and the teachers who have been hired have gone elsewhere. Wang Xiangji, the principal of the school, has repeatedly requested the county government to find a way to remedy the situation, but it has not been resolved. The county government gives the school a collection on behalf of the government for the student food and food meter. The monthly salary of the teachers and staff is set by the county government to be between 10,000 and 16,000 yuan. If this is not followed, the county government will not give advice on the monthly salary of the teachers and staff. The principal felt that it was so difficult to handle and could not maintain it. He continued to ask the county government to resign, but he was not allowed. Unexpectedly, on the first day of this month, the principal suddenly disappeared and there was no news. According to his eldest daughter, her father (the principal) never stayed out at night in his life. At 2 pm that afternoon, he claimed that he had something to do on the street, and he never returned. There is no news. She also said that when her father left, he did not bring any luggage, and he had no money with him. He also left three letters of farewell: one to his grandfather, which said: "Father! Your unfilial son feels that it is necessary to leave the world forever. Please don't worry about it. Take good care of your daughter-in-law's womb. Written by your son Ji." One to his colleagues in the school, which said: "Directors of Training, Education, and Affairs: I, because I am incompetent in handling school affairs, therefore say goodbye to you. Before the county government sends someone to take over, please ask the three directors to take care of it and don't feel sorry for my misfortune. Wang Xiangji wrote." One was given to the county government and presented with an official letter, which was his final letter of resignation. Therefore, after the principal disappeared, his family asked the gods for help, making a tearful scene and searching everywhere, but his whereabouts were unknown. It is feared that there are more bad luck than good. (Yu)

### Tongji University, with Thirty-Nine Years of History (Part 1)

— Huang Kainan

When one mentions Tongji University, what first appears in people's minds is a tense picture: in Tongji's unique-style practice factory, young people of different appearances, during different practice times, wield different tools, operate different machines, wear blue workers' clothes, covered in oil stains, sweating, personally and steadfastly engaging in arduous practice. In the classroom, in the dissection room, or in the self-study room, even in today's tea houses, sturdy young men, holding different reference books and almost identical instruments, are tensely, quietly, burying their heads to study alone.

(Relocated to Lizhuang, Sichuan after the war) Lizhuang is in a relatively large valley. The river flows out of the valley in the northwest corner, as if bidding farewell to Lizhuang, lingering affectionately in front of Lizhuang to form a large bay, and then flowing torrentially towards the east, towards her—the old home to which Tongji will return. Behind Lizhuang are mountains, and across the Yangtze River are also mountains. It has tranquil fragrance and beautiful sweetness. In addition to Tongji, there are the Institute of History of the Academia Sinica, the China Museum, the Geodesy Group of the Institute of Geography of the Academia Sinica, and a part of the Institute of Social Sciences of the Academia Sinica. It is about a thousand li away from Chongqing, making it the most suitable place for scholars to conduct research. During the War of Resistance, there was never a report of [空], so Tongji was never disturbed by old reports.

Tongji already has thirty-nine years of history. But Tongji has never been involved in any disturbances, nor has it participated in any off-campus activities. Tongji's consistent school spirit is "hard work with head down." Students are never willing to spend any time shouting meaningless empty slogans, like a pond of lake water, forever quiet to external things. When spring comes, it is like this; when summer comes, it is still like this. When swallows come to seek the traces of "spring" in autumn, the swallows must still ask this quiet green water. Before the War of Resistance, it was like this in Wusong; after the War of Resistance, after the baptism of gunfire, it is still like this now west of the Yangtze River, and it has become even more silent.

(Absolutely No Welcoming or Sending Off Any President) An old professor of Tongji once said in a public lecture: "Today (at that time, during the War of Resistance), the country is in such difficulties, yet it still allocates a large portion of funds for us to study. We should work harder, we should carry forward Tongji's school spirit, we must work hard, work practically, work quickly, work toughly..." Several consecutive "work" characters moved the students' "hearts" to just beat faster. Over the decades, Tongji has had many changes of presidents, but students have never retained any president, nor have they chased away any president. Moreover, when any president first came to the school, no students welcomed him, or held a welcoming meeting after his arrival. Every student's heart, since stepping over the threshold of Tongji, has deeply engraved a seal of "practical work, hard work, tough work," and decided to study, so first study well before anything else. The students' hearts are always entirely placed on books, in the factory, or in the laboratory. The students' hearts are always as sincere and simple as farmers.

### The Bridge Between British and Soviet Spheres of Influence: A Keynote of New International Relations - A Review of the Turkish Question

Special Article of This Newspaper, Translated from the British Royal Institute of International Affairs’ "The World Today" Monthly

Turkey is in reality a bridge between the spheres of influence of Great Britain and the Soviet Union. The changes in the Turkish political situation have a significant relationship with all countries in the world and can be used to see to what extent a true understanding has been reached between Great Britain and the Soviet Union. Since the 19th century, the Turkish Straits and the Transcaucasian border have become a touchstone of international relations: The Straits reveal the relations between the great powers, and the Transcaucasian border reveals the relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey. In other words, according to historical precedent, the Transcaucasian border only becomes a 'problem' when friction has occurred between the Soviet Union and Turkey due to the Straits issue. This problem has always been a major point of contention in Soviet-Turkish relations, and it has become more complicated due to the interference of Western countries for their own conflicting interests.

Based on this, the recent territorial claims made by the Soviet Union regarding Kars and Ardahan (Note: According to the Turkish Foreign Minister's broadcast on January 17, the Soviet side has not formally made a request to change the territory.) and the even more excessive territorial demands along the Black Sea coast made by a professor at the University of Georgia can be interpreted as diplomatic pressure exerted by Moscow to force Turkey to accept the Soviet Union's views on revising the

'Montreux Convention Regarding the Straits'

In any case, it is very clear that a kind of war of nerves is currently underway between the Soviet Union and Turkey, of which border demands are only a part. At the same time, the Transcaucasian territorial demands must be regarded as part of the general problem of the Middle East and related to other aspects of Soviet policy in this region, especially its desire for security on its back door.

As for the Straits issue, the revision of the 'Montreux Convention' should be decided jointly by all countries, and not just by the Soviet Union and Turkey themselves. But the Soviet Union is a powerful country, and it has at least some power to promote international cooperation. Now Turkey has to play a passive role. On this point, the Soviet Union argues that Turkey chose this passive role herself during the war, and that Turkey's neutrality was very beneficial to Germany. Turkey's neutrality was defended by President İnönü in a speech at the opening ceremony of the National Assembly on November 1, 1945, in which he emphasized that Turkey had rejected Germany's request to approach the Middle East and the Soviet Union's Caucasian border, and that Turkey had faithfully fulfilled the 'Montreux Convention'.

Ukraine suffered heavy losses in this war and cannot withstand foreign attacks. In order to ensure the security of its back door, the Soviet Union considers the

Old Foundation of Soviet-Turkish Relations

to be very unsatisfactory, so on March 19, 1945, it publicly criticized the 'Soviet-Turkish Treaty' signed in 1925. At that time, the Soviet Union issued a formal statement declaring, "The Soviet government recognizes the value of the Soviet-Turkish Treaty signed on December 17, 1925, in maintaining friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey, but believes that we must pay attention to the fact that the current situation has changed greatly, especially during the Second World War. Therefore, this treaty is no longer suitable for the times and urgently needs to be fundamentally revised." During a meeting between the Soviet ambassador and the Turkish Foreign Minister in June, the Soviet government seemed to have proposed three preconditions for signing a new treaty: (1) Kars and Ardahan, which were ceded to Turkey in 1921, should be returned to the Soviet Union; (2) The Soviet Union should be allowed to establish bases in the Black Sea Straits and participate in the defense of the Straits; (3) The 'Montreux Convention' should be revised. In July, the Foreign Minister returned home from San Francisco, passing through London, and sent a memorandum to the British government and a copy to the US government, explaining Turkey's views. Turkey stated that as long as its sovereignty is not infringed and its security is not threatened, it is willing to guarantee the free passage of ships of all countries through the Straits under international supervision. At the same time, it expressed the hope that Soviet-Turkish relations should also be resolved together to avoid future disputes. President İnönü and Prime Minister Saraçoğlu both expressed their reactions to the territorial demands made by the Soviet Union in strong tones: "Turkish territory will never be allowed to be ceded to anyone; we were born in glory and will die in glory." President İnönü said this on November 1. Then, on January 6, Prime Minister Saraçoğlu cited recent historical records and population figures from Kars, Ardahan, and the Black Sea coast to refute the territorial demands made by the Soviet Union.

At the Potsdam Conference, a resolution was passed that the three powers should separately discuss the revision of the 'Montreux Convention' with the Turkish government. The United States (on November 2) and Great Britain (on November 23) subsequently proposed revisions to Turkey, but the British and American proposals did not include major changes. This topic was not formally discussed at the London Foreign Ministers Conference or the recent Moscow Conference.

If we observe with a long-term perspective, then the various political actions that occurred last year are difficult to explain according to current views, because due to the invention of atomic weapons, the true value of all classical

Strategic Fortresses

has been completely changed. The Soviet Union's actions can only remind people of 19th-century strategies.

The Soviet Union's attention to the Straits can be traced back to the decline of the old Ottoman Empire and the expansion of Russian power towards the Black Sea. Before 1774, the Black Sea Straits were completely under the control of the old Ottoman Empire, but after the 'Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca' was signed in 1774, the Russian Empress Catherine the Great obtained a special permit from the Turkish side to allow Russian merchant ships to pass through the Straits. Since then, the authority of the old Ottoman Empire has been declining day by day. If it were not for the intervention of the Mediterranean and European countries (especially Great Britain), Russia could have obtained a special permit to allow warships to pass through the Straits into the Mediterranean Sea earlier. After Russia obtained this privilege, Western countries followed suit, imitating Russia and bullying the weak Turkey. Austria, Great Britain, France, and Prussia subsequently obtained special permits from Turkey, allowing their merchant ships to pass freely through the Straits. The Russo-Turkish War of 1829 ended with the signing of the 'Treaty of Adrianople', which recognized Russia's sovereignty over Georgia and the Caucasus provinces, and all neutral merchant ships were free to navigate the Black Sea and the Danube River.

Because the wheat-producing areas of southern Turkey became increasingly important, its Black Sea commerce also expanded accordingly, and the ports along the Black Sea coast were all ice-free ports, prompting Russia to intentionally establish a Black Sea fleet, which should have the right to freely pass through the Straits, but not allow other countries along the Black Sea coast to set foot in the Black Sea. By means of conquest, or by making the Turkish Emperor fall into a protected position, or by using peaceful means to allow the great powers to divide this declining old Ottoman Empire, Russia could thereby obtain control of Constantinople and place the Straits under Russian administration. These plans for territorial expansion were opposed by Great Britain, Austria-Hungary, and Germany, especially Great Britain, because the eastern Mediterranean was a lifeline for British-Indian communications and was of paramount importance to Great Britain. Therefore, Great Britain adopted a blockade policy, prohibiting all warships from passing through the Straits, and confining the Russian fleet in the Black Sea. Subsequently, Russia and Turkey resumed diplomatic relations and signed the 'Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi' in 1833, authorizing Russia to send warships through the Straits so that Russia could fulfill its mission to Turkey. Thereafter, according to the terms of the 'Quadruple Alliance of Great Britain, Russia, Prussia, and Austria' in 1840 (later France also joined in signing), foreign warships were again prohibited from passing through the Straits. Turkey at that time had no right to allow any national warships to pass through the Straits as an exception. Moreover, this prohibition could not be modified without the consent of the signatory countries. At this point, Russia recognized that

the Straits issue concerns all of Europe

and that the Russo-Turkish dispute is not just a matter between the two countries themselves. After Russia's defeat in the Crimean War, it was not allowed to build another fleet in the Black Sea, nor to establish munitions factories along the Black Sea coast, and was forced to cede Southern Bessarabia (Treaty of Paris in 1856). Tsar Alexander II was determined to break these shackles and took advantage of the Franco-Prussian War to first abolish the provisions concerning the Russian fleet. At the London Conference in 1871, the great powers agreed to abolish the veto power and guarantee the independence and integrity of Turkey. In order to achieve this goal, they authorized the Turkish Emperor to allow foreign warships to pass through the Straits, even in peacetime. As a result of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, Russia recovered the territory it had lost under the 'Treaty of Paris'.

At the same time, the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 caused Great Britain's policy to begin to change, and then Great Britain acquired Cyprus in 1878 and obtained a strategic base in Egypt, so its policy became more active. The expansion of German power in Turkey and the Anglo-Russian alliance (1907) concluded due to changes in the European balance of power also forced Great Britain to change its policy. It now advocated that the Straits should be opened and that warships of all countries should be free to pass through the Straits. However, before 1918, the Straits were still under Turkish administration. During the Italo-Turkish War of 1911-1912, Russia

felt serious difficulties

because 50% of its maritime exports needed to pass through the Straits.

Similarly, during the Great War of 1914-1918, the closure of the Straits by Turkey caused Russia to lose contact with the Western Allies, which also resulted in considerable losses. In view of the impending crisis of military defeat, Great Britain and France expressed their understanding to Russia, and were willing to give it all the privileges that Russia had not been allowed to enjoy in the 19th century. Before the Dardanelles expedition began, Great Britain, France, and Russia secretly signed the 'Constantinople Agreement' on March 18, 1915, stipulating that if the Allies were victorious, Russia should occupy all of Constantinople, both sides of the Bosphorus, the line from Southern Thrace to Enos-Midia, Imbros, Tenedos, and certain islands in the Sea of Marmara. However, the Soviet leaders, after overthrowing the Kerensky Provisional Government, issued a formal declaration in October 1917, opposing all forms of annexation and imperialism, and rejecting all secret treaties signed by the Russian Emperors.

After Russia withdrew from the European War and Turkey collapsed, the administration of the Straits passed into the hands of the Allies. Allied troops occupied the strategic points along the Straits until 1923, when the Straits were placed under the jurisdiction of an international commission according to the provisions of the 'Treaty of Lausanne', and the armaments on the Bosphorus, the Dardanelles, and the islands in the Sea of Marmara were removed. Merchant ships were allowed to pass freely through the Straits, whether in peacetime or wartime. Warships could also pass through in peacetime, but the number of ships of any country was limited to no more than the Black Sea fleet. In a war in which Turkey was a belligerent, neutral warships and merchant ships would be responsible for their own safety when passing through the Straits. The Soviet representative attending the Lausanne Conference expressed his dissent when signing the treaty, and the Soviet government refused to ratify it. The Soviet Union argued that warships should not be allowed to pass through the Straits, whether in peacetime or wartime, but the Western countries wanted the Straits to be completely open. The result of the mediation was to bring the Soviet Union and Turkey together to jointly oppose the Western countries. The 'Soviet-Turkish Treaty' was signed on December 17, 1925, establishing a new friendship between the two countries (this treaty is the one that the Soviet Union recently repudiated). According to this treaty, neither country should take hostile action against the other if attacked by a third country.

The two countries agreed to maintain neutrality

In the following decade, the young Turkish Republic reached a consensus with the Western countries. In 1933, when Turkey felt confident of the support of itself and the Soviet Union, it dared to propose revising the 'Treaty of Lausanne'. It was not until 1936, when the League of Nations failed to effectively intervene in the Italo-Ethiopian conflict and Germany's reoccupation of the Rhineland, that the Western countries recognized that the guarantees provided by the 'Treaty of Lausanne' were not sufficient and should not weaken Turkey's sovereignty over the Straits. Therefore, according to the 'Montreux Convention' signed on July 20, 1936, Turkey was able to rearm the Straits area, abolish the International Commission, and fully restore Turkish sovereignty. In peacetime, and in wars in which Turkey remained neutral, merchant ships of all countries were free to pass through the Straits; in peacetime, the movements of warships were restricted (which was entirely beneficial to the Soviet Union); and in wars in which Turkey remained neutral, warships of any belligerent country were not allowed to pass through the Straits.

The opinions of Great Britain and the United States are that, apart from the period in June 1944 during this recent war, when the Allies criticized Turkey for allowing German armed merchant ships to escape into the Aegean Sea through the Straits, Turkey can be said to have faithfully fulfilled all its responsibilities under the 'Montreux Convention'. The Soviet Union does not agree with this view, believing that Turkey's neutrality was beneficial to Germany. Great Britain and the United States seem to believe that the 'Montreux Convention' only needs to be adapted to the new era and linked to new international institutions, and that its specific provisions should be slightly revised to conform to new naval technology, which is enough. The Soviet Union believes that its entire foundation (that is, Turkey's complete sovereignty over the Straits) should be changed. The general opinion in Great Britain today is that the 'Montreux Convention' is good enough in peacetime, and that any agreement is useless in wartime, so the most important thing is to prevent war. This seems a bit like empty talk to the Soviet Union, because its borders have proven to be weak and unreliable in the past, and it is stubbornly

seeking border security

Turkey's opinion on the issue of weakening its sovereignty has already been mentioned earlier. According to the 'Tripartite Treaty' signed on October 19, 1939 (valid for 15 years), Great Britain and France should both bear certain responsibilities for Turkey. From this brief description of the history of the Straits issue, we can see that the current situation is not a new event at all, and its origins have been around for a long time.

The Transcaucasian border issue has played a relatively minor role in the past, although this dispute has a history of more than 70 years between the Soviet Union and Turkey. After the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, according to the provisions of the 'Treaty of San Stefano', Turkey should cede the provinces of Ardahan, Kars, Batum, and Bayazid to Russia. However, after the intervention of the great powers, the 'Treaty of Berlin' replaced the 'Treaty of San Stefano', returning Bayazid to Turkey, but recognizing the cession of Batum, Kars, and Ardahan in place of the huge indemnity that Turkey was unable to pay. This transfer of territory did not pose a problem, whether based on ethnological arguments or according to the wishes of the local residents. Subsequently, according to the provisions of the 'Treaty of Brest-Litovsk' in 1918, this territory was re-ceded to Turkey, but the current border was not finally determined until 1921. During this period, the Allies, relying on their control of the Straits, used the provinces of Georgia, Yerevan, and Azerbaijan, which were attempting to become independent, to form a cordon sanitaire (a blockade line to prevent infectious diseases) between the Soviet Union and Turkey, which eventually led to the resumption of Soviet-Turkish relations mentioned above. The Transcaucasus seemed to the Western countries to be a remote place, not worth their continued investment of manpower and material resources there after the end of the war. Therefore, the British troops stationed there withdrew in August 1919. At the same time, the interior of the Transcaucasian Republics failed to unify. Thus,

the Soviet Union was given an opportunity

Azerbaijan declared itself a Soviet Republic in early 1920. The Armenian Republic of Yerevan, attacked by both Turkey and Russia, had to request a ceasefire on November 7, and then, in mid-December, a Soviet government was established. Turkey, which had occupied Kars (an Armenian fortress) during the war, demanded that about three-quarters of the territory in that area on the Russian border before the Great War of 1914 be ceded to Turkey, but this demand was not accepted.

Georgia, which maintained a strong tradition of national independence, continued to resist attacks from the Soviet Union and Turkey after its neighbors succumbed, but in 1921, under strong Soviet pressure, the Georgian Soviet Republic was finally declared, and the Turkish military responded by withdrawing. During this chaotic period, the territory of the Transcaucasus changed hands frequently, and the final solution was reached in Moscow in March 1921, when the Soviet Union and Turkey signed a treaty stipulating that Batum and the 'Batum-Baku oil pipeline' at the Black Sea end should belong to the Soviet Union, but Turkey would have unrestricted use of the port, while Kars and Ardahan should be returned to Turkey.

Regarding the situation in the Transcaucasus during this period, we must mention Armenia's attempt at independence, which the Allies encouraged during the war and at the peace conference. President Wilson made his famous 'Fourteen Points' speech on January 8, 1918, which included the following statement: "...the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development..." In April 1920, Armenia was entrusted to the United States for trusteeship, but the United States refused to accept it. The 'Treaty of Sèvres' signed by Turkey and the Allies was invalidated because it was not ratified. According to this treaty, Turkey should recognize Armenia as a free and independent country, and its borders should be delineated according to President Wilson's ruling in November 1920. The Allies did not fulfill their promises to Armenia. Therefore, a group of Armenians residing in London took this as an excuse, calling themselves the Armenian Socialist Party, and wrote to the London Foreign Ministers Conference in October 1945, declaring: "The Armenians of the world are absolutely united in demanding the implementation of President Wilson's ruling, and they firmly hope that if the Soviet Union demands that

the Armenian provinces of Turkey

be incorporated into the boundaries of Soviet Armenia, the British and American governments should take consistent action with the Soviet government."

Regarding the ethnological basis for the Soviet Union's territorial demands, Turkey's interpretation is that, broadly speaking, this basis no longer exists today. This view is supported by evidence provided by impartial observers. At the same time, the Soviet Union has never demanded the territory of Kars and Ardahan on ethnological grounds, and the population of Soviet Armenia, in terms of its relative density, is not excessively crowded, which are two facts that are worth mentioning here.

From this perspective, the Soviet Union's territorial demands on the Transcaucasus are merely a byproduct of the Black Sea Straits issue, which has been proven by historical facts. At the same time, the recent events in Iranian Azerbaijan province have further aggravated the situation, affecting not only Turkey, but also the future of the entire Middle East.

### Glimpses of the U.S. Women's Army Corps

An American girl of Polish descent (left), dressed in Polish national costume, is raising her hand to swear allegiance to a unit within the U.S. Women's Army Corps. This unit is composed entirely of American women of Polish descent. Standing to the right is a lieutenant of the Army Corps, supervising the oath. Behind them is the Liberty Bell, a historical symbol of American freedom. Among the women enlisting are a world-renowned opera star and a young woman. They had just escaped from German concentration camps after eighteen months of captivity and enlisted ten days after returning to the United States. The purpose of the U.S. Women's Army Corps and other non-combatant units is to enable American women to perform the duties of men, allowing them to take on combat roles. The war services performed by the Women's Army Corps include medical affairs, training, science, photography, languages, weather reporting, radio, transportation, mechanics, administrative work, driving vehicles, military supplies, and other war services, numbering no fewer than two hundred and thirty-nine types. Their footprints can be found in the European and Pacific theaters of war.

### U.S. Industrial Research Institute

A certain U.S. scientific research institute has established an industrial design class. Students in the class build various wooden models to illustrate the machine coordination techniques in modern industry. The professor in the picture serves in an aircraft factory and deeply understands the importance of assisting workers to accelerate productivity. When the United States joined the war, the institute began training students to learn various special skills to assist the government in resisting aggressor nations. Women receive training in industrial design and combat cover to replace men engaged in industry.

### Reader's Opinion: Rampant Extortion and Levies - People of Eastern Zhejiang Unable to Bear the Burden

To the Editor:

After eight years of resistance against Japan, and upon the arrival of victory, the government, in the midst of post-war recovery, urgently needs to address the people's pressing demands for a stable and improved life. This cannot be treated as a matter for later consideration. Therefore, the first good news the government conveyed to the people after the victory was the exemption of farmland tax for the 34th year of the Republic (1945) in all recovered areas nationwide. Indeed, during eight years of darkness, the people suffered oppression under the enemy and puppets, living a life of servitude. Now that the homeland has been restored, the government orders the exemption of farmland tax, allowing the people to recover slightly. This is truly an act of profound grace! Who would have thought that the central government's good policy would have the opposite effect. Policies originate from multiple sources, with no fixed amount for levies. These levies are not collected together with the farmland tax (since the farmland tax for the 34th year was exempted, it cannot be collected together), nor are they managed uniformly by the government (because the donations are as numerous as hairs on an ox, urgent like a shooting star, and it seems provincial and county governments do not have time to tally them, making unified management impossible). Instead, the task is entrusted to the easily corruptible rural townships and baojia systems for house-to-house conscription, with no one spared. Now, this practice has become even more severe, with no restrictions imposed. Those who have not conducted on-site investigations might suspect this is an exaggeration. Now, I will use my recent return to my hometown of Yuyao in Zhejiang Province, which I had left for ten years due to my father's passing, as an example.

According to the elders in my village, in August and September of last year (1945), when the news of victory spread throughout Zhejiang Province, Yuyao launched a donation campaign throughout the county for "Celebration of Victory in the War of Resistance" (the first type of donation after the victory). At this time, the people, suddenly seeing the light of day, were filled with joy and eagerly welcomed the occasion, and a large sum of money was quickly raised without needing to force donations. However, after that, in addition to regular taxes such as business tax and slaughter tax, various miscellaneous and exorbitant levies surged like a tide, one after another. To date, according to the memories of the villagers, in the short span of six months, there have been as many as twelve types of donations. The main ones are as follows: (1) Fees for civilian laborers requisitioned by the Military-Civilian Cooperation Agency; (2) Supply fees for garrison troops; (3) Expenses for purchasing firearms; (4) Expenses for the liaison intelligence network; (5) Military grain; (6) Public grain; (7) Non-staple food and clothing expenses for the county militia; (8) Equipment expenses for the district administrative office; (9) Recurring expenses for national schools; (10) Village housing and police donation fees; (11) Expenses for the farmers' association; (12) Construction fees for the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. Such exorbitant levies are piled upon each other, emerging endlessly. Each time they are collected, it is either by order of the province or county, then by the county to the township, the township to the bao, and the bao to the jia, who then collect rice and currency from door to door from both landlords and tenants, with amounts determined arbitrarily without any standard. And unscrupulous baojia heads take advantage to embezzle, which is unavoidable. Taking a rough estimate, for every one unit of official revenue received by the government, the people pay double or even triple, making the burden unbearable. As a result, the people live in constant anxiety, fearing the arrival of the official documents in the hands of the baojia heads and the wooden holsters on the waists of the self-defense forces (armed self-defense forces are often dispatched during collection), looming over their humble homes, causing them to tremble with fear and shed tears in silence. Usually, the government collects farmland tax only once or twice a year, but these levies are so exorbitant and numerous, coming endlessly and incessantly. People say, "Oppressive government is fiercer than a tiger," but in reality, it is like draining the pond to catch all the fish, even fiercer than a tiger. People say, "Miscellaneous levies are as bothersome as flies," but in reality, they arrive morning and evening, even more bothersome than flies. Thus, the government nominally implements the benevolent policy of "exemption of farmland tax," but the people actually suffer the oppressive government of "exhausting all resources." The people are not dying from tigers, bandits, the enemy, or the puppets, but from the government that led the War of Resistance to success. What could be more resentful than this!

What is even more incomprehensible is that our Chairman, through perseverance and extraordinary leadership, led the War of Resistance for eight years as if it were a single day. His indelible achievements shine brightly both at home and abroad, and will be remembered for thousands of years. The people, wanting to commemorate him, all share the same sentiment! Now, the Zhejiang provincial authorities are building a "Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall" for the Chairman as a means of commemoration. This is precisely what the people wish would be "planned and built and completed without delay" in this peaceful and prosperous time. However, at a time when the land is scarred and the people are on the verge of death, Yuyao County is actually levying a "Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall construction fee" of as much as three million yuan. The county magistrate, unable to raise the funds, then orders the township heads, who then order the baojia heads. The baojia heads then forcibly collect from door to door, just as disruptively as other miscellaneous levies. The people believe that this hall is to commemorate the Chairman's great achievements, so even if they are unable to afford it, they will pawn their possessions and borrow money, enduring hunger and cold to comply. However, one wonders why the Zhejiang provincial authorities do not emulate the Chairman's heart of "treating the people as if they were wounded," and instead build this historically valuable hall on the groans of the people? I know that the great Chairman would certainly not bear to hear and happily accept it, and I believe the Zhejiang provincial authorities will also realize their mistake and withdraw from this course.

The above is all based on objective facts, without a single element of emotional bias. I deeply hope that the government authorities, understanding the suffering of our people, will not increase it further, and will resolutely stop collecting various exorbitant levies, so as not to further disturb our people. According to the majority opinion of the village elders, they would rather endure the pain for a while and pay the farmland tax for the 35th year of the Republic (1946) in advance (the farmland tax for the 35th year is normally collected in September of this year), and have all miscellaneous levies collected together with the farmland tax, to be collected and remitted uniformly by the county government, without entrusting the baojia with collecting even a single cent, thus preventing corruption and eliminating disturbances, so that the common people can still find peace under heavy burdens. Otherwise, the impact will not only be the weeping of a single family or a single road, it will be enough to shatter the fruits of victory and place the nation in a state of eternal destruction. Fearing the dangers, I dare not remain silent. I think that your esteemed newspaper holds a fair position and serves as the voice of the people. I beg you to lend me a corner of your space to publish this and to appeal to the government to quickly devise a comprehensive remedy, so as to relieve the people from their distress, rescue them from fire and water, and plead for their lives with utmost sincerity. May they take this into consideration. (Zhang Yiju, March 11th)

### Request to the Financial Authorities to Clarify the National Bond Policy

To the Editor: I have always been a believer in public bonds and am a small player in the bond industry. Currently, my colleagues in the bond industry feel particularly distressed about the current situation of public bonds, and there are many doubts that urgently need clarification from the financial authorities to dispel public confusion. As your newspaper has always been the voice of the people, I boldly, in the capacity of a commoner, dare to ask your newspaper to publish this, so that I may obtain guidance from wise people in all sectors and obtain clear instructions from the authorities. I list the following points:

(1) Due to the impact of the war, currency inflation, and the depreciation of currency value, the face value of public bonds is already less than one-thousandth of its original value at the time of issuance. According to its current market price, it has exceeded its face value by fifteen times. Why is it that the financial authorities turn a blind eye? Moreover, in the report on financial matters made by Finance Minister Yu at the recent Second Plenary Session, not a single word was mentioned about public bonds. Are public bonds an unimportant matter?

(2) The current market price of National Salvation Bonds is slightly higher than that of the Unified B Bonds. Since the National Government moved west due to the war, this bond has been like a worthless security. Now that victory has arrived, we only hear about the lottery drawing for the principal and interest payment of U.S. dollar and British pound bonds, but there is no news at all about these National Salvation Bonds. Is it because their face value is too small when calculated at the current face value? However, the legal tender paid at the beginning when buying bonds out of patriotism had a very different value from the current value. I ask, are there any countries in the world where those who buy national salvation bonds receive such a poor outcome after their country's victory?

(3) The market price of public bonds is high because the financial authorities have made no statement or paid any interest, which has further caused the public to believe that the government will definitely maintain its creditworthiness and will not cause bondholders to suffer any losses. As a result, the market price is slightly higher. The Unified B Bonds once reached twenty-four times their face value at its highest, which seems extremely pitiful compared to the soaring prices of goods and stocks. However, public opinion from all walks of life has repeatedly criticized this, regarding it as speculation. Are there no people with a sense of justice among these critics? I ask, for public bonds issued by the same country, is it that those denominated in foreign currency can avoid losses, while those denominated in the local currency should suffer? Who would then believe in or invest in bonds denominated in the local currency in the future?

(4) The above leads to a related question, that is, the numerous officials of the government deliberate day and night on how to contract the currency, but why do they forget to drive funds into investing in public bonds? Is the country worried about issuing new public bonds?

(5) Public bonds are securities with value and are explicitly stipulated as being freely tradable. Why has the police station recently been arbitrarily arresting public bond dealers or hindering their freedom of trade? Last week, my colleague Mr. Li was detained by the police station and held for three hours, after which he had to leave a fingerprint to be released. Has the public bond regulation stipulating free trade been canceled and invalidated? However, no clear cancellation has been announced by the financial authorities. I dare to ask, "What is the mystery behind this?"

(6) According to Mr. Li, he has been in this business for more than ten years, and he believes in the country throughout his life. He was also detained for dealing in public bonds during the enemy-puppet era. He never expected to see this situation again after the restoration of light. In his anger, he regrets not having been one of those who bought gold, stored foreign exchange, and hoarded goods, who are now triumphant and satisfied. This "Mr. Li's new conclusion" may seem insignificant on the surface, but it is actually a matter of concern. I ask, do clear-sighted people need to or know how to salvage this kind of distorted mentality?

Although the above items are very plain, in Shanghai, the financial center of the country, they must be mentioned, because their impact is not small. I hope that wise people from all walks of life, as well as wise authorities, will quickly provide guidance. Shi Jiahao (March 5th)

### A Record of Torture on the Tongguan-Luoyang Road

— Fan Hongji

Luoyang, this newspaper, 23rd dispatch

After staying in Tongguan for two or three days, due to various difficulties, I almost changed my plan to travel east along the Longhai Railway. I had once negotiated with the Jin-Cha-Sui-Ji Branch Office to go to Taiyuan with a large number of staff from the office and then try to transfer to Beiping. However, as many friends had entrusted me with matters that I had to try to accomplish, and my hometown was far away and my parents had been waiting for a long time, I had to take the opportunity to return. Fortunately, Director Zhou of the Joint Transportation Office went to Tongguan to inspect, which resolved the difficulty of traveling east. On the morning of the 21st, I boarded a Longhai Joint Transportation vehicle and left Tongguan.

As soon as the vehicle started, dust rose into the air. Sitting at the back of the vehicle, looking back, the rising dust looked like cumulus clouds in summer, or like the spray of a waterfall hitting rocks, surging and turbulent. If it weren't for the dust entering my nose, I wouldn't know I was on the Loess Plateau.

We hadn't gone far when, after a turn and a steep slope, the vehicle, even with full power, couldn't make it up. As a result, the people in the back had to get out and push.

Leaving the First Pass - Stepping onto the Line of Life and Death

After leaving the First Pass (the border between Henan and Shaanxi), I overlooked the railway emerging from the mountain tunnel. This area was the most threatened section during the war, having endured countless enemy shells, and countless locomotives and passengers had lost their lives here. The dirt road we were traveling on was the old cart path from before the railway was built in the late Qing dynasty. The road surface was entirely made up of cart tracks. After the War of Resistance, the Shaanxi-Henan road was cut off, and this road became the only thoroughfare between the two provinces. I really did not expect that the so-called repatriation vehicles would take this narrow, winding, steep, and sloping dirt road, rather than the original Luoyang-Tongguan highway. Even more strange, the road was not repaired at all. Paving stones and building bridges would certainly take too long, but it didn't seem too difficult to pay attention to uneven road surfaces or excessively steep slopes and turns. Disregarding the vehicle's lifespan, the safety of returning passengers, and the passengers' health is truly disheartening. Anyone who sees this road shakes their head and sighs: "It's terrible!" I heard that when it rains, it takes ten or eight days to travel the road, so some people simply spend a few extra days on the road and take a "lala car," which is a little less dangerous.

Overturning Tragedy - Luggage Everywhere

When our vehicle reached a certain location, a vehicle that was traveling ahead of us overturned on the side of the road. Many of the passengers had broken heads and were bleeding. Some were sitting, some were lying, some were shouting. Luggage was scattered all over the ground. The reason for the overturning was: the road was too narrow, and the roadside was too soft. When an oncoming vehicle approached, the vehicle gave way, and slipped into the field. Our vehicle also drove to the edge of the field when turning a corner, but fortunately the driver was quick to react and immediately stopped the vehicle. He called the passengers to get off and quickly pulled the vehicle back up, otherwise there would have been at least some bloodshed, if not fatal injuries.

What we hadn't anticipated was the painful experience of riding in a vehicle, regardless of size, that was forced to carry more than thirty people. The vehicle was full of luggage, with nearly forty adults and children. Because of the lack of transportation, the thirty people registered for each vehicle had to be accommodated. As a result, we had to squeeze desperately, grabbing whatever foothold we could find. The station sent this group of passengers onto the vehicle.

Tense Situation - Experiencing the Bitter Taste of Squeezing

The squeezing situation was no less severe than the evacuation on the Xiang-Gui Railway the year before. Those sitting on the edge, traveling on the bumpy, winding, and sloping road, feared being thrown under the vehicle and had to squeeze inward as much as possible to maintain their safety. Those sitting inside had to bear the weight of many people stepping on their legs and shoulders. The upper body was burdened, and the lower body couldn't move. Their buttocks couldn't sit properly on the seat, and the vehicle's movement prevented them from supporting their bodies with their hands. But this suffering from being squeezed and dragged had to be endured every minute and every second, so the entire vehicle was never quiet for a minute. Either someone was complaining that their legs couldn't stretch out, or someone was shouting that the people on either side were encroaching on their space and knocking over their child. The situation was tense and heated like a raging fire. I also tasted the flavors of inside, outside, front, and back, which I had never experienced before, so I said, "On the Tongguan-Luoyang road, one suffers torture!"

After noon, the sun shone directly on the ground, and the dust flew even more fiercely. People's breathing was extremely labored. Most people didn't want to eat lunch, feeling hot and restless, and unable to eat anything. By the afternoon, our bodies were completely coated with a layer of yellow earth, about two or three copper coins thick. Our noses, mouths, eyes, and ears were all sealed with yellow earth, and we were completely transformed into "earth people."

Vehicle Arrives at Shaanxi Prefecture - Situation Becomes Even More Chaotic

There were very few inspections along the way. There were two or three checkpoints, but as soon as the vehicle stopped, it was registered and let through, with no other troubles. On the first night, we arrived at Shaanxi Prefecture, 111 kilometers from Tongguan. Getting on and off the vehicle was completely unsupervised. Passengers had to retrieve, place, and guard their own luggage. Seating was no longer assigned, and passengers had to find their own seats, making the situation even more chaotic than before.

Things in Shaanxi Prefecture were similar to those in Tongguan. Lodgings cost 360 yuan per day, tea was 80 yuan, and tips were optional. Meals cost around 500 yuan per meal. The lodgings were still "fully booked," so finding a lodging was a major task when the vehicle arrived at the station, unlike before the war when many lodgings sent people to the station to compete for customers.

From Shaanxi Prefecture to Luoyang is a total of 150 kilometers, and there are many vehicles. Every night, drivers go to the lodgings to ask the bosses, "Is there a good vehicle going to Luoyang?" Under this situation, the vehicles are looking for people, and the passengers can take advantage, which means they can bargain. Usually, the price can be negotiated for several thousand yuan.

Rotten Roads, Broken Vehicles - How Can This Benefit Repatriation?

On the second day, we passed through Zhangmao, Guanyintang, Hua Chi, Tiemen, and Xin'an. Prices were relatively low, and vendors shouted as the vehicle passed through the streets.

The vehicle's tires were flat on the road, and we waited for another hour. Fortunately, we managed to reach Luoyang City that night. According to the driver, none of their vehicles are in good condition. Each trip requires two or three days of repairs, followed by one or two days of rest. At most, they can only make three trips per month. In this urgent repatriation effort, traveling just over 1,000 li per month on this short 261-kilometer journey is simply not urgent enough and is disappointing to outsiders. Why are the roads not repaired? Why are good vehicles not used? How can dealing with this with rotten roads and broken vehicles be called repatriation transportation? (February 23rd in Luoyang)

Spring and Autumn

### Starting with "Chang'e Flying to the Moon"

— Shi Jimei

That was last year's affair.

In the silvery-blue sky hung a silver-white moon, it was precisely the Mid-Autumn Festival evening for family reunion.

With a gust of wind, there was a whiff of osmanthus fragrance in the courtyard.

"Oh! The bright moon is in the sky, the ice wheel emerges, what a beautiful scene of clear autumn..." Wei Luo, who had just learned Peking Opera for more than two months, couldn't leave her "profession" in three sentences.

"From morning till night, crowing like a chicken or meowing like a cat, how hateful and detestable," that was Jie Na, who became "heroically short of breath" after learning for eight days, getting angry whenever opera was mentioned.

"What do you know?" Wei Luo said, "This is called 'evoking feelings by the scene'!"

"What do you know?" Jie Na retorted, "Even after learning for three and a half days, I know these sentences are from 'Farewell My Concubine'. If you want to evoke feelings by the scene, why don't you sing 'Chang'e Flying to the Moon'? Why hum that?"

"'Chang'e Flying to the Moon', I haven't learned it yet!"

Everyone laughed at that.

So the topic turned to Chang'e—

Qing Zi gazed at the bright moon, thoughtfully saying, "The scientists' theories are really a killjoy, so many beautiful fairy tales! I've yearned for it since I was little, that touching fairy tale 'Chang'e Flying to the Moon', but those people insist on saying that the moon is a satellite of the solar system, and something about glaciers... a whole bunch of theories, making it all boring."

What a poetic idea!

"The scientists deserve to die ten thousand times, Your Majesty, please calm your anger," the playful Wei Luo came to "evoke feelings by the scene."

Another burst of laughter.

"I also agree with Qing Zi's words, if we had this set of scientific theories a few thousand years ago, we might not have been able to read so many good poems and essays," Xuan Zhu said.

"Isn't that right?" Jie Na laughed, "In that case, even if Wei Luo learns opera for another ten years, she probably wouldn't learn 'Chang'e Flying to the Moon'."

"Well! It doesn't matter if there's no 'Chang'e Flying to the Moon', let's use 'Farewell My Concubine' as a substitute," Wei Luo said solemnly, "But aren't the poems of the ancients mostly praising nature? In ten poems that mention the moon," she added with the frankness of "Fourth Son Visiting His Mother", "eight or nine of them do."

"You're exaggerating too much," Jie Na said, "The scientists didn't say there's no moon in the sky, what are you worried about?"

"This—" Wei Luo glared at her, "Why are you deliberately making trouble for me today?" She thought for a moment and exclaimed, "Got it, at least there's one poem, Li Shangyin's 'Chang'e Should Regret Stealing the Immortality Elixir'," wouldn't it be impossible to write?"

"Speaking of this poem," Xin Shi asked, "What kind of person do you imagine Chang'e to be?"

"Like Wang Qiang reborn, her face like Xishi reincarnated." The wicked Wei Luo, again quoted two lines from a seven-character verse narrative.

"Incorrect, at the time of Chang'e, Xishi and Tu Jiao hadn't even been born yet! How could they 'reborn' or 'reincarnate'?" Xuan Zhu said, "Chang'e is the goddess of the moon, as beautiful as peach blossoms and plums, as cold as ice and frost."

"Cold as ice and frost is just an external attitude, Chang'e is a passionate woman," Jie Na said definitely.

"What do you mean by that?"

"Otherwise, why would she 'regret stealing the immortality elixir'? And why would she have a 'blue sea, blue sky, night after night heart'?"

"Actually, Chang'e is too infatuated, is someone like Hou Yi worth missing? Women are really pitiful, even Chang'e is no exception," Xuan Zhu sighed, with a bit of subtext.

"You're really a bunch of bookworms," Wei Luo laughed, like silver bells, "That's just the poet's nonsense, you've all fallen for Li Shangyin's trick! Imagine Chang'e sitting in the Guanghan Palace, how carefree, how free, seeing through the vicissitudes of the human world, surprised by the phoenix anchoring, sadness and joy, separation and reunion, all are illusions, why would she still miss Hou Yi? Why would she still miss that—"

"Listening to her, quickly get paper and pen, what a beautiful thesis?" It was Jie Na again, who was looking for trouble, interrupting her.

"Maybe she still has a child left behind, even if she doesn't miss Hou Yi, she will still miss her child." Xuan Zhu's weak voice, this sentence was not heard by everyone.

"Mommy, what are you talking about?" Sen Sen. Jie Na's nine-year-old son ran over and asked.

"Sen Sen, we're talking about the story of Chang'e in the moon."

"There's Wu Gang in the moon, Teacher Li told us yesterday, Wu Gang chopping cassia tree."

"Really, there's also Mr. Wu Gang in the moon! Luckily this child mentioned it," Jie Na said, "We almost forgot about him."

"In that case, Chang'e also has a companion, and will no longer have a 'blue sea, blue sky, night after night heart'," Wei Luo laughed loudly.

"Why is it that today you haven't said a word, haven't expressed a single brilliant idea?" Qing Zi asked me.

I smiled and did not answer her question. Originally, I have never been clear about such big issues as women's issues, and they are discussing Chang'e flying to the moon like Nora leaving home, what else can I say?

March 8, 1946

### The Old Man

— Xiao Qun

My sixth uncle's situation is quite miserable. He is a burden to live. He had been prominent for a while in his early years, but that is a thing of the past. Now no one pays attention to him anymore. Relatives and friends all try to stay away from him. People dislike his garrulousness and his words are out of touch with the times. Even his wife, his daughter-in-law, and his grandchildren can arbitrarily abuse him, as if his existence is really superfluous.

However, let me say, sixth uncle is really a kind-hearted old man. He is honest and sincere, treats others as he treats himself, and can treat his nephews and nieces equally. In the past, his feelings with my father were as close as glue. The degree of their friendship was really unimaginable. They lived and ate together. When my father passed away, he was really sad for a while. In the past, he could have someone to chat with, but now his old partner has also left him far away.

My sixth uncle is already over seventy years old, but he doesn't look very frail. Naturally, the dragon-like old age of ordinary old people is inevitable. He is in good health and rarely has minor problems throughout the year. He is used to doing housework, like sweeping spider webs and playing with flowers and plants, it seems that he cannot pass the time without doing this. People say that perhaps his labor is very helpful to his body. Once, he suddenly had diarrhea in the middle of the night, and the diarrhea was very severe, totaling twenty or thirty times. His family was really scared for a while, but the next day he was completely fine, sweeping spider webs and playing with flowers and plants as usual, as if nothing had happened.

My sixth uncle left his hometown very early. His situation was quite poor when he was young. Even now, he still likes to talk endlessly about the tight circumstances of those years, such as going to Nanjing to take the imperial examination and selling his fur coat to survive the winter. He likes to talk about that very much. He feels that this is the best lesson for his descendants. The reason why our family is in this situation is that the achievements of the deceased uncle cannot be erased. He has done many things before, worked as a teacher in a normal school, worked as an editor-in-chief in a newspaper, and also served as a factory director. After the age of forty, he suffered a serious illness, almost leaving the world. Although he recovered from the illness later, his mind became confused. He couldn't remember things from the day before, and he wouldn't even recognize relatives in the family if he didn't see them for a few days. For this reason, he often made some jokes, but he remembered things before the illness very clearly. He could even recite entire paragraphs of ancient books. Some people say that this is his blessing, and he also boasts that he has entered the realm of a half-immortal. He said that his eating and sleeping are both supernatural, he can eat or not eat, and he doesn't feel hungry even if he doesn't eat anything all day long. He loves Zheng Banqiao's sentence the most, "It is rare to be confused." He said that there are very few people who have entered his realm in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad.

Because of his confusion, he has been living a reclusive life for many years. The business he founded was messed up by his nephews. Occasionally, people told him something, and he was very angry. He was not very confident in the various despicable methods of his nephews. But then he forgot completely. What is most ridiculous is that our family's situation has gradually declined in recent years, and the old servants of the past have dispersed, but he still likes to shout loudly sometimes, and others laugh at him. He likes to play a little mahjong, but people generally don't want to accompany him. A few granddaughters sometimes play four rounds with him when they are in a good mood. He sometimes argues about a card like a child, and his face turns red. He is completely indifferent to the price changes in recent years. The Japanese came and went, and he didn't know at all. In his memory, he thought that life was still as good as before, and that rice was sold for ten yuan a dan, so cheap. Once people told him that eggs were already selling for ten thousand, and his surprise was indescribable. He said that he was determined not to eat anymore, but naturally that was just talk. Ten minutes later, he had already forgotten what he had said.

### The Sound of the Watchman's Drum

— Suo Yi

Friend, can you hear the sound of the watchman's drum in this noisy city?

Midnight, in the silent darkness; friend, listen to the sound of the watchman's drum, monotonous and desolate, spreading faintly from the alley.

If you lean out, you can see a thin shadow reflected in the cold moonlight, holding a wind lantern, mechanically knocking on bamboo clappers, approaching from afar.

In this dark world, no one accompanies him, spending this long night. The most intimate is this wind lantern. In the monotonous sound of the watchman's drum, he walks through the streets and alleys, completing his responsibility for this day.

That sound of the watchman's drum is like a monk in an ancient temple, striking the bell, emitting that kind of desolate sound wave, cleansing your long-turbid heart.

### Scroll of Poems on a Journey to Huangshan

— Shi Chongpeng

Ms. Wang Jianfang Yi Mei of Southern Anhui was a classmate twenty years ago. We have not seen each other for fifteen years! Before the Incident, correspondence was uninterrupted. In the spring of the twenty-fifth year, the Ministry of Education held the Second National Art Exhibition in Beijing. I had some works participating. Yi Mei and I both went to Beijing to visit, but we did not meet because of the different travel dates. She wrote in her letter: Your landscape painting is refreshing and pleasing, etc. I was grateful for her discerning words, so I presented it to her as a gift. Soon after, she reciprocated with a self-made "Scroll of Poems on a Journey to Huangshan," which was about two feet long and six inches high, made of white silk satin and embroidered with blue poems and calligraphy. It was exquisitely beautiful and could be called a triple masterpiece of poetry, calligraphy, and embroidery. The poem reads: "A corner of a dangerous building is idle on the ridge, the west window does not need to be closed in the evening; it is good to point to the setting sun descending from the distant mountains outside the vast clouds and trees." It is timeless and extraordinary, and the calligraphy is also graceful and dynamic, unlike a woman's handwriting. I carefully treasure it, and ten years have passed in an instant. Every time I think of her, we are on opposite sides of the earth, and my heart aches when I unroll the scroll. So I followed up with two quatrains:

Wandering in scenic spots is leisurely, cloud

things, layered buildings are not allowed to

close; every word is a pearl, made by your hand,

facing you, desks, smoke and clouds are leisurely all day long.

Heavenly sounds in mid-air, how could they

be closed? You gave me a brocade embroidered

scroll of poetry and calligraphy, it is as if

a piece of mountain has flown here.

### Leaving the Hague

— Jin Wensi

The caged cart turns repeatedly, setting off at dawn, the wind-driven vehicle is about to depart, overwhelmed with emotion; roundly urging the wind wheel of the water country to turn, I remember the green of the rice fields in my Jiangnan hometown. Seven years finally made me an exile from Qin, I am still ashamed to be a Han Su Xiang in my prime; at this time of danger, I am most happy that my parents are healthy, I miss my brothers in Shanghai and Paris.

### Responding to the Previous Rhyme Leaving Brussels

— Qian Tai

The fierce power of the border guards prohibits guests from traveling, wandering on the blocked road, feeling lost; a hungry stomach rumbles, facing the wind and cold, frequent night alarms, fearing the bright moon. In both places, we know that we cherish our close friends, and we have troubled Jing Ke many times to avoid disasters; the return journey is thousands of miles away, obstructed by the voyage, let's report peace to our brothers.

### Leaving Poland, Taking the Road to Belgium and France, Responding to the Previous Rhyme

— Wang Jingqi (Deceased)

My homeland is broken and the road is difficult to travel, millions of people flee in misery; (The righteous battle is not seen in the Spring and Autumn Annals, who knows the game of Weiqi in the Chu-Han chess game. Yellow sand is blue and I mourn the previous lessons, the black night carriages move with the wandering guests; it is miserable to have no success and only dry bones, the father mourns his son and the younger brother mourns his older brother.

### Leaving Paris, Responding to the Previous Rhyme

— Shi Zhaoji

A hundred twists and turns in the dark night, refugees everywhere, a scene of misery; the wind blows the wheels of the vehicle, questioning the alarm, the moon reflects the desolate wilderness, half-bright in color. After eight years of drifting, I finally realize it was a dream, with multiple disasters everywhere, I miss my lord even more; I still hope that the weapons of war will be destroyed one day, and all people in the world will be brothers.

### Using My Younger Brother's Rhyme of Saying Farewell to the Hague and Missing Friends in Europe

— Jin Wenzhu

The rumbling of the cart goes in all directions, the lingering feelings for the homeland are endless, the wind and rain almost seem to form chaos, the rivers and mountains still shine brightly. The raging waves compete for the position of leader, lodging in autumn sorrow, writing poems as a guest minister; bitterness and sweetness are shared, I know from afar that you also miss me as a brother.

### Double Stay Double Fly (19)

— Zhao Qingge

Several months ago, the Weixin Grand Stage invited a group of famous actors from Hankou to perform Peking Opera. As a result, the idle class men and women of the entire Jingzhou went crazy, including Second Madam Weng and Madam Mo. Second Madam Weng was simply fascinated by Shi Yuqi, who sang female roles, while Madam Mo was simply fascinated by the opera. Second Madam Weng almost secured a box, and went to support the show with Madam Mo every day, unless there was no Shi Yulou's opera on that day.

Second Madam Weng originally liked Peking Opera because of her own interests and knew how to sing a few lines. At first, Second Madam Weng only admired Shi Yulou's acting skills on the stage, but later she fell in love with Shi Yulou the person offstage. At first, she just went to listen to the opera every day, but later, Second Madam Weng actually sent colorful silk to Shi Yulou to support the show. It was on this day that Second Madam Weng and Shi Yulou officially met. Although it was a brief meeting—Shi Yulou received the colorful silk, and before going on stage, led by the theater manager, quietly went to Second Madam Weng's box to thank her. After the manager introduced him, he smiled and gave Second Madam Weng a half bow and left. And this slight smile even more deeply intoxicated Second Madam Weng's heart, her soul was hooked away by this slight smile! On this day, Shi Yulou sang "Drunken Concubine," and she stared at Shi Yulou without blinking. At this time, she suddenly nervously discovered that Shi Yulou was "flirting" with her, and she was so happy that she immediately grabbed Madam Mo and shouted! Startling the onlookers around her to stare at her. The next day, she invited Shi Yulou to dinner at a restaurant, with Madam Mo and Chunli accompanying. This time she was satisfied, she got to sit next to Shi Yulou; she got to talk to Shi Yulou; she got to look at Shi Yuqi as much as possible, and she felt that at this time she alone—at most two people—occupied Shi Yulou; unlike in the theater, where many people watched Shi Yulou, and even loved Shi Yulou. Shi Yulou did not talk much, only often smiled, and Second Madam Weng was captured by this smile! From then on, Second Madam Weng gradually became familiar with Shi Yulou. She not only often went to listen to his opera; invited him to eat at restaurants, but also invited him to her home for secret rendezvous. Anyway, Master Weng was always in dreamland during the day.

Shi Yulou's costume and makeup were indeed beautiful, and he himself was also very handsome. He was only thirty years old, but his body was terribly weak. Perhaps he was too deeply influenced by the opera, every move was like a woman, gentle, refined, and never spoke loudly. Second Madam Weng was completely a woman in front of Madam Mo; in front of Shi Yulou, she turned into a complete man. Shi Yulou was considered a famous actor of his time, and his singing and performance were above average. Therefore, there were quite a few people who supported him, even men were fascinated by him. Everything about him satisfied Second Madam Weng, only this jealousy caused by Shi Yulou caused her pain!

Also, Shi Yulou also had the same opium addiction as Master Weng, which made it difficult for Second Madam Weng! She hated this thing from the bottom of her heart, but she couldn't persuade Shi Yulou to quit, because Shi Yulou relied on opium to boost his spirits in recent years, without it, he couldn't sing at all. Therefore, Second Madam Weng not only couldn't stop him, but even stole Master Weng's well-cooked pure opium paste to give to Shi Yulou in order to win his favor. The reason why Bai Yulou was willing to go to the Weng's house was also for this reason. Second Madam Weng could take advantage of the time when Master Weng was sleeping to steal the opium paraphernalia and give it to Shi Yulou. Second Madam Weng had already been trained by Master Weng, so she was very good at preparing the opium and serving Shi Yulou.
