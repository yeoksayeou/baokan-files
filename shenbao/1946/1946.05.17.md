### Shao Lizi Expresses Opinions in Beijing: Peaceful Prospects Remain Optimistic; Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group to Reconvene Next Week

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] The armistice negotiations inside and outside Shanhaiguan are difficult to realize in the short term, due to the passage of time and shifting conditions. Some people who are eager for peace and unity are racking their brains, using a helpless analysis, forcing an explanation, emphasizing that "military mediation" and "political consultation" cannot be confused. Today, Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, publicly expressed this opinion. Shao stated that currently only large-scale warfare is occurring in the Northeast, with minor conflicts inside Shanhaiguan, and the situation is not serious, so the prospects for mediation remain optimistic. Shao also said: Some news reports in the current newspapers about the conflicts between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are unduly exaggerated, which increases public anxiety. The past "Hubei Central Conflict" and the current "Northern Jiangsu War" are examples of this.

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] According to Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, who told our reporter, the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group meeting may be held at any time. The central task of the meeting is to discuss the number of National Assembly representatives, government reorganization, and the review of the draft constitution. The group meeting has not yet received new proposals from all parties. Furthermore, the CCP representatives Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, and Li Weihan, and the government representatives Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, and Wang Shijie have all arrived in Beijing. The representatives of the Democratic League, Luo Longji, Zhang Junmai, and Liang Shuming, the representatives of the Youth Party, Zeng Qi and Chen Qitian, and the social dignitaries Shao Congen and Wang Yunwu, will all gather in Beijing before the 20th. Wang Yunwu does not intend to attend the group meeting after taking office as Minister of Economic Affairs, and will choose another worthy person to replace him. The residence of the Democratic League representatives is currently under construction and will be completed within a few days. According to Lei Zhen, the Comprehensive Group meeting cannot be convened this week, but it will definitely be held next week.

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] It is widely rumored that Sichuan Chairman Zhang Qun will fly to Beijing, but he had not arrived on the 16th. The CCP representatives Dong Biwu and Li Weihan and their entourage arrived in Beijing by air from Chongqing at 2:00 PM today, accompanied by Liu Ningyi, a member of the "Liberated Area Federation of Trade Unions" of the CCP, and five other staff members.

Marshall's "Unity" Plan May Soon Be Realized

[All Nations Service, Washington, 15th] Official sources stated today that the opportunity for China to restore peace is now "brighter" than it was two weeks ago. It is widely believed that General Marshall's "eighteen-month plan" to unite the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has nearly completed its initial six months of work as scheduled. These people believe that although the messages from China do not indicate that friction has decreased, some basic and unpublished improvements have been achieved. Peace between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in North China and Northeast China may soon be realized. These people refused to disclose the actual gains, only saying that the official reports received by the United States from China show "genuine progress." The above-mentioned people explained General Marshall's "eighteen-month plan," saying that Marshall hopes to achieve a complete ceasefire in the first six months, and this period is now coming to an end. In the second six months, Marshall plans to merge the Kuomintang and Communist forces into a unified military organization. Although the overall command will be taken by Kuomintang generals, the Communist Party can also serve as division commanders. In this unified army, the ratio of Kuomintang to Communist forces is roughly five to one. As for the details, it depends on the local conditions. In the third six months, Marshall hopes to unify and expand China's administrative agencies, even reaching the smallest villages. In various political organizations, the proportion of Kuomintang and Communist personnel differs more significantly than in the military, but the main body still belongs to the central government. U.S. officials believe that the different conditions in various parts of China make this flexible plan the only way to achieve success.

### U.S. Appeasement Policy in China May Reap Its Own Bitter Fruit; Powell on the Situation in China

[United Press, New York, 15th] J.B. Powell, editor of the "China Weekly Review," wrote to the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" today, stating that news from the Far East shows that our country's appeasement plan in China is not only failing, but also may reap its own bitter fruit day by day. He pointed out that American journalists who recently lost their freedom in Changchun were surprised by the rapid entry of the Communist army into Northeast China, because there were almost no Communist troops in the Northeast when Japan surrendered. Powell quoted these journalists as saying: The Communist army's occupation work closely cooperated with the U.S. military's retreat, and also said that Inner Mongolia seems to be falling into the hands of the new Soviet Communist regime and becoming another puppet regime of the Soviet Union in Asia. He believes that the expansion of the Communist army's power now proves the views expressed by government officials during the war, that the Communist Party is working harder to improve its own position than to resist the Japanese army. Powell said: "The future is not optimistic. A Communist-controlled China cannot be friendly to the United States, but on the other hand, if a civil war breaks out, it will make the entire revitalization plan a bubble."

[Central News Agency, New York, 16th, United Press] American writer William Henry Chamberlin wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal stating that the traditional American policy wishes to see China undivided, and the Open Door Policy should be strictly observed. The current situation in Northeast China is extremely important, and the current division of Korea should be ended. The division of a country always leads to unnecessary poverty and suffering.

### Executive Yuan to Add Two Ministries; Weng Wenhao and Zhang Jia'ao to Head Agriculture & Mining and Industry & Commerce, Respectively; Mayors of Beijing and Chiefs of Police of Shanghai to Remain in Office

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] The Supreme National Defense Council has decided that Bai Chongxi will be the Minister of National Defense, and Chen Cheng will be the Chief of Staff. However, the members of the Strategic Advisory Committee must be determined after the Ministry of National Defense is established. It is heard that the Executive Yuan plans to add two ministries, Agriculture & Mining and Industry & Commerce, which will be headed by Weng Wenhao and Zhang Jia'ao, respectively. Although Wang Yunwu once humbly declined the post of Minister of Economic Affairs, he will accept the difficult task on June 1 due to the high expectations from all parties. Furthermore, the rumor of changing the Mayor of Beijing has become a thing of the past, and Xuan Tiewu will continue to work hard as the Chief of Police of Shanghai.

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] The various Yuan and Ministries of the National Government are finally returning to the capital. Among them, except for the staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who have all returned to the capital, the rest of the Yuan and Ministries still have a part remaining in the provisional capital, about 2,000 people, waiting for transportation to come to Beijing. For example, only more than 30 people have arrived at the Ministry of the Interior so far.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 16th] The National Salvation Daily reported that Dong Lifu, Minister of Organization, may be appointed as the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Lu Zhonglin, the former Director of the Conscription Department, is said to be appointed as the Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government.

### Wang Yunwu to Go to Beijing Next Week; Going to Work, Not to Take Office

[Central News Agency, This City News] Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Wang Yunwu, the newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs, at his private residence. Mr. Wang is the only self-made entrepreneur in our country, and also the only new figure participating in the central organization without any party affiliation. His hair is already white, but his physical strength and spirit are no less than those of a young man. Yesterday, he wore a dark blue Zhongshan suit and deep yellow leather shoes with patches in his simple and plain study and met with reporters. He began by saying: Until yesterday morning, I still hoped to be spared this new appointment, but since the Executive Yuan has already announced it, I should naturally fulfill my national duty. Although I am almost 60 years old, I have not yet reached the age limit for conscription. At the time of political restoration, the country needs me, and I should naturally work hard for the country. Therefore, when Mr. and Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek sought my consent to take office as Minister of Economic Affairs in Beijing, I stated that I am not here to take office, but to work, and I must be absolutely responsible for my work. However, although I have been engaged in industry in the past, I have focused on cultural aspects and lack economic experience, so I still need to learn. I will first visit various experts, relevant parties, and people's representatives to consult and study within a few days, and I plan to go to Beijing next week to take office. When asked by reporters whether there would be any changes in the personnel of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, he highly praised the British civil service protection system. My appointment as Minister of Economic Affairs will be based on the principle of not changing personnel. Moreover, the staff of the Ministry of Economic Affairs are all professional talents. Mr. Weng Wenhao's morality and writing are also admired, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs under Mr. Weng's leadership is naturally well-organized and does not need any changes. Regarding the future of China's economy, he said: "It depends on human effort." Economic warfare is not more difficult than military warfare. As long as the whole country is of one heart and one mind, there will be a way for the future of the economy. Regarding the CCP issue, he hopes to have a reasonable and proper solution. Mr. Wang is a representative of the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group. When reporters asked when the group could meet in Nanjing, he said that the group representatives have now arrived in Beijing and Shanghai, and all parties hope to convene the meeting as soon as possible to resolve various issues, but the date of the meeting has not yet been determined. Finally, he said: I have resigned from the position of General Manager of the Commercial Press and planned to engage in literary research and writing, but now I have to temporarily abandon this plan.

### Pauley to Come to Beijing; Compensation Matters May Be Decided Within Weeks

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] It is learned that President Truman's compensation problem advisor Edwin Pauley may come to Beijing from Korea around the 16th. It is also heard that the U.S. side will have a detailed decision within weeks on which Japanese factories should be retained and which should be used for compensation.

### Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Fly to Beijing; Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek Also Returns on the Same Plane

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] Special Envoy Marshall and his wife arrived in Beijing by plane from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 16th. They got off the plane at 4:13 PM. Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek also returned to Beijing on the same plane. When Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek got off the plane, her expression was very happy. Reporters asked those around her about Mrs. Marshall's condition. They said that Mrs. Marshall had no symptoms of illness. Mrs. Marshall said that she was very happy to have this short trip. The Marshalls left the airport at 4:15 PM. When the car arrived at Zhonghua Gate, it happened that President Chiang was driving by. He immediately stopped the car, greeted each other, and then went to the residence together to rest.

[Central News Agency, This City News] Five-Star General Special Envoy Marshall came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday to visit his wife's condition. He stayed in Shanghai for less than 30 hours and hurriedly took his wife, who had been with him for decades, back to Nanjing by plane at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. The U.S. military did not disclose what special mission Marshall had on this trip, but said that he came specifically to pick up his wife and return to Beijing. Marshal Marshall has two sons and one daughter. His eldest son died in Europe during the war. Mrs. Marshall is still grieving and came to China with her husband in March this year. Her health has not improved and she is still recuperating.

### Strengthening Military Defense; Northeast Divided into Five Pacification Zones; Armistice Issue Has Not Yet Been Agreed Upon

[Our Nanjing Office, 16th] A reporter recently visited a senior official and asked about the key to the overall situation. According to reports, the safety of the overall situation only depends on the word "sincerity." Currently, the Chinese people are generally disappointed with the CCP's lack of "sincerity," but the government is still expecting with the greatest patience and determination. The crux of the problem is not the new plan or the old plan. This can be seen in the recent remarks of the CCP representatives. The period of depression has not yet passed.

[Our Beiping Office, 15th] General Gillem returned to Beiping on the afternoon of the 15th. At the airport, he told Cai Wenzhi and Luo Ruiqing, who greeted him, that his trip to Nanjing had resulted in an agreement on mediation work, but he did not explicitly state whether this agreement was the new military mediation method that was rumored to be passed as long as both parties agreed. Gillem also said that the most important Northeast armistice issue has not yet been resolved, but with Marshall's mediation, President Chiang has directly participated in the Northeast issue negotiations since the 11th, and Gillem was also present at these talks. It is also learned that Gillem's trip not only reached an agreement on the Central Plains issue and temporarily settled this "serious situation," but also provided considerable assistance to the negotiation on resolving the Northeast issue. After all, he is the direct person in charge of the mediation for several months. If the rumored new mediation method is true, it is probably a new method to deal with the current difficult problems based on his experience in mediation for several months.

[Our Beiping Office, 15th] A reporter recently asked Luo Ruiqing, the Communist Party's Chief of Staff of the Executive Headquarters, a question, saying that he received a telegram from Beijing saying that the Northeast armistice might be signed tonight. Luo said he had not heard Gillem say this. Regarding the rumored new mediation method that can be passed as long as Nanjing agrees, Luo also said that Gillem only said that there was an agreement, but did not explicitly say that it was an agreement like the rumor. Luo expressed doubt about this rumor.

[Our Beiping Office, 15th] A powerful figure in the CCP told reporters that before the Northeast armistice, it cannot be expected that the situation of traffic disruption in various places will improve. The situation will gradually deteriorate. He did not deny that there will be a major battle in Gongzhuling. Some people are quite worried about whether the entire trend in the Northeast and even inside Shanhaiguan will change by waiting for the Changchun issue to be resolved.

[Our Beiping Office, 16th] The government side of the Executive Headquarters recently dispatched Major General Liu Jianyi and Major General Xia Jiafu as the leaders of the 28th and 29th groups in the Northeast. They flew to Shenyang on the morning of the 16th.

[United Press, Beiping, 16th] The New Life Daily reported that General Du Yuming has ordered the Northeast to be divided into five pacification zones to strengthen military defense, with one pacification director for each zone. Mou Tingfang, commander of the 94th Army, recently arrived here from Shenyang. He said that Sipingjie can be completely recovered within days. However, according to Communist sources, the Communist army is in an advantageous position in the Sipingjie battle.

[United Press, Shenyang, 16th] According to sources in Du Yuming's headquarters, in the past 24 hours, the National Army has extended its control area along the railway lines from Shenyang to various places. There are various signs in Shenyang that the National Army is consolidating its base and will launch a large-scale general offensive towards Sipingjie and Changchun in the coming weeks after driving the Communist army out of the traffic line area. Yesterday, the National Army began to attack 30,000 to 40,000 Communist troops concentrated on the east side of the railway line between Shenyang and Sipingjie, driving them 40 li to the east.

[Another dispatch] A senior Communist official in Shenyang revealed that Lu Chengcao (transliteration) of Zhang Xueliang's former command is now commanding the Communist army's defense in Sipingjie. He also said that Lu is not a member of the Communist Party. In 1937, he was an officer in the 53rd Northeast Army. Before the Xi'an Incident, the army was personally led by Zhang Xueliang.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 16th] According to reports, fierce battles are taking place in Chifeng, Rehe, and Xifengkou of the Great Wall. The Communist army intends to advance towards Liaoning.

### Executive Teams Work; No Hindrance or Obstruction; Gillem Obtains Agreement in Beijing

[Our Beiping Office, 16th] It is confirmed that it is not as rumored outside, but an agreement limited to the actions of the Executive Teams. The main points of the agreement are divided into two: (1) No unit or organization of any party may hinder or obstruct the actions of the Executive Teams. (2) If any party of the Executive Team proposes to go to a certain place for investigation, mediation, or other matters, it can be established with the consent of the other party. No single party has the right to veto. However, this new method does not apply to the Executive Teams' discussion of specific issues, nor does it apply to the Executive Headquarters or the Three-Person Team above it, but is limited to deciding on the actions of the Executive Teams. In the past, the actions of the Executive Teams were hindered or obstructed by the local units under the pretext of not reaching the orders of the superiors. Also, when a party proposed that the Executive Team must go to a certain place for inspection or mediation, if a certain party felt that it was unfavorable to them, they would veto it by objecting, which hindered the solution of many problems.

[Our Beiping Office, 16th] After Gillem and Hill arrived in Beijing, they made suggestions on accelerating the efficiency of the Executive Headquarters and Executive Teams' mediation work. Later, the Military Affairs Three-Person Team discussed and obtained improved methods and universally signed instruction documents, which were issued to the Executive Headquarters. The main contents included (1) Stipulating that Executive Teams should have equal opportunities to investigate the government and the CCP, and the U.S. representative of the Executive Team can propose a draft investigation procedure, which will be executed after the three parties agree. If it is difficult to reach an agreement, it can be submitted to the Executive Headquarters for resolution within 24 hours. (2) For those who request Executive Teams to investigate with false information, the Three-Person Team can take effective sanctions. (3) Local authorities should protect and assist the work of the Executive Teams and should not hinder or delay the actions of the Executive Teams.

### Communist Army Destroys Beining and Jinpu Railways

[Our Beiping Office, 16th] It has been learned here that the Communist army has recently destroyed the railway as follows: (1) The Beining Railway can run to Qiansuo. The situation east of Qiansuo is unknown. It is speculated that Gaoling has been occupied by the Communist army. The Communist army in that area is ten times larger than the National Army. It is heard that a part of the National Army is completely surrounded by the Communist army. The Communist army east of Qiansuo is destroying it on a large scale. The rails have been transported away. The Jinyu Line cannot pass through in recent days. (3) There are no battles south of Cang County on the Jinpu Line today, but Botou and Fengjiakou are still in the hands of the Communist army. A big fire broke out in the Zha River from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM yesterday, destroying many houses. The Communist army is transporting troops south of the Zha River on small trains. (3) At Zhu Nan Zhuang, six miles north of Beicang in the Pingjin section, more than 3,000 Communist troops launched a surprise attack at 12:00 last night. After the National Army met them, they retreated at 5:00 AM this morning. In Tanggezhuang, southwest of Huangcun, the Communist army recruited 4,000 laborers to prepare to destroy the road. On the other hand, the National Army recovered Anci County at 5:00 AM this morning. A big fire broke out when the Communist army retreated.

### Soviet Army Completely Withdraws from Northeast China; Commander Dong Chanping Has Received Official Notice; Inquiries from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Have Not Yet Been Answered

[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] Foreign Minister Liu today stated that Dong Chanping, the head of the military delegation stationed in Vladivostok with the Soviet army, has received official notice from the Soviet side stating that the Soviet army has completely withdrawn from the Northeast, and Dalian, as one of the ports in the Northeast, is also included in the withdrawal. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously officially inquired of Moscow whether the Soviet army had completely withdrawn, and has not yet received a reply. According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Union can use Lushun as a military base. It is estimated that the Soviet army in that area has not withdrawn. Or, in response to the saying that the Soviet diplomatic and railway personnel have all withdrawn due to the unstable military situation in the Northeast, Liu said that the National Government recently agreed to set up a Soviet consulate in Shenyang, but no Soviet consuls have yet arrived in various parts of the Northeast. If there were Soviet diplomats in the Northeast ten days ago, they must have been representatives previously sent by the Soviet Union to the Puppet Manchukuo. As for the withdrawal of railway personnel, the Soviet Embassy has notified the National Government that the reason is "lack of protection." The National Government replied that Chinese personnel on the Changchun Railway have been ordered to remain in their posts and work, and hoped that the Soviet side would do the same.

### Shenyang and Shanghai Prepare for Direct Telephone and Telegraph Communications

[Our Beiping Office, 16th] The Northeast Electric Administration is actively strengthening itself. The Office of the Northeast District Telecommunications Traffic Receiving Committee will soon be abolished and the Ninth District Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Communications will be established. It is also actively preparing for direct telegraph and telephone communications between Shenyang and Shanghai and Nanjing. The person in charge of Northeast Electric Administration in Ping had purchased a large number of telecommunications materials and borrowed a 5,000-kilowatt station line and a telephone and telegraph machine from the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau.

### Zeng Shucheng Succeeds as Mayor of Kunming

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 16th] Chen Yuke, the mayor of Kunming, resigned from his position as mayor with reference to a National Assembly representative in the Pacification District and has been approved. The newly appointed mayor Zeng Shucheng took office at 2:00 PM today.

It is heard that this trip is to inspect the situation in the Northeast and the reorganization of the Northeast troops. Furthermore, General Sun Liren, who attended the United Nations Staff Conference, came to Beijing from Shanghai today. It is heard that after Sun met with President Chiang to report on his duties, he may turn to Manchuria to inspect and take the opportunity to comfort the comrades of the New First Army.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 16th] Bai Chongxi flew to Beiping at 2:00 PM on the 16th and will fly to Manchuria on the 17th for inspection.

### Current State of Transportation Between Guangdong and Hong Kong

— By Our Hong Kong Correspondent, Lin Youlan

General Festing of the British Army visited Guangdong on the 8th on official business. On the 10th, he hosted Guangzhou newspaper reporters and stated: "Guangzhou and Hong Kong are sister cities, and it is essential to understand each other's environments and maintain close contact… Now Hong Kong has transitioned from military to civil administration, but traditional policies will not change, and its friendly relationship with China will also remain unchanged… Currently, the world is experiencing post-war food shortages and social disorder, and Guangdong and Hong Kong are no exception…" General Festing traveled to Guangdong on a British naval speedboat. On the same day he made his remarks, an unprecedented tragedy occurred on the Guangzhou-Kowloon railway line, involving "more than a dozen deaths and injuries and losses of 200 million," shocking the societies of Guangdong and Hong Kong.

The light express train on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway departed from Guangzhou at 7:00 AM on the 10th. As it approached Nangang, more than a dozen bandits suddenly opened fire from the hillside, unleashing a barrage of bullets on the train. Simultaneously, a landmine exploded on the tracks with three loud blasts, instantly shattering the locomotive. The driver and three passengers were killed immediately, while the conductor and nine travelers were seriously injured, and three others sustained minor injuries. The bandits rushed onto the train, demanding valuables from the passengers for about twenty minutes before fleeing.

The greatest loss among the passengers was suffered by a merchant who carried 70 million in national currency. A high-ranking provincial government official, Mr. Liang, also carried 50 million in national currency, and another merchant carried 30,000 Hong Kong dollars, all of which were stolen. According to eyewitness accounts from passengers, the bandits were all dressed in black plain clothes and carried Japanese pistols. One of the bandits produced a card printed with the three characters "Zhu Guang Kang," identifying himself to the passengers as a Red Army soldier and assuring them not to panic.

Nangang, the site of the incident, is strategically located in the Dongjiang area. Twenty years ago, it was a gathering place for Dongjiang outlaws. It is now considered a haven for communist guerrillas calling themselves the "Dongjiang Detachment," located about 23 kilometers from Guangzhou. The nearby hillside where the incident occurred originally had a fort, but it is said that the garrison was being changed that day. The old troops had left, and the new troops had not yet arrived, creating an opportunity for the tragedy.

The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was quite safe before the war. After this incident, the Guangdong provincial authorities are taking it very seriously and are currently conducting a thorough investigation. It is rumored that a system of joint defense, joint guarantee, and collective responsibility will be implemented to maintain transportation and protect the safety of passengers. Starting from the 12th, additional soldiers armed with live ammunition have been dispatched to patrol critical points along the railway line. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is the most important nerve center for transportation in Southern China, and ensuring the safety of its operations is essential. Although the land distance between Guangzhou and Hong Kong is only 112 miles, if transportation between the two places is interrupted, foreign goods cannot be imported, and local products cannot be exported, making them like two unconnected planets. In addition to the railway, there are also ships for transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong. However, before the war, the Guangzhou-Kowloon express train ran two times daily, and the demand remained high. The train journey only took three hours, while the ship journey took at least six and a half hours. Therefore, many passengers chose to travel by land. In case of emergencies, it was possible to make a round trip within a day. After the war, due to coal shortages, damaged tracks, and outdated locomotives, the travel time has doubled compared to before the war. It now takes at least eight hours. The shipping service was restored not long ago, but there is a lack of vessels, and the schedule has been reduced, with an average of only one ship every two days. The railway bureau initially planned to imitate the pre-war method and add one train daily, but there are not enough carriages and locomotives, making it impossible to proceed. Unable to do anything else, they came up with a type of light express train. This type of train has two carriages and two locomotives. The locomotives are converted from car engines, using gasoline as fuel, and each can carry 9 to 12 passengers. The train involved in the incident carried 41 passengers, including five female passengers.

The light express train takes about five hours for the entire journey, which is still slower than the special express train before the war. The fare is about twice as high as the special express train, but many passengers choose it to save time. Unexpectedly, this tragedy occurred in less than a month of operation! As Southern China recovers, transportation on the Guangzhou-Kowloon line is becoming more frequent every day and will not be affected by this tragedy. On the contrary, this tragedy has strengthened the authorities' determination to improve transportation on the Guangzhou-Kowloon line and made people in the country newly aware of the importance of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway.

The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway connects to the Yuehan Railway. With active repairs by the authorities, the Yuehan Railway will be fully operational within half a year, connecting Southern and Central China. The significant role that the Yuehan Railway played during the War of Resistance is expected to have even more glorious performance during the recovery period. Not to mention the distant future, Hunan is currently suffering from famine, but due to transportation issues, tens of thousands of tons of food from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are stuck in the warehouses of Hong Kong, unable to be transported for relief. The UNRRA has also recently shipped a large number of railway equipment and carriages to assist in the restoration of the Yuehan Railway.

To strengthen transportation in Southern China, the authorities allocated a large sum of money two months ago to begin repairing the Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway. The section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway from Kowloon to Shenzhen, the border between China and Britain, was undamaged when the Japanese surrendered. However, the section from Shenzhen to Guangzhou was damaged by the Japanese first and then by the communists. Now, the authorities are collecting road materials from all sources, gathering specialized technicians, and accelerating repairs. It is said that the entire road will be open to traffic by June 10th. At that time, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway will be "as if a tiger has grown wings," and transportation in Southern China will have a leap forward. Air transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong has also been quite smooth since the border opened, with the entire journey taking only 45 minutes. (May 13th)

### Li Qing Tian Hosts Press Conference in Nanjing; Korean Restoration Army Prepares for Demobilization; Current Hope is for People to Live in Stability

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] As the Korean Restoration Army is about to demobilize and return to its home country, the General Headquarters hosted a press conference this afternoon to express its farewell. General Commander Li Qing Tian presided, reported on the current political situation in Korea, and released a demobilization declaration. According to Li, Korea is currently facing famine. Although Korea produces rice, the northern part of the country, under Soviet military control, cannot transport rice to the south, which is under U.S. control. Before the Japanese surrender, all Korean currency amounted to only 140 billion won. After the U.S. and Soviet forces took over, the U.S. issued 400 billion won, and the Soviet Union issued tens of billions, totaling about 1 trillion won. The army was established in Chongqing in 1940. It coordinated with the First, Second, Third, Fifth War Zones of China and the Allied forces in South Myanmar and India to fight against Japan. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, it is about to retire and return to its home country. The army currently has a total of 1,100 soldiers stationed in Tianjin, Shanghai and other places, waiting to return to their country by ship. The Korean government is still led by the provisional government formed by Kim Gu, with U.S. guidance, while the Soviet-occupied areas have established a People's Committee. Their current hope is for people's stable living conditions.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] General Commander of the Korean Restoration Army, Li Qing Tian, hosted a press conference at Anle Restaurant at 3:00 PM on the 16th to announce that the army would demobilize from now on, and all personnel would return to Korea to participate in construction projects. The army has been established for seven years, and according to Li, its development has been as follows: "The predecessor of our army was the National Defense Revolutionary Army within the country, the Great Korean West Route Army Political Department in the Northeast, the North Route Army Political Department, the Korean Independence Army, the Koryo Revolutionary Army, the Sino-Korean Allied Army, and the Sino-Korean Joint Punitive Army. In 1940, with the outbreak of the Pacific War, our army was recognized by the government of your country, and a new army was organized with support. It was formally established in Chongqing. Now that the enemy has surrendered and Korea has been restored, our army's mission of cooperating in combat within your country has come to an end. We announce our demobilization, and all personnel will return to the country to engage in construction work. Our army is grateful for the deep moral assistance from the wise figures in your country's government and the public for more than 30 years."

The trip to Nantong by the three-person group has been cancelled. The group dispatched by the Beiping Military Mediation Department arrived in Huaiyin on the 10th of this month and has now returned to Beiping to report on its mission. As for the rumors of conflict in Northern Jiangsu, according to communist sources here, minor conflicts occurred in several towns near Nantong in the middle of last month, and the external rumors must have originated from this.

### Delays in Wuhan Telegrams; Hope That Transportation Authorities Will Quickly Improve

[Our Hankou Airmail] News telegrams and telegrams sent from Wuhan to Shanghai have often been delayed for more than two days. The Shanghai newspaper's correspondent in Wuhan has repeatedly contacted the Wuhan Telecommunications Bureau, but there has been no improvement. It is understood that the bureau's express message room for messages sent to Shanghai only has a damaged machine left behind by the enemy, and due to performance reasons, only Japanese employees can repair it, so it is impossible to work whenever it is damaged. Although the bureau's telegraphers intend to find ways to strengthen it, they are filled with the sentiment that they "cannot do anything" due to the failure of the machines. It is generally believed that Wuhan has a population of nearly one million, but the telecommunications equipment is so simple. It is hoped that the transportation authorities will make long-term improvements.

### Communist Troops Invading Changchun Are Mostly Bandits and Puppets; This Is What Is Meant by the "Democratic Allied Army"

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th] Since last October until the fall of Changchun, I have worked in Changchun for half a year, and I would like to point out the following facts to the people of the country. Zhou Baozhong, who commanded the invasion, was appointed by the CCP as the "Commander of the Jilin-Liaoning Military Region" and is now also the Garrison Commander of Changchun. He was the "Lieutenant Colonel Huang" who was active in Changchun between October 11th and 12th of last year. After the national government officially took over Changchun on December 22nd, this "Lieutenant Colonel Huang" withdrew from Changchun. On December 27th, under the title of "General Zhou Baozhong," he used cars to forcibly transport gentry from five or six counties around Changchun to hold a "Jilin Provincial People's Representative Conference" in Chaluhe, 120 miles south of Jilin. As a result, "General Zhou Baozhong" was "elected" to become "Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government." In that representative conference, Zhou Jingwen, who was in Chongqing, was also elected as vice chairman. Zhang Qinghe, the deputy commander of this attack on Changchun, was the director of the Changchun Public Security Bureau in early November. The first retreat of the receiver personnel on November 17th was caused by the threats and harassment of this "Director" Zhang. When Mayor Zhao Junmai received the transfer, he was ordered to lead troops to withdraw from Changchun and had been wandering around the Nongan-Dehui area for several months. This time he has returned as the deputy commander of the invasion. He is a puppet Manchukuo officer. When I was in Changchun, I saw in a Japanese magazine that he gave a speech at a "National Warriors' Symposium" in 1943, but now he has been cited as a cadre of the "Democratic Generals." The "Mayor" of the communist troops in Changchun City is also Liu Juying, who continued to act as "Mayor" for sixteen days after succeeding Yuan on November of last year, before being forced to withdraw under pressure from our government. Since January of this year, she has served as the "Secretary-General" of "Chairman" Zhou Baozhong, entrenched in the Chaluhe-Panshi area of Jilin, which is a typical area of bandits and puppets in Changchun. It is said that she has relatives with Li Yunchang. The return of the above three figures is merely a reenactment of the situation between October 11th and 12th of last year, except with the addition of Peng Zhen and Lin Feng from Yan'an. "General Zhou Baozhong, ""Mayor" Liu Juying," the puppet Manchukuo "youngster" Zhang Qinghe, plus the likes of Peng Zhen and Lin Feng from Yan'an, the three-in-one has created the current situation in Changchun. This situation has been born since October of last year. This kind of three-in-one form can also explain the essence of the entire Northeast issue. From the figures who are now putting on a performance, we can understand the meaning of the so-called "Democratic Allied Army" and "Autonomous Government." I hope that the people of the country will pay special attention to the Communist Party's unscrupulous approach to seizing territory, which is included in the words "Allied" and "Autonomous."

### CCP Director of the Military Mediation Department Shot at in Car in Beiping

The car window was shattered, but Song was not injured. Today, Ye Jianying personally went to the Beiping Garrison Command and the Municipal Police Bureau to request the arrest of the perpetrator. According to the police bureau personnel who inspected the car, the weapon used to attack the car was likely a Browning pistol.

### Japanese Prisoners Drown Near Nanjing After Boat Capsizes

At 3 PM on the 16th, the ship docked at Pier No. 3 to disembark the prisoners. Due to overcrowding on the lighters, over 300 Japanese prisoners went onto a large barge moored alongside the pier to rest. Unexpectedly, the barge capsized due to being overloaded, causing all those onboard to fall into the water. Pier staff, laborers, and military police made every effort to rescue them, saving over 200 people. Nearly a hundred drowned.

### Tainan's Anping Port Renovation Project to be Completed in Five Years

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 16th] Anping Port in Tainan was originally one of Taiwan's best ports. However, in recent years, silt and sand accumulation have made it difficult for large ships to enter and exit. The Tainan City Government plans to raise NT$100 million to renovate the port and canals, with completion expected in five years. Anping Port was built by the Dutch in 1630. Zheng Chenggong led his troops to attack and enter the port. The "Old Port" is actually Anping Port. The Japanese built the port from 1922 to 1925 and constructed a canal, including docks, cargo yards, warehouses, ice factories, and fish markets. However, silt accumulation recurred, and in 1925, a new port was opened south of the original port, which took three years. It has not been repaired in recent years and is severely damaged. The current plan is to build two breakwaters, each 1,800 meters long, outside the port to accommodate ships of approximately 3,000 tons. The sand and mud dredged from the port will be used to fill the low-lying areas south of the port to create an industrial zone.

### Local Dispatches

Songjiang

Defense is Effective, Mutinous Troops Retreat: More than a hundred mutinous soldiers from the former Wang Bamei unit stationed in Pinghu and Zhapu boarded three ships on the afternoon of the 10th, carrying new-style weapons, intending to cause trouble at the Jinshanzui estuary in the county.

Hangzhou

American Agricultural Expert Comes to Hangzhou for Observation: American agricultural expert Mr. Homer, hired by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry as a consultant to its extension council, was accompanied by technician Yang Maochun of the ministry to inspect agricultural conditions in Hangzhou. He has now completed his work and returned to Beijing via Shanghai to report to the ministry. Mr. Homer is also cooperating with relief organizations such as the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Based on his investigation, he suggested that the relief branch allocate seeds, fertilizers, farm implements, livestock, instruments, medicines, and other supplies according to the needs of each locality to assist in the agricultural reconstruction work in various inland areas. Recently, the United States organized a Chinese agricultural advisory group, and Mr. Homer is also participating as a member.

Suzhou

Training Police and Establishing Supplementary Schools: The county government believes that police chiefs are subordinate cadres of the police force, responsible for directly protecting public order and implementing government orders. Their quality must be continuously improved so that police administration can have a good performance. Most of the current police chiefs in the county were transferred from the puppet regime. Their habits are deeply ingrained, and they are often resistant to government orders. Unless they are strictly trained, it is impossible to talk about rectification. It is proposed to establish a supplementary school for police chiefs and separately recruit and transfer outstanding police officers to provide them with rigorous training. Preparations have already begun, and the budget has been prepared. It will begin as soon as approval is received.

Confiscating Enemy-Occupied Houses Separately: The Suzhou Office of the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau stated that Chen Zemin, Gao Guanwu, Yu Bailu, Tang Huimin, and others all have properties in Suzhou that should be confiscated in accordance with national laws. On the 13th, Wang Yuntai, head of the Enemy Property Section, was dispatched to execute the confiscations separately at each address. These included Chen Zemin's house at No. 69 Furenfang, with more than 200 pieces of rosewood furniture; Gao Guanwu's Western-style house at No. 99 Xihai Island; Yu Bailu's Western-style house at No. 9 Qiaoyuan Bridge; and Tang Huimin's house at No. 16 Ruyi Lane, Shiquan Street, with more than 90 pieces of rosewood furniture. All items were counted, registered, and confiscated pending further handling.

Changshu

(3) The barren land at Xiaoshantou outside the West Gate has been designated as a reclamation zone. If the soil quality is poor, it will be converted into a public cemetery. (4) Wang Zhengzhi, captain of the water police team, was prosecuted by the District Court Procuratorate and publicly tried for gambling protection, extortion, and forced donations from ships. (5) A large gambling den was raided at the Luochunge teahouse in Fanjiashi outside the Xiaodongmen, and fifteen gamblers were arrested.

County Government to Construct a Ring Road: The ring road of the county, which began construction before the war but has not yet been completed, has been urged by the County Provisional Council to be built by the county government. The county government replied expressing that the construction of the ring road has been listed as a construction project plan of this county. Once the funds are available, construction can begin.

Jiangyin

County Government Prohibits Solicitation of Litigation: Since the restoration of this county, civil and criminal lawsuits have increased. Magistrate Fang specially ordered the district, township, and town offices to establish mediation committees. In the future, if people have civil disputes, they must first apply for mediation. If they truly wish to litigate, the complaint must be accompanied by a certificate proving the mediation was unsuccessful. The complainant must also sign and seal the complaint before it can be accepted. Anyone found colluding in litigation will be severely investigated and punished.

Nantong

Memorial Service for Fallen Soldiers: The people of this county held a memorial service for the fallen soldiers and martyrs of Xiaohai and Guanshui towns the other day. More than fifty units participated. At 9:00 AM, the memorial service began. Chairman Liu, commander of the 105th Division, reported on the combat situation. Wang, deputy commander, Commissioner Xu, Magistrate Yang, Qian Xiaowu, and others then gave speeches. Representatives of various government agencies and units then offered sacrifices.

Wuhu

Rice Prices Soar, Tea Market Slumps: Due to some people recklessly bidding up prices, rice prices in Wuhu have soared from 20,000 to over 40,000 in a week, causing small merchants to hoard and refuse to sell retail, leading to widespread panic among the people and turmoil in the market. A small number of rice merchants with a strong sense of responsibility, seeing that no one from the government was intervening, voluntarily stopped trading with outsiders for three days and agreed to keep the market price within 40,000, which was able to calm the situation for a while. However, speculators learned that rice prices in Guangdong had reached an index of 90,000 to 100,000, and their desire for profit became uncontrollable. They started aggressively buying again, and in the morning and afternoon of the past two days, prices rose sharply by more than 8,000, with milled rice now exceeding 43,000. It has been found that this rice all comes from the sea and is obtained by using the name of the tea company to obtain agricultural loans of 200,000,000 yuan, colluding with prominent figures in Wuhu and relying on their power to obtain huge profits. Although public opinion has repeatedly appealed for the sake of the people, the authorities remain indifferent. As capital is poured into rice, tea, which is Anhui's only foreign trade product, is now in decline at a time when it should be revitalized. The best *taijian* (tea bud) is now only selling for around 300,000 yuan, strip tea for 130,000 to 140,000, and stored tea for 150,000 to 160,000. The position of our world-renowned tea in foreign countries may be completely undermined.

Editorial

### Recent Personnel Changes in the Government

The Central Standing Committee and the Supreme National Defense Council held meetings the day before yesterday. In addition to adjusting the organization of the Central Party Headquarters and implementing austerity measures, Peng Xuepei was also selected as the Minister of Propaganda to succeed Wu Guozhen, who was transferred to be the mayor of Shanghai. In addition, military industry expert Yu Dawei was appointed Minister of Transportation, and scientific management expert Wang Yunwu was appointed Minister of Economic Affairs. Both are non-partisan individuals, demonstrating the government's sincerity in broadly soliciting social talents to jointly manage the country. At the same time, the national defense and military organization was adjusted, merging the Military Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Military Administration, the Ministry of Military Training, and the Ministry of Political Affairs into a single Ministry of National Defense, with General Bai Chongxi appointed as the Minister of National Defense and young General Chen Cheng as the Chief of General Staff, officially established on June 1st. This is the first personnel change since the National Government returned to the capital and can also be said to be the first step in the central government's reform of the party, government, and military mechanisms, "enhancing administrative efficiency, rectifying organizations at all levels, clarifying responsibilities, abolishing all redundant organizations, simplifying administrative procedures, and implementing tiered accountability." We hope that the government will start anew with the people, and this initial adjustment by the government is worthy of everyone's attention.

From the perspective of political common sense and examples from various countries, personnel changes and partial reorganizations are common occurrences in politics because the most important thing in politics is policy, not personnel. However, China's current politics has not completely broken away from the stage of "rule by man," and there is often a feeling that "when the person exists, the policy is implemented; when the person dies, the policy ceases." Therefore, the advancement and retreat of people can often affect the rise and fall of events. Does this personnel change in the central government contain the meaning of changing policies, or is it only aimed at enhancing administrative efficiency?

We do not deny that the current Chinese politics is difficult to satisfy people and that there are many areas that urgently need reform. What the people of the whole country are looking forward to is the gradual realization of the "Peaceful Nation-Building Program" passed by the Political Consultative Conference. In other words, it is to reorganize the National Government to accommodate people from all parties and factions to participate, and to convene the National Assembly on May 5th to formulate a constitution to embark on the right track of democratic politics. However, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is creating wars in the Northeast and launching attacks everywhere within the Great Wall, and it stubbornly holds to its views on the draft constitution and refuses to compromise even slightly. As for the government reorganization and the National Assembly, it refuses to provide a list of nominees, so that the National Assembly, which the people have been eagerly awaiting, has to be postponed again, and the government reorganization has also been blocked. However, the central political authorities urgently need to start anew with the people and strive to revitalize the country and must not continue to procrastinate like this, causing everyone to hold a "five-day mayor" mentality, making government efficiency even lower. Therefore, the central authorities decided to automatically carry out partial reorganization and at the same time recruit social talents to participate in order to strengthen administrative efficiency. We believe that the government's fundamental policy of post-war reconstruction will not be affected by personnel changes. Furthermore, in terms of the candidates succeeding as ministers, Wang Yunwu and Yu Dawei are both non-partisan experts and scholars. Although we oppose the erroneous idea of "those who excel in academics should become officials" in academic and cultural circles, it seems that in today's China, if the government can recruit domestic experts and scholars to participate in the government and hold important positions, it is still something worthy of encouragement. The government not only regards the democratization of politics as the highest principle but has also begun to advance towards this goal. We dare to say that this central personnel change is the first step in China's politics towards democratization. On the other hand, let us take a look at the CCP, which has always flaunted "democracy." Apart from loudly shouting about democracy, what facts of democratization has it shown to the people in politics!

Prior to the central personnel change, the Shanghai Municipal Government was also reorganized. The Executive Yuan's regular meeting appointed Wu Guozhen as the mayor of Shanghai, and the secretary-general of the municipal government, the director of the finance bureau, the director of the health bureau, and the director of the political affairs bureau have also been replaced. The new mayor will soon bring the new directors to Shanghai to take office. This is also the beginning of Shanghai's municipal administration after the war entering a new stage. Shanghai is an international metropolis where Chinese and foreigners live together. In the past, the existence of concessions was regarded as a source of evil. During the War of Resistance, Shanghai first became an isolated island, suffering the oppression of the enemy, and then became an occupied area, directly suffering the destruction and poisoning of the enemy and puppet regimes, almost becoming the darkest place on earth. Last autumn, the Japanese invaders surrendered, the sun and moon shone again, and former Mayor Qian Dajun arrived in Shanghai with the national army and took office as the first mayor of Shanghai after the war. Eight months have passed since then, and it has been difficult to manage. Shanghai's environment is inherently unique, coupled with the inevitable chaos after the war. Qian Dajun has tried his best to reform the municipal administration, but its effectiveness is difficult to achieve overnight. Moreover, what the citizens of Shanghai suffer most today is the high prices and the difficulty of life, and the control of materials and the management of transportation are beyond the power of the local authorities. There is a desire to govern, but the power and responsibility do not belong to the same person, so it is appropriate that he is exhausted and has to leave office. We cannot hastily judge the merits and demerits of the first mayor of Shanghai after the restoration at this moment, but we can at least say that for a local official, if you want him to be responsible, you should first give him the powers that he should have. If he has a position but no authority, all matters, or at least some matters, are subject to the constraints of all parties, then the cautious will have nothing to do, and the reckless will have something to shirk. If this system does not change, we are afraid that changing local officials a hundred times will not help.

Therefore, before the new mayor comes to Shanghai, we would like to ask the central authorities to give the new mayor as much power as he should have. Local politics is the responsibility of the local officials, and the central government's supervision and encouragement are enough to fulfill the duty of promoting the state affairs. It is not necessary for all matters to be directly managed by the central government departments. How to review the past, plan for the future, and grasp the reality to build a post-war Shanghai is the common wish of the four million citizens of Shanghai and also the ambition that the new mayor should have. I remember that before the War of Resistance, the Shanghai Municipal Government, although there were concessions at that time and the area it governed was limited, had a consistent plan to build an ideal Shanghai. Although this ideal could not be fully realized due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the spirit of governing and the style of not easily changing personnel at that time are still praised by the citizens. Therefore, I still hope that the new mayor, within the scope of his powers and responsibilities, will carry forward the policies and spirit of the municipal government before the war, build a great Shanghai, and especially hope that the central government will first give him power and then hold him accountable.

In addition, China's politics has not yet implemented a civil service system, and often due to the change of the head, even the clerks and staff are often transferred in large numbers. Wang Yunwu said yesterday that he would not easily change personnel after he arrived at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which is commendable. It is already hard enough to be a civil servant, and they still have to "walk through the doors of the dukes and ministers, serving at the side of the powerful and noble," floating with the political tides, which is not only uneconomical for his personal economy, but also uneconomical for society and the country. In this way, administration can never get on the right track. In short, we hope that both the central and Shanghai municipal governments will change their personnel and work together to create a new situation!

### British Government Announces Indian Federal Organization Outline in the House of Commons: Establishment of Provisional Government at the Full Discretion of the Governor-General of India; Cabinet Delegation to Leave India and Return to London at the End of the Month

[Our Dispatch] London, 16th, Broadcast: British Prime Minister Attlee announced this afternoon at 2:00 PM (Greenwich Time) in the House of Commons the Indian Federal Plan, which contains six major outlines. This plan was drafted by the three-member British Cabinet delegation visiting India because negotiations between Indian leaders on the Indian Independence and Provisional Government Plan have failed during the drafting period of the new constitution. The so-called six major outlines are as follows:

(1) Establish an Indian Federation, including so-called British India and India's six hundred tribes. (2) Establish a central administrative department and legislative assembly. Any major issue must be approved by the majority of the legislative assembly and the National Congress Party and the Muslim League before it can be passed. (3) Other government issues (remaining issues) may be handled by the provinces. (4) Tribes also maintain all their powers and do not transfer them to the federation. (5) Provinces may establish districts, and districts may also establish administrative departments and legislative assemblies. (6) In the federal and district constitutions, it is stipulated that any provincial legislative assembly may reconsider the constitution by voting after the first ten years and every ten years thereafter.

The Cabinet Delegation also proposed the establishment of a transitional government, with all departments handled by Indians.

Further News: Attlee admitted in the House of Commons that the British delegation's efforts in India had completely failed. He said that Gandhi's response to the British side was only two words: "Quit India." Gandhi also incited Indians to riot in various places, but it has been quelled.

[Our Dispatch] London, 16th, Broadcast: The British Cabinet Delegation decided to leave India and return to London before the end of the month. All matters related to the organization of the provisional government will be handled at the full discretion of the Governor-General of India, Wavell.

Harmonizing the Demands of Both Factions and Considering the Interests of All States

[Reuters, New Delhi, 16th] India is now awaiting the announcement of the British Cabinet Mission's recommendations on Indian independence. Lord Lawrence will make a fifteen-minute broadcast simultaneously in London and New Delhi after the publication of the communiqué, and will then convene a press conference with Cripps and Alexander. Another press conference will be held the following day. Governor-General Wavell will also make a fifteen-minute broadcast on Friday night. The Cabinet Delegation may convene representatives of the Indian National Congress Party and the Muslim League today to discuss their recommendations. Former Congress Party Chairman Acharya, current Chairman Nehru, and Gandhi have all been invited to attend. Muslim League Chairman Jinnah has not come forward since the breakdown of the Shimla Summit Conference, so his secretary Ali Khan will attend. The British Cabinet representatives have kept the recommendations secret before their official announcement. The Cabinet representatives have presented long-term recommendations. Prior consideration has been given to the minimum requirements of the two factions in India and the interests of the various Indian states. It is generally expected that these recommendations will not differ too much from the principles previously announced by the Cabinet.

### Breaking the Political Stalemate in Japan: Shigeru Yoshida Appointed to Form a Cabinet; Gathering Talents, the New Cabinet Has a Conservative Nature

[Our Newspaper News] Tokyo, 16th - Radio broadcast: At 2:45 PM today, the Emperor ordered Yoshida to organize a new cabinet to address various post-war issues. The political stalemate that had persisted for 24 days since Shidehara's resignation has finally been broken. After leaving his high school post, Mr. Yoshida immediately went to the Prime Minister's official residence to consider and finalize the members of the new cabinet, and issued a statement saying that the Emperor emphasized the urgent need to resolve issues such as food supply. He pledged to complete the cabinet formation swiftly. He also stated that he would seek out ordinary talents to overcome difficulties and achieve national unity. The cabinet formation work is currently being carried out rapidly with State Minister Ishiguro acting as advisor, and Jiyuto (Liberal Party) member Etsujiro Uehara and Shidehara, the leader of the Shinpoto (Progressive Party), serving as consultants.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 16th] Observers in political circles here believe that the Yoshida cabinet will have a conservative nature. Liberal Party members will occupy the majority of positions, with Progressive Party members holding fewer. It is even possible that some members of the Cooperative Party will be included. While not extreme right-wing, these parties are at least right-leaning, with "popular governance" as their slogan. The Yoshida cabinet will exclude members of the Socialist Party or the Communist Party, and these two parties have already decided to form an opposition party.

Cabinet Member Candidates

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 16th] It is reported that the preliminary list of cabinet member candidates is roughly as follows: Prime Minister and Foreign Minister: Shigeru Yoshida (Liberal Party). Home Minister: Giichi Matsumura (House of Peers). Finance Minister: Aiyama (Liberal Party) or Kotari Toku (same). Justice Minister: (Incumbent) Tomizo Iwata (House of Peers). Education Minister: (Incumbent) Yoshinari Yasunobu (House of Peers). Agriculture and Forestry Minister: Yoshinari Kawai (Progressive Party). Commerce and Industry Minister: Niro Hoshijima (Liberal Party). Health and Welfare Minister: Ryujiro Okubo (Liberal Party). Communications Minister: Kankichi Hitotsumatsu (Progressive Party). State Ministers: Kijuro Shidehara (Progressive Party). Takao Saito (Progressive Party). Etsujiro Uehara (Liberal Party). Takeshige Ishiguro. In addition, it is rumored that due to constitutional considerations, either the renowned scholar Tatsukichi Minobe or the Liberal Party's Tokujiro Kinmochi may also be appointed.

The Yoshida cabinet will inevitably be a short-lived one, its mission being solely to pass the draft constitution in parliament. The Communist Party criticizes Yoshida for appointing Tanaka, the former Foreign Vice-Minister, who contributed to Tanaka's policy of aggression against China. They point out that Yoshida, since his appointment as ambassador to the UK in 1930, supported the aggressive foreign policy towards China and, like the former leader of the Liberal Party, Hatoyama, should be dismissed.

Yoshida's Brief History

[Kaizo-sha News] Japan's new Prime Minister, Yoshida, is 69 years old this year, born in Tosa, Shikoku, of commoner origin. He graduated from the Tokyo Imperial University's Faculty of Political Science in 1906, passed the diplomatic service examination, and joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1920, he was appointed as a member of the Committee for Implementing the Treaty of Peace with Germany. In 1928, he served as Foreign Vice-Minister in the Tanaka cabinet. Yoshida's British gentleman-style diplomatic skills gradually gained recognition at this time. In 1930, he was appointed as plenipotentiary ambassador to Italy. In 1932, he was a Japanese representative to the Lausanne Reparations Conference. In 1936, he was appointed as ambassador to the UK. In 1939, he was dismissed and remained out of office for six years. After Japan's surrender, in September, he became Foreign Minister and concurrently President of the "Bureau for Handling Post-War Affairs," dealing with post-armistice matters. During the war, Yoshida often advocated peace to the Tojo cabinet, which resulted in him "eating the stale rice of the military police" for three months, but he never wavered in his views. When Konoe advised the Emperor to abandon the hopeless war, he also often consulted with Yoshida. Sources here say that while Yoshida is a liberal, he is definitely not a democrat. As Prime Minister, he faces difficult and treacherous prospects, which are far from optimistic.

The Course of Political Turmoil

[Our Newspaper Tokyo Correspondent, 15th] Since the resignation of the Shidehara cabinet, Japan's political situation has been in a state of confusion. After a lengthy discussion on the issue of forming a cabinet, the leaders of the Socialist Party and the Liberal Party, the Socialist Party decided to give the Prime Minister's position to the Liberal Party. However, the Liberal Party must implement the Socialist Party's economic policies in the new cabinet. Therefore, people generally hope to establish a coalition government in Japan. However, the leader of the Liberal Party, Hatoyama, is an opportunist. For example, during the era of military rule, Hatoyama supported fascism, but after the Allied forces landed, he talked extensively about his democratic theories. When Shidehara dispatched Foreign Minister Yoshida to suggest to MacArthur that Hatoyama be promoted to form a cabinet, MacArthur rejected his suggestion in order to comply with public opinion. Afterwards, Secretary-General Katayama of the Socialist Party was very interested in forming a cabinet, but the conservative parties unanimously expressed their unwillingness to participate in Katayama's new cabinet. The Socialist Party is not a majority party in the parliament. Even with the Communist Party included, it does not reach one hundred seats. If the Socialist Party were to form a cabinet alone, it would certainly not be able to organize one. Since Yoshida took office as the leader of the Liberal Party, and with Shidehara's recommendation, he was appointed to form a cabinet today. A conservative government will be born tomorrow. The opinion of Japanese public opinion believes that the conservative party's emergence to form a cabinet cannot solve the people's main problems, because Yoshida represents Japan's landlords, capitalists, and politicians. Only socialism can solve Japan's current main problems.

### Japanese War Crimes Trials to Take One Year; Hearings Continue Today

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th, United Press] Allied Indian prosecutor Menon stated that the trial of 28 Japanese war crimes suspects will take one year. He stated that the defendant's attacks on the court's jurisdiction were unfounded and only served to delay the trial.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th] The International Military Tribunal for the Far East is scheduled to continue the trial of major Japanese war criminals tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM.

### Opening of the Japanese Parliament; House of Representatives Elects Speaker and Deputy Speaker; Labor Union Demonstrations Outside

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th] The House of Representatives convened this afternoon and elected Miki of the Liberal Party and Kimura of the Progressive Party as Speaker and Deputy Speaker.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th] The House of Peers met for a very short time and resolved that the existing staff would continue in their positions. Among the newly elected members of the Lower House, women occupy thirty-eight seats, participating in politics for the first time, feeling nervous and solemn. Hundreds of Tokyo transport workers marched in formation, waving red flags and singing the Labor Day song, passed the parliament and went to the Prime Minister's official residence to protest against the "conservative cabinet" and demand the formation of a democratic government.

### Japanese Plundered Artifacts Returned to Our Country

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] MacArthur's headquarters has returned the artifacts plundered by the Japanese army in Zhoukoudian, China, to the Chinese delegation in Japan. They will be packed into seven boxes and transported back to China.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] It is reported that the Japanese government issued a nationwide order on May 5th and 9th, stating that all materials seized or plundered by the Japanese army through coercive means from China, Vietnam, Siam, Malaya, Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and other places occupied by the Japanese army since the "July 7th" Incident, and currently existing in Japan, will be investigated and confiscated by the Japanese government. A deadline of the 20th of this month was set for detailed reporting from all over the country. The Allied Headquarters in Japan further ordered the Japanese government to submit a detailed list of the materials plundered by Japan by June 2nd and to be responsible for their safekeeping, prohibiting the trading or moving of these materials. Cultural relics and materials belonging to our country will be recovered by our country.

### Pacific Islands Base Issue: US-UK Negotiations Underway; UK Maintains Close Cooperation with Various Self-Governing Territories

[Reuters, London, 16th] Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mr. Huk, in response to a question from a member of the House of Commons yesterday, stated that the United States had spent a large amount of money during the war establishing military bases on certain islands in the South Pacific region. Some of these islands are under the rule of the British Commonwealth or under its complete governance. In recent months, the US government has made suggestions regarding the future status and use of these islands. Negotiations are still in progress, hoping to establish an agreement that is satisfactory to all parties. The British government maintains the closest cooperation with all self-governing territories on this matter.

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] The London "Daily Mail" today used large headlines to urge "The British Empire to Retain Bases," but also mentioned the possibility of Anglo-American joint defense. The "Daily Express" stated that Australia and New Zealand are deeply concerned about the base issue. The "News Chronicle" pointed out that some islands are within the inner defense line of the self-governing territories of the South Pacific. Meanwhile, according to Washington news, the negotiations between the UK and the US on several islands in the Pacific are progressing satisfactorily. Some in Washington speculate that after Admiral Leahy, President Truman's personal Chief of Staff, arrives in London by plane, the possibility of a joint defense agreement between the two countries may be discussed.

### Four Foreign Ministers Conference: Recess Begins Today; Experts to Discuss German Issues; Date of Peace Conference Still Undecided

[Our Newspaper News] London, 16th - Radio broadcast: The Four Foreign Ministers Conference has been in session for four weeks now, and from beginning to end, it has been deadlocked. Today, it formally admitted complete failure. On the issue of peace treaties with Italy and other former Axis satellite countries, no agreement could be reached, and it was forced to recess from tomorrow until the 15th of next month, when it will reconvene. At that time, the US will do its best to urge the Soviet Union to agree to determine the date of the peace conference.

[Our Newspaper News] London, 16th - Radio broadcast: The Foreign Ministers Conference decided this morning to appoint experts to form a special committee to discuss German issues.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 15th] At the plenary session this afternoon, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference passed the proposal by Byrnes to postpone the current meeting until June 15th. After the postponement, representatives of various countries will continue to work in Paris.

[Reuters, Paris, 16th] Before the adjournment of the Foreign Ministers Conference, the foreign ministers agreed to sign the draft revision of the Italian armistice conditions proposed by Byrnes, but the date of the peace conference has not been decided.

[US Information Service, Washington, 15th] The White House announced today that Truman's private plane was not sent to Paris to transport Secretary of State Byrnes and his entourage back to the US, but another plane will fly to Paris tomorrow or the day after to pick up Byrnes for his return home. According to White House Press Secretary Ross, Byrnes's return to the US does not mean that the Foreign Ministers Conference will be postponed. (According to Associated Press, Paris, reliable sources say Byrnes is scheduled to return home on Friday.)

[Associated Press, Paris, 15th] Regarding the issue of China's participation in the Foreign Ministers Conference, it is reported that the Four Foreign Ministers have decided that the current discussion of German issues is of a preliminary nature, so they do not intend to invite Chinese representatives to participate. The US side said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had stated that if any one country is invited to participate in the expansion of the meeting, then Poland and Czechoslovakia should also be allowed to attend.

[Reuters, Paris, 16th] French Foreign Minister Bidault yesterday elaborated on France's views on the borders of Germany and general issues. British Foreign Secretary Bevin advocated for a broad discussion of the German issue before considering France's Ruhr plan in detail. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov supported Bidault's proposal to discuss Germany's western border first, the content of which is international co-management of the Ruhr and Rhineland regions, while the Saar region would be merged into France. The reason given was that France had encountered seven invasions in the past 150 years, and in order to prevent future invasions, the Ruhr and Rhineland regions should be politically separated from Germany. Bevin expressed his willingness to respect France's security needs, but the German issue needs to be treated as a unit.

### Reason for the Breakdown of US-Soviet Negotiations on Korean Issue; Soviet Newspaper Blames the US

[Reuters, Moscow, 16th] "Izvestia" reported that negotiations on the establishment of a provisional democratic government in Korea have now stalled because of the US representative’s insistence on deviating from the resolutions of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. According to the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, the Allied policy should be to foster democracy in Korea and make it an independent country. Now, the Soviet delegation wants to vigorously implement this resolution, while the US delegation wants to avoid fulfilling some of the resolutions, leading to a standstill in negotiations.

### "Yellow Diplomacy" Incident; US Embassy Official in the Soviet Union Accused of "Rogue Behavior"

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] US Embassy official in the Soviet Union, Walter D. Rose, accused of "rogue behavior," the US has requested the Soviet Union to revoke the charge and allow him to leave the country immediately, which has been rejected. Today, US diplomats here stated that the case has become a diplomatic incident, involving the State Department, the US Embassy in the Soviet Union, and the Kremlin. Soviet Navy Lieutenant Leutin was convicted in the US on March 16th on espionage charges. This indictment against Rose is in retaliation. Two weeks ago, the Soviet Union accused Rose of engaging in "rogue behavior" towards a Soviet female artist in February this year.

### Egypt Opposes International Defense of Suez Canal; British Giant Floating Dockyard Departs from Alexandria

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 15th] Egyptian Prime Minister Sukii recently declared that Egypt should not accept a plan to defend the Suez Canal with international forces. This remark was in response to an opinion expressed by a British newspaper commentator.

[Associated Press, Alexandria, 15th] The British Navy's floating dockyard (40,000 tons), which has been used to repair numerous famous warships, set sail today, moving to Gibraltar. It is generally believed that this is a step in Britain's withdrawal of all its land, sea, and air forces from Egypt.

[Reuters, Cairo, 16th] British authorities here recently declared that rumors that orders have been issued for British troops to withdraw from Cairo and Alexandria before July are completely untrue. After investigation, it was found that there are no ships or planes available to transport these troops.

### Security Council Plans New Rules of Procedure: Certain Meetings Can Be Kept Secret

[Associated Press, New York, 15th] The Security Council Committee on Rules of Procedure of the United Nations has drafted new rules of procedure that would allow the Council to keep certain meetings secret, even from member states of the same United Nations organization. This proposal is expected to be passed by the Council tomorrow.

### Hungary's Alarming Inflation: One US Dollar Worth 2.5 Billion Hungarian Currency; One Ton of Black Market Rice Costs 7.5 Billion

[Associated Press, Hungarian Capital, 16th] Hungary is now threatened by inflation, with ten billion Hungarian currency exchanging for one banknote, circulating on the market since May 14th. Before the war, five Hungarian "Pengos" were worth one US dollar, but now one US dollar is worth 2.5 billion Hungarian Pengos.

The average worker earns about one US dollar per month, and a meal on the black market costs three US dollars, but you can't find anyone in the Hungarian capital who truly lives on an income of one US dollar. There are undoubtedly many suffering people in Hungary, but in the theaters, opera houses, and high-end restaurants of the Hungarian capital, there are still many distinguished guests, with no empty seats. Only the traces of the poor are not to be seen.

To such a degree of inflation, the government has yet to announce any measures to stop it. Officials once declared that anyone caught with foreign currency would be punished, but it has had no effect. Most people in the government believe that they should wait until the peace treaty is signed before trying to stop inflation.

### Egyptian King Initiates Call for Arab Heads of State Meeting to Discuss Palestine Issue; Arabs' Opposition to Jewish Immigration is Extremely Determined

[Reuters, Cairo, 16th] Egyptian Royal Arab leader Batel traveled by Egyptian military plane to visit Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad, and Amman, inviting all Arab leaders to hold a meeting to study the Palestine issue on behalf of Egyptian King Farouk. Separately, the extraordinary meeting of the Arab League, originally scheduled to be held in Damascus on Saturday, has been postponed to next Tuesday. League Secretary-General Ashaim told the press that various Arab kings and presidents will soon meet in a location near Egypt to exchange views on the Palestine issue.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 16th] Butairi, an independent member of the Palestine Higher Committee, told our reporter today that if Britain and the US insist on implementing the report of the investigation team, it would be tantamount to war against the Arab race. All Arab countries are willing to support us in opposing expanded immigration. From India to Tripoli, the majority of people want to submit the Palestine issue to the United Nations organization for arbitration. Butairi further stated that even if the investigation team's report is implemented, we will never beg for help from the Soviet Union.

Request to Dissolve the Jewish Agency

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 16th] The Arab Higher Committee resolved to lodge the most serious protest with the British High Commissioner to Palestine, Cunningham, against the illegal immigration of Jews into Palestine, and requested that he immediately dissolve the Jewish Agency that is responsible for this work.

Britain Adopts a Cautious Attitude

[Reuters, London, 16th] The British Foreign Office issued a statement yesterday stating that the British government is still studying the Palestine report and will not make a decision until after consulting with the US government and consulting the opinions of Arab and Jewish leaders.

### Japan Should Move Towards Democracy, Not Communism: Acheson Warns the Control Council

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th, Exclusive] At today's (15th) meeting of the Allied Control Council for Japan, US member and council chairman Acheson stated that the US does not approve of Japan practicing communism. My opinion can be candidly stated that the efforts of the members of this council should be applied to leading Japan towards democratization. Supporting communism or any Japanese political party during public gatherings of the council is not an obligation that any member of this council should have.

### MacArthur Approves Return of Some Japanese Military Equipment

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th] MacArthur today authorized the return of some Japanese military equipment received by the occupation forces for civilian relief, agricultural production, civilian reception, cultural and entertainment activities, or for the manufacture of consumer goods research. However, the return of such property does not affect future reparations claims. Japanese property in Korea is not included.

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] According to responsible Chinese sources today, Philippine President-elect Roxas discussed the issue of overseas Chinese in the Philippines participating in the "Anti-Roxas Movement" with Chinese Ambassador to the US, Wei Daoming, yesterday.

### Two British Carrier Pigeons Awarded Highest Medal

[Reuters, London, 16th] Carrier pigeons "Princess" and "Lonely," who made meritorious contributions during the war, were awarded the British government's "Dickin Medal." This medal is the highest grade among bird medals. "Princess" flew from Crete back to Alexandria in 1943, a distance of more than 500 miles. "Lonely" was dropped from a plane to France in the same year, flying more than 400 miles in one day, setting a record. "Princess" later died of illness in Cairo, while "Lonely" is still alive.

### Goering Planned to Spend a Huge Sum to Purchase the World's Largest Pearl; Stolen by a Thief, Found in France; Perpetrator Captured, Escaped from Prison

[United Press, Paris, 15th] Belgian named I. Collette, who was arrested by the French police for stealing one of the world's largest pearls, "The Pearl of Asia," escaped from a prison hospital today. Collette feigned madness and was sent to the prison hospital for examination. This prison escape was assisted by accomplices, and the police are currently conducting a reinvestigation.

[Reuters, Paris, 16th] Part of the ownership of the world's largest pearl, "The Pearl of Asia," currently belongs to the Mohideen Brothers Company in Shanghai, Ceylon. In 1944, the pearl was stored in a bank in Paris under the custody of the German army. At that time, Goering planned to offer £165,000 to purchase it. Just as negotiations were underway, Collette and his accomplices, disguised as German police, deceived and stole the pearl. The French police arrested them, but were later released due to German intervention. After the liberation of France, they were arrested again and charged with conspiring with the German secret police. The French police later found the pearl in the toilet of a hotel in Marseille. This largest pearl in the world was first seized by the Persians who invaded Delhi in 1739, and was later presented to the Chinese Emperor, who greatly valued it and used it for burial. It was not until the beginning of this century that it was rediscovered in the hands of a Chinese official. Thirty years ago, a Ceylonese man bought the pearl in Hong Kong for £38,000 and later shared it with a French church. The Ceylonese owner died in Shanghai last year, and part of the ownership was given to his two sons.

### Buying Yarn: Is it Beneficial to Us? Tang Shoumin Still Unenlightened, Actually Claims, "It is the Enemy Giving Us Supplies," and Still Appears Pleased When Confessing

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Supreme Court is being extremely active in handling cases of Chinese traitors recently. Yesterday alone, it interrogated as many as fourteen people, and delivered verdicts on two. The details of each case are recorded below:

At 9:30 AM yesterday, the presiding judge of the High Court moved to the Second Tribunal to begin hearing the case of Tang Shoumin. Tang refuted each of the offenses listed by Prosecutor Ye in the indictment, even claiming that the prosecutor was prejudiced. Regarding the matter of buying yarn, he cunningly claimed, "Not only was it definitely not supplying the enemy, but it was the enemy giving us supplies." He seemed quite pleased while saying this. Tang is from Zhenjiang, 55 years old, and resides at 35 Enlihe Road. Before the war, he worked in a bank. When the December 8th Pacific War broke out, Tang was the general manager of the Bank of Communications, overseeing the bank's operations in Hong Kong. On the 20th of the same month, Hong Kong fell, and Tang came to Shanghai to contact Obara, an economic advisor to the enemy. In September of the 31st year [of the Republic], he oversaw the resumption of the bank's operations. Tang served as chairman and assisted the puppet Central Reserve Bank in carrying out its business. On March 15th of the 32nd year, he reorganized the Commercial Control Committee. During his tenure, he was entrusted by the puppet government to forcibly register yarn merchants and collect over 120,000 pieces of yarn to contribute to the enemy's transportation department. He also served as an advisor to the puppet Central Reserve Bank and supervisor of the puppet Central Savings Association. In the second half of the 33rd year, he served as a member of the puppet National Economic Commission. After the victory, he was escorted to the court by the Military Statistics Bureau. After investigation by the High Procuratorate, he was prosecuted under Article 2, Clauses 1, 4, and 10, of the Regulations for Punishing Chinese Traitors for conspiring with an enemy country, plotting to resist this country, and disrupting finance. Tang hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Zuo De as his defense, but only lawyer Zuo came to court. Tang was a burly man, wearing a new gray long gown made of cloth and yellow leather shoes. He was neatly dressed from head to toe, had a shaved head, and his hair was already graying. He wore tortoiseshell-rimmed reading glasses on his nose, and his face was full and his demeanor calm. He stated that he had one wife and four children each (the oldest being 30 years old and the youngest 14), but only one daughter-in-law. Tang vigorously defended himself against the indictment, stating that: (1) December 21st of the 30th year [of the Republic] was not the date of the fall of Hong Kong. The defendant was detained for 114 days before being escorted to Shanghai. (2) The resumption of the Bank of Communications was being negotiated by the Bank of China before the defendant came to Shanghai, and was inspected and monitored by enemy personnel, not by colluding with the enemy. (3) Only the Bank of Communications benefited the Central Reserve Bank; the Central Reserve Bank did not benefit the Bank of Communications. (4) Major Chinese banks, including the Bank of Communications, invested in the "China Silk Company," the achievement of which was to reclaim the enemy's exclusive rights. (5) Not a single thread of yarn was used to supply the enemy. (6) The various committees of the puppet government were all nominal positions, without consent. (7) He turned himself in to the Military Statistics Bureau on September 30th of last year, not arrested. (8) The Commercial Control Committee was an autonomous organization of merchants, not colluding with the enemy. Tang also elaborated that the establishment of the "Commercial Control Committee" had two benefits for merchants: (1) Abolishing military control; (2) No restrictions on the export of materials. Therefore, it was helpful to the war of resistance and the process was managed to handle import and export affairs, distributing over 2,500 pieces of cloth to Shanghai citizens, with each person receiving fifteen feet. Regarding the puppet positions of advisor to the Central Reserve Bank, Tang stated that they were all vacant positions. As for the China Silk Company, he served as a director because of the Bank of Communications' investment, with the goal of competing with the Japanese. The amount of yarn purchased and registered reached over 245,300 pieces, half of which was funded by the Central Reserve Bank and the other half by the Japanese in gold. Therefore, it was not supplying the enemy, but the enemy supplying us, he said. At this point, the court ordered a postponement for further questioning. Lawyer Zuo requested that Yuan Liang, a witness favorable to the defendant, be summoned at the next interrogation and requested to see his family on behalf of the defendant. Tang's eldest son saw his old father and was overcome with emotion, tears welling up in his eyes and even crying. Tang then advised him, "After exchanging pleasantries," and Tang was then escorted back to the court prison.

Yesterday morning, the Criminal Tribunal of the High Court also interrogated Huang Xianggu and other traitors. The details are as follows:

Huang Xianggu

Interrogated by Judge Qiu. Huang was from Jian'ou and was originally the executive director of the Mass Movement Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, and later promoted to head of the Propaganda Section. In May of the 28th year [of the Republic], he joined the puppet organization. He successively held positions such as puppet Central Supervisory Committee member, puppet Vice Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, puppet Social Movement Committee member, and puppet National Economic Commission member. He dredged airfields and built highways to aid the enemy's military use. Huang claimed that all the puppet positions he held were nominal. Finally, he requested the judge to ask journalists not to publish his underground activities to prevent the world from laughing at his ugly self-promotion, which was ultimately rejected by the judge.

Liu Xingchen

From Taixian, originally a professor of mathematics at Henan University. He served as a researcher at the Economic Research Institute of the puppet Ministry of Finance, an advisor to the puppet Ministry of Finance, the Director of the Currency Department, the puppet Zhejiang Finance Director, the Director of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government Goods Distribution Office, and the Director of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau. He stated that during his tenure in the puppet government, he did not increase the burden on the people.

Liu Yusheng

A cultural traitor from Nanhai, Guangdong. In the 30th year [of the Republic], he was in Hong Kong. In May of the following year, he returned to Shanghai to visit relatives and immediately joined the puppet Propaganda Department, working for Lin Xiangsheng to win over cultural writers. He also served as an editor for the China Daily, repeatedly publishing fallacies and promoting "peace movement." He also compiled the "New National Movement Essays," for the "Taiping Publishing Company," a cultural organization of the enemy. The book was translated into Japanese and highly praised by the enemy. Moreover, during his tenure in the puppet government, he attended the "Greater East Asia Writers' Conference" in Tokyo. After the meeting, he used English to broadcast to overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia on the need for mutual understanding of culture between the "Chinese" and Japanese nations and engaged in propaganda work. However, according to his testimony, the indictment did not conform to the facts and that he had never harmed the country or benefited the enemy.

### Over One Hundred Coal Businesses, Moved by Righteous Indignation, Report Yi Taixing and Shen Jinzhou for Colluding with the Enemy

(Our Newspaper's Report) Yi Taixing Coal Company and its manager, Shen Jinzhou, colluded with a small number of coal businesses during the period of enemy rule, secretly acting on the orders of the enemy's "Asia Development Board" and "Embassy" to organize the puppet "Dazhong Coal Company," with Shen as chairman. They enforced coal weight controls on behalf of the enemy, planned the supply of coal to the enemy's military, and used vile methods to promote the "dual standard system" of military scrip and puppet currency for the enemy. People in the coal industry suffered greatly under their oppression and detested their actions. After the victory, 127 companies jointly signed a report, along with 33 pieces of evidence, detailing nine major crimes, and submitted them separately to the Shanghai High Court Procuratorate and the Military Affairs Commission Investigation and Statistics Bureau for legal action. After investigation, Shen was arrested and imprisoned on the morning of the 2nd of this month. At the original location of "Dazhong Coal Company," a large amount of evidence and documents were seized, including 91 case files, 15 meeting minutes, 47 account books, and two sacks of letters. At the time, the "regulations" formulated by Shen and others were also found, with the year on the cover written as "Showa 17" (1942), showing their flattery of the enemy and forgetfulness of their ancestors. Currently, over one hundred coal businesses in this city are requesting the authorities to severely punish them in order to uphold national law, and are calling on all sectors of society to uphold national law and promote justice.

### Military Officer Stabbed to Death in Small Wood Bridge Vegetable Shed, Wife and Soldier Flee

[Our Newspaper's Report] Qi Yunwang, a 34-year-old student from the 13th Company of the 3rd Officer Corps directly under the Ministry of Military Administration, was originally a company commander in the 9th Engineering Regiment. He had just come to Shanghai from Zhengzhou for training. The company was stationed in the Taikang Biscuit Factory on Xiaomuqiao Road. Qi brought his wife, children, and a soldier, residing in a nearby Yinjiazhai residence. On the 14th, Qi stayed at the company headquarters. Around 3:00 PM on the 15th, Qi went to the Central District of the city with his courier to watch a play, while his wife, Ms. Li, stayed home. Around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, a farmer, Gu Liangqi, discovered the body of a military officer in a vegetable garden opposite the Western Dairy Farm in Yinjiazhai. The Changshu District Police Bureau was notified, and Deputy Bureau Chief Huang Zhen personally led police officers from the Judicial Section to conduct an on-site investigation, discovering a knife wound in the abdomen, with the omentum flowing out, and a knife wound in the throat, with the trachea severely lacerated. The murder weapon, a vegetable-chopping paring knife of the sharpest kind, was found next to the body. It was later learned that the deceased was Qi, so his home was investigated, only to find that it had been emptied of its residents. His wife, Ms. Li, and the soldier, Yu Chenglong, had fled, taking a one-year-old child and all valuables with them. According to his subordinates, Li married Qi in the 32nd year [of the Republic]. She had a lover in her hometown. It is unknown whether Qi's sudden and tragic death and the subsequent departure of his wife and the soldier was due to an illicit relationship between her and Yu that led to this extreme measure. The soldier, Yu Chenglong, is of medium height, with a thin, long face, a round shaved head, and a Henan accent. Ms. Li has an oval face, short hair, and wears a blue cloth cheongsam over a fine checkered lined robe. The luggage contains a red cloth quilt cover and an tan military blanket.

### Five Million People Will Become Starving Corpses, Guangdong Food Urgently Needs Relief, Drought Causes Rice Prices to Reach 100,000 Per Dan

[Our Newspaper's Report] Ling Daoyang, Director of the "Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" Guangdong Regional Office, stated at a press conference yesterday that if Guangdong Province does not receive sufficient food relief immediately, five million people will starve to death within one or two months. Ling solemnly declared that before taking office, the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" and the "Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" Standing Bureau had promised to supply Guangdong Province with 33,000 tons of flour and 55,000 tons of rice, but he had actually received only 9,564 tons of flour and 1,535 tons of rice, less than two-tenths of the original amount.

No Rain for Half a Year, Farmland Barren

Ling stated that Guangdong is one of the most populous provinces in the occupied areas, with a total of 35 million people, second only to Shandong and Jiangsu. In the past two or three decades, Guangdong's rice imports accounted for seven-tenths of the national total. Since the eight years of the War of Resistance, the disaster has been particularly widespread and severe. Six million acres of farmland have been abandoned due to unrepaired dikes. There are 800,000 people in Guangdong who are engaged in fishing, and almost all of the 30,000 fishing boats they rely on for livelihood were destroyed by the Japanese. In addition, the weather has been dry, with no rain for half a year, causing rice prices to reach over 100,000, and the hardship and suffering of the people of Guangdong can be said to have reached an extreme. The Guangdong Regional Office has received far less food than the original amount, causing great disappointment to the people of Guangdong and leading to dissatisfaction with the work of the "Relief and Rehabilitation Administration". The relief work in the province is divided into eleven districts for implementation: Guangzhou, Taishan, Qujiang, Yuyao, Huiyang, Shantou, Maoming, Zhanjiang, Huanshan, Lehui, and Danxian. Taking Guangzhou as an example, four affordable dining halls have been established, serving 25,000 people a day; twelve porridge kitchens, serving 20,000 people a day; and an affordable bakery, supplying approximately 6,500 citizens with bread every day.

A Glimpse of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Sub-Office's Work

Many overseas Chinese in Thailand are originally from Shantou. They donated a total of 5,115 tons of rice. The "Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" was only responsible for transporting this rice. Of this, 3,115 tons have been transported to Shantou, 1,500 tons have been used for relief in Guangzhou, and 500 tons have been transported to Hainan Island. This rice is not owned by the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration", so the "Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" entrusted the Youth Corps, the Senate, and others to handle the relief matters. There were some procedures that were not handled properly. General Zhang Fakui has ordered a thorough investigation. The Guangdong Regional Office is successfully distributing medicine and old clothes and repatriating refugees to their hometowns. As for work relief, 170,000 workers have been mobilized to repair the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, costing a total of 350 tons of flour. This road is expected to be completed in early next month. In addition, many refugees are engaged in reclamation, and 37 fishermen's cooperatives have been established. To restore farmland, dikes are being repaired, mobilizing 21,000 people every day. A sawmill has been built, planning to saw 200,000 railroad ties in each period for the restoration of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway.

Requesting Increased Funding, More Material Assistance

Ling's purpose in coming to Shanghai is to: (1) request increased funding from the General Office. The current monthly funding of 20 million yuan is not even enough for one-fourth of the required transportation costs. (2) Ask the General Office to request more material assistance from the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration". (3) Request more experts, as the current relief work is often only assisted by some pastors and churches. Ling then introduced Mr. Martin, Director of the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" Guangdong Sub-Office, who praised Ling for his tireless efforts in working under extremely complex and difficult circumstances. He also listed the reasons why relief work in Guangdong Province is so difficult: (1) inconvenient transportation, (2) poor economy, (3) various geographical difficulties. He hopes that the roads can be opened as soon as possible to transport relief materials to Guangxi and Hunan provinces. Ling finally stated that he would return to Guangdong in three or four days. When asked by reporters about the results of his negotiations in Shanghai, he replied: "I really dare not say!" It seems that the fate of over five million people in Guangdong Province is still uncertain.

### Materials Supply Bureau Established, Purchasing Surplus Materials from the US and Canada to Meet Various Needs, US Military Sells Dock Equipment to Us, Agreement Signed Yesterday

The Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau was officially announced yesterday. The office is located on the third floor of the former Deutsche Bank building.

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday marked the sixth anniversary of the martyrdom of Zhang Zizhong, a famous anti-Japanese general and national hero.

More than 5,000 people attended. The atmosphere in the memorial hall was solemn and tragic.

Qian Dajun, due to other matters, arrived and took his position at 1:00 PM. A moment of silence was observed to express grief, followed by the offering of incense, flag, and elegiac music. Three bows were made to the portrait of the late General Zhang.

The memorial address stated: "On the 16th day of May in the 35th year of the Republic of China, Kong Xiangxi, Qian Dajun, Li and Wu Shaoshu, respectfully offer this sacrifice to the spirit of General. Our country gained you, an elite from Shandong, a high-ranking general, and a great wall defending the country. The Battle of Fei River, the victory at Linyi, severely damaged the enemy's advance, a fierce display. Fighting in Xiang River, advancing the cause. Conferring upon us the meritorious official, All are delighted. Amidst the slander and praise, unwavering and persistent, Your ambition to serve the country is extraordinary. Six years since your demise, your commanding presence echoes in the wind and clouds, your dignified composure lingers in our minds. Your unwavering loyalty to the nation, unshaken and true. May your spirit be aware, and your soul find solace. Enduring for ten thousand years, your portrait will be enshrined. Respectfully offered."

Subsequently, students from the National Conservatory of Music sang a dirge. After the song, Kong gave a speech, recounting the deceased general's selfless service and heroic battles, stating that his sacrifice laid the foundation for today's victory. He added that nation-building is not yet complete, and those who have not died should strive to create a free, peaceful, and democratic nation where people can live and work in peace, a task ten times harder than the War of Resistance. Zhang Zizhong's younger brother, Ziming, then gave a speech of thanks. The ceremony concluded at around 6:00 PM.

This newspaper's couplet read: "Distinguish right from wrong, vow steadfast loyalty, the party's light, the country unites." "Dedicate loyalty, sacrifice life, the soul undimmed, the spirit enduring." Yan Huiqing's couplet read: "The Battle of Suizao, the foundation of victory, the sun and moon shine on his unwavering devotion, the swiftness of his heroic wind is recorded in history." "After the Great Wall, fighting to the death, the rivers and mountains honored by his blood, famous generals rarely live to old age." The United Daily News's couplet read: "The Xiang River sobs with cold currents, his heroic spirit lingers, still mindful of the land not yet recovered, half of the ruins are overgrown with weeds, the world awaits to be restored." "The bones of loyalty are buried in the Shu mountains, his ambition has been fulfilled, sharing with the bright moon, a plum blossom tree, the fragrance of reverence shared for thousands of years." All are eloquent and worthy of recitation.

Gong Zhizhan, Cheng Cangbo, and about 40 reporters from various newspapers attended. During the banquet, Wang Xiaogang delivered a welcoming speech, expressing his delight that 31 units had attended the meeting in Nanjing (originally scheduled to include 43 units from the nine northeastern provinces). This spirit of unity and enthusiastic sentiment symbolize a bright future. He also stated that he had presented a request to the chairman to convene a conference of national agricultural, industrial, commercial, and specialized scholars to formulate plans to effectively curb prices and develop industry and commerce to overcome the current difficulties. Representatives from various provinces then reported on the current situation in their respective provinces. The most serious problems at present are the Yellow River flood area and the disaster in Hunan, and the communist occupation of some areas, which hinders the development of industry and commerce, is particularly painful. In the Henan and Suiyuan areas, the communists forcibly occupy land, destroy morality and education, forcibly separate families, massacre intellectuals, and destroy productive enterprises, especially by destroying transportation. The only hope for the people in these areas is that the Chinese and British governments will recover the lost territories and eliminate the destructive work of the communists. According to Yang Qingtian, deputy editor of the Zhengzhou Zhongbao, the newspaper industry in Henan is not very developed. Kaifeng is more advanced, with a total of 12 newspapers, but even the most popular does not exceed 7,000 copies. Four newspapers are published in Zhengzhou, and the people there greatly welcome the Shenbao, Xinmin, and Dagong newspapers from Shanghai, especially the Shenbao, which has the highest sales, reaching more than 5,000 copies per day, exceeding the local newspapers. However, due to current transportation difficulties, it takes at least two days to read them.

### Actual Sales and Speculation Work Together - Gold Prices Rose Again Yesterday - Many Mysterious Rumors About its Destination

Yesterday, due to easing credit, persistent buying interest, and the abundance of capital from the countryside, with civilians still possessing the ability to hoard gold, prices rebounded. Morning opening prices were similar to the previous closing prices. After the opening, there were some sell-offs after prices increased, and some profit-taking in the middle of the day, causing prices to drop to 1.715 million. Countryside silver shops absorbed some of this. Around 10:00 AM, prices rebounded to fluctuate around the morning opening price. The Central Bank allocated 268 taels to traders at a price of 1.74 million, after which prices slightly decreased. Easing credit conditions led to frequent absorption by various hot money sources. The general sentiment, though not daring to extravagantly hope for control from the Central Bank, considered that prices below 1.7 million would not drop much further given historical trends, and those with surplus capital were not hesitant to buy. Securities firms also joined in, increasing activity, but with little trading, capital became limited. At noon, prices rose to around 1.8 million. In the afternoon, people continued to speculate about the current environment, and mysterious rumors about the destination of gold spread, continuing the upward trend. As a result, prices closed 70,000 higher than the previous closing. Decorative gold also rose to 193,000, standard silver rose to 1,700, and silver dollar prices rose by half a percent. Secret interest rates were unstable, ranging from 1.6 to 2 cents.

Foreign currency, especially US dollars, remained stable, passively fluctuating with Yu Jia's price. The morning opening price was 2,300 yuan, then gradually dropped to 2,270 yuan, remaining below 2,300 yuan. It only rebounded to 2,330 yuan at noon, stabilizing slightly at noon. The overall market invigorated in the afternoon, and was again positively influenced, closing 40 yuan higher than the previous closing. Hong Kong dollar capital was tight, influenced by the Hong Kong exchange rate, initially flat, then stable, closing 5 yuan higher. The Hong Kong exchange rate was initially flat, then firm, with buying interest increasing, rising from 410 yuan to 425 yuan. Robi was at 525 yuan, all selling prices. The US exchange rate was nominally flat but secretly stagnant.

### Government Bonds Drop - Both Bulls and Bears are Waiting for an Opportunity

Government bond prices were stable, with both bulls and bears waiting for an opportunity. Some hot money flowed to the gold market. Unified Class C bonds started the morning at 7,450 yuan, then fluctuated down to around 7,050 yuan, fluctuating slightly around 7,100 yuan at noon, closing 150 yuan lower than the previous closing. Classes A and B dropped slightly by 50 yuan each, while Classes D and E dropped by 100 yuan.

### Chinese Stocks Gradually Recover - Foreign Stocks Rise Across the Board

After being weak, Chinese stocks gradually stabilized, with miscellaneous capital joining in. Prices gradually recovered after the opening, with small stocks being weaker. At the lowest point in the morning, Yongsha was at 4,950 yuan, Meiya at 4,050 yuan, Jingfu at 130 yuan, Xinguang at 265 yuan, and Qindian at 235 yuan. Prices gradually recovered, reaching high prices at noon. Yongsha at 5,300 yuan, Meiya at 4,400 yuan, and Jingfu at 338 yuan, then slightly decreased. Xinguang and Qinxing closed at their highest prices. As a result, Yongsha and Meiya each rose by about half a percent, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose slightly, the medium-sized stock Rongfeng was intentionally lowered, Xinhe and Heping and Zhongfang and Dahua each rose slightly, the unpopular small stocks were flat, and the veteran stocks were still sluggish. Guangdong capital purchased companies, calling for prices above 2,600. After continuous profit-taking by bulls in foreign stocks, capital flowed into the hands of powerful players, and the market became drier. Yisha opened slightly higher than the previous day's closing price, and there was occasional short covering. Various stocks then gradually rose, led by Yisha, with enthusiasm in the financial sector. Prices turned high at noon, stabilizing slightly at noon, closing about 10% higher than the previous closing. Paper stocks were more attractive to investors because they were lower than Yipi, and rose by 20%.

### Yarn Market Stable - Cotton Trading Better

Yesterday, the yarn market was initially weak but eventually stable. Large yarn shipments were still small, and medium and small yarn shipments softened due to observers from Beijing and Wuhu. Each brand of cotton yarn decreased by about 10,000 yuan. At the close of the market, the situation stabilized due to replenishment by local retail stores. Four-inch two-strand thread rose by as much as 50,000 to 60,000 yuan because the Textile Construction Company did not supply the same industry yesterday.

The demand for cloth was normal from both out-of-town buyers and local shops. Shilin cloth and twelve-pound fine cloth were loose, while Daming Fu silk and grey twill were slightly firm.

In the cotton market, New York and American cotton prices fell by 17 to 19 pounds. Recent US dollars were at 26.98, forward prices at 27.58, and Meterlin spot prices at 27.78. Local cotton trading was better. Nantong Dasheng, Suzhou Sulun, and Chongming Jiafeng are all said to be purchasing cotton.

### Sugar Auction Prices Increase - An Immediate Rebound

Yesterday, the sugar market rebounded because the previously rumored large sale of sugar by a new company did not materialize, and the auction price of enemy property sugar by the association increased. The market gradually rose, with medium sugar and white sugar initially at 64,000 yuan in the morning, then rising through 5,000 yuan, 5,500 yuan, 6,000 yuan, 66,500 yuan, and 70,000 yuan, to 67,250 yuan to 77,500 yuan in the afternoon. Raw sugar was at 56,000 yuan, three-and-a-half white grass sugar was at 68,500 yuan to 71,000 yuan, and Benmian white sugar was at 71,200 yuan. The total amount of sugar auctioned was over 2,000 pieces, with only dozens of bags of raw sugar sold at 60,000 yuan because it was 4,000 yuan higher than the privately negotiated price. Four-and-a-half car white sugar was at 88,000 yuan, with over 330 bags sold.

### Tea Market Bottoms are Sharp

Since merchants from Nanjing and Tianjin have been active in the producing areas of Hangzhou's new Qiangqiang tea, the local market has become increasingly bullish. Most holders are stopping losses and holding on, resulting in less trading, but bottoms are generally sharp. As for the Wenzhou Xinlongjing tea, which has been arriving for days with declining quality, buyers are competing to sell it off as before, and the market is still lackluster. The supply and demand for aged tea is balanced, and the trend is still hovering. Export green teas, such as the specially selected Gong Xi Ran Zhen brush, are still favored by buyers, but it is difficult to find an outlet for sales, and the situation is again quiet.

### Silk Prices Show Mixed Trends

Yesterday, the silk market was quite stable. 120 Tianqiao glossy rayon was bid at 1.38 million yuan, and the lowest bid in the middle was 1.35 million yuan, eventually traded at 360,000 yuan. 120 Tianqiao non-glossy rayon had half a box traded at 1.95 million yuan, factory and foreign firm goods were at 2.5 million yuan for 83 points of uniformity, and 2.35 million yuan for 81 points of uniformity. Jardine Matheson had some purchases yesterday. The prices of other grades of goods were similar to the previous day. Ordinary goods were slightly better, and silk goods were slightly weaker. Meiya bedcovers were down 10,000 yuan per 100, and Dacheng checked crepe was down 140 to 150 yuan per yard. Other goods did not fluctuate much.

### South American Rice - Dajiang Sells Off 20,000 Tons - Local Rice Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the rice market rose because the inland market was firm and buyers were strong. Jingxiu rice continued to rise by 500 to 600 yuan. Flour had no outlet in foreign ports, and local demand was still slack, causing prices to fall by 200 to 300 yuan. The oil market became depressed again due to the large arrival of Qingdao goods in Shanghai, falling by more than 2,000 yuan. Soybeans were slightly weak, soybean cakes had little supply or demand, bran demand was weak, falling by another 400 to 500 yuan, sesame seeds were also down 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and corn sales in Qingdao had decreased, causing the market to soften. Mung beans were flat, and red beans were also stagnant. All grains except rice prices were weak. Yesterday, the rice that arrived in Shanghai, according to the rice market, totaled over 4,000 shi. The types and amounts are as follows: White Japonica rice 2,414 shi, early rice 742 shi, thin rice 680 shi, sheep indica rice 132 shi, Du indica rice 385 shi, and White Yuan 55 shi.

In other news, the sale of foreign rice by Dajiang Enterprise Company yesterday greatly stimulated the grain market. Grain administration officials and soybean and rice firms went to the company to negotiate orders. According to the person in charge of the company, after six months, 20,000 tons of rice were purchased in South America, and the company chartered a cargo ship in the United States to depart from South America next month. The Ministry of Food purchased 16,000 tons yesterday. The foreign rice is divided into two types, with a selling price of 175 to 197 US dollars per ton (delivered to the Shanghai shore, including freight, insurance, bagging, etc.). The company charges the Ministry of Food a handling fee of 0.25%, and merchants a handling fee of 0.5%. A deposit is also collected, temporarily 5% for the Ministry of Food and 10% to 50% for merchants. The rice quality is similar to Du-indica.

### The First Batch of Sichuan Rice - Has Arrived in Hankou

The first batch of 24 tons of Sichuan rice, which the Ministry of Food previously planned to allocate to Hubei Province (2 million shi), has arrived in Hankou on a US landing craft. It is heard that the craft is a dedicated vessel for transporting Sichuan grain to Hubei. This was a trial voyage, and the results were good. Now that the Yangtze River water level has risen, the authorities are preparing to use a large number of ships to transport rice to Hankou. It is heard that after the food arrives successively, the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Food will distribute it at parity prices in Wuhan and other parts of Hubei Province in order to regulate the people's food supply.

### The Rice Markets in the North and South - Are Difficult to Restore in Practice

Recently, there were widespread rumors that the temporary rice market in Shanghai will be abolished, and that all rice and grains will be traded in the north and south markets. According to Xing Zhigang, director of the market management committee, the rice market has never considered this matter. There are many difficulties in implementing this measure. In the past, rice and grain trading was divided into two markets, the South Market located at the Fengji Wharf and the North Market located at the Xinzha Bridge. Since the war, the Fengji Wharf in the South Market has been damaged. Currently, repairing it would not only take a long time, but also require a lot of capital. Recently, only a small number of rice and grain brokers have made such calls.

### Too Little Rain Impedes Cotton Production - Part of the American Cotton Needs to be Replanted

[Reuters Washington, 16th] According to the official weekly cotton planting climate report, cotton planting in most of the southern states of the United States has been affected by the lack of timely rain. Some areas must be replanted, especially Arkansas.

### Economic Briefs

Recently, large quantities of coconut oil and copra have been shipped from Nanyang, Little Luzon, and Siam. Due to the slack demand, not only have prices plummeted, but no one is interested in buying them. Coconut oil was considered a rare commodity one or two months ago, with prices reaching 340,000 to 350,000 per dan. Yesterday's market price was only 100,000 per dan.

The establishment of cotton cloth distribution points by Zhongfang has caused opposition from cotton cloth merchants. After representatives from both sides negotiated, a temporary agreement has been reached. The Cotton Cloth Business Association is currently collecting opinions on the establishment of cotton cloth distribution points to ensure caution.

[Reuters Alexandria, 16th] It is heard that China's interest in Egyptian cotton is increasing. The French Purchasing Committee needs good quality cotton, but the barter trade between Egypt and Italy is currently at a standstill.

### Negotiations between the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Construction Bureaus and China Silk Corporation Regarding Cocoon Purchasing and Silk Reeling; Standard Cocoon Price Calculation Method Also Drafted

With the cocoon season approaching, the cocoon purchasing activities of various manufacturers have become extremely active due to the assistance of Shanghai's cocoon purchasing loan banks. Zhejiang Province is scheduled to start purchasing from the 18th, and Jiangsu and Anhui provinces will also begin procurement successively. Regarding this year's cocoon purchasing and silk reeling, the China Silk Corporation recently held discussions with representatives from the Construction Bureaus of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to carry out the following points: (1) Municipal scales should be used for cocoon collection. (2) Standard cocoon prices should be established. (3) Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces should separately formulate management plans for cocoon merchants and silk factories. (4) Allocation of autumn silkworm eggs between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces: Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces need 300,000 sheets of autumn eggs this year. Zhejiang Province will supply 150,000 sheets themselves, and the remainder will be supplied by Jiangsu. Jiangsu Province will cold-store 450,000 sheets of pure autumn eggs as the standard. (5) The two provincial governments will subsidize egg prices to encourage superior varieties. (6) Representatives from the Construction Bureaus of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will separately liaise and promote the organization of the Silkworm Egg Industry Association of the Third District (including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and Nanjing and Shanghai). (7) Registration of native silk merchants will be conducted immediately to gradually reduce native silk production. (8) Improvement guidance fees will be collected uniformly on native silkworm cocoons and improved silkworm cocoons. (9) Silkworm egg management should be restored to pre-war methods, and a silkworm cultivation improvement fee and egg price subsidy should be levied appropriately on dried cocoons. (10) During the cocoon season, the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will issue orders to county governments and security teams to earnestly protect and facilitate all personnel, funds, and other storage and transportation matters related to silkworm cocoon trading. (11) Silkworm silk workers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the management personnel stationed by the China Silk Corporation for cocoon collection should establish contact and assist each other at any time. In addition to drafting the above matters, the three parties' representatives also drafted a method for calculating standard cocoon prices. Assuming a silk price of 2,500,000 yuan (20/22 78%), with a reeling yield of 400 catties and a processing fee of 800,000 yuan, the cocoon cost is 1,700,000 yuan, the dry cocoon price (1,700,000 / 4) is 425,000 yuan, the cocoon drying, interest, and transportation costs (per picul) are 100,000 yuan, the net dry cocoon price is 325,000 yuan, and the fresh cocoon price (325,000 / 2.8) is 116,000 yuan (Sima scale). For every increase or decrease of ten catties in the reeling yield, the fresh cocoon price will be adjusted accordingly.

### Tight Money in Chongqing

[Chongqing Air Dispatch] Due to tight money and high interest rates in Shanghai, ordinary loans are around 1.5 to 2 points per month. This has led those with idle funds to sit back and enjoy the benefits. In addition, general merchants are in urgent need of funds and are scrambling everywhere. As a result, the long-depleted monetary atmosphere in Chongqing has suddenly turned profitable since the beginning of this month, and there is a growing trend of tightness. Interest rates have already increased. It is heard that yesterday, interest rates for loans until the end of the month were 2.8 yuan per day, and it was still not easy to obtain them. Money lenders everywhere are reporting shortages.

### Price of Xinghua Longans Soars Due to Shortage

### U.S. Treasury Secretary Predicts Post-War World Trade Situation: Three-Fourths in British-American Zone; Capitalism and Communism Form Two Groups

[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 15th] U.S. Treasury Secretary Vinson testified again today before the House Banking and Currency Committee considering the loan to Britain, predicting that 75% of post-war world trade will take place in the British and American zones. Michigan Republican Representative Crawford asked if this meant the world would be divided into two economic groups, one British-American capitalism and the other Soviet communism. Vinson replied, "In my opinion, we must recognize this situation. Britain occupies an important position in world trade. If the British-American zone, which accounts for 75% of world trade, can reach an understanding on monetary and trade practices, we can hope that its trade will expand to more than 75%." Vinson warned that if the loan agreement to Britain is not approved, American trade will be restricted in the world market, or even have no foothold in many places. He strongly stated that the United States does not need an economic war. He said that the goal of the loan agreement to Britain is to eliminate discriminatory trade practices.

### What I Saw in England: The Suez Knot

— Special Correspondent Xueyan, London Air Dispatch, May 3rd

Since the United Nations was born, the first real difficulty it encountered was the Iranian issue. Fortunately, on the one hand, the representatives of various countries in the Security Council did their best to uphold the Charter, and on the other hand, the Soviet Union and Iran were able to directly negotiate with a spirit of mutual compromise outside the Council, reaching an agreement in a state of being neither too close nor too far. Although this case is still on the books of the United Nations today, as long as Soviet troops withdraw from northern Iran before May 6, this account can probably be written off. If no further complications arise in the future, there should be no more disturbances. The details of the handling of this case in the United Nations have probably been published in detail in domestic newspapers, so there is no need to elaborate further.

Why is the United States' Attitude So Resolute?

In the debates in the Security Council, it seems at first glance that there is a U.S.-Soviet confrontation, especially when the meeting was held in New York, this trend seemed very obvious. Almost everywhere, the United States took the lead, and Britain and the remaining countries supported it. In fact, we know that the real conflict of interest in Iran is between Britain and the Soviet Union, not between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, if this dispute were led by Britain to confront the Soviet Union, the effect would probably not be so great, and therefore the results would probably not be satisfactory. One point worth noting here is that in this dispute, the U.S. government has consistently sympathized with Britain's position, which is beyond question. However, the actions of the U.S. government are often influenced by public opinion. Although the American people also sympathize with Britain's position and will certainly support the government and support the United States, the question is the degree to which they will do so. If the U.S. government is only in a position to support, then, once both sides insist and a stalemate develops, or even need to consider the issue of strength, will the American people always remain firm, risking confrontation with the Soviet Union for the sake of British interests, or is there no problem? Therefore, when it comes to critical moments, differences in the attitudes of Britain and the United States will inevitably affect the outcome. On the contrary, if the U.S. government takes the lead, the situation will be different. Every time both sides insist, it will involve the issue of the United States' prestige, and American public opinion cannot talk about retreating. And Britain, because its own interests are involved, must support the United States. The seamless cooperation between Britain and the United States is the main factor in the safe passage of this Iranian dispute. The Iranian issue is not directly related to the United States. Why is the United States' attitude so resolute? Does the U.S. authorities feel that in order to maintain the dignity of the United Nations, it needs strong U.S. support, and therefore, it is using the Iranian issue to express its determination to support it? Or is there a tacit understanding in diplomatic questions between Britain and the United States? We certainly cannot know. However, it is worth noting that when the Iranian issue was causing a great deal of commotion, the British Foreign Office suddenly sent a note to the Soviet Union protesting its interpretation of the war booty in the Eastern Three Provinces. The wording was extremely cautious, but the intention to support the United States was very obvious.

But if we are more demanding, we know that although the Security Council claims to have succeeded, it only safely passed the crisis itself, and did not actually resolve the dispute between the Soviet Union and Iran. The real solution to the dispute is still the agreement directly negotiated between the two countries. However, during the negotiation period, the United Nations was able to help boost its reputation, making Iran's position strengthened invisibly. Therefore, the agreement could be established more smoothly, which is true. Therefore, the real function of the United Nations is only this. Some people say that being able to do this is already not easy. Or this is very correct, and a realistic view.

A Set of Nets to Prevent Oil Rights from Overflowing

The main parts of the Soviet-Iranian agreement are three points: (1) Soviet troops stationed in northern Iran will be completely withdrawn before May 6. (2) The Soviet Union and Iran will jointly form an oil company to develop the oil fields in northern Iran. The company contract is tentatively set at 50 years. For the first 25 years, the Soviet Union will own 51% of the shares, and Iran will own 49%. For the next 25 years, the situation is exactly the opposite. The contract needs to be approved by the Iranian Parliament. Therefore, the agreement also stipulates that the oil company contract should be submitted to the parliament for approval within seven months from March 24. (3) The Soviet Union recognizes the independence movement in northern Iran as an internal affair of Iran, but it also recognizes it as a democratic movement, hoping that the Iranian government can resolve it legally. On the surface, these three points are independent of each other and have no connection with each other. The Soviet Union does not take the satisfactory completion of points (2) and (3) as a condition for withdrawing troops. But in fact, since they are negotiated at the same time, they naturally have a symbiotic relationship. At a time when the world is thirsty for oil, Iran, a small country, happens to have a lot of oil. It is really suffering from the illness of being guilty of having wealth. Iran itself, of course, also understands its own weaknesses, so it has pre-arranged a set of nets in legislation to prevent oil rights from falling into the hands of foreigners. According to the law enacted by the Iranian Parliament in the autumn of 1944, any prime minister or minister, or their representative, cannot negotiate oil rights with foreign governments or foreign companies without the approval of the parliament, otherwise the result is invalid. Therefore, the result of the Soviet-Iranian negotiations on oil rights can only take legal effect with the approval of the parliament. But we know that the Iranian Parliament has now been dissolved, and on the eve of its dissolution, it passed a law stipulating that when there are still foreign troops stationed within the territory, new parliamentary elections cannot be held. Therefore, the longer Soviet troops continue to be stationed in northern Iran, the longer a new parliament cannot be established. The second article of the Soviet-Iranian agreement requesting a deadline for parliamentary approval is all adapted to the national conditions of Iran. Soviet troops are scheduled to withdraw completely before May 6, and the oil field contract will be submitted to the parliament for approval about five and a half months after May 6. Of course, it is expected that the new parliament can escape in accordance with the law within five and a half months after the withdrawal of Soviet troops, and the agreement can be approved as expected.

Old Case Replayed: No Fresh Meaning

Why do we always say that the Soviet-Iranian dispute is directly related to Britain? This should be viewed from various historical, political, and economic perspectives. An important cornerstone of Britain's traditional foreign policy is to ensure the safety of the transportation line to the Far East. If a hostile power extends its influence to the vicinity of this transportation line, it considers itself threatened, and often does not hesitate to use all means to weaken this hostile power's strength here. Therefore, when France was strong in the Middle East, Britain competed with France. And when Tsarist Russia or the Soviet Union was strong, Britain also clashed with it. Conversely, on the Soviet side, whenever it is full of strength, it wants to go south and enter the Indian Ocean, which is also an old saying that everyone knows. Therefore, the intersection of the two countries' forces is also the point of interest, always in the area of Iran and the Dardanelles. Using historical precedents to prove that the harmony and conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union are largely determined by whether the conflict of interest in the above two places is resolved or eased. Therefore, the British-Soviet conflict recently manifested in the Iranian incident is just a rehash of the old story and has little fresh meaning. Northern Iran has always been considered to be within the Soviet Union's sphere of influence. If the development of Soviet power is only limited to this, Britain can still tolerate it. But if troops are not withdrawn and continue to move south, it will inevitably directly threaten Britain's transportation line. Therefore, before the Soviet Union's intentions were clear, Britain was particularly uneasy. And when this case was submitted to the Security Council for discussion, Britain's willingness to work so hard was on the one hand to warn the Soviet Union that it would risk conflict with Britain, and on the other hand, to make the Soviet Union understand to stop at the right time. Looking again at the agreement established by the Soviet Union and Iran this time, one of the main purposes of the Soviet Union is oil rights. If the Soviet Union only wants to obtain the oil fields in northern Iran, Britain would not excessively clamor. But hundreds of miles east of the northern Iranian border are British oil wells in Iraq, and hundreds of miles south are British oil fields in Abadan (Adalen). And when the popular movement for independence in northern Iran, its Kurds族 called on the Kurds of Iraq to rise up and fight together. This is also one of the reasons that made Britain feel chilled. Therefore, when the Soviet-Iranian dispute was being debated in the United Nations, whether it was in London led by Britain to confront the Soviet Union, or in New York led by the United States to confront the Soviet Union, the entire UK always paid attention, never slackening for a moment, until the dispute came to an end and the Soviet Union had a definite date for withdrawing troops, then Britain seemed to have taken a breath of fresh air.

When the Soviet-Iranian issue was in full swing, the British House of Commons sent several representatives to Iran to observe and investigate the truth on the spot. In particular, they wanted to enter the Soviet-occupied area, the lair of the separatist movement in northern Iran, namely Azerbaijan, to see the actual situation. In fact, because the Soviet army blocked them, they were unable to enter northern Iran and only reached Tehran. It can be said that they did not achieve their goal, but they gained a little direct impression. According to one of the representatives, Michael Foot, the general impression of Iran is that Britain's past policies towards Iran were wrong. He said: "Britain entered Iran in 1941 with only an army and no policy." To this day, the general Iranian only knows that Britain is an aggressive imperialist and a reactionary, who does not recognize the requirements of the times and does not understand the needs of the Iranian people. He believes that the most powerful political party in Iran today is the Tudeh Party, but the Tudeh Party is pro-Soviet and anti-British. However, even before the Tudeh Party colluded with the Soviet Union, it had already been tainted with anti-British sentiment. According to him, this is the result of the British authorities' ignoring the development of new forces. Because British local officials lack foresight and only know how to cooperate with the powerful, and the authorities happen to be corrupt. Once their power falls into the hands of the people, the hatred is extended to the British who cooperated with them. This is what Iran is like today. Now that the Tudeh Party has cooperated with the Soviet Union, its anti-British color is even stronger, which goes without saying. But according to him, Britain should take this as a warning and work hard to correct it, otherwise it will affect Britain's general reputation in the Middle East.

### Issue 136 of Soviet Forum Carries Article on Unpardonable Japanese War Crimes

The main Japanese war criminals are currently on trial in Tokyo, judged by an international tribunal composed of representatives from the countries that signed the Japanese surrender terms. Those who instigated, led, and carried out such conspiracies will be subject to legal judgment.

The world is paying close attention to the exposure in Nuremberg of the horrific crimes of the Hitlerite leaders. Now, the top figures of Japanese imperialism, the organizers of aggression in the Far East, will also be judged by an international tribunal.

List of War Criminals: Japanese war criminals not only committed the crime of initiating the Pacific War, but even before that, their records show that they were the organizers and leaders of the invasion of China and the heads of the Japanese war machine.

The publicly released list of main Japanese war criminals includes former Japanese Prime Ministers Konoe, Koiso, Hirota, and Hiranuma; former Kwantung Army Commanders Umezu and Minami Jiro; former Foreign Ministers Matsuoka and Shigemitsu; and Tani Masayuki, as well as other leaders of the Japanese government and military. However, these lists are not complete, with many omissions, and many of those whom the countries that participated in defeating Japan demanded to be punished were not included in the list.

The Emperor Himself

The Emperor Question: The Emperor himself, setting aside his sacred imperial status, is traveling around the country giving publicity to his willingness to "serve democracy."

World opinion insists that Hirohito should be tried. Democratic Senator Roslow gave a speech in the Senate, demanding the arrest of the Emperor as a war criminal, which he was right to do. He pointed out that Hirohito is the heart of Japanese imperialism and one of the greatest aggressors in history. He also said: Because the Allies showed great respect for Hirohito, the Japanese people do not feel their defeat.

A group of prominent Filipinos jointly sent a telegram to President Truman, pointing out that reactionary forces intended to help the Emperor escape trial. Chinese newspapers emphasized that although Hirohito issued the surrender order and was temporarily retained to allow Allied forces to occupy Japan, his responsibility was not reduced as a result. Finally, even some Japanese newspapers hoped that the Allied headquarters would hand Hirohito over to the International Tribunal.

Kijuro Shidehara's Evasive Words

Although Shidehara reluctantly admitted that it was necessary to determine who was guilty of war crimes, they dramatically proclaimed: "He does not agree that these people deliberately started the war." Shidehara is very enthusiastic about helping war criminals evade responsibility.

He insisted: "There is no law that can be used as the basis for punishing those responsible for the war. Invoking such a new law is politically impermissible. If we must do this, then it constitutes a threat to the lives of our citizens. I believe that such a law could easily be abused by those who are politically powerful. We can use such laws to punish those who have failed politically. I believe that those guilty of war crimes should only be judged by public opinion."

When the order to arrest Prince Konoe was issued, Shidehara declared in the Diet: The government should not issue any statement on this matter.

Konoe and His Ilk: Konoe's suicide by poison can be considered a fitting death, allowing him to escape trial. Most government officials even attended Konoe's funeral. The Japanese police, who were ordered by MacArthur to arrest war criminals, gave many war criminals the opportunity to commit suicide calmly, thus escaping trial.

The occupying authorities have shown negligence in assigning the task of arresting war criminals to the Japanese police. Not only that, but according to the Associated Press, the US military headquarters also gave a group of war criminals three days of freedom to conclude their personal affairs. During this period, these war criminals were of course able to destroy all evidence and documents. Several war criminals were even granted various privileges for "commercial" reasons.

Finally, American newspapers reported that MacArthur decided to review the list of war criminals to determine whether further arrests were necessary. Moreover, the occupying authorities even released some war criminals before the trial began. Many of those in detention have had many opportunities to communicate with the outside world.

Mission of Atonement: Seeing the leniency and forgetfulness of the Allied countries, the Japanese government has devised a way to allow a group of war criminals to benefit. The Japanese government decided to send a "Mission of Atonement" to apologize and seek forgiveness from the countries that suffered during the war.

Shimada, the former Japanese Naval Minister who actively participated in the plan to attack Pearl Harbor, humbly told reporters that he went to Meiji Shrine every day to repent for his crimes.

The leaders of the Japanese government who directed the acts of aggression all pushed the blame onto the army, the army pushed it onto the navy, and the navy pushed it onto a group of dead people. When Tojo was arrested, he expressed extreme surprise and declared that he had tried his best to prevent the war, and that only Tojo himself was guilty of starting the war. Shortly before his suicide, Konoe argued that all his activities were for the purpose of peace, but these activities were obstructed by the warlords. In his will, this cunning old politician even tried to whitewash his own crimes. He wrote: "I have always wanted to cooperate with the United States to resolve Pacific affairs peacefully, but it is a pity that the United States has listed me as a war criminal.

Cunning Style

Tojo, who during his tenure as Prime Minister, followed the actions of the Hitlerite leaders step by step, is now using the same effort to imitate the cunning methods invented by a group of advanced comrades in the Nuremberg defendants' dock.

The Japan Times reported on March 27 that, according to authoritative sources: ". Tojo must lose his memory." During the interrogation, he could not "remember dates and other important details." Undoubtedly, during future interrogations, Japanese war criminals will maintain their consistent style of deception, evasion, and denial.

The Yamashita Case

The recent trial of Yamashita in Manila is clear proof. Although the prosecutor presented strong evidence and witnesses described the various atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers under the defendant's command in the Philippines, the defendant's lawyer appealed to the Philippine Supreme Court, requesting that Yamashita Tomoyuki be treated as a prisoner of war. These people who distort right and wrong even questioned the jurisdiction of the military commission that tried Yamashita Tomoyuki, arguing that such a trial violated the constitutions of the United States and the Philippines. Finally, they protested that Spain, which represents Japanese interests, had not received formal notice of the trial.

After all attempts failed, Yamashita appealed to the US Supreme Court. It was not until three months after the trial began that Yamashita received the final verdict and was executed by hanging. However, after Yamashita, General Homma, who was tried in Manila, had the opportunity to delay the case for a long time based on seemingly ambiguous legal technicalities. The lessons learned from the process of the trials that have already been held should be considered, and attention should be paid to the demands of various countries for the swift punishment of war criminals. Japanese fascists used the same weapons as the Hitlerites to imitate imperialism, seizing foreign territories, enslaving other countries, abolishing their independence, plundering the property of various countries, destroying all laws and customs of war, and abusing prisoners of war and the people of conquered countries - all of this was the same style in German imperialism and Japanese imperialism.

### Taitung Fishing Port: Suao

— Special Correspondent Mu Yun, Taitung Aviation News, 10th of this month

Judging from the terrain and actual conditions of Taitung, Suao — a small town located on the edge of the Pacific Ocean — is indeed the most excellent fishing port. It occupies a significant position in the total fish production of Taiwan.

Nanfangao, the center of the fishing port, is two kilometers from Suao. The reporter walked for three quarters of an hour in the hot weather. The district office has set up a village chief's office (township head) here, led by a village chief surnamed Huang. We visited the vitamin research factory established by the Japanese here using fish. It was bombed by American planes on March 21 last year, leaving only a ruin. The Health Bureau and higher authorities were unwilling to take over, leaving the local authorities to chew on the dregs.

The Japanese stored a large number of naval mines and aerial torpedoes in the mountain caves. There was a light railway line that meandered through the mountain caves, following the coastline and the cliffs to the town. On the water side of the small train line is a T-shaped inner harbor built artificially, made of cement, with a depth of two to three meters. Hundreds of motorized fishing boats and sailboats are docked here, as well as Japanese-style landing craft taken over by the naval department, thirty of which are docked in a row on the ocean.

From November to May, during these six months, the daily production is 600,000 Taiwan dollars. From June to October in the summer, because fish production is decentralized for sale, the daily production is 300,000 Taiwan dollars. There is a fisheries association with more than a hundred members, which handles matters related to fisheries. In the past, the Japanese allocated fishing gear to fish producers and issued subsidy bonuses to increase production. Now, the government's fisheries department has not yet thought of encouraging and subsidizing, but production has not decreased. This phenomenon seems abnormal, but it is actually very simple. The reason is that fish prices are high, which directly encourages them to increase production, enabling more than a thousand local people and five hundred Ryukyu residents who have been displaced to obtain a more stable life than in the Japanese era. (Regarding the Ryukyu residents, the reporter would like to report to the readers that there are 5,000 Ryukyu people in Taiwan. Like the gypsies of Europe, they live a nomadic life. Recently, they have felt serious unease, which is the rumor that their property will be confiscated. Some knowledgeable people say that it is a poisonous arrow released by the Japanese who were left in Taiwan for covert purposes, which is a terrible conspiracy.) The Taiwan Fisheries Company, with a capital of 50 million yuan, has a cold storage warehouse in Nanfangao, one of which can store 50 tons, and another in Suao with a daily production of 600 tons of freezing factory, and a canning factory with a monthly output of 5,000 boxes (the factory has been closed after the takeover), and the fishing equipment is very complete. The number one product is sailfish. Shark fins are the only seafood in the eyes of Shanghai people. It accounts for four-tenths of the total production in the province. The quality is better than that of Japanese production. A month ago, the selling price was 85 yuan per catty, but now it has soared to 400 yuan per catty, and there is still a shortage of goods.

Nanfangao is a harbor surrounded by mountains on three sides, artificially constructed, which is quite grand and suitable for sheltering from the wind and for concealment. However, because of the typhoon attack last year, many houses and public buildings were destroyed, and they have not yet been restored to their original state. A team of military police is stationed here to maintain law and order, so that the other side of the ocean has deeply smelled the atmosphere of mainland China. When the reporter sang "Fishermen are poor for generations" on the seaside under the moonlight, he had a different feeling about the government's "unlimited" indifference!

### Water Town Suzhou

— Correspondent Wu Shouren, Suzhou, 12th of this month

Suzhou, the water town of Jiangnan, known as the Venice of the East, may be a very small point in the map of China, which covers one to two million square kilometers, but its tranquil and beautiful appearance is admired and envied by tens of millions of people from the north and south of the Yangtze River. Thinking of the popular saying "Above there is heaven, below there is Suzhou and Hangzhou," Suzhou must have a brilliant and glorious history.

Should Be Sowing: What to Buy Rice With to Exchange for Seeds

Along the Beijing-Shanghai line, Suzhou should always be considered a wealthy land of fish and rice, but today, this fortunate noun has become a fading trace and cannot be applied to the current Suzhou. The rice fields surrounding the city, covering more than 1.4 million mu, have an annual output of about 2.4 million shi of white rice. If distributed to a population of more than 1.3 million people, with the minimum needs of each person, there will still be a panic of 400,000 shi missing each year. What's more, this only food cannot be fully enjoyed by the people of Suzhou. In addition to the procurement of military food and the supply of local miscellaneous troops, there is also a large amount absorbed by huge grain loans. Although it is only a few months away from the autumn harvest, most of the tenant farmers have been threatened by famine. They were originally preparing food to get through the period between harvests, but gun purchase fees, self-defense donations, etc. forced them to sell their limited food reserves. In an instant, the price of rice soared to more than 40,000 yuan. The fields should also be sown, and everyone is worried: What to buy rice with? What to exchange for seeds?

Material Theft Suspects: Actually Escaped from Prison

The warehouses left by the enemy are densely distributed in the suburbs. They have been sealed, stored, and guarded since September last year, but there is still no news of any disposal. "Starving people fill the roads," although still an exaggerated phrase, "rice rotting in the granary" is the most accurate. In February of this year, a case of dereliction of duty involving theft was exposed. The warehouse manager of Xikuatang colluded with his subordinates to continuously steal a large amount of materials. Although this matter was discovered and investigated by the competent authorities, it actually allowed the main criminal to escape through the window while in custody. The result was that it ended without a conclusion. The unlucky ones were the common people who sold the stolen goods, who are said to still be imprisoned. They became the scapegoat for the criminals.

The Suzhou news industry is also not as lively as before the war. Currently, the newspapers in circulation are Suzhou Mingbao, Su Bao, Suzhou Daily, Lixing Daily, Dinhua Bao, and Dajiangnan Bao, a total of six newspapers. Except for Dajiangnan Bao, which is a small-sized newspaper published three times a month, the others are three large-sized daily newspapers and two small-sized daily newspapers. There is only competition in business and news between them, and little attention is paid to the improvement of their own organizations. Therefore, the strength of the news front is scattered. Unlike other places where there is fierce competition in work, but a valuable harmony is maintained in spirit, in the past February, the news workers themselves initiated the organization of the News Reporters Friendship Association. Only three preparatory meetings were held, and the fourth meeting was stillborn, and it has not been established to this day. The only existing news organization is the Newspaper Association, which is the only news industry organization independently organized by the publishers of five daily newspapers.

Piles of Garbage: Seemingly Forming Small Hills

Finally, what I want to say is about the garbage in Suzhou. If a foreigner wants to inquire about Suzhou's specialties, the reporter can answer him without hesitation: "Garbage." This is Suzhou's historical specialty. Piled up at the ends of every street and alley, or in open spaces, seemingly forming piles of small hills. In the past, it has been repeatedly cleaned up using Japanese prisoners of war, but cleanliness could not be maintained for more than three days. The reason is of course that the destination is not prosperous. In fact, hundreds of thousands of tenant farmers surrounding the city need it to be used as fertilizer. However, the demands and difficulties in transportation make the honest tenant farmers dare not try. Each scavenger or local bully arbitrarily identifies a section of land, and the garbage within this section is their property. They refuse to let others transport it casually without payment, and they themselves do not find ways to sell and dispose of it, so they accumulate it there to wait for a good price. Whenever the weather is clear, the wind blows and stirs up a large cloud of dust everywhere. In this cloud of dust, we seem to be watching this tranquil and beautiful Suzhou, a water town in Jiangnan, falling behind day by day, day by day. Separated from the beautiful and ideal realm.

### Going South by Driving the Chariot North · Self-Contained System: Two Worlds of Korea

According to Koreans who have moved from northern Korea to the American zone in the south: Today's Korea is actually divided into two countries, possessing two different political and economic systems.

The American occupation zone is governed by the US military government led by Major General Lerch. The government was established in September 1945, immediately after the American occupation forces landed in Korea. Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US military in Korea, once said: The American plan is to gradually transfer all administrative and executive powers to the Koreans when they are capable of doing so in Korea.

Korean Autonomy: Expected to be Realized Soon

In the past few months, this ability of the Koreans has been quite strong. Major General Lerch said in an interview with the Associated Press that he believed that Koreans would soon be able to take over all government agencies. Later, he also said that he believed that the Koreans were ready for autonomy and hoped that they would be able to become a reality soon.

According to a recent announcement by the military government: The transfer of government power is actually in progress and is progressing rapidly. For several months, there have been two directors in each bureau of the government, and many other important positions have dual officials: one American and one Korean. In fact, in most bureaus, the position of the American is purely advisory, and the Korean officials are doing the actual work.

Like a Pyramid: Establishing a Civil Service System

At the beginning of this year, General Hodge explained the purpose of the United States in Korea. He compared the Korean government to a pyramid. He said: The Americans are building the pyramid from the bottom up, laying a solid foundation for the civil service system, so that when the provisional government and the final independent government are established, the leaders of the government can stand securely on the pyramid without the danger of collapsing.

The military government, following Hodge's policy, specially established a civil service system suitable for the Korean political system. It promulgated a decree last month stipulating that government officials must pass a civil service examination to completely overthrow the Japanese system of appointment by the Japanese Emperor. The Korean civil service system is completely based on the American civil service system, and the actual organizational matters are presided over by the American civil service chief. All positions are based on performance as the standard for retention. Current officials, as long as they can pass the examination or their qualifications and abilities are considered satisfactory by senior officials, have the hope of retaining their positions.

Five Northern Provinces: The Situation of Soviet Takeover

But in northern Korea, the government system under the Soviet Union presents a completely different picture. When the Soviet Union occupied northern Korea, the People's Committee was established there, taking over the Korean administrative organs after the Japanese surrender. This kind of organization also existed within the American occupation zone. When the United States announced that the military government was the only ruling body recognized by the United States, the Soviet Union took over these committees for its own use. According to the Koreans, they often changed the leaders and administrative heads, but the body of the organization remained unchanged.

This situation has created a situation that allows the Soviet Union to have an excuse to say that Korea is ruled by the Provisional People's Committee, while the United States can only say that they are laying the foundation for a permanent government. The government in the north is based in Pyongyang, the second largest city and industrial center in Korea. The American government is located in Seoul, the ancient capital of Korea. The American authorities have taken over the Korean government, while the Soviet Union has only taken over the government of the five northern provinces.

The North and South Zones: Almost Run Counter to Each Other

The leaders of the Communist Party in southern and northern Korea have fully utilized the so-called "one people" government. In fact, this government is predetermined. According to the Koreans, important positions are occupied by Communist Party members, and anti-Communists are absolutely not allowed to hold administrative positions. Politically, the north and south zones are almost running counter to each other. The Americans allow all parties (from Communists to anarchists) to participate in politics. But the Soviet Union, through the People's Committee under the control of the Communist Party, only supports the Communist Party and excludes all other parties. Within the American zone, there are currently 150 registered parties, of which five parties are relatively important. But in the Soviet zone, there are only the Communist Party, the left-wing People's Party, and the Democratic Party. The latter, due to the impact of political and social changes, cannot continue to operate in northern Korea and has moved its headquarters to Seoul.

Similarly, in terms of economy, the situation in the north and south zones is also completely different. The American army only took over the banks and currency, but according to the Koreans, the Soviet army forcibly occupied the banks and issued its own military notes. In the American zone, political parties adopted a land reform policy to sell land to farmers. But in the north, the Communist Party wants to confiscate the land and give it to the farmers.

### Truly Going to Fight?

— Liao Yuan

I am an ordinary citizen without party affiliation, standing in an objective position. I want to say something directly to the point: the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and other parties, along with the powerful officials, are all serving the common people. To put it bluntly, the country belongs to us, the people. Your parties and those in power are public servants of the people, meant to create happiness for the people, not to play around with us. You must recognize your responsibilities and not assume that just because you have guns, the country and the people are your possessions. Of course, it would be great if you could negotiate well. But if you can't, and guns are pitted against guns, cannons against cannons, who suffers in the end but the common people? Frankly speaking, you are toying with the people. It's pitiful that the people's voices have no effect anymore. We don't want you to fight, yet you insist on opening fire. Doesn't this mean the people have no sovereignty? What democracy are we even talking about? We, the weak and helpless common people, have only one request: please don't fight! Let the people have a few days of peace, and let the country catch its breath. Our country has been embroiled in civil war for over twenty years and fought against the Japanese invaders for eight more. We are already exhausted. Finally, with the government's leadership, the external threats have been eliminated. This is the time for national construction and for the people to rest. How can we possibly tolerate internal strife again? Even if you each have powerful backers, I ask you, what good does it do for our country and our people? Fighting back and forth, isn't it just a case of two clams fighting, benefiting the fisherman? Isn't Spain a good example for us? Do you perhaps want to turn the country into a graveyard and make us, the people, into corpse-guarding ghosts? Our people's demand for a ceasefire and peace is as good as nothing. We have to rely on our allies to mediate and run around to bring about some result. It's such a shameful thing that our domestic affairs have to be managed by outsiders! Our people shout until their throats are sore, but it's like a drop in the bucket, completely ineffective. The people don't want you to fight, yet you insist on fighting. We, the people, can only call out to Heaven, and only Heaven knows our suffering. We endured eight years of the War of Resistance, shedding blood and suffering hardship, finally hoping that the Japanese devils would surrender so we could return to our hometowns. Who would have thought that not only could we not go home, but prices are even higher than during the war, making it impossible for us to survive? We heard that there was a ceasefire and that transportation was restored. We were overjoyed, dancing with happiness. But who knew that the good times wouldn't last? We heard that fighting had broken out again everywhere, that transportation was disrupted again, and that the ceasefire order was no longer effective, leaving us, the displaced people, with no other option but to shed a few hot tears. But we, the people, still hope that you powerful officials who wield guns will have the heart of a Bodhisattva and have pity on us, the people! Please don't fight anymore. If both sides truly launch a full-scale civil war, we, the people, standing in an objective position, will not lean towards either side. You are all Chinese; we will see who treats us, the people, better. Fight, fight, fight, we, the people, will watch you fight!

Relieving the Grain Shortage — Liang Zhao

Recently, famine has continued in various parts of the country, rice and food are scarce, and starving people are migrating. The situation is severe, and cries for help are rising everywhere. Socially conscious people are thinking of good ways to remedy the situation. Some advocate food rationing, others advocate thrift, and so on. The food rationing policies in Europe and the United States have been implemented and can greatly solve the food shortage problem. However, China's current household registration system is not good, and transportation is not smooth, so it is feared that good results may not be achieved. Although frugality is a passive method, it may still be helpful if implemented properly. Poor families have already tightened their belts and practiced complete frugality. The problem lies only with the wealthy. They must have fish and meat with every meal, and they must eat until they are full before they stop. This is simply too extravagant! We want to ask them to show great kindness, save food, and save their compatriots who are on the line of death. At the same time, the government should urgently use newspapers and radio stations to promote frugality, and immediately implement compulsory frugality measures, such as strictly prohibiting the use of rice to brew wine, make pastries, and prohibiting diners from eating and drinking excessively in restaurants and hotels. Guangxi once vigorously promoted frugality. When the local authorities opened wine shops and restaurants, they sent military police to monitor their operations. If they found diners eating more than the regulations allowed, they would be punished according to law. As a result, the habit of eating excessively gradually decreased. In short, governance depends on people. If the government is determined to implement it vigorously and formulate laws that are appropriate for the situation, there is no reason why it will not be effective.

Reading the essays in Ta Kung Pao and Shen Bao, wise men and scholars have expressed their views, such as selecting food, paying attention to quality, and seeking to obtain rich nutrients, and paying attention to eating methods, intending to make food easy to digest and absorb, all of which are good suggestions. At the same time, I feel that our country's cooking methods mostly seek to satisfy taste, without paying attention to nutrition, discarding or retaining things and whether they are easy to digest, which is not in line with scientific principles. The matter must be studied and improved by various health agencies and food nutritionists. The United States has already achieved results in researching and improving the cooking method of rice. Looking back at our country, which has always been known as a rice-eating country, no one has paid attention to improvement. It is embarrassing to say, do we only know how to enjoy the achievements of others? Stewing and steaming vegetables are not advisable, frying is better because the loss of nutrients is less. Secondly, the ingredients can also be reduced. This does not greatly affect the taste of the vegetables, but it can save food. Advanced scholars should study cooking methods, and draw up several menus for compatriots, detailing the cooking methods, widely disseminate them, and guide people to adopt them. If we can do this, it is expected that part of the difficulties of the food shortage can be resolved.

Spring and Autumn

### A Grand Occasion of Listening to Music

— Tang Liyan

Music is one of the six arts, connected to literature and art above, and in harmony with opera and drama below. As Zixia said, "Words are not enough to express it, therefore we lengthen them; lengthening words is not enough, therefore we sing and sigh; singing and sighing is not enough, therefore we dance with our hands and stomp with our feet." Therefore, Yao struck the chime-stones and the hundred beasts danced together. Shun played the five-stringed zither and sang the "Ode to the Southern Wind," and the world was at peace. Confucius, after hearing the Shao music, did not taste meat for three months. Its power to move people is beyond what words can convey. Since the demise of elegant music and the rise of foreign music, our people's power of assimilation has been stronger than that of any other nation. Therefore, before long, the Qiang flute, the Hu Jia, the Pipa, and the Sanxian became as important as the Qin, Se, Sheng, and Zheng. In the Tang Dynasty's Ten Parts of Music, elegant music occupied only one position, while the others were mostly music from Liangzhou, Yizhou, Gaochang, and even India, brought in from the Western Regions. Because of the love of music by Emperor Wu of Han, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, and Emperor Huizong of Song, there were great masters such as Li Yannian, Li Yannian, Kang Kunlun, Huang Fancho, and Zhou Bangyan, as well as peerless beauties such as Lady Li, Zhao Feiyan, Yang Yuhuan, and Li Shishi. That period was the golden age of Chinese music. How glorious and magnificent! Hearing about it a thousand years later still makes one's heart stir. Since the Yuan and Ming dynasties, music has gradually declined. With the loss of ritual, we seek it in the wild. Hence, the invention of the Yuan Dynasty's new drama and the Ming Dynasty's Kunqu opera were enough to slightly revive the declining trend. Since the opening of the seas, the people of our country have been obsessed with Europe and America, and Western music has flourished, no longer knowing that there is national music. Those so-called musicians seem to think that carrying a violin and playing a saxophone is enough to fulfill their capabilities. The saxophone and violin are certainly good, but they do not think from the perspective of our own culture. They absorb foreign cultures, abandoning their own, and only value the West, even considering China to have no music, which is regrettable.

The gentlemen of the Shanghai National Music Research Association, at this time of uncertainty, have gathered comrades to study national music, to turn back the tide when it is about to fall, and to seek out what is about to be lost. Having been established for ten years, they have performed many times, and their reputation has long been spread both at home and abroad. In particular, the president, Mr. Sun Yude, has devoted himself to research for thirty years, having unique secrets in national music, and adopting the strengths of others with a humble heart, which is even more commendable. The other day, in response to an invitation from the Friends of the Military Association, they gave a public performance to慰劳 the soldiers who had fought hundreds of battles and to celebrate the commemoration of the return to the capital. This reporter was fortunate enough to attend the event, a feast for the ears, and cannot but record it.

That evening, they played "Remembering the Past," "Han Xin Conquers Chu," "Sword Dance," and "High Moon." "Remembering the Past" is a Zhongyuan string music that was transmitted to Dabu, Guangdong. It is a work of inspiration at the time. It is played by all ten instruments in unison. The interlude is desolate and has a deep sense of emotion. It is played by southerners, which adds a delicate and undulating feeling. It is the combination of the strengths of the north and the south. Next was Mr. Sun Yude's Pipa solo, its name being "Han Xin Conquers Chu". Marquis of Huaiyin, Han Xin, trapped the Hegemon-King of Chu at Gaixia with his ambushing plan of Ambush from Ten Sides, the Hegemon-King, with his earth-shattering appearance, was defeated and committed suicide at the Wujiang River. This tune is the same story as "The Hegemon-King Disarms" (also known as 四輪袍). "The Hegemon-King Disarms" tells the story of the Hegemon-King's tragic defeat, especially the part where he bids farewell to his concubine, which is even more poignant (Mei Lanfang's Farewell My Concubine is based on this). This tune, however, describes the victory of the Han army. The story is both tragic and heroic, and Mr. Sun Yude's fingerwork is especially skilled. He can play various sounds on the Pipa strings. At first, the bugles and horns sound together, the three armies line up, the generals are appointed and the soldiers are dispatched, and the teams are ambushed. Then the battle begins, the shouting shakes the sky, and amidst the stampede of ten thousand horses, drum sounds are interspersed. Finally, the formation is defeated, they break through the siege, and flee hastily, ending with a sharp sound that stops abruptly, making the listener feel as if they are in the battlefield, witnessing the bloody battle of the two armies. It is truly a divine skill. The next performance was Mr. Ye Dami and Miss Bingru's sword dance, accompanied by Pipa, Jinghu, Sheng, and Xiao four musical instruments. Mr. Ye is said to be the true heir of General Li Jinglin. His swordsmanship is of the Wudang school, and he has already deeply entered the realm. His inner strength is profound, and his thrust is especially miraculous. Miss Bingru's swordsmanship is also exquisite. The two dance together, gently undulating, each reaching their best. They are sometimes as agile as swimming dragons, sometimes as light as startled swans, both bold and agile, heroic and transcendent. I did not see the sword dance of Lady Gongsun, but I have already been fascinated by watching Wang Xichun's sword dance in Hanga during an enemy air raid, and I wrote a long poem to record it, which was widely spread. Now seeing Mr. Ye and Miss Sword Dance is even more magical and extraordinary. No wonder Zhang Dian saw Lady Gongsun's sword dance and became a master of cursive script. The finale was "High Moon". "!!!" is another name for the Song of Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Dress. Some say that the Song of Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Dress was the music that the Taoist Ye Fashan heard when he led Emperor Xuanzong of Tang to tour the Moon Palace, while others say that it was the Brahman music presented by Yang Jingshu, the Tang Hexi Jiedushi. The former is closer to mythology, while the latter may be more credible, because the Brahman music came from the Western Liang and was adapted by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. This music has songs and dances, and it was probably taught to the Liyuan disciples after being adapted by Emperor Xuanzong. The reason why this music is named so is because Consort Yang Yuhuan loved this music and also personally created the Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Dress Dance to please Emperor Xuanzong. With the rendering of Bai Juyi's Song of Everlasting Regret, the romance of Emperor Xuanzong and Yang Guifei immediately floats into the mind when mentioning the preface to Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Dress. This music was lost by the Song Dynasty. Jiang Baishi once supplemented a stanza of Sanxu. Recently, Professor Wu Meicun obtained a solitary copy, which turned out to be a complete set, and personally taught it at the Southeast University Affiliated High School and the First Women's Normal School. This evening was a musical performance by the entire orchestra, not a song and dance, so there are still shortcomings in discussing the preface to Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Dress, but the skill of the performance has been able to convey the events in this story, as if one were in the Tang Palace. This music should only be found in heaven, how many times can one hear it in the world? After the performance, the entire audience applauded for three minutes without stopping, demanding another encore. But after a while, the music ended and the people disappeared, inevitably causing disappointment. Listening to the true music of the Rainbow Skirt in the sky, the wind and dew are unbearable on the way back, which is used as the finale of this music.

### The Annamese's Horn

— Zhang Luo

"DA, DA DA..." The horn of the Annamese people in the Shanghai Overseas Annamese Association, my neighbor, is sounding again. The east has just turned white, when the wandering thoughts of the classmates in the dormitory are still lingering in the "Spring Dream Garden."

This monotonous, weak, and even desolate horn is sounding endlessly and regularly every day, whether you are in class, reading and writing, taking a walk in the garden after class, or lying on the bed under the lamp, lost in thought.

It disrupts our work and disturbs our peace, but we have no right or even reason to stop it. Because, as the Annamese people say, this is also their homework—it is the representative of the Annamese people, the voice of the Annamese people—the voice of all Annamese people!

Helplessly, the classmates came up with a way to deal with it, which is to spit on the ground as soon as it sounds again, to express a kind of spiritual disgust and curse for it.

This day was even worse. Several horns started blaring together, just as we were having English class; and joining in were several drum sounds. These things were blowing and beating together in a mess. This cursed sound was like loss and sorrow; like accusation and injustice. At the same time, if you listened carefully, you could also hear a series of solemn, sad, and intense farewell tunes mixed in...

This day ruined one of our classes. Most of the classmates only spat three times before stopping, because it blew and beat continuously for an hour. As a result, the classmates elected me as their representative and decided to walk over the courtyard wall and negotiate with them.

I went, and the negotiation went like this:

"Friends!" On the parade ground, I stopped a short Annamese drummer and asked him in French.

"I'm sorry, I can't welcome you to speak to me in French!" He answered me in Chinese with reproach and kindness, solemnly.

I felt ashamed and embarrassed, and then asked:

"What is this for today?" I also spoke Chinese, pointing to the horns and drums that were placed aside, and the group of drummers squatting beside them.

"Oh!" He called out, "Now I can talk to you, even though we have wasted a lot of effort on you... Now we are aware: we will take all the remaining strength back and blow it there, where we believe it can arouse resistance and help! Friends, are we saying goodbye tomorrow? Just now was a farewell to you..."

After coming back, I wandered around the campus, savoring these words carefully. Soon, I understood the monotonous, weak, and even desolate sound, and the solemn, sad, and intense farewell tune that I had not been able to understand before...

Yes, we have foolishly misused many precious strengths of others. In our country, apart from only knowing how to watch people fight for democracy as if watching a play, and using disgust to deal with friends' requests for help and urging, there is nothing else.

After thinking, I wanted to tell everyone what I had experienced and thought, so that they could also understand the Annamese people's horns and its sound, and further promote their actions to make up for the disappointment of friends towards us, but they are leaving tomorrow...

Yes, they are leaving tomorrow. Tomorrow, the so-called Shanghai Overseas Annamese Association will leave behind the three empty and prison-like Western houses and a parade ground like a desolate tomb. And the Annamese people, our dear brothers, will leave these behind and run to the embrace of their homeland, which is small but knows how to resist and help...

### Night Inscription on Grass

— Qi Fan

At night, I dipped my haggard soul in silence, calling for dreamlike shadows. My thoughts, like a tired pug, lay at my feet, a past memory floating to the surface of my heart.

Under the small window, the green lamp accompanies the silence—thinking of your history, warming your old dreams, what is there? A trace of sweetness that has passed, a little tranquility; in the alley, there are lonely night travelers, their footsteps tapping on the stone slabs, so the waves spread on the sea of night, and the heart expands in circles in all directions; it is also like slowly expanding from the focus of a snail-shell-like spiral, gradually greening the unfolding marks, lengthening the journey of life. A few poetic sentiments of the night, a few memories; tracing back the old dreams of the past, scarlet and golden, chewing them like an olive.

The contemplation of the night carries you further away.

In the desolate countryside, there is no trace of anyone at the ferry crossing. In the blossoming month of March, carrying a simple pack, traversing one mountain, then wading through a river, the roads at night are mostly rugged, a distant spark of fire, is it a lamp light or a will-o'-the-wisp? The night wind howls as it sweeps across the wilderness. When fatigue weighs down the legs, the dawn appears on the horizon, and the red halo of the sunlight rises into the brightness of the daytime.

In the ancient city, we meet and want to know each other, you hold up your clever wisdom, so you leave me with a good memory. In the mountain city, the ancient city walls, the spring dusk, are covered with the remnants of the sun, a white cloud in the blue sky covers the distant poplars, in the small river. The setting sun scatters golden light, white chickens swim close, the round, water-like ripples are hidden in the green grass. The chickens' toes tap on the surface of the water, creating a series of notes, you say, this is time, this is true beauty. A wild flower, abandoned, is gently picked up by you in the forest. So you think of the flower-thrower, you say, this flower is smeared with love and hate. Finally, on a moonless night, you put on a grass-green coat, and then walked out alone, recognizing the breath and color of the night.

There is no sadness at parting, you only say a low "goodbye", I only watch your back disappear into the atmosphere of the night, at that time, who can appreciate whether the occasional separation is sweet or bitter? ...... Now, five years have passed, but this small city, should also make you nostalgic?

In the distance, there are green mountains, there are green waters, and a beautiful environment for you, but do you still remember your old friend from thousands of miles away?

The night is still so quiet. I take out a photo of you, which you gave me as a memento, from a page in a book with a red leaf pressed between the pages, and stare at it. Suddenly, it makes me seem to faintly yearn for your grass-green coat, which is always a silent shadow.

Fatigue lowers my eyelids, but I don't want to sleep. I press my hand on my chest, faintly, but heavily, I hear the beating of my own heart.

The lamp shakes off the weariness of the long night, and letters from people in the distance are spread out on the table.

The century is long!

### Harvest

— Chen Gange

The dim sunset, facing the high-hanging rosy clouds, in the early autumn of Jiangnan, still tries to radiate its weak remaining power. But the farmers seem not to have noticed that dusk has begun to envelop the earth, still bending down, barefoot; the men naked to the waist, rolling up their trousers; the women wearing very thin clothes, holding sickles in their hands, cutting and cutting, letting the bean-sized sweat droplets slide from the corners of their foreheads to their mouths, then flow to their necks, and then flow to their chests, before dripping little by little into the soil.

### Twin Flight (36)

— Zhao Qingge

(9)

The Second Madam Weng no longer carries the surname Weng, but we might as well still call her Second Madam Weng. It suffices for us to know that she has become the wife of Shi Wanglou.

Since Second Madam Weng eloped with Shi Yulou to Beijing, she has lived in an apartment in the Xichenggen area.

Shi Yulou still performs, but he is not as famous as he was in Jingzhou. Beijing is a place where famous actors congregate, and Shi Yulou can only be ranked as a third-rate actor. Wealthy people go to listen to Xun Huisheng's huashan opera; those without money listen to the Fuliancheng opera school, which is also passable.

Shi Yulou still smokes opium, and he smokes it even more heavily. Like Master Weng, he sleeps during the day and performs on stage at night. He hardly has time to talk or play with Second Madam Weng, leaving her still living a lonely and desolate life.

As time went on, Second Madam Weng felt that Shi Yulou was not as considerate and indulgent as Master Weng. Shi Yulou was never much of a talker, but now he is even more silent, often not saying a word from morning to night. When Second Madam Weng asked him something, he would nod to indicate agreement and shake his head to indicate disagreement. Within this "agreement" and "disagreement," there were more disagreements. Because Shi Yulou was quite stubborn, he did what he wanted, and Second Madam Weng had to go along with him. But Shi Yulou did not necessarily go along with what Second Madam Weng wanted. Shi Yulou had a prejudice against Second Madam Weng in his heart, perhaps he had such a prejudice against all women! He believed that the reason Second Madam Weng tormented Master Weng in the first place was because Master Weng was too compliant with her. Now, he was determined not to follow in Master Weng's footsteps. Therefore, he constantly used Master Weng's past to warn himself. Of course, he also had ways to please Second Madam Weng, unlike Master Weng, who could only make her disgusted. For example, Shi Yulou's art, Shi Yulou's youth, and Shi Yulou's appearance—it was precisely because of these things that Second Madam Weng was willing to endure the unhappiness that Shi Yulou gave her. Moreover, Second Madam Weng was simply reverting to her original nature, which was timidity.

When Second Madam Weng learned of Master Weng's death, she quietly shed a few tears of mourning. She thought that Master Weng's suicide was for her sake, and she was saddened! She repented! But then she thought that if she had not left, if she had stayed with Master Weng and lived such a gloomy life, it would not have been a good outcome either. So she forgave herself again. This issue caused her contradictory pain! And this pain was only buried in her heart, she could not express it, and there was no one to tell! During this period, she thought of Madam Mo. She remembered that ten years ago, when she was abandoned by Master Weng in Jingzhou, it was Madam Mo who saved her during that most painful period, and Madam Mo taught her to be strong. Later, when Master Weng surrendered to her, it was Madam Mo who told her how to take revenge on Master Weng. Now, it seemed that Shi Yulou was taking revenge on her for Master Weng, and she feared that Shi Yulou would also abandon her one day like Master Weng. Therefore, she was very lost! She needed Madam Mo to support her again, and at the same time, she still needed Madam Mo to accompany her loneliness in life. So, she wrote a letter inviting Madam Mo to come to Beijing.

### Tracking Down Missing Persons

### A Grieving Mother Longs for Her Son's Return

In Shanghai's Xujiahui, there lives an elderly widow, Madam Lu, originally from Zhuji, who raised her son with proper guidance, and is praised by all. Her only son, Lu Chaobin, also known as Ruiyun, received training in the Guiyang army before the August 13th Incident and later joined the air force. Initially, there were letters from home, but later Madam Lu was not at home. In the winter of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), an urgent letter was sent, but the neighbors did not receive it on her behalf, nor did they stamp the return slip, so the letter was returned. Since then, there has been no news. His father served as a coach for the Shanghai West Security Corps before the August 13th Incident and was killed by the enemy. Now, more than half a year has passed since the victory, and the aging Madam Lu leans on the door panel every day, longing for her son's return. Her situation is very tragic. We earnestly request that officers and colleagues who know about his life or death please send a letter to Madam Lu at No. 21 Zhaoxiang Lane, Tianyao Bridge, Xujiahui, Shanghai, or to Lu Cuie in Shanglu Town, Dongyang, Zhejiang.

### Searching for Xu Weixin

From Nanjing, 31 years old, worked for the Shanghai Huamei Evening News in the 26th year of the Republic (1937). Xu Weixian worked for the Shanghai Wing On Company. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), he left his job to join the Shanghai Student Model Brigade (Commander Wang Jingyun) and retreated westward for many years. There has been no news. Since the victory, he has not been seen. His elderly mother is helpless and sick with worry.

### Service Briefs

### Cheng Zhuanxiang Asks:

My younger sister, Zhou Wenying, is 18 years old. When she was young, her parents arranged a marriage with her aunt's son (a cousin). Now that they are both adults, the cousin is dull and unattractive. For the sake of her future, she does not want to marry him. However, under the old etiquette and feudal ideology, although she has protested several times in words, she cannot open the minds of her stubborn parents. To avoid a life of misery, the woman has decided to dissolve the engagement. What procedures should she follow to get rid of it? I would be grateful for your guidance.

### [Reply by Lawyer Cao Yaxia]

Our Civil Code stipulates that "marriage contracts should be made by the man and woman themselves," and "men under the age of seventeen and women under the age of fifteen may not enter into marriage contracts." Therefore, a marriage arranged by her parents when she was young is naturally invalid and does not give rise to the issue of dissolution. Miss Zhou is now eighteen years old, not yet an adult, and if she has not consented to the marriage contract, she is naturally not bound by it, nor is it necessary to express her intention to dissolve the marriage contract. Moreover, the performance of a marriage contract cannot be enforced. If she is determined not to marry the other party in the future, even if her parents are stubborn, they cannot force her to perform it.
