### The Ten Major Plans for Streamlining the Military and Building the Nation: Meticulous Discussions and Unanimous Passage; Military Rehabilitation Conference Concludes This Morning

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The third plenary session of the Military Rehabilitation Conference was held this morning at 9:00 AM, followed immediately by group review meetings. These were divided into five groups: post-reorganization logistical support, education and training; officer and soldier welfare; career change and production; resettlement of wounded soldiers; and pensions for the families of fallen soldiers. Discussions within each group were exceptionally lively, particularly regarding the reorganization, education, and training, and officer and soldier welfare/career change and production groups, where speakers were most enthusiastic. Officials from various ministries shared their valuable experience and provided opinions. The review meetings lasted until about 1:00 PM. The meeting reconvened at 3:00 PM, presided over by Chairman Chiang himself. At the start of the meeting, each group's reviewed and approved proposals were put to a vote. The most crucial among these was the National Army Reorganization Plan, examined and established by the Reorganization Group. It is understood that this plan is based on the annual military streamlining plan, reducing the existing army to ninety infantry divisions and ten cavalry brigades. When the convenor of the Reorganization Group presented the plan, all generals in attendance stood up in unison after Chairman Chiang sought the assembly's opinion. This demonstrated that the National Army's generals possessed a clear understanding of streamlining the military and building the nation, displaying sagacity and ardent patriotism. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. Over the past four days, the Military Rehabilitation Conference had thoroughly discussed the ten major plans for streamlining the military and building the nation: (1) Defining army structure, (2) Unifying national defense force structure, (3) Reorganizing officer ranks and restoring appointed ranks, (4) Troop education and training, (5) Improving officer and soldier quality to align with the elite force policy, (6) Improving officer and soldier welfare and promoting recreation, (7) Reassigning demobilized troops to land reclamation, (8) Providing generous resettlement for redundant officers and soldiers, (9) Providing pensions for the families of fallen soldiers, and (10) Resettling wounded and disabled soldiers. These plans were successfully completed by this afternoon after the generals in attendance painstakingly deliberated and repeatedly discussed them. The conference achieved fruitful results, fulfilling its historical mission of streamlining the military and building the nation. The conference is scheduled to close on the morning of the 19th, after which the Chairman will personally lead all the generals and soldiers in paying respects at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and holding a solemn public memorial service at the cemetery of fallen soldiers near Yegusi Temple.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Before the afternoon plenary session today, Chairman Chiang took a group photo with the attending generals to commemorate this historically significant rehabilitation conference. The Chairman also took individual photos with each senior general above the rank of lieutenant general. From the 15th to today, the atmosphere at the conference was filled with harmony and joy. The citizens of Nanjing were greatly encouraged upon hearing that the Military Rehabilitation Conference had been successfully completed. Furthermore, the spokesman for the Army General Headquarters announced tonight that Commander-in-Chief He would hold a press conference after the conference's closing to report on its progress.

### New Life Movement Anniversary: Chairman Admonishes Compatriots Nationwide to Intensify Efforts and Establish a Foundation for Self-Reliance

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] On the eve of the 12th anniversary of the New Life Movement, Chairman Chiang issued a telegram to the nation from Nanjing, the full text of which follows:

To the General Association for the Promotion of the New Life Movement, and relayed to provincial and municipal branch associations, all organizations and groups, and the general public: The New Life Movement, since its advocacy and implementation, has now been ongoing for twelve years. Its main purpose is to start with cleanliness and simplicity in food, clothing, housing, and transportation, to quickly and effectively reform individual lives, transform social customs, and thereby seek progress for the nation and the people. The aim is for all of us to have a healthy body and mind, so that we can establish a strong foundation, respond to the evolution of the times without falling behind, and appropriately deal with complex matters. This is what this center firmly believes. Now that the War of Resistance has achieved victory, the work of national construction should begin immediately. Our nation has entered a new and great era. Looking to the future, the prospects are bright, but the difficulties are formidable. We must all bring into play the spirit of perseverance and grand ambition in national construction to accomplish this great undertaking. The so-called spirit of national construction, in terms of psychology, requires a lofty belief, a firm will, and a fervent enthusiasm for building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. In terms of action, as I stated last Double Tenth Day, we must strive for daily renewal, seize time, be precise in everything, and be practical in every step to realize the three major demands of the New Life Movement. The cultivation of this spirit of national construction can only be achieved if every citizen constantly examines and improves themselves in the simple, everyday aspects of life, which are also the most fundamental. My fellow countrymen, especially, should strive to practice a new life that is solid and orderly, and become good citizens with ambition and spirit. Do not be opportunistic, do not choose the easy over the difficult, do not be disorganized and selfish, and do not abandon righteousness for profit. Ensure that small families and the large nation all have a thriving atmosphere, sweep away the accumulated habits of routine and decadence, and then the work of national construction can actively unfold along with the victory of the War of Resistance and the completion of rehabilitation, to comfort the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the revolution and the War of Resistance. Furthermore, the essential meaning of practicing the New Life Movement lies not only in seeking individual self-awareness and self-governance. My compatriots must also engage in broad and close cooperation with each other, encouraging and supporting each other to advance together. We should also address past shortcomings, paying particular attention to the widespread improvement of rural sanitation and the enhancement of national physique and productive capacity. Then, with inner and outer strengths filled, and foundations consolidated, the past unhealthy state of disorganization, poverty, and weakness can be fundamentally eradicated. My compatriots can then possess strong spiritual and material forces, as well as a united force of collective identity, to adapt to the great era and shoulder the mission of national construction. Only then can we ensure the independence and freedom of our nation and people, and make our Republic of China a modern nation respected by others. Looking back at the eight years of the War of Resistance, the sacrifices were heavy, and the fruits of victory were hard-won. At this juncture, we should intensify our efforts, understand the principle of self-help and mutual assistance, and establish a foundation for self-reliance. A nation on this earth must have a place to stand. The way to build a nation is none other than vigorous action and self-strengthening. All my compatriots should know that the New Life Movement is truly a movement for national rejuvenation. As long as national construction is not complete, this meaning will not diminish for a single day. We must uphold propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame; take responsibility, observe discipline, overcome decline and corruption, and persevere to the end. In particular, all organizations, groups, and social leaders must lead by example, extend their influence to others, and ensure that this movement continues to flourish and grow, so as not to disappoint my repeated admonitions. I hope you will all strive together. Chiang Kai-shek, February 18, 1946.

### Nine Foreign Reporters Arrive in Shenyang; Claim to Be Traveling as Civilians

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 17th] According to a Shenyang phone call, nine foreign reporters arrived in Shenyang at 3:30 AM this morning from Jinzhou by passenger train. They first stayed at the Northeast Hotel, and later, after the Soviets indicated that the Yamato Hotel was safer, they moved to that hotel to rest. One of the nine is a female reporter, representing the International News Service. The other eight represent the London Daily News, Chicago Sun, New York Post, Associated Press, United Press, etc. Their schedule in Shenyang is undecided, and it is currently unknown whether they will come to Changchun.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 18th] A Shenyang phone call reports that today is the second day of the foreign reporters' arrival in Shenyang. The eight men and one woman are relaxing in the Yamato Hotel, drinking the famous Shenyang-produced Taiyang (Sun) beer, feeling extremely bored. They tell people, "It's very boring."

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 17th] Nine British and American reporters arrived in Shenyang by train at 3:00 AM this morning from Jinzhou. Officials from both the Chinese and Soviet military authorities were dispatched to the station to welcome them, and they were hosted by the Soviets and stayed at the Yamato Hotel. They came from Tianjin and other places, claiming that they had not obtained the consent of the Chinese and Soviet authorities beforehand and that they were traveling in the Northeast as foreign civilians, not as news reporters. They will stay in Shenyang for several days and may go to Changchun. This is the first time that British and American reporters have come to the Northeast since the Japanese surrender, and possibly the first time since 1932. In 1932, British and American reporters accompanied the League of Nations investigation team to the Northeast.

### Wedemeyer Arrives in Nanjing from Chongqing; Lieutenant General Gilner Arrives in China to Assist Marshall

Wedemeyer is scheduled to attend the National Military Reorganization and Rehabilitation Conference tomorrow, deliver a speech, and will then return to Shanghai shortly.

[United Press, Chongqing, 18th] Former Commander of the U.S. Thirteenth Corps, Lieutenant General Gilner, has arrived in China to assist U.S. President's Special Envoy to China, Marshal Marshall. After arriving here from Shanghai on Friday, he visited Special Envoy Marshall with General Wedemeyer.

[United Press, Chongqing, 17th] Major General Renduel, leader of the Chongqing U.S. Liaison Group, is about to return to the United States. He issued a farewell message to the Chinese people today, stating that Chairman Chiang has a great personality, is selfless and impartial, and that China, under his leadership, has experienced the difficult period of the war, making the greatness of China known to the world. He hopes and believes that the Chinese people have entered the most rewarding year in history. China had to face reality and struggle resolutely during the war, and will certainly be able to overcome various obstacles in peacetime as in wartime. Major General Renduel is a graduate of the U.S. West Point Military Academy, has 21 years of rich experience in the Air Force, and previously served as Commander of the Western China Air Force, defending the B-29 bases.

### The Situation in the Northeast Remains Depressing; Foreign Minister Wang Returns to Chongqing Yesterday After Requesting Instructions in Nanjing

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 18th] Rumors of new Soviet demands regarding the Northeast issue have not been confirmed by any parties. However, Wang Shijie's hasty trip to Nanjing, claiming only that he was seeking instructions on important matters, is noteworthy. It is reported that Yang Chuo'an, the mayor of Harbin, has faced extreme difficulties since taking over Harbin. Other personnel taking over various locations face similar situations, and their personal safety relies on the Allied forces. There is no talk of security and administration. It is also understood that Pan Gongbi, a special commissioner stationed in the Northeast by the Central Propaganda Department, will return to Chongqing within days to report on his duties.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, who flew to Nanjing on the 16th for important official business, returned to Chongqing by plane at 2:00 PM this afternoon.

[United Press, Tianjin, 18th] According to Chinese who have returned from the Northeast: The situation in Harbin is relatively quiet, with a curfew enforced at 8:00 PM. After 7:00 PM, there are almost no pedestrians on the streets. However, the situation is very chaotic in the areas along the railway lines outside Harbin City.

[United Press, Beiping, 18th] Ten officials from the Liaobei Provincial Government went to southern Manchuria to take over ten counties within the province's jurisdiction, agreeing to be accompanied by an equal number of Soviet liaison officers. Upon contacting the Soviets, it was found that there were only five Soviet officers. The Chinese takeover personnel had to select five members to join. Subsequently, the Soviet side discovered that one of the five Chinese takeover personnel was from Beiping and one was a local of the Northeast, and accused them of not being takeover personnel directly dispatched from Chongqing, refusing to accompany them. The remaining three prepared to depart, but the Soviet side then said that one of them seemed ill and one seemed to "lack sufficient geographical knowledge," and refused to depart again. As a result, the Chinese side had only one person go to the takeover area, but when he arrived at the county seat, he could not enter. This person is currently staying at the train station, where he is performing takeover work, which, according to Chinese newspapers, "is not very convenient."

### After the Zhang Xinfu Tragedy, Public Opinion Calls for Public Attention

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 18th] Regarding the Northeast issue, public opinion has gradually become uneasy since the Zhang Xinfu tragedy. Today's editorial in Ta Kung Pao stated that the recent proposal by the Communist Party spokesman to resolve the Northeast issue was not a matter of internal affairs, and that the Central Army's entry into the Northeast has encountered various difficulties. With the assistance of foreign forces (Xinhua Daily's editorial admitted it was with the assistance of the Soviet army), the Communist Party's army has poured into various parts of the Northeast. The editorial argued that this was contrary to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. Other newspapers also commented on the Northeast issue, calling for public attention.

[United Press, Chongqing, 18th] Chongqing newspapers are greatly shocked by the resurgence of conflict in the Northeast, accusing the Soviet Union, stating that the Sino-Soviet Treaty is meaningless, and expressing regret over the Yalta Secret Agreement. At the same time, newspapers are severely criticizing the Soviet Union's activities in the Northeast.

[United Press, Manila, 18th] Chinese representatives here held a meeting today and passed the following resolution: requesting the immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Nine Eastern Provinces to protect China's territory and sovereignty.

[United Press, Nanjing, 18th] Amid official discussions here about the renewed conflict between the Nationalists and Communists in the Northeast and the Soviet Union's economic demands, it is reported that eight divisions of the National Army will be heading to the Northeast. In addition to the already dispatched 5th Army and New 6th Army, the New 1st Army, 8th Army, 74th Army, 94th Army, and two other armies have been prepared for departure.

### Xuzhou's Population Soars

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 18th] According to statistics from the Xuzhou City Police Department, Xuzhou's population has soared, nearly doubling compared to before the war. Last month's census counted 266,784 people. This is the number of ordinary households, not including the households of foreigners and temples in public places. Before the war, Xuzhou's population was less than 110,000.

### Early Spring Outside the Pass

— Rong Qin

It's been four days since the Beginning of Spring. In Guangzhou, in Kunming, those desolate and barren plains should be dotted with tender buds and green leaves. Many people in the Jiangnan region are yearning for and imagining the spring scenery. However, outside the Pass, ice blocks and snow blankets still show no signs of melting. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, snowflakes were fluttering here. People coming from the south constantly utter the word "cold". Seeing children wearing black cotton-padded clothes and leather hats playing in the snow and ice skating, they feel somewhat inferior. Old people say, "This year is much better; it was even colder last year." The climate this year might be the same as in previous years, but in their hearts, there is a different feeling.

Banditry is rampant, coal is scarce, and the burden of life is pressing hard. In the warm hearts of compatriots outside the Pass, there's always something hindering them. Terms like "X Road bandits" and "Big X-zi" never disappear from their lips. Bandits exist in many places, and they are very fierce. However, adding the word "bandits" to "X Road" casts a shadow over people's hearts. People are saying that the X Road Army was good when it first arrived, calling the common people "older brother," "older sister," or "comrade." However, due to a lack, or even absence, of equipment and food, they often seize things from the common people. Many tables and wood materials from homes or schools were taken to cook or keep warm. Living in people's homes increased their food difficulties. Before the National Army arrived, they even burned a lot of the common people's food to prevent the "enemy" from using it. In reality, the New Sixth Army and the Fifty-Second Army had sufficient food supplies. They emphasized propaganda, repeatedly broadcasting the "Zhu De Telegram" wherever they went. The common people knew that it was "Chairman Chiang" who was leading the war of resistance, and few people listened to their speeches. If there were schools in the area, they would also advocate forming "Student Unions" and "Teacher Unions" (Teacher Federations). "I dare say that none of the intellectuals here have joined their party, but some hooligans have," a middle school principal with thirty years of experience in education told the reporter.

I heard that in the areas north and south of Xinmin, the "X Road Army" is forcibly conscripting horses and soldiers, strengthening "popular forces" in eastern Liaoning.

The National Army troops that have crossed the Pass are mostly still in the suburbs of Shenyang or wandering into the city in small groups of twos and threes. However, they are not allowed to carry weapons and are not allowed to stay overnight, apparently because negotiations have not yet been finalized. News of joint celebrations between the Chinese and Soviet armies in Shenyang brings a happy glow to the faces of the National Army troops here.

The price of gold is not much higher than inside the Pass, and sometimes it's even lower, which makes people with a lot of gold feel unhappy.

Reconstruction of education should be a major theme of rebuilding the Northeast. The enemy puppets' fourteen years of rule implemented thorough enslavement education. The arrival of the devil party brought the greatest changes to education. Elementary schools were forcibly renamed National Schools, higher elementary schools were renamed National Advanced Schools, and universities were still called universities, perhaps because most of the educated were Japanese or Korean. Japanese people presided over and supervised all levels of schools. Japanese people serving as vice principals had no respect for the principals. The most alarming thing was the appearance of the curriculum content. The main courses in all levels of schools were "National Language" (Japanese and "Manchu," where "Manchu" meant Chinese), "National Founding Spirit," and "Arts and Skills" (labor services such as farming and plowing). Using Japanese and "Manchu" together as "National Language" reveals their intentions. Although the curriculum was like this, parents were still afraid that their children would not be able to enter school. Many people even used pleading or even bribery to achieve the goal of sending their children to school, because leaving children at home meant even greater responsibility to the "nation." Children who went to school had less time for studying and more time for labor. Graduates of National Advanced Schools (higher elementary schools) who could write their names clearly and write the simplest letter were considered to have excellent grades. Enslavement education even extended to eating and dressing. For example, in universities, Japanese students ate rice ("white rice"), while "Manchu" students ate sorghum. It was considered lucky to have millet to eat. The treatment of teachers at all levels of schools was also different. Taking National High Schools (middle schools) as an example, "Manchu" teachers earned 150 yuan per month, while Japanese teachers earned 200 yuan per month. The rations they received were also much better for the latter than for the former. "Manchu" teachers sometimes felt unbearably poor and dared not even try to make a new set of clothes easily, as the charge of "economic crime" was unbearable.

In reality, the effectiveness of enslavement education was not as great as the Japanese had hoped. Although Japanese teachers at all levels of schools kept a very close watch on thought, and Japanese military police often broke into school gates to interrogate or arrest "ideological suspects," there were still many cases of teachers and students being imprisoned and sacrificing their lives for the crime of "anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese." What the Northeastern compatriots enjoyed talking about most was a scene from 1940. In that year, after the "Wang Clique" government finished performing the farce of "returning the capital," they held a so-called "Japan-Manchu-China" ball game league in Changchun. When the "China" team scored a goal, the "Manchu" team representatives and spectators applauded warmly. When the "Manchu" team scored a goal, they also received the same warm applause. However, when the Japanese team scored a goal, the whole stadium was silent. Some Japanese expatriate spectators who hesitantly wanted to applaud were also embarrassed to do so, which made the Japanese authorities very unhappy.

However, to be fair, education in the Northeast must be rebuilt, and it is very urgent. For fourteen years, the younger generation here has been silently receiving "education"! Children have no opportunity to use their brains, and they must once again enjoy the happiness of thinking freely. The "party-ization education" that has withdrawn from the school walls should not be transplanted here. In reality, the young people here do not like to listen to the "party," but they love their motherland – the mother they have been away from for so long!

As the reporter was drafting this article, the middle school principals and teachers of the entire Liaoning Province had already gone to Jinzhou to concentrate and receive two weeks of training. Elementary school teachers will also receive training starting on the twelfth of the month. Their brains should be filled with more awareness of the "motherland" and a new worldview. Teachers are very scarce here, and in this transitional stage where there is a shortage of new blood, the authorities mostly still use old people. Old people are not necessarily bad, but qualified teachers are indeed very much needed here! (Xinmin, February 8th)

### Zhou Enlai on the Northeast Conflict: Advocates Military Mediation

Claims the Communist Party Does Not Oppose the Central Army Entering the Northeast

[United Press Chongqing, 18th] Zhou Enlai today expressed his opinion on the Soviet army's delay in withdrawing from the Northeast and denied that the Chinese Communist Party was "Moscow's pawns." Zhou stated, "The sooner the Soviet troops withdraw from the Northeast, the better." The CCP does not openly demand the Soviet withdrawal of troops to avoid suspicion among the Chinese people that the CCP has the ambition to take over and rule the Northeast. The CCP does not oppose the Central Army entering the Northeast to restore sovereignty. However, there are already 300,000 Communist troops and Communist Party-controlled troops outside the Pass, mostly stationed in Liaoning and Jilin provinces. If attacked, "accidents are bound to happen." Zhou also said that the Communist Party supports the proposal of Special Envoy Marshall to send a military mediation group to the areas where recent conflicts have occurred in the Northeast, but the Central government has not yet responded.

[Reuters Chongqing, 18th] A CCP spokesperson here today claimed that there are intermittent conflicts between the Central government army and the CCP army in the nine eastern provinces, but the ceasefire agreement between the government and the CCP armies throughout China is being maintained. Several newspapers here today stated that the situation in the Northeast is "critical," and the Ta Kung Pao called for an end to "secret diplomacy" and the news blockade on the Northeast situation.

[United Press Chongqing, 18th] Since news of the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists continues to spread, people here are increasingly worried about the situation in the Northeast. In the past ten days, the National Army has expanded outward from the railway areas in the southwestern part of the nine northeastern provinces, while the US Navy continues to transport troops from various parts of China to the Northeast. According to a Communist Party report, the National Army under Du Yuming's command continues to advance towards the "People's Army," and the war has spread from western Liaoning to eastern Rehe. After occupying Panshan and Taian, the New Sixth Army also occupied Liaozhong. According to Professor Zhou Jingwen, a well-known Northeastern educator here, there are currently about one million troops in the economically bankrupt Northeast, including Soviet troops, Mongolian troops, Soviet international communist troops, CCP troops, National troops, former puppet Manchukuo mercenaries, and former anti-Japanese volunteer armies. No one knows the exact number of Soviet troops, but it is estimated to be around 100,000. The Soviet international communist troops include people from the Soviet Union, China, Japan, Mongolia, and Korea, totaling 150,000. The National Army includes three armies, with a maximum of 120,000 troops. There are 30,000 Mongolian cavalry supporting the autonomous government of eastern Mongolia. CCP troops occupy southern Manchuria, and Soviet international communist troops occupy northern Manchuria, with the line passing through Changchun as the boundary. Mongolians live near Wangye Temple in western Northeast China, while puppet Manchukuo mercenaries and anti-Japanese volunteer armies are scattered throughout the Northeast.

[United Press Yan'an, 18th] A CCP spokesperson announced today that if Zhang Fakui's troops do not abandon their attacks on the CCP army's Dongjiang Brigade, the CCP's Eighth Route Army will have to reconsider the issue of cooperation with the Chinese and North China puppet armies.

### Leike Flies to Yanzhou for Mediation, Communist Army in Dingyuan Refuses to Withdraw

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 17th] Leike flew to Yanzhou early on the 17th for mediation. In addition, a train carrying grain from the provincial government is supplying the civilians in Tai'an City.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 18th] According to reports from Bengbu, Dingyuan, which is 50 li from Bengbu, is currently occupied by Luo Binghui's troops, nicknamed "Big Belly," with a force of about five regiments. The Military Mediation Department's Xuzhou Group had previously ordered Luo's troops to withdraw from the area, and an agreement had been reached. Recently, it was heard that the troops were using the excuse that the people had asked them to stay, delaying their withdrawal. The Military Mediation Department will send personnel to investigate based on the report.

### Mediation Department Orders Assistance in Sending Japanese Back to North China

[US News Service Beijing, 18th] The Mediation Executive Department announced today its responsibility for sending Japanese people in North China back to their country and ordered military commanders of the National Government and the Communist Party stationed in North China, and personnel of the Executive Group to assist in the implementation of this work.

According to the department's Public Bulletin No. 13, the large number of Japanese people currently remaining in North China is causing difficulties and concerns. Therefore, the Executive Department is directly concerned with how to move the Japanese people from their respective locations to the embarkation points for the ships in an orderly manner.

The bulletin revealed: "There are currently 120,000 Japanese soldiers and 189,000 civilians in North China. They will all go to Tanggu and Qingdao to wait for ships to return to their country. As for the evacuation of Japanese people in the more southern areas, it will be regulated by the new agreement and will not require the assistance of the Mediation Executive Department's actions."

### Permanent Representative to the UN Security Council, China Appoints Representative, Executive Yuan Resolves to Appoint Guo Taiqi

Secretary-General of the United Nations Appoints Staff

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 18th] According to the United Nations Charter, China is one of the permanent members of the Security Council, and the Council is a body that meets frequently, so China must have a representative dedicated to this matter. It is officially announced that the Executive Yuan has resolved to appoint Guo Taiqi as China's permanent representative to the United Nations Security Council.

[United Press London, 17th] The United Nations' chief representative from the United States, Stettinius, said today upon boarding a plane back to the United States that the permanent headquarters of the United Nations are located in the United States, and "its future is brighter than we dare to hope." Stettinius paid his respects to the UK's efforts to successfully conclude the first General Assembly of the United Nations. He stated that all members of the US delegation, upon leaving the UK to return to their country, expressed their most sincere admiration for the British government and people. "San Francisco in the New World is the birthplace of the United Nations Charter, and London in the Old World is the birthplace of the United Nations' global peacekeeping mechanism, shining together and complementing each other."

[United Press London, 17th] The first batch of Secretariat staff appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Lie was announced today. Former Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Sobolev, was appointed Assistant Secretary-General, presiding over Security Council affairs. Former Director of the Netherlands Intelligence Office in London, Belt, was appointed Assistant Secretary-General, presiding over conference and general affairs. Owen, former private assistant to British Sir Cripps, was appointed Administrative Assistant to the Secretary-General's office, with the rank of Director. Feller, former Special Assistant to the US Attorney General, was appointed General Counsel of the Secretariat, also with the rank of Director.

[United Press New York, 17th] The British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast today that United Nations Secretary-General Lie needs to recruit about 2,500 male and female staff members from various countries for the Secretariat. They must each have expertise in many different areas, be prepared to suppress their own national interests for the benefit of the new international organization, and be willing to move their families to the permanent headquarters of the United Nations and serve there for life. In other words, they will become international civil servants.

### Atomic Secret Leak Case, Search Extends to the UK, Canadian Official Arrested in London, US Senator Advocates Immediate Investigation

[United Press Ottawa, 18th] The Canadian government's investigation into the leakage of atomic secrets and secret intelligence has extended to London. It was learned here today that a Canadian official has been arrested there. This development may also involve the United States. It is reported that several FBI agents arrived here from Washington over the weekend. The FBI always has a representative stationed in the Canadian police force. According to a Canadian official, the arrested persons will be secretly interrogated within the month. The country that received the original secret and other scientific and military secrets will be the Soviet Union, and this can be revealed from the confessions. Among these arrested persons are people from several countries, and the Canadian government will consider them as undesirable elements and request their governments to recall them.

[French News Agency London, 18th] According to reports from Ottawa, regarding the arrest of several Canadian military officers suspected of leaking atomic bomb secrets, the government will issue a statement in three days. The investigation committee for the case held a secret meeting today.

[Reuters New York, 18th] Washington electric: Since Canada began arresting spies who leaked secret intelligence last weekend, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee has been asked to investigate the situation within the United States. Republican Senator Bridges stated in an interview published in the New York Herald Tribune: "This is an event with terrible power. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee should immediately conduct an investigation to find out whether anyone in the State Department is preventing the FBI or the Department of Justice from thoroughly investigating this matter." The Herald Tribune also reprinted a conversation with former US Ambassador to China, Hurley, who happily said: "The Canadian incident is related to the information I provided to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last December." Peterson also wrote an article for the New York Sunday Mirror, stating: "Canadian Prime Minister King's surprising announcement has put the State Department in an extremely awkward position. I wonder if our State Department also intends to conduct a thorough investigation? Before ordering the arrest of suspects, Prime Minister King consulted with our State Department, hoping that the two governments would proceed simultaneously, but State Department Director Bellner refused. Bellner knew that the Soviet Union had a spy network in the Americas when he attended the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in London last September. He was very angry at the time, which caused a quarrel with Molotov."

[Reuters Washington, 18th] Army experts here expressed serious concern about the "repeated leakage" of atomic bomb secrets, which were supposed to be strictly guarded. The leakage of secrets is endangering the United States' position of greatest advantage, and there is no sufficient legal protection for the extremely important information that has now been generally obtained. General Groves, director of the US atomic bomb program, said: "The United States has lost more security regarding this bomb in the past four weeks than it lost during the entire invention period during the war."

### Transporting Supplies to the Soviet Union, Canada Orders Production to Stop

[United Press Ottawa, 18th] The Canadian government has stopped producing supplies destined for the Soviet Union. This news comes from a reliable source, who said that the order to stop production was issued by Construction Minister Howe and took effect several days ago. However, the source immediately pointed out that the order to stop production has nothing to do with the leakage of atomic secrets and is "purely coincidental." The reliable source said: "The only reason for canceling this production is that Canada and the Soviet Union failed to reach an agreement on loan conditions." However, some still believe that espionage activities by foreign government agents are a factor in Canada's actions.

### Two New Inventions Related to Radar

Disclosed by the US Department of the Army

[US News Service Washington, 17th] The Department of the Army has lifted the wartime ban on two new inventions of the Signal Corps related to radar. These inventions can detect enemy mortars and artillery positions at long distances and can also detect the movement of convoys and vehicles at night on roads occupied by the enemy. Lieutenant General Douglas, commander of the Army Signal Corps, explained that the radar reconnaissance device can search for enemy artillery positions more than five miles away with astonishing accuracy. The Signal Corps used a special radar to measure the upward and downward direction of enemy shells and then used the principle of geometric triangulation to calculate the entire trajectory of the shell and the accurate location of the artillery position. According to the above method, radar can find hidden artillery positions more than five miles away, with a maximum error of 60 yards. The radar used to observe enemy night movements can detect all moving targets, even in areas where radar beams are scattered. Vehicles as far as sixteen miles away cannot escape its sight. However, the normal effective range is ten miles, and the movement of troops three miles away can also be detected. Radar technicians, with their skilled techniques, can even calculate the number of enemy soldiers in a team and the type and speed of enemy vehicles.

### Arnold Said in the US House of Representatives that the US Must Invest in Atomic Bombs to Maintain World Peace, the Power of the Air Force is Sufficient to Extend to Any Corner, and US Military Bases in the Pacific Should Also Be Maintained

[United Press Washington, 17th] Arnold, former commander of the US Army Air Forces, said today in the House Library Committee that the United States must invest in atomic bombs to maintain world peace. The United States must maintain a large and powerful air force, its power is sufficient to extend to any corner of the world. Pray that a third world war will not happen. The Army, Navy, and Air Force must be combined into one. US military bases in the Pacific should also be maintained. As far as we know, only aircraft can carry atomic bombs to their destination for bombing. The only defensive method is to destroy them before they reach their destination. Regarding Marshal Stalin's announcement of Soviet aircraft production figures, I believe that the number of the US Air Force should be determined according to needs and should not be based on other countries' production figures as a standard.

### British Authorities Resolve to Take Strong Action to Maintain Order in Singapore

Investigation Results of Recent Conflicts Determine Police Gunfire Was Entirely Legal

[Reuters, Singapore, 18th] On February 15th, the anniversary of the fall of Singapore, communist elements requested permission to hold a demonstration and march on that day, "so that we may firmly remember the darkness of the Japanese occupation era as a warning, and build a better Malaya." After the authorities refused, a conflict between police and marchers occurred that day. Yesterday, the authorities issued an official statement regarding this matter, warning that any actions that disrupt the peace, whether organized or not, will not be tolerated. The statement said that on the night of February 14th, police arrested several people in an effort to prevent possible attempts to violate the ban, but about 200 people still attempted to march, carrying wooden sticks and iron rulers, and attacked the police who were interfering and preventing them. After a thorough investigation ordered by the Southeast Asia Headquarters, the investigation report released yesterday stated that the police action was "entirely legal." The official statement concluded, "The British military government will continue to arrest those responsible for disrupting the peace or inciting them." The authorities' close enforcement of this policy is evidenced by the fact that fifteen overseas Chinese were each sentenced to one month's imprisonment and fined twenty-five Straits dollars on Saturday. Another nineteen overseas Chinese are charged with rioting, participating in illegal activities, endangering life, and assaulting public servants, and have been released on bail pending trial.

Communist Leader Accused of Eight Counts

"Reuters, Singapore, 18th" Lim Ah Liang (transliteration), the leader of the Singapore branch of the Malayan Communist Party, was charged with three cases and eight counts of illegal acts and appeared in the High Court here today. Mr. Lim appeared in court with a bandage on his head. After questioning in court, it was announced that the trial would resume on Saturday. Mr. Lim was remanded in custody. The eight counts include disturbing public order, participating in illegal assemblies, resisting arrest, and escaping after being arrested.

Glimpse of Chinese Newspaper Sentiment

[Associated Press, Singapore, 17th] Since the conflict, various Chinese newspapers have commented that the United States does not forget the Pearl Harbor incident, so why does the United Kingdom argue that the fall of Singapore should not be commemorated? The conservative Sin Chew Jit Poh also believes that commemoration is proper, saying that this day was the day of suffering for the people in the Japanese-occupied areas and should be commemorated to show the determination of all countries in the world to never allow fascism to reappear, and denouncing the United Kingdom for using intimidation to deal with unarmed civilians.

### Scientists' Protest: Atomic Secrets Remain Unshared, Global Situation Increasingly Tense

[Reuters, London, 18th] Professor Hill, who served on the British Cabinet's Scientific Advisory Committee during the war, issued a declaration to scientists yesterday, instructing them or their representatives to refuse to cooperate if they are not allowed to share in determining the purpose, policies, or possible results of their research. Professor Bernal, vice president of the Association of Scientific Workers, also said: Scientists cannot tolerate the current state of the world. We cannot deny that the delay in sharing atomic secrets is a major cause of the increasing tension in the world situation. In terms of international scientific cooperation, the current situation is even worse than a year ago.

### Belgian Election Results: Catholic Party Wins, Cabinet Resigns

[Associated Press, London, 18th] According to Brussels Radio: In the Belgian general election yesterday, the Catholic Party won nearly half the seats in the House of Representatives. Socialist Prime Minister Van Acker submitted his cabinet's resignation to the Regent today. The Regent ordered him to remain temporarily in office.

[Associated Press, Belgian Capital, 18th] Belgian Prime Minister Van Acker and Foreign Minister Spaak have been re-elected as members of the lower house today. The Catholic Party still holds a great advantage. What remains to be determined is whether the Socialist and Communist parties can obtain sufficient seats in the lower house to cooperate and counter it. The Liberal Party is weak. Election reports from seven of the nation's nine provinces show that the Catholics have already taken seventy-six of the two hundred and two seats in the parliament, the Socialists forty-six, the Communists twelve, and the Liberals only nine.

### Thirty-Two Cardinals Ordained Yesterday

[Associated Press, Vatican City, 18th] The College of Bishops held a secret meeting at 9:35 this morning, attended by thirty-seven bishops and cardinals. Pope Pius XII announced the elevation of thirty-two bishops to the rank of cardinal. Cardinal Tien Ken-hsin of China was also among them. The bishops read out a pre-drafted edict. Papal envoys waited to deliver the appointment documents to the cardinals residing at ten locations in the Vatican, so that they may receive their honors. The Roman Catholic Church's appointment of new cardinals is the largest this time. The total number of bishops has now reached sixty-nine.

[Associated Press, Vatican City, 18th] Pope Pius XII told the College of Bishops today: "I have long cherished the idea of appointing new cardinals, but I was hindered by the war and could not realize it. Now that the war has finally ended, we can implement our planned project. The universality of the Church has now been increased with new glory, because the Church does not belong to any one race, one people, or one nation, but to the masses of the human family."

### Sudden Shift in Soviet Diplomacy: Supports Italy's Counter-Demands, Attempts to Expand Influence in the Mediterranean, Commander of Polish Forces in Italy Refutes Soviet Fabrications

[United Press, London, 17th] London's Sunday Express reports, citing a Moscow correspondent: The Soviet Union has stopped supporting Yugoslavia's demands for Trieste and will instead support Italy's counter-demands. The chief Soviet representative to the United Nations, Vyshinsky, met privately with Italian diplomatic representative Count Carandini in London on Thursday. Reportedly, Vyshinsky said, "The Soviet government will never forget that Italy was the first country to express friendship towards the Soviet Union." The newspaper speculates that the Soviet Union's motive for supporting Italy is twofold: one is to separate Italy from its tendency towards the West, and the other is to expand the Soviet Union's potential influence in the Mediterranean beyond Yugoslavia's current borders.

[Reuters, Rome, 18th] Since the resumption of negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia, the dispute over the port of Trieste and the Julian March region seems to have caused a change in attitudes at home and abroad. Yugoslav communist propaganda for the incorporation of Trieste into the Yugoslav Federation has recently eased, while the Italian Communist Party is gradually joining other Italian political parties in strongly arguing that Trieste belongs to Italy by nature.

[Associated Press, Rome, 17th] General Anders, commander of Polish forces abroad, announced today that Polish forces are stationed along a 1,500-kilometer stretch of the Adriatic coast from Taranto to Udine. The Soviet Union, representing Yugoslavia, sent a letter to the United Nations Security Council, attacking these Polish forces, saying that they are sufficient to threaten future peace. General Morgan, the Supreme Commander of the United Nations, and General Anders both declined to comment. The Polish military information office in Rome declared that there are no Polish forces stationed in the Julian March of Venice, which is occupied by the Allied forces of Britain, America, and Yugoslavia until the signing of the peace treaty. It also denied that Poland is recruiting new troops, using "resistance to Yugoslav communism" as a slogan.

### British Labour Cabinet to Undergo Partial Reshuffle

[Reuters, London, 18th] It is expected that Prime Minister Attlee will make changes to some of his cabinet members early, focusing on lower-level personnel. Even if one or two members of the Labour cabinet are changed, the rest may remain in their posts. The most difficult issues for the government are housing and fuel, but the general labor force believes that the Labour Party has made some achievements since taking office six months ago. The government's credibility in foreign affairs is quite good, and the opposition party is also willing to back it in writing.

### Six Munitions Factories in Fukuoka District, Japan: Equipment to Be Shipped to China and Korea, for Rebuilding Factories to Produce Daily Necessities

[Associated Press, Fukuoka, 18th] The American military government announced today that all machinery and equipment from six munitions factories in the Fukuoka district will be shipped to China and Korea to rebuild destroyed factories and manufacture daily necessities. This measure is in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration.

### Japanese People Scramble to Exchange Cash for Goods

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th Dispatch] The Japanese government's emergency financial and food control orders have led to a surge in buying in markets and shopping districts over the weekend. Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered in Tokyo's commercial districts, each wanting to exchange their money for food and goods. Although rice prices remained stable over the weekend, the prices of daily necessities have soared. Small denomination banknotes of ten yen or less are not affected by the issuance of new banknotes, so people are vying to obtain them. A reporter saw a Japanese person holding a ten-yen note and buying an unnecessary one-cent train ticket from the railway ticket office. Customers entering stores invariably ask first if there are small denomination banknotes to be found, so that stores throughout Tokyo have posted notices asking customers not to hope to find small denominations. According to observers, this kind of turmoil is temporary. Prices are bound to rise before March 7, but prices will gradually fall after March 7, because old banknotes will be discarded at that time, and bank withdrawals will also be restricted.

### Japan's Status Disappears: US Trade Will Change

[US Information Service, Washington, 17th] The Department of Commerce announced today that the disappearance of Japan's position as a major exporting country will inevitably stimulate the industrialization of other countries in the Far East, which will have a significant impact on the foreign trade of the United States. Before the war, more than 55% of all US exports to the Far East were purchased by Japan, while Japan accounted for one-sixth of the Far East's exports to the US. This is particularly important from the perspective of the changing post-war international trade situation, as Japan was originally the main supplier of inexpensive goods needed by the Asian market.

### Cement House Built in One Day and One Night

American Invention of New Machine

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] According to Estes, a Texas newspaper publisher, who announced here today, a huge machine can completely build an inexpensive cement house in 24 hours, like a hen laying an egg, and has now been successfully developed. This machine is equipped with rubber tires up to twelve feet high and can be freely moved to the construction site. The shape of the house is pre-made with steel forms. All that is needed is to pour cement into the steel forms and remove the steel forms after 24 hours, and the whole house is completed. Equipped with glass windows and decorated, it can be inhabited. The house "hatched" in this way has two bedrooms and a living room eighteen feet long and eleven and a half feet wide.

### Egypt Plans to Negotiate with Britain to Fulfill Independence Aspirations

Eradicate Three Harms in Domestic Administration

[Associated Press, Cairo, 17th] Egyptian Prime Minister Sidqi told reporters today that, judging from the list of new cabinet members he has selected, he seems to sympathize with the students' demonstration in Cairo demanding "British troops withdraw, or we will rebel." He also knows that the spirit of the Sudanese is the spirit of the Egyptians, and our policy is to merge Sudan with Egypt. Sidqi also replied to King Farouk that he will soon submit a list of delegates to negotiate with Britain to fulfill the desire for independence. We must also find ways to ensure domestic peace and raise the living standards of the poor. Illiteracy, poverty, and disease are the three harms of Egypt, and we must declare war on them.

### International Tidbits

French Commissioner to Vietnam, Admiral D'Argenlieu, has flown to France to report to the government on the situation in Vietnam.

Mrs. Roosevelt arrived in Dublin from London by plane on the 17th to visit Irish President de Valera and is scheduled to depart for the United States on the 18th.

The number of illegitimate children in Japan has increased sevenfold compared to the pre-war average. Among the fathers are even senior officials and teachers.

### February 24th Designated as Japan's Abolition of Prostitution Memorial Day

[Reuters, Tokyo, 18th] Japan will henceforth commemorate the termination of legal prostitution on February 24, as MacArthur stipulated that the law allowing women to be prostitutes in Japan be abolished on that day.

### Iranian Prime Minister Flies to Moscow: Soviet-Iranian Negotiations to Begin Immediately

Soviet Side Will Refuse to Discuss Azerbaijan Issue

[Reuters, Tehran, 18th] A Soviet giant transport plane will carry Iranian Prime Minister Sadr and his selected representatives from Tehran directly to Moscow today for negotiations to improve relations between the two countries. However, whether the Azerbaijan issue is within the scope of the negotiations is still doubtful. Many people believe that the Russian side will refuse to discuss this matter. When Prime Minister Sadr addressed the parliament yesterday, promising to open a new page in relations with the Soviet Union, the whole place cheered. When Sadr left the parliament, the crowd raised him high on their shoulders. These phenomena can all indicate the people's support for the new government.

[Associated Press, Tehran, 17th] The Iranian government today appointed former Gendarmerie Commander General Yaqubali as Chief of Staff of the Iranian Army.

### Yalta Agreement Sacrifices Our Basic Rights

US Newspapers Unanimously Criticize Harshly: All Believe Soviet Union's Greed Is Insatiable

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 17th] American newspapers today commented on the Yalta Agreement's cession of the Kuril Islands and the southern part of Sakhalin Island to the Soviet Union, and all agreed with what the New York Times called: "The unfortunate result of wartime power politics is inevitable." Some newspapers criticized Churchill and Roosevelt harshly for not consulting with China and directly allowing the Soviet Union to have various rights in the three northeastern provinces.

The New York Times said: "The most unfortunate aspect of this agreement is that the United States and Britain agreed to sacrifice the basic rights of another ally, China, and then the US President sought China's consent to the fait accompli. Even if the Red Army did not participate in the war before the United Nations attacked the Japanese mainland, Japan had already shown signs of seeking peace. However, at the time the Yalta Agreement was signed, Japan's military weakness and its willingness to seek peace without being annihilated were not yet so obvious."

The Portland Oregonian emphasized the strategic importance of the Kuril Islands, so when people heard that Roosevelt and Churchill had ceded the islands to the Soviet Union, they were generally "shocked." American interests in the Pacific and the broad trusteeship system advocated by the United States have been affected by this. The countries that participated in the Second World War must meet frankly. This is also paramount in the Soviet Union. The Kuril Islands should be re-examined by the United Nations.

The San Francisco Chronicle said: "From the lines of the Yalta Agreement, it is clear that Roosevelt and Churchill obtained Soviet assistance at a considerable price, which is the Kuril Islands and other important concessions, especially those involving China. This agreement was negotiated and signed by the three giants without revealing it to China's President Chiang, and China is the only country to suffer losses as a result of this agreement. From this, it can be seen that the three giants never had the idea of the Four Powers in their minds. The so-called Four Powers are just slogans to divert public attention."

The Oregonian also said: "Some of the islands in the Kuril Islands originally belonged to Japanese territory and have a long history. They cannot be attributed to land acquired by violence and greed." As announced by the Cairo Conference of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang in 1943 and should be taken from Japan, it can be known that the Yalta Agreement has political relations and military relations.

The Washington Times commented, entitled "The Soviet Union Has Obtained the Price and Is Still Not Satisfied." It said: "Every promise to the Soviet Union in the secret agreement has now been fulfilled, but in the United Nations conference in London, it can be seen that the Soviet Union is still not satisfied with what it has obtained and resolutely opposes the wishes of any government that does not obey Moscow."

### Local Correspondence

Kunshan: Eight Robbers of Ferryboat Arrested The Su Chen Ferryboat left Suzhou on the afternoon of the 14th. When it sailed near Jinshan Port (Wuxian Boundary), it was suddenly robbed by fifteen or sixteen robbers (four of the robbers were women, four wore military uniforms, and were fully armed with a machine gun). At the time, they also kidnapped Patrol Officer Zhao Zong of the Chenmu Police Station in Kunshan and three policemen. It is now learned that after receiving the report, the military and police authorities immediately dispatched a team to pursue and suppress them and achieved great results. Patrol Officer Zhao and others who were kidnapped have also escaped danger and returned to Kunshan. At the same time, it is also learned that this group of robbers was captured on the 15th in Tongli Town, fifteen miles east of Wujiang, by eight members of the 434th Regiment of the 21st Army of the National Army and will be escorted to Kunshan for interrogation.

Suzhou: Investigation of Schools Damaged During the War The Suzhou-Ningbo Branch of the National Relief Commission, in order to investigate the most seriously damaged school buildings of elementary schools in this county during the War of Resistance, has already sent a letter to the Wuxian Relief Association requesting it to forward the letter to the Wuxian Education Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation of the losses of each elementary school building during the War of Resistance and a detailed report to the Relief Association for submission and handling.

Changshu: National Army Regiment Arrives to Take Over Defense Commander Yan of the 433rd Regiment of the 145th Division of the 21st Army of the National Army arrived in Yu on the 14th. One of his battalions has moved from Tai to this county and has been ordered to take over the defense of the Luo Battalion of the Pingding Force of the Loyalty and Rescue Army. The handover of the city defense portion was completed on the morning of the 15th.

Wuxi: Exchanging Counterfeit Money Is Extremely Difficult In Wuxi, the exchange of counterfeit money was initially handled by the post office, but recently it has been handled by the Farmers Bank and the County Bank. However, due to the small amount of funds and manpower, the exchange is limited. Since the lunar new year, small amounts of counterfeit money in the countryside have stopped being used and have flowed into the cities. Recently, because the counterfeit money of 5.1 million yuan in Changshu and other counties has stopped being used, it has been transported to Wuxi. There is a sudden increase in the amount of counterfeit money on the market and the legal tender seems to be smaller. Merchants require legal tender when buying in, but mostly sell counterfeit money. This has caused a difference in prices, and larger goods have also had problems being bought in. The city is in extreme chaos. I hope the authorities will pay attention to it.

Jiaxing: Japanese Prisoner Kicks Child to Death While Shopping The Japanese prisoner is a sergeant squad leader of the 5th Battalion of the 91st Brigade of the Japanese Army. At about 12 o'clock on the evening of the 14th, in the Luosihama area of Chunbo Bridge in Dongcheng, he had a dispute with a Ming child over the sale of cigarettes. The Japanese prisoner kicked the lower abdomen of the child and then pushed him into the river. The child struggled and crawled home that night. He died of his injuries at noon on the 15th. His family has an octogenarian mother and is extremely poor. After the Japanese Prisoner Management Office learned about this, Director Ye sent Deputy Officers Ding and Hou with 10,000 yuan to the Ming child's house to express their condolences and investigate the truth. He also identified the Japanese prisoner who committed the crime and detained him and has telegraphed his superiors for instructions.

Qingdao: Communist Army Attacks National Army Convoy The Tarte Station on the Jiaoji Railway is garrisoned by a part of the XX National Army of the Eighth Army. On the morning of the 11th, the Communist Army suddenly violated the ceasefire order and attacked the National Army grain convoy with 2,000 troops. A fierce war then broke out. The National Army was caught off guard, resulting in more than 100 officers and soldiers killed and wounded. On the 12th, more than 50 wounded National Army soldiers were sent from Tarte Station to Qingdao for treatment. The situation of the battle and the number of casualties and items are still under investigation.

### New Invention by American Scientists: Mathematical Robot

Can Calculate Complex Problems in a Few Hours: Will Revolutionize Atomic Energy Research

[US Information Service, Philadelphia, 17th] The Department of the Army held an unveiling ceremony for a giant "mathematical robot" at the University of Pennsylvania on the 15th of this month. The machine is an electrical integrator and calculator, costing $400,000, weighing thirty tons, containing 18,000 vacuum tubes and miles of intertwined wires. The machine was made at the request of the Ordnance Department of the Army and is used to calculate complex ballistic firing tables and bomb-dropping calculation tables. It is said to have great potential for peaceful uses. The inventors of the machine are Drs. Mauchly and Eckert of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, and Dr. Goldstein of the Ordnance Department of the Army. The Department of the Army declared that "this machine is the most complex and intricate electrical invention in the world." The machine can solve problems in a few hours that would take a mathematician hundreds of years to solve. The Department of the Army emphasized that the machine is a good assistant to mathematics, which can save scientists' energy, without having to engage in lengthy calculations, and revolutionize engineering mathematics, industrial design methods, and atomic energy research.

### Most Complex and Intricate Melting Pot of All Races: Hawaii Forges New Lineage, Pilgrimage to the Free Paradise of the Central Pacific

…Special Translated Manuscript by This Newspaper's Editorial Office

The United States has always been the world's number one racial melting pot, but today, its territory, the island of Hawaii, has surpassed it, defeating it. When Hawaii was first discovered, the island had a population of 300,000, all of whom were the original inhabitants of the island. Since then, people from all corners of the earth have gone there, merchants, workers, adventurers, all kinds, creating this paradise in the central Pacific! The most numerous of the islanders are now Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish. In fact, the residents of Hawaii can almost represent the human race of the entire world.

### White People Called "Hola" Chinese People Called "Boga"

Recently, when American sailors were leaving Honolulu, a clamor of cursing arose among them. They used harsh and rebellious tones to describe the islanders of Hawaii, saying, "Good heavens! These foolish, barefooted, Hawaiians!" These curses only revealed the minor failures of Honolulu in the minds of a small segment of people. In reality, it has almost become the most successful experiment in the world for mixed-race blends and the dream realm of sociologists for mixed-race culture and education. In Hawaii, there are so many races—purebreds, mixed-bloods, all kinds are present. There is no difference in preference or discrimination. Every race is a minority. Of Hawaii's 430,000 population, there are Americans, Britons, Norwegians, Germans, Spaniards, Puerto Ricans, Portuguese, blacks, Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Filipinos, Micronesians, and Polynesians. Furthermore, there are mixed crystallizations of the above-mentioned races. There, people judge a person by talent and virtue, not by skin color, just like the method of judgment used by the native Hawaiians. White people there are not called white people but are called "Hola" (transliteration), meaning foreigners. Chinese people are called "Boga," meaning "Uncle." Native Hawaiians originally could not pronounce "R," but now they have learned it because English has become the most common language.

### Spiritual Tendency Towards Americanization Mixed Race Component Not Concealed

This melting pot, with its tolerance of interracial mixing and racial brotherhood, is truly unparalleled in the world today! But it is not without its exceptions. Higher-class white people are not very tolerant of interracial mixing. They retain to some extent the demarcation line of skin color. This is considered an undesirable attitude. However, these people can be said to be exceptions on the island of Hawaii. In fact, a new race is growing.

The new mixed-race Hawaiians are tolerant, patient, healthy, and Americanized. No one there conceals their mixed-race component. In fact, if one wants to apply for a marriage certificate, one must state the racial lineage of the four grandparents. The U.S. official census bureau only registers two races: Caucasian Hawaiian and Asian Hawaiian. Other than that, no matter how complex the ancestral lineage is, applicants are uniformly registered according to their father's race or the racial group to which they belong. Although words like "white" and "colored" are never used, lighter skin colors are ultimately more favored. Some half-mixed-race Hawaiians, in order to avoid ridicule for exaggerating the density of their white ancestry, often register as pure Hawaiians. Intermarriage between Chinese Hawaiians and Caucasian Hawaiians is increasing.

### Old-Style Chinese Merchants Richest Japanese Express Loyalty to America

On the island of Hawaii, 60% of the population is of Asian descent. There are 28,000 Chinese, 155,000 Japanese, and 52,000 Filipinos. Although interracial marriage is very prevalent, on the other hand, Eastern nations still seek partners within their own racial circles. Chinese and Japanese emigrants both preserve the old-fashioned traditional customs of their families and do not allow their children to intermarry with other races. Chinese people are the richest of the above three races. Most are large merchants and figures in professional circles. Japanese people are mostly small farmers, small shopkeepers, and small manufacturers. Most Filipinos are still agricultural laborers. The three races of Chinese, Filipino, and Japanese all suffer from a scarcity of women because those who go to the island are mostly single men who work in the sugarcane fields. The three races of Chinese, Filipino, and Japanese have all been universally hated multiple times for economic reasons (and not for reasons of racial differences). However, the Chinese and Japanese are the best-behaved races on the island. (The worst-behaved are the Puerto Ricans, half-mixed-race Hawaiians, and Filipinos.) The percentage of Chinese children sent to school is higher than that of Caucasians. The percentage of children in school below Caucasians is surpassed by Koreans. Among the Japanese, although a few acted as spies during the war, the majority patiently, bravely, and loyally express their loyalty to America, even on their tombstones, they erect or carve them in English and in the American style.

### Hawaii Becomes Paradise Related to the Spirit of Freedom

In 1778, Captain Cook discovered the original Hawaiians on the island, a proud and happy race. It is said that this race is gradually disappearing. In the 18th-century Stone Age, it had a population of 300,000, but by 1872, only 57,000 remained. The reason for the dramatic decline in population was entirely due to the infectious diseases brought by white people, such as mumps, measles, and whooping cough, which led to a sharp increase in mortality. Today, if we calculate its mixed-race population, it accounts for 15% of the island's total population, which is a number of 75,000 people. Some of these families are also wealthy. It is predicted that one day, all the people on the island will inevitably become half-mixed-race Hawaiians.

The original inhabitants of the island have always been lovers of the sea. It was so in the past, and it still is today. It is believed that these original inhabitants were Caucasians transplanted from the West Indies. It is said that they moved to the island from Samoa around 500 AD. They were never conquered by other Pacific nations and lived a free and independent life until 1898. This fact, coupled with their inherent spirit of tolerance and freedom, has somewhat influenced Hawaii's becoming a paradise for all races.

### Problems Caused by the Reorganization of Companies in Recovered Areas

— Pan Shihao

Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the reorganization of industrial and commercial organizations in the recovered areas has been of great concern to all parties, and how to convert the book capital amount and how to adjust the rights and interests of new and old shareholders have been the focus of discussion. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations have repeatedly made suggestions to the government. The "Measures for Handling the Registration of Companies in Recovered Areas" recently passed by the Executive Yuan can be said to have given us a considerable answer. However, this has also raised several issues that still need our exploration. I would like to list them below based on my humble opinion:

Conversion of Capital

The result can be said to be in line with the principles suggested by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Institute of Certified Public Accountants. On the surface, it seems to convert counterfeit currency capital at a rate of two hundred to one, but the property purchased with the increased counterfeit currency can be reasonably priced in legal tender, and the new and old shareholders are allowed to calculate together. The amount allocated to the new shares will be the new shares, and the remainder will be used as public accumulation, so the result is still allowed to be offset. If the property appraisal is not enough to offset, the amount of capital should be reduced; but if it exceeds the amount of capital, will it be allowed to increase it for capital increase? And how can the appraisal result be considered appropriate, and how can the capital amount not be inflated? The key to this lies in the standard of property appraisal. In terms of legal and accounting principles, except for liquidation, the lower price between the original price and the market price should be the principle. In other words, the book amount of the property should be the original price. When the original price is lower than the market price, it can be discounted according to the market price, but this does not seem to be discussed in the conversion of capital. Moreover, the conversion of the counterfeit currency capital amount at a rate of two hundred to one is inherently far-fetched in accounting and is not a normal processing principle that can be cited. Therefore, the current pricing should be based on the market price as the principle. At this time of currency depreciation and rising prices, except for a very small number of industries and businesses with special abnormalities, it seems that there is no problem in offsetting the book capital amount of counterfeit currency into legal tender. The word "inflation" is not worth worrying too much about. As for whether the excess can be increased for capital increase, it should be feasible to interpret it in terms of "the remainder is used as public accumulation." Because public accumulation can be used as capital increase, but this kind of capital increase procedure should not be handled together with this conversion of counterfeit currency capital to clarify the boundaries. I believe that in this way, everyone's anxiety about

Taxation and Dividends

The problem can be answered here. The increase in property value caused by the appraisal, which is allocated to the shareholders to make up for the book capital amount of counterfeit currency to be offset into legal tender, does not seem to be comparable to the usual distribution of profits, and there is no need to bear income tax, nor is it bound by the custom of dividends. As for whether the surplus of the appraisal should be used as capital increase, the definition of public accumulation must first be explained. According to Article 170 of the Company Law, the public accumulation fund belongs to the nature of retained earnings that have not been taxed. Therefore, when distributed to shareholders as capital increase, it is still necessary to bear taxes, and employee dividends are a free agreement between labor and capital. Profits that do not come from actual production and business activities are not necessarily required to be distributed. Recently, there have been more and more labor disputes. The misunderstanding caused by the wealth on paper is a hidden reef for the future of industry and commerce. The capital side should show consideration for the employees, and the employees should also understand the capital side. Commentators have cited the capital reduction method to explain the decline in the real value of capital in recent years, and the industrial and commercial circles have repeatedly pointed out the danger of the lack of material quantity. Their remarks may be slightly biased, but when adjusting capital, it is indeed not possible to seek excessive profits.

Preservation of Old Shareholders' Rights and Interests

Preservation of old shareholders' rights and interests has also been taken into account in the handling measures of the Executive Yuan, and there are even Zhang's regulations on the number of directors and supervisors of new and old shareholders. However, when each rich company increases capital, old shareholders often fail to participate, and those who have returned from the mainland have repeatedly criticized this. Since the handling measures have not clearly stipulated, it seems that new and old shareholders should negotiate on their own from an emotional point of view, otherwise, I will have more to do. The actions of the company should originally be in accordance with the Company Law. The Company Law clearly stipulates that the increase in capital must be registered for changes, but if there is a resolution of the shareholders' meeting, even if the registration of changes is neglected, it does not hinder the establishment of its actions. If there is no violation of the law in the procedures for convening and resolving the shareholders' meeting, its capital increase actions should originally be considered valid. Moreover, there are many reasons for the company's capital increase in recent years that are out of necessity. Old shareholders can certainly understand this. After they leave their original address, if there is no considerable remedy, they themselves cannot be said to have no responsibility, and they cannot claim the right to subscribe for new shares on the grounds that they have not been notified or have not been able to participate. Here, we cannot but think of

Shareholders' Meeting Disputes

On the other hand. In a company or a corporate body, the shareholders' meeting is originally its highest internal general meeting, and all internal disputes can originally be resolved within the shareholders' meeting. However, before the rights and interests of new and old shareholders have been determined, what will be the basis for convening and voting at its general meeting? And how will the solution be sought when there are questions about property appraisal? The Company Law originally had restrictions on property appraisal. Anyone who contributes in kind when increasing capital must first mention it in the shareholders' meeting and then discuss its appraisal, which is sufficient to show that the legislation pays great attention to property appraisal. Therefore, if the property appraisal is not determined, the adjustment of the capital amount is not determined, that is, the equity of the new and old shareholders is not determined. If the equity of the new and old shareholders has not been determined, then this shareholders' meeting certainly cannot resolve the dispute over property appraisal. However, if we talk about the intention of the handling measures, it is to deal with the company in the recovered area as soon as possible, and then proceed to registration. Then, for the new shareholders, it seems that they should first exercise their voting rights based on the amount of legal tender converted from counterfeit currency at a rate of two hundred to one. Although these measures seem to be a loss on the surface, the real value of the capital of the old shareholders has not increased sufficiently, and in fact, there is also a loss. In general, the shareholders' meeting should be convened again after the appraisal of the property is proposed to the shareholders, so as to be both reasonable and legal. At the beginning of the reorganization of the company in the recovered area, the matter is very important, so I would like to discuss my views with the industrial and commercial circles.

### Comforting Exiles Re-Planning Rehabilitation A Talk on the Current Situation in Jiangsu

— Our Reader Pei Yun Sent from Yangzhou

The military mediation work has already entered the second stage, and special terms such as Jidong, Lunan, Chahar-Suiyuan, and Subei will inevitably become a thing of the past. At present, the situation in Yangzhou is that the dawn is just beginning to appear, and thousands of people are celebrating the New Year with joy, and the enthusiasm of the emotions is no less than that of the early days of victory. The reporter arrived in Yangzhou at the end of the year to spend the first New Year after this victory, and I would like to report what I have heard and seen to the former Subei expatriates.

Spring Arrives in Jianghuai

Spring arrives in the world, and the painted boats on Slender West Lake have been completely renovated. The boat ladies are well, and the singing is melodious. Although the spring breeze still brings the cold of the remaining winter, the Five Pavilions Bridge and the Pingshui Hall are already full of vigorous vitality. Guanyin Mountain, which has been deserted for eight years, is particularly prosperous on the God of Wealth Day. The first New Year after victory should be celebrated slightly.

County Magistrate Flees

Since the unconditional surrender of the enemy bandits, the counties in northern Jiangsu have gradually resumed. Who knew that the Communist army repeatedly approached, and the county magistrates of Gaoyou, Xinghua, Taiyu, and Tianchang counties all obeyed orders not to resist, and led the local people to flee to Yangzhou. Now, while comforting the exiled youth, they are re-planning reconstruction and re-rehabilitation, which is what is expected, but the exiled youth today look to their hometown with infinite pain.

Dikes to be Repaired

The Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau is currently preparing to block the Shijiang dams that were opened last year, and plans to repair the Guazhou Dike project to prevent the summer and autumn Jiang tide from scouring the dike body, so as to avoid the farmland within the east and west dikes from being harmed. Moreover, because the mouth of the Yellow River has not been blocked, if the Huai River rises sharply and the Yellow River floods, the canal cannot accommodate it, and the counties in the lower river will become a swamp. Therefore, the Bureau plans to apply to the Relief Administration for funds to carry out various projects.

Highway Improvement

From Liuwei on the edge of the Yangtze River to Yangzhou, there are more than ten kilometers of highway. Before the war, there were connecting buses, which were very convenient. Now, it is replaced by a reconstructed coal-powered car from 1920. Repairs have been stopped along the way, and passengers also have to ride on the roof. It is hoped that the highway authorities will find a way to improve it. The Yangtai Highway is barely passable. Yangzhou north to Shaobo, Gaoyou, Qingjiang and other places, it is better to use civilian ships. Recently, the Highway Administration has sent personnel to inspect and will immediately formulate a repair plan and engage in repairs.

Educational Rehabilitation

Before the war, the degree of Yangjin was praised by the academic circles of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. After the War of Resistance, either due to environmental pressure, it moved inland, or it was temporarily suspended due to the occupation of school buildings. The American Chinese Middle School, which is run by the church, has had its school buildings occupied by the Japanese invaders and changed into a concentration camp for foreigners. It has now been taken back and officially started classes. The male and female primary and secondary schools run by the Catholic Church are trying their best to maintain the status quo. The provincial and county middle schools have also been relocated from the inland. It is hoped that the educational authorities will step up rehabilitation guidance work to improve the educational and cultural level of northern Jiangsu. (2, 3.)

### A Moving Scene in Xinxiang

Editor: This is a recent moving scene in Xinxiang. I am from Qinyang, and I will record the true situation I witnessed. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Communist army captured Qinyang, Boai, Wenmeng, and Chou counties in northern Henan and called them "Liberated Areas." The people in the "Liberated Areas" could not bear the oppression and fled to Kaifeng and Xinxiang, becoming exiles with no place to live, in a very miserable situation. After the Xinxiang team of the Mediation Executive Department returned to Xinxiang for the second time, more than a thousand male and female people's representatives from Qinyi and Chuan counties marched in Xinxiang in teams on the afternoon of February 6 to petition, shouting slogans on the road such as "We don't want to be prisoners in the Liberated Area," "The Liberated Area is a big prison," and "We firmly oppose dividing northern Henan into the Liberated Area." After reaching the door of the three-person team, they requested that the representatives meet with them. Only government representatives politely persuaded the public to go back at the door. When the people heard the sound, they knelt down, prostrated themselves on the ground and cried bitterly, calling out "We want to go home," "Please the Eighth Route Army hurry up and withdraw from Qinyang Boai" and "Please the Central Army open west to recover Qinyang." The local people who watched also shed tears because of the moving situation. After many persuasion, the crying was slightly smaller, but the tears did not stop. They gradually stood up and still gathered and did not disperse. The writer quietly asked an old man who was nearly seventy years old why he was petitioning. According to him, "I am from Dongguan, Boai. I am sixty-six years old this year, and I only have one son named Ma Changshan. After the Eighth Route Army captured Boai, they only said that they would organize the militia. Who knew that when attacking Qinyang City, the militia was also opened. They didn't give my son a gun, but asked him to carry a ladder, and he lost his life in vain." After saying that, he choked and could not make a sound. A twelve-year-old girl asked another person who was asking with tears, "My dad was caught by the Eighth Route Army and insisted that he was a Kuomintang, and he was shot in Qinyang!" I interrupted and asked him what his dad did? She said, "He fought guerrillas with the brigade commander (that is, the current commander of the security brigade, Li Zongji - the author), and I don't know what he did. My mother is half crazy with anxiety, and my third uncle took us out." Saying that, the people, after being persuaded, cried out in unison, "Please the three-person team uphold justice and let us go home." The public gradually went west. The writer witnessed the suffering of the elders in his hometown, and when he returned home, he had thousands of thoughts in his heart. Without realizing it, he wrote these few words that are not well-written with tears, and asked to publish them. Sincerely, Xinxiang Chen Ping.

### Editorial: The Twelfth Anniversary of the New Life Movement

Today marks the twelfth anniversary of the New Life Movement. As we commemorate this anniversary during a time of national restoration and initial construction, reflecting on the past and planning for the future holds profound significance. Chairman Chiang initiated the New Life Movement twelve years ago, originally to address contemporary issues and urge us to adopt strict discipline in our daily lives to invigorate ourselves and strive for strength. Since the Xinhai Revolution, followed by the May Fourth New Culture Movement, under the slogan of overthrowing the "Confucius Shop," our inherent excellent traditions have often been neglected and self-despised. The moral values inherent in our nation have gradually declined. Simultaneously, the people have become accustomed to leisure and inaction, leading to scattered behavior and a lack of self-motivation. Chairman Chiang's advocacy of the New Life Movement aimed to restore our inherent moral order and discipline while encouraging individuals to invigorate and reform their personal lives. This was truly a potent remedy for saving our national customs. A nation is composed of countless individuals. Without reform in personal lives, how can the nation be reformed, and how can our nation join the ranks of modern nations? Some believe that the New Life should embody new morals, not merely restoring traditional virtues. However, moral values are timeless. The moral principles followed by our ancestors do not change their value with the passage of time. How to uphold our inherent moral values to adapt to our current new era and new life should be the primary task of the New Life Movement. This is the most fundamental task in our great nation-building endeavor. We can catch up in all material constructions, but if the personal lives of our people are not thoroughly reformed, it will be like building skyscrapers on a sandy beach, inevitably collapsing. Therefore, the widespread implementation of the New Life Movement is essential for nation-building, which is self-evident.

Twelve years is not a short time. After twelve years of promoting the New Life Movement, we cannot deny its achievements, but the desired outcomes have not been fully realized. Today, compared to twelve years ago, have we seen any real changes in the lives of our citizens? Have our personal lives been invigorated? The lack of punctuality remains, and the lack of self-motivation in personal lives persists. Today, after twelve years, how is it any different from the beginning? Occasionally, when we reflect, we cannot help but feel deeply moved. The number of organizations promoting the New Life is not small nationwide, and the funds spent on promoting the New Life Movement over the past twelve years are considerable. However, why are the results so limited?

First, it is because we have failed to practice what we preach. If those who are engaged in promoting the New Life Movement in various regions do not set a good example in their personal lives and lead by example, how can we expect the movement they are promoting to be effective? To promote the New Life Movement, slogans are posted, instructing people not to take cars or sedan chairs but to develop the habit of walking. Yet, those in charge of promotion in various regions may still use cars and sedan chairs. How can this be an effective promotion? Only when those promoting the New Life Movement in various regions personally practice the rules of the New Life can we expect it to be effective.

Second, we feel that it is difficult to express, but the rules of conduct set by the New Life Movement are too strict. If they are too strict, they are difficult to follow. Yet, we cannot but follow them, leading to superficial compliance and an increase in hypocrisy. This has a very negative impact on the general public's understanding of the New Life Movement. For example, smoking and drinking are prohibited by the New Life Movement. While tobacco and alcohol are indeed harmful habits, individuals have the freedom to choose. If an individual enjoys drinking, they should be able to have a drink with a few good friends during their leisure time, as long as it is done in moderation and does not lead to drunkenness or disturbance, which is not harmful to moral values or to the necessity of life. While this is not ideal, it does not need to be strictly prohibited. The New Life Movement explicitly prohibits these behaviors, leading to situations in some regions where the New Life Movement is implemented where restaurants are not allowed to sell alcohol openly, but people drink alcohol under the pretense of drinking tea, which is nothing more than self-deception. This has a significantly negative impact. The promotion of the New Life Movement originally aimed to make people understand propriety and shame and invigorate their personal lives. If the result of the promotion is to encourage people to be hypocritical and deceitful, does it not contradict Chairman Chiang's original intention in initiating the New Life Movement?

During his visit to Shanghai, Chairman Chiang, in his address to the public at the welcome rally at the racecourse, earnestly encouraged the public to restore inherent morality and practice the New Life. This demonstrates how much importance Chairman Chiang places on the promotion of the New Life Movement. Chairman Chiang said: "I believe that the most important thing for nation-building and safeguarding independence and freedom in the future is to restore China's inherent morality, develop our new spirit of nation-building, and practice our new life to change the numb and sluggish atmosphere. Every one of our compatriots must understand propriety, know shame, be responsible, and abide by discipline. The reason why our allied nations such as the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France have become so powerful is entirely due to the high moral standards of their people, who are able to automatically take responsibility for the nation, abide by discipline, and be selfless in public. If we want to stand in equality with our allied nations in independence and freedom, we must love our country, have the same morality, and have the same spirit as they do... only then can we stand among the modern nations and societies. Therefore, as I said before, the promotion of the New Life Movement is the most fundamental work in our nation-building efforts. The lack of effectiveness in the past promotion of the New Life Movement makes us aware of the need for vigilance in the future promotion of the New Life Movement. As we commemorate the twelfth anniversary of the New Life Movement, I would like to offer some observations on the future development of the New Life Movement:

First, the New Life Movement primarily aims to restore our nation's inherent morality and enable us to be responsible and disciplined in our daily lives. It seems appropriate to revise the rules regarding personal life, which are too strict, so that this fundamental movement of nation-building can be universally implemented without adverse effects. If it is too strict, it is difficult to implement. To make the New Life Movement practical for the general public, the limits of personal freedom must be relaxed. Actions that do not conflict with inherent morality should not be strictly prohibited. If we are too focused on minor details, the further we promote it, the further we will be from the purpose of the promotion. Given the lack of effectiveness in the past promotion of the New Life Movement, this point deserves special attention.

Second, we want to point out that restoring inherent morality is not about returning to the past but about innovation. Morality is timeless, as we have already said, and there is no difference between Chinese and foreign morality. Moral values are universal. Although foreign languages may not have the exact equivalents of our words "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame," foreign behavior is still guided by these principles. In his address to the public at the racecourse, Chairman Chiang taught us to learn from their moral spirit, which shows that restoring inherent morality is not about blindly returning to the past. Western moral spirit, including that of the Soviet Union, is deeply intertwined with Christianity. In addition to moral principles, they also have religious principles to regulate their behavior. The New Life Movement focuses on restoring inherent morality, and perhaps a new driving force is needed for its implementation. In our country, Chinese morality and Christian morality can be said to be two sides of the same coin. To thoroughly learn from the Western moral spirit, we should also pay more attention to the Christian principles that form the backbone of Western civilization.

### Report on the Case of Lee Tze's Betrayal: Record of Yesterday Afternoon's Continued Hearing, Prosecution Requests Seizure of Defendant's Property

New New Company Director and Several Others Summoned to Testify, Court Adjourns for Investigation and Reschedules Hearing for Debate

[Reported by this newspaper] The Lee Tze case was reheard yesterday. Both lawyers hired by the defendant, Che Shih-chao and Chen Rui, were present. Sha Qianli, the legal advisor for the prosecution, was also present, but due to litigation regulations, he could not participate in the debate and merely sat in the audience, providing instructions. Both sides presented their statements yesterday and summoned a large number of witnesses, including Jin Zongcheng. The details are as follows:

At half past two, Court President Liu Yu-kuei, along with Judges Cao Jun and Cai Jin, prosecutors, clerks, and others, arrived in court. After Lee Tze was brought in, the clerk was ordered to read the defendant's recorded statement from the previous hearing. Lee was asked if there were any errors, and he proposed two corrections. Then, the recorded statements of the prosecutors from the previous hearing were read, and they all stated that they were accurate. At this point, the court asked Lee Tze if he had any comments. Lee stated: Before the war, the customs' fine for the New New Company was not due to tax evasion but a misunderstanding. Regarding the donation of the New New Glass Radio equipment to the enemy, it was forcibly taken over by the Japanese puppet regime, and New New was not the only company affected at the time. As for the underground work,

They say I bought it with money

I don't want to argue too much, the facts will prove themselves in the future, he said. Then, Shu Yue-qiao said: If Lee Tze claims to have made contributions and wants to escape punishment, then Wang Jingwei also made contributions to the Republic in the past. Moreover, the witnesses Lee mentioned are all related to him, he said. Another prosecutor, Han Wu-cheng, said: During Chairman's visit to Shanghai, the Shanghai cotton cloth industry was bought by the puppet merchants' association, and they specially published a newspaper to appeal to the Chairman for relief. This shows the harm of the puppet merchants' association. Lee was the one who initiated the organization of the merchants' association and was a preparatory committee member and elected as a director and proposal review committee member. He also participated in

The European banquet for the Japanese economic delegation

Ogura and others, which can all be proven by reports, he said. At the same time, he requested the court to (1) summon Kinoshita Yutaka, the Japanese advisor to the New New Company, (2) review the files and meeting minutes of the puppet merchants' association, (3) investigate the connection between the Jiang Gong-mei case and Lee Tze, (3) investigate the dismissal of Bi Gao-kui, the inspector-general of the Garrison Command, and the reprimand of Cheng Yi-ming, the director of the investigation office, and the connection with the Lee Tze case, (5) immediately seize Lee Tze's property, and (6) inquire with the Public Utilities Bureau about the license number of Lee Tze's puppet merchants' association vehicle. At this point, lawyer Chen Ting-rui stood up and said: Last time, we asked the court to send someone to investigate the relevant accounts with both parties. The defendant has now had Pan Xulun, a certified public accountant from Lixin Accounting Firm, audit the New New Company, the Sendai Iron Factory, the New Great Bank, the Shanghai Industrial Bank, the clearing house, and other various

Relevant accounts audited

And has a written report, which is hereby submitted. The court then questioned Jin Zongcheng, the chairman of the New New Company, who stated: I did introduce the Sendai Iron Factory to purchase New New Company's Water Gutter Iron at the time, but I did not know the purchase date and price, he said. Then, He Jia-liang, an employee of the New New Company, was asked, who stated: When selling the Water Gutter to Sendai, I weighed it at the entrance of the New New Hotel, and it was transported by charcoal truck, a total of more than 300 bundles. Fei Wei-zhi, a clerk at the Sendai Iron Factory, said: I went to the New New Company to transport and weigh it, and the truck was borrowed from Rongfeng Spinning Mill. Chen Fu-en, the driver of Rongfeng Spinning Mill, testified that it was true. At this point, Court President Liu immediately asked Tang Cheng-zhang, the business manager of the New New Company, and ordered him to sign in court to verify the signature on the relevant account books related to the sale of Water Gutter Iron. Lawyer Chen then presented a book of subpoenas and said: Tang's signature methods are different, which can be used for reference. After Court President Liu questioned Chen Yao-shu, the cashier of the New New Company, and shareholders Wang Tong-sheng and Wu Zhi, he asked Lee Tze again. Lee said: Jiang Gong-mei has nothing to do with me at all. Now that Jiang has been arrested, please investigate, he said. At this point, Court President Liu said: The prosecutors and defense lawyers have presented evidence in this case, which the court will deliberate and determine whether it is necessary to investigate. Han Wu-cheng then stood up again and said that Wang Sheng-mao, Huang Ke-wen, and Xu Ke-kang, employees of the New New Company who are not representatives of the prosecutors, can also testify to the enemy's use of military trucks to transport Water Gutter Iron to New New. He also said that there are more than 400 employees of the New New Company who can testify. Yu Geng-sheng then described how enemy military trucks arrived at New New to transport Water Gutter Iron. After the interrogation was complete, the court adjourned for investigation and rescheduled the hearing for debate.

### Two Traitor Cases Heard on the Same Day

Two other traitor cases were heard yesterday morning, including (1) Gao Quan-sheng, a secret agent of the enemy's military police in Yangsiqiao, Pudong, with the victims Ding Wei-liang and Huang Hai-gen describing their victimization, (2) Chen You-tian, an intelligence officer of the puppet Pudong Security Brigade. Both cases were adjourned for further questioning.

The case of the Shen Wan-ling, the owner of the Shengsheng Ranch, accused of being a traitor by the ranch employees, will be heard at 9:30 a.m. today.

### Looking Forward to the Twelfth Anniversary of the New Life

— Qian Da-jun

Since Chairman Chiang initiated the New Life Movement in Nanchang on February 19, 1934, twelve years have passed. Whether in China or abroad, whether in cities or villages, whether men, women, old, or young, everyone knows the term "New Life" Movement, and everyone says they want to practice the New Life. But in fact, how many people have truly practiced the New Life? Looking at the overall society and country, how much has the New Life Movement actually achieved? Over the past twelve years, the nation and people have faced the dangers of life and death, survival, and extinction. However, the government and society have been actively carrying out this work, because the "New Life Movement" is indeed a social movement and a movement for the nation to rise from the dead. If we examine the achievements of the past twelve years, they are of course far from ideal. However, we should clearly recognize that the main reason why the New Life Movement could not be widely and universally successful was, of course, due to the destruction and obstruction of Japanese imperialism. The second reason is that the intellectual, influential, and responsible leaders in society generally lacked a correct understanding and, even more so, lacked the determination to practice it themselves. The New Life Movement cannot succeed with slogans alone; it must be practiced by everyone, especially in China, where our compatriots suffer hardships and have limited knowledge, and it is essential for social leaders to promote it in order to achieve top-down effectiveness. The New Life Movement has perfect theories and good methods. If we can gather the strength of all parties to promote it, it will be a fundamental movement for building a new China!

A movement, an ideology, when we study it from the perspective of evolutionary change, we can know that it must have temporality and spatiality. Based on the principle that "truth fears no destruction," let us examine whether the theory of the New Life Movement is correct and whether it meets the needs of today's situation.

The New Life Movement promotes a disciplined life based on "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame." It is practiced in daily life—in the four aspects of "clothing, food, housing, and transportation." "Embodying propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" is the content of the New Life Movement. "Propriety" is a respectful attitude, "righteousness" is upright behavior, "integrity" is clear distinction, and "shame" is sincere awareness. If the true meaning of "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" can be clearly understood, I believe that no one will doubt or insult the New Life Movement. As for the relationship between "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" and society and the nation, let us refer to Chairman Chiang's explanation:

"Propriety is reason; reason in the natural world is called law; reason in society is called regulations; reason in the nation is called discipline. If people's behavior is guided by these three laws, it is called abiding by the rules. Any behavior that abides by the rules is called a respectful attitude.

"Righteousness is appropriateness; appropriateness is proper behavior. Behavior that follows propriety—that is, conforms to the laws of nature, social regulations, and national discipline—is called proper behavior. Improper behavior, or knowing what is proper and not doing it,

"Integrity is clarity; it means being able to distinguish between right and wrong. That which conforms to propriety and righteousness is right, and that which is contrary to propriety and righteousness is wrong. Knowing what is right and taking it, knowing what is wrong and abandoning it, is called clear distinction.

"Shame is knowledge; it means knowing to have a sense of shame and disgust. Behavior that does not conform to propriety, righteousness, and integrity, and feeling ashamed of it, is called shame. Behavior that does not conform to propriety, righteousness, and integrity, and becoming immersed in its shameful nature, is called disgust. However, the notion of shame and disgust is prone to excess or deficiency. Therefore, awareness must be sincere. Having a sincere sense of shame means striving for improvement, and having a sincere sense of disgust means striving to cleanse oneself. This is called sincere awareness.

From the above, "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" are truly the only regulations for society, groups, and the nation. "Behavior that is contrary to 'propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame' only serves to harm others with one's knowledge and skills, and ultimately cannot benefit oneself, only leading to failure. Therefore, 'propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame' can not only save the nation but also establish the nation." As Guan Zhong said, "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of the nation. If the four pillars are not upheld, the nation will decline and perish." The reason why Chairman Chiang wants to promote the New Life Movement is because "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" are not upheld in today's society. In today's Chinese society, the general mentality is complacency and weakness, which is manifested in behavior as a lack of distinction between public and private, and a lack of understanding of fundamentals and details. Officials are hypocritical and corrupt; the people are scattered and numb; the youth are degenerate and indulgent; adults are corrupt and mediocre; the rich are extravagant and superficial; and the poor are humble and chaotic. Although there has been much progress in the eight years of the war of resistance, countless cases of shamelessness, corruption, and perversion of justice continue to emerge, and national discipline and social order are difficult to establish. If this situation continues for a long time, the victory won by the blood and lives of tens of millions of soldiers and civilians will be in vain. China has today entered the ranks of the four great powers, and not only must we seek clarity and efficiency in politics, but we must also strive for soundness in society, because a democratic country is based on the people as the foundation of the nation, and the strength of society can determine political reform. If China is to revive and become a prosperous and strong country, it must rebuild social morality and transform the national psychology, and the New Life Movement is precisely a movement created to address the ills of the old Chinese society; therefore, the New Life Movement is essential for China and must continue to be promoted. We hope that all sectors of the country will unanimously recognize the goal and earnestly do their best to fulfill our mission of creating a new society and a new country!

### US Military Continues Trial of Japanese War Criminals; General Chennault Also Attends Hearing; Defendant Pleads for Release, Claiming No Involvement in Killings

Yesterday morning, Flying Tiger General Chennault, accompanied by Colonel Shu Boyan, Chief of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Aviation Commission, attended the US military tribunal at Tilanqiao Prison to hear the case of the killing of American pilots. According to the record, the three young pilots who were brutally murdered were pilots of the 14th Air Force under General Chennault's command. After the American side learned that their pilots were killed on the 16th, they launched a major bombing of Hankou on the 10th of that month in retaliation. At that time, many innocent Chinese people in Hankou were also killed. Yesterday, Lieutenant Colonel Weiss, the prosecuting attorney, completed reading aloud the collected evidence of the crimes of the defendants. Lieutenant Colonel Harkins and Major Li Weiyun, the defense attorneys, then took the stand to speak and presented various reasons requesting the release of Sergeant Yamaguchi Kyukichi, Tsukada Kōkichi, Takeuchi Yoshiyuki, Fujita Jun'ichi, and Mizuta Yu, all of the 34th Army, stating that they only followed orders from their superiors to execute everything and did not participate in the killings. However, Lieutenant Colonel Weiss, the prosecuting attorney, rebutted, arguing that in law, all accomplices are guilty. Therefore, the five men's request for release was denied. Afterwards, the defense attorneys requested the release of Manabe Ryoichi, an official of the Japanese Consulate in Hankou, Hamada Shohei, a consular police officer, and Kato Takumi, a member of the youth corps, stating that they served in the consulate and were not involved in the matter and should not be convicted. This was also rejected. At noon, both sides' lawyers questioned Major General Kaburaki Masao, Colonel Sakai Sadaji, and Fujii Tsutomu, which lasted for two hours.

### Former Deputy Director of the French Concession Police Arrested; Aminov Accused of Assisting the Enemy and Puppets in Persecuting Patriots

Aminov, who once served as the Deputy Director of the Police Department of the French Concession, has been arrested by our military authorities a few days ago, following Sari, on suspicion of assisting the enemy and puppets in gathering military intelligence and killing patriotic individuals during the Anti-Japanese War. He has been handed over to the court and will be publicly tried.

It is learned that Aminov, also known as George, is 49 years old, originally from White Russia and later naturalized as a French citizen. During the Tsarist Russian era, he served as the head of the Royal Detective Corps. In 1922, he joined the French Concession Police as a detective in the Criminal Division, and was subsequently promoted to translator, head of the Political Affairs Section, chief inspector, and

Head of the Political Affairs Section

After the enemy forces invaded the Concession, he was appointed director of the Baojia Office (Neighborhood Watch) and once served as Deputy Director. It is said that at this time, Aminov colluded with Sari to persecute patriotic individuals, and it is rumored that the Japanese government awarded him a medal for this. Our authorities arrested Aminov at his residence on Hongqiao Road a week ago and

Filed public charges for war crimes.

It is reported that during the military tribunal's interrogation, Aminov firmly denied receiving a medal from the Japanese government. He also claimed to be unaware of Sari's various crimes and stated that he himself was on the Japanese blacklist.

### Sufficient Grain Reserves in the City; Authorities to Further Smooth Supply Channels

[Report from our Newspaper] According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Grain Administration Commissioner's Office, the city currently has ample rice reserves, and the autumn harvest in various places last year was also good. Therefore, he is very optimistic about the future of the city's grain administration. It is estimated that the current grain reserves in the city are six to eight times higher than the reserves in September last year. Only 30% of the abundant harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces last autumn has been sold. Therefore, the reasons for the current rise in rice prices in the city are nothing more than: (1) the general rise in commodity prices; (2) the rise in rice prices in the producing areas; (3) hoarding and speculation by speculators. He stated that the city's rice reserves were already sufficient, and now they will continue to smooth supply channels to rationalize the price of rice in the city. The office also plans to support rice merchants by finding ways to obtain mortgage loans from banks and the government to facilitate rice merchants' funding and facilitate the purchase and transportation of rice to Shanghai. Since the victory, the office has actively assisted various rice trade associations and rice shops in resuming business, and the number of rice shops has increased from 200 to 16,000.

### Labor Dispute in Cotton and Wool Textile Industry; Mediation Shows Signs of Progress

[Report from our Newspaper] After more than 7,700 employees of nine factories, including the Yong'an, Xinhe, Baofeng, and Shenxin cotton and wool textile factories, began a work slowdown on the 16th, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Li Jianhua, convened labor and management for mediation on the following day. The 12 demands raised by the labor side covered a wide range, making it difficult to reach an agreement immediately. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting with the management of 43 factories yesterday. According to Director Li, the focus of the dispute is the underpaid wages for November and December of last year after calculating the cost of living index. Most other issues are easier to resolve. If the negotiations at 2:00 PM this afternoon are successful, then work can fully resume tomorrow.

### Gas Company Employees Demand Improved Treatment

Employees of the Shanghai Gas Company submitted 19 demands to the company at the end of last year, requesting improved treatment, and requested mediation from the Social Affairs Bureau. At that time, the Social Affairs Bureau was busy dealing with other more serious labor disputes, so it has not yet formally mediated. After repeated urging from the labor side, the Social Affairs Bureau decided to convene labor and management at 10:00 AM on the 20th of this month to discuss solutions.

Subsequently, the 94th Army captured a bandit named Gu Huaiyi, a cook from Yangzhou, and presented him to the Third Front Army Command Headquarters. After interrogation, he confessed without reservation. The suspect dared to carry out robberies in towns, so he was sentenced to death by the Army Headquarters in accordance with the law. Yesterday, the suspect was identified and executed by firing squad at the execution ground on Song Park Road in Northern Fujian as a warning.

The advance subsidy has already begun to be issued yesterday.

### Incident Involving Passengers on the Yongsheng Steamer

Ministry of Economic Affairs personnel assaulted and insulted; luggage thrown into the river, culprits not caught

The Yongsheng Steamer of Jardine Matheson & Co., managed by the Far East Shipping Manager's Office in the UK, transported relief supplies to Qingdao and returned to Shanghai. It was then assigned to transport relief supplies to Tianjin. It was originally scheduled to depart the day before yesterday, but due to delays in loading and unloading cargo, it was postponed to yesterday afternoon. Shanghai-Tianjin sea routes are scarce, making travel inconvenient. After the steamer announced its voyage to Tianjin, passengers flocked to purchase tickets. Yesterday morning, the steamer moved from the Yitaixing Wharf in Pudong to the Swire Wharf in Xin Kai River to allow passengers to board and depart. There were 30 personnel from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, led by Captain Sun Qifan, traveling to Tianjin to then proceed to the Northeast to take over industrial assets. Around 7:00 AM, the team hired a vehicle to load their luggage and arrived at the wharf. They saw that the ship and wharf were crowded with passengers boarding continuously, and there was no room to stand on the deck or the walkways on both sides of the cargo hold. Due to the large number of people and luggage, the team could not find a place to settle down. The captain negotiated with the purser, Mr. Xu, and was allowed to huddle on the walkways on both sides of the officer's cabin, placing some of their luggage in the cabin. Around 11:30 AM, before the ship was about to set sail, two British sailors (resembling soldiers) entered and, for unknown reasons, suddenly started punching and kicking wildly, injuring several people. Fortunately, the injuries were minor and did not require medical treatment. The team was also present and several people stepped forward to dissuade them, but they were also beaten. The sailors also threw the team's luggage into the Huangpu River. The team immediately went ashore to call the police. Subsequently, the Shui Shang Police Sub-bureau of the 16th Precinct dispatched several police officers to accompany them. The two assaulting sailors were taken to the police station, along with a higher-ranking British soldier. After reconciliation at the police station, they all returned to the ship. Unexpectedly, the British sailors' attitude changed again after returning to the ship, and the team could no longer tolerate it. They immediately reported to the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and reported to the Shui Shang Police Sub-bureau again. After the police sub-bureau notified the captain, the ship could not set sail until the above dispute was resolved. The Special Commissioner's Office then sent Zhu Fukuang to the ship to negotiate with the captain, and the Shui Shang Police Sub-bureau also sent personnel to assist. By 5:30 PM, the captain agreed to let the team stay in the dining room in front of the officer's cabin, and the incident came to an end. The ship is scheduled to depart for Tianjin at 4:00 AM this morning. As for the luggage that was thrown away, only one piece has been recovered. It is said that two pieces are still missing, one of which may be official documents and is very important. Negotiations will continue regarding the lost items.

### Memorial for Zhang Yongchun; Friends Set Up Altar for Remembrance

Zhang Yongchun, a member of the Shanghai Special City Party Committee, was arrested by the Japanese Kempeitai during the Anti-Japanese War in 1944 and suffered severe torture in prison. After being released that year, he eventually died of his injuries on February 19. Today is the second anniversary of Zhang's death. Comrades and friends in the city have set up an altar at the Danjing Temple at the intersection of Xiai Xians Road and Jin Shenfu Road to commemorate the martyr and console his loyal spirit.

### Women's Contribution to the Nation Should Be Equal to Men's; Madame Chiang Kai-shek Discusses Her Impressions of Her Trip to the Northeast

— Reported by Our Reporter, Mai Tian

"Many people often overlook the status and importance of housewives. In fact, this is a mistake. The responsibilities of housewives are very important, especially during the Anti-Japanese War. They not only had to take care of their husbands and children and manage the household, but also constantly helped their husbands with their work. Their contribution to the nation is really equal to that of their husbands." Madame Chiang told us this yesterday afternoon when she received reporters. If we want to give an example, Madame Chiang herself is the best example.

Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the reporters had the special opportunity to be received by Madame Chiang at the Kong Residence on Xiai Xians Road, even though she was not feeling well. She spent 40 minutes talking to us, and we felt very grateful and apologetic.

Madame Chiang was wearing a dark blue floral silk long-sleeved qipao, black high heels, and black earrings. Upon entering the living room, she warmly shook hands with each of the reporters and asked about them kindly. During the conversation, she smiled and called the reporters "children" from time to time.

Northeast Compatriots Are Excellent

When the reporters asked Madame Chiang about her impressions of the Northeast compatriots when she was in the Northeast, Madame Chiang spoke with a local accent, saying that she had a very good impression of the Northeast compatriots. When she arrived in Changchun, local residents braved the snow to welcome her at the airport, which moved her very much. But she found that the Northeast compatriots had indeed been oppressed by the Japanese. When she gave a speech at the conference, the crowd applauded enthusiastically. When the commander on stage ordered them to stop so that she could continue her speech, the entire audience immediately stopped applauding after the commander raised his hand. This was not like free people gradually and naturally stopping clapping. "The compatriots in the Northeast are very excellent. They are an oppressed people, not an organized people. If we can educate them and organize them well, the future will be very promising," Madame Chiang continued.

Do More to Serve Us

Madame Chiang was deeply moved by the many relatives, friends, and compatriots who had been displaced and died during the years of the Anti-Japanese War. She said, "People must have a broad vision, seek practicality, and should not only focus on the present. Life is short and fleeting like a dream, but precisely because it is short, we should strive to do something for the country and for mankind."

Madame Chiang is not only a leader in the women's world but also a good mother to children. As the Chairman of the Wartime Children's Relief Association, she has accommodated 30,000 orphans in the past few years. She has made the greatest efforts to raise funds and plan work for them.

Next, the reporters raised the following questions to Madame Chiang:

Q: "How will women's elections be stipulated when the National Assembly is convened in the future?"

A: "I don't think there should be any restrictions on women participating in the general election. Their qualifications to be elected and to vote are the same as men's."

Q: "What are Madame Chiang's opinions on women working in society and the unequal status of women?"

A: "I cannot understand why women cannot have a place in society. Women are also equal citizens. Although our experience may not be as much as men's, in fact, women can endure hardship more than men. But women themselves should also respect their own personality and not engage in behaviors that are despised by men. As for women being fired because they are married, this is also very unreasonable. As long as she has the ability to work, or her children are grown up and do not need to be taken care of all day long, she can of course continue to serve in society. It all depends on the individual's situation and environment."

Views on Clothing Issues

Madame Chiang was very happy to talk to us, so we changed the topic.

Q: "Madame Chiang has not returned to Shanghai for more than eight years. Now that she has come here, what are her feelings about the clothing of Shanghai women?"

A: "I really didn't see any new clothes. I heard that short qipaos are popular now. My clothes are the same as they were eight years ago, and I don't know what the most fashionable styles are. I always hear that high-shoulder qipaos are popular, but I haven't even seen them. I still like to wear long qipaos, and I always wear silk-cotton robes in cold weather. I am very afraid of the cold, and silk-cotton robes are much warmer. I think the most fashionable clothes are those that are good for your health."

Q: "What are Madame Chiang's usual hobbies?"

A: "I used to love horseback riding, playing golf, and playing tennis, but now there is no opportunity at all. I always thought I could rest after the victory, but in fact, it's impossible. But we should still do more when we can." Madame Chiang also said: "I also often like to take walks, and I like classical music. I really hope that when Shanghai's symphony orchestra performs, it can be broadcast for free by radio, like in foreign countries, so that everyone can hear it.

Most Favors Deep Blue

Q: "What is Madame Chiang's favorite color?"

A: "I like deep blue and black."

Someone came in to report that the time was up, so we had to stand up and say goodbye. Before leaving, Madame Chiang expressed her approval and satisfaction with women working in the news industry. She earnestly encouraged us, saying: "I hope that you can work hard in the newspaper not only for your career but also for the country and for mankind."

### Securities Exchange Heating Up Again; Authorities Determined to Intensify Crackdown

Since the Shanghai financial authorities dispatched police to clear the Securities Exchange on the morning of the 15th to combat speculation and crack down on the black market, thoroughly investigating the accounts of various firms and punishing any illegal business activities according to law, speculators have all disappeared. Yesterday morning, it was discovered that unscrupulous individuals were gathering and trading in the building again, resuming their old business, and the atmosphere became lively again. The authorities believe that this speculation endangers social security and affects price fluctuations. In the future, they will only intensify the crackdown according to the established policy and will never relax. They have already agreed with the security authorities to take effective countermeasures.

The Rectification Committee of the Shanghai Money Changers Association has issued a notice to its members, requiring them to comply with the authorities' policy of stabilizing finance and to ensure that no speculative behavior occurs in their business operations. Otherwise, the association will not provide protection.

Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, a fire broke out in the furnace room due to carelessness in burning rice straw, affecting the building in front, where the Xuhui Theater performed Shaoxing opera. Suddenly, male and female spectators rushed out of the door, causing chaos.

### Black Market Transactions: Gold and Banknotes Decline, Public Bonds Continue to Fall, Chinese Stocks Rebound

Secret trading of gold bars continued yesterday, opening at 1.54 million, with extremely tight credit conditions. Sellers gradually pressured the price down to 1.45 million, with buyers still active, struggling around the 1.5 million mark. Banks from the north continued to unload gold. With rumors of account investigations targeting financial institutions, speculators lacked sources of funds. The overnight interest rate soared to 30%, creating a slight sense of panic. The price dropped to a low of 1.33 million, closing at 1.37 million at noon, a half-percent decrease from the previous Saturday. In the afternoon, prices fluctuated within the 1.4 million range. No official price was listed for refined gold. Silver was selling at 1,600, and silver dollars were offered at 8,120 yuan. Interest rates were briefly bid up to 30%, but the prevailing rate was between 20% and 25%.

The US dollar opened around 2,050 yuan, but weakened due to the influence of gold prices, trending downwards after reaching 2,080 yuan. It fell to 1,960 yuan before noon, hovering between 1,980 yuan and 2,000 yuan at noon, similar to the previous Saturday. The exchange rate against gold fluctuated from 730 yuan to 700 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong currency lacked demand, with newly issued notes being particularly weak. As a result, older notes remained stable while new notes experienced a half-percent decline.

There was some transfer of public bonds in the market. Class C bonds opened at 1,620 yuan, reaching a high of 1,720 yuan and a low of 1,450 yuan, closing at 1,500 yuan at noon. Class E bonds opened at 1,180 yuan, reaching a high of 1,250 yuan and a low of 1,020 yuan, eventually settling around 1,050 yuan. Miscellaneous bonds of Classes A, B, and D all remained around 1,000 yuan. Due to tight credit, sellers continued to cut prices, resulting in a further 10% drop compared to the previous Saturday.

Chinese stocks rebounded slightly due to efforts by trade associations to request the authorities to allow free trading. However, high prices were forced down by tight credit conditions, leading to continued selling. Yong Xin Yarn initially opened at 2,200 yuan in the morning, reaching a high of 2,300 yuan, but eventually closing at 2,050 yuan. Mei Ya opened at 1,750 yuan, reaching a high of 1,800 yuan, and closing at 1,550 yuan. Jing Fu fell from around 125 yuan to around 115 yuan. Overall, the results were half a percent better than the previous Saturday.

Foreign stocks were priced by sellers at the start of yesterday, but buyers remained cautious, resulting in limited transactions. Based on the sellers' asking prices, all stocks fell by about 10%. Except for the buying price of British & Chinese Corporation's "De Shao," all other prices were selling prices.

### Sluggish Yarn Sales: High List Prices for the Textile Construction Company

The yarn market remained depressed yesterday. Yang Chu initially opened at a high price, with 20-count Double Horse yarn trading at 1.02 million, but sellers flooded the market, and it closed at 970,000. Many traders were forced to lower prices to sell due to tight credit. Sales were slow, and sentiment was neutral. Prices for various yarn counts decreased by about 50,000. At noon, the Textile Construction Company announced its list prices. It offered no sales of 42-count Qian yarn and 20-count yarn, which were in demand. However, 40-count Blue Phoenix single yarn was auctioned at 1.76 million, an increase of 90,000 from the previous period. Additionally, 60-count Sunlight Singed thread was also auctioned at a high price of 3.18 million. It was reported that few yarn traders bought yesterday, believing that the Textile Construction Company's auction prices were higher than the market.

### Slight Progress in Cotton Transactions

First Transaction of Zhangde Cotton

The Textile Construction Company made some purchases, buying Zhangde cotton at 100,500 yuan, Mettling cotton at 89,000 yuan, and Nantong Taicang cotton at 74,000 yuan, all delivered to the factory. The internal price of Zhoupu Seed Cotton was 14,000 yuan. According to cotton traders, Zhangde cotton had been unavailable due to transportation disruptions, but supplies are expected to arrive in Shanghai continuously. This was the first transaction since the August 13th Incident.

### Silk Market: Qian Jing Thread Alone Shows Strength, Silk Fabrics Start Strong, End Weak

Warehouse receipts were weaker, trading at a minimum of 1.12 million and a maximum of 1.19 million, closing at 1.17 million in the afternoon. 120-count miscellaneous brands traded at 1.95 million. Mill silk saw little fluctuation. Qian Jing thread alone showed strength, as the price was significantly lower than mill silk, prompting users to favor it. The asking price for Qian Jing thread with an evenness of over 30 points was 1.45 million per load. Silk fabrics started strong but ended weak. Mei Ya silk was bid at over 1.25 million per hundred, later trading at 1.19 million. Da Ge Bi crepe fell from 4,320 yuan to 4,220 yuan. Minsheng black crepe was 4,950 yuan per yard.

### Rice Prices Continue to Rise

Soybean prices fluctuated, but rebounded by 1,000 yuan yesterday due to active trade. Soybean cake also increased by 200 yuan. Raw peanuts saw little change. Prices for all grains softened at the close.

### White Lead Wire Declines

The price of lead wire has recently shown signs of decline, as a shipment of 50 tons from abroad has arrived and is expected to be gradually sold off, causing those holding inventory to become apprehensive and refrain from raising prices as they did previously.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Cotton cloth traders remained inactive, unable to push up prices, but local demand remained exceptionally strong.

The lumber market has been strong in the past week due to brisk sales both locally and in other ports, especially Liu'an and Liu'an plywood, which have seen sharp increases. The market situation remained quite stable yesterday.

Daily necessities, such as Solid Foundation scissors and soap, opened slightly weaker. Huang Xiang Mao continues to receive allocations from the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration, resulting in strong sales, increasing by 2,500 yuan compared to yesterday. Candles and matches remained stable.

For cigarettes, British American Tobacco's Old Knife brand sold well and enjoyed quiet profits. Except for a slight increase in Da Gao Rong cigarettes, Chinese factory cigarettes saw sluggish sales, with abundant market supply and slight price declines.

Traders from various regions actively purchased Western medicines. With dwindling inventory, saccharin, quinine, penicillin, and other drugs reached new highs, with brisk sales.

The market for industrial raw materials was flat and sluggish, with few transactions. The price of caustic soda remained stable due to conflicting rumors, leading buyers to take a wait-and-see approach.

### Gold Prices Continue to Rise in Various Locations

(Central News Agency, Xi'an, 17th) Spurred by soaring gold prices in various regions, the market price of gold in Xi'an opened at 126,000 yuan per tael today, rising further to 128,000 yuan.

Most owners are unwilling to sell, especially light-colored broadcloth, which is most popular.

### Weak Tea Market: Minhou Tea Arrives in Shanghai

The tea market trend has shifted to a situation of "red tea weak, green tea strong." Sales of red tea varieties have gradually declined recently, with buyers hesitant.

The price of Taiwan black tea has even fallen below 60,000 yuan per dan. Qimen tea is showing obvious weakness and its future is uncertain.

(Chongqing, 15th) The Bank of China recently received instructions from the Ministry of Finance that because the crowds of buyers were causing disorder and making it impossible to maintain order in the Bank's entrusted gold trading, all gold trading procedures would be re-examined by the Ministry of Finance. Before the review is completed, trading should be temporarily suspended, and all customers registered on the 12th, whether they had drawn a number or not, should wait for instructions from the Executive Yuan. The sudden tightening of credit in Chongqing has eased as a result. It is reported that the liquid capital gathered in the Bank of China from various places at the moment is single-handedly facilitating manganese production.

The Guizhou Provincial Government has lifted the wartime ban on manganese production transactions, which is now applicable to buying and selling in the province. However, approval from the authorities is still required to export manganese.

### Wuhan Regional Planning Committee: Planning Wuhan's Cultural Development

Distribution of Elementary Schools and Parks Determined

[Special Dispatch from Hankou for this Paper] The Wuhan Regional City Planning Committee has recently planned the following cultural facilities for the Wuhan area: (1) Snake Mountain is designated as a scenic area, (2) the distribution of elementary schools, city parks, and sports fields is determined.

### Educational Facilities in Recovered Areas Suffer Extremely Heavy Losses

Submitting a Request for Assistance to the Ministry of Education

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Regarding the local education funds for the provinces and cities in the recovered areas, the Ministry of Education submitted a request in November of last year for the allocation of emergency measures funds, and the Executive Yuan allocated 1.1 billion yuan, which was distributed to the provinces to meet urgent needs. However, the damage to schools in the provinces is severe, making the allocation a drop in the bucket. Schools were mostly moved to the countryside during the war, and now plan to move back, but most of the original school buildings have been destroyed and cannot be used. Renting civilian housing is also impossible. Library equipment has suffered severe losses after repeated relocations. Although the situation in each province is not entirely the same, according to a survey by the Ministry of Education, 31 colleges and universities in 16 provinces and 5 cities (including Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Anhui, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Jehol, Chahar, Suiyuan, Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin, and Qingdao) have suffered damage in almost all cases. Of the 2,676 secondary schools, 1,861 have been damaged. Of the 206,704 elementary schools, 118,663 have been damaged. During the rehabilitation period, large sums of money will be needed for the repair of school buildings and the replenishment of equipment. It is reported that Hunan Province alone needs more than 570 billion yuan, which is a very serious situation. After the long war, the people's strength is exhausted, and the provinces and cities are unable to raise funds on their own. They are now submitting requests to the Ministry of Education to find solutions.

### College Students in Recovered Areas to Undergo Registration and Screening

The Ministry of Education has stipulated that students from enemy and puppet colleges and universities may register with the Teacher Appraisal Committee in each recovered area. After being approved for registration, students must submit reports on their studies of Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the book "China's Destiny," along with a thesis on their specialized subjects. After passing the review, the Ministry will issue a certificate recognizing their qualifications. Those who fail the review will be allowed to take the entrance examination for equivalent schools and grades.

### Municipal Education Loan Committee Sets Loan Amounts

[This City News] Applications for education loans have been closed.

After receiving the list of approved students from the committee, each school should come to the committee to calculate the amount of loan funds it should receive, and the committee will issue a check payable to the school. However, if the fundraising has not yet been fully collected, the committee may consult with each school to arrange for payment in installments.

It has been heard that there are still a few schools that have dismissed teachers without following the standards set by the Bureau. The Municipal Elementary School Association has sent representatives to report to the Education Bureau, which has accepted the report and will send personnel to investigate and correct the situation. It is also reported that the vast majority of municipal schools have not made any changes to their existing teachers and staff.

### The New Life Movement and Education

— Gu Yuxiu

The New Life Movement has been underway for twelve years since its inception. Within these twelve years, it has endured eight years of the War of Resistance. Therefore, the New Life Movement holds immense power and success for the victory of the War of Resistance. Now that the enemy has surrendered, the War of Resistance is victorious, and after the completion of the takeover, we are engaged in construction. Today, we celebrate the twelfth anniversary of the New Life Movement, reflecting on past work and planning further advancements.

In essence, the New Life Movement is a revolution of the lifestyle of our entire nation. It employs the simplest and most urgent methods to eliminate the habits of our citizens that are incompatible with the times and unsuitable for the environment, guiding them towards a lifestyle that suits the times and environment. In other words, it seeks to rationalize the lives of the people, using the inherent virtues of the Chinese nation, "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame," as the foundation, practicing them in the four aspects of daily life: "food, clothing, housing, and transportation." Today's China is a China victorious in the War of Resistance, and also a China striving for construction. Therefore, the lives of all citizens should be even more suited to the times and the environment, invigorate new spirits, engage in production and construction, and permanently stand shoulder to shoulder with the great powers.

The method of promoting the New Life Movement should begin with teaching, followed by inspection. Therefore, education and the New Life Movement are closely related.

Teachers at all levels of schools, whether in the classroom or during extracurricular activities, should teach students the main points and content of the New Life Movement using various methods. They should also lead by example, serving as role models for students. This will cultivate citizens who deeply understand propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and who can demonstrate these virtues in their daily lives of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. As for the general public, we should implement social education to promote the New Life Movement. Establishing public education centers, libraries, museums, gymnasiums, holding music performances, art exhibitions, and staging educational dramas and films can certainly enable the public to increase their knowledge, maintain good health, eliminate old habits, and cultivate a virtuous life. Therefore, as we celebrate the twelfth anniversary of the New Life Movement today, we realize that educational undertakings are indeed an important way to promote the New Life Movement.

### Basketball League Last Night: Renyu Defeats Xingzhong

Women's Group V Team Wins, Shantou Team Sacko Postponed

The basketball league yesterday had Sacko request postponement due to temporary military matters, disappointing countless spectators who were unable to witness an exciting match. Therefore, only two games remained yesterday. The results are as follows:

The final score was 46 to 40, and Renyu passed another hurdle. The Shantou Team Sacko match was postponed and replaced by a mixed temporary team from Shantou, with no impact on the standings.

### Dare Not

— Xiaoshan

There are several unique local dialects in Shaanxi that are very refined, beautiful in expression, and full of wisdom. "Dare not" is one of them.

If you go to a shop to buy something and want to reduce the price or get a discount, the shopkeeper will smile and answer you, "Dare not sell." This is much more tactful and generous than the Sichuanese shop's "Cannot," the Jiangsu and Zhejiang shop's "Cannot succeed," and the Tianjin shop's "No way."

If you negotiate with a rickshaw puller and the fare differs greatly, the puller will also sincerely respond with a "Dare not pull!" as if telling you that the "strength" of the laborer cannot be devalued! Very humble, yet very self-respecting.

Even when you ask, "Sir, is your surname Zhou, as in Zhou Wenwang?" the Shaanxi person will repeatedly reply with a look of fear and surprise, "Dare not surname! Dare not surname!"

Although "Dare not" may have actually become a "business tactic" and "polite phrase," the original meaning of "Dare not" is still valuable.

Dare not means prudence, thoughtfulness, restraint, simplicity, and careful consideration.

Life has many aspects, and I very much agree that we should all be "able to dare," but I would also prefer that we be "dare not" people at the same time. True "able to dare" always includes "dare not"; otherwise, it will lead you down a hooligan-like path, acting recklessly at every opportunity.

An "able to dare" boxer dares not strike casually, dares not sell dog-skin plaster everywhere.

An "able to dare" orator dares not open his mouth easily; his speech drafts are often more elaborate than those of a novice.

An "able to dare" author dares not produce shoddy work. Gorky's "Mother" was revised five times before being submitted.

An "able to dare" doctor dares not make a diagnosis lightly. The famous surgeon Miller once said, "Sometimes I almost dare not see patients; I am always afraid of being wrong."

An "able to dare" politician dares not be stubborn, dares not be selfish, dares not take risks casually, dares not ignore the trends of the people.

"Dare not" is not cowardice; "Dare not" is stability.

Thinking of myself, I should know what "dare not" to do. Looking at others, I hope they know what "dare not" to do. Otherwise, listening to the voices of the masses, shouldn't we dare not to "dare not" anymore?

Don't ever think that "Dare not" is something ugly, unlucky, or embarrassing. "Dare not" is indeed an unparalleled beauty.

International

### European Federation

— Jin Chun

It is said that U.S. President Truman is currently considering organizing a European federation. This federation may not be exactly the same as the U.S. federal system, but within this federation, the currency system will be uniform, tariffs will be unified, all resources will be jointly developed, and waterways will be publicly utilized. This federation will bring peace, stability, and prosperity to Europe. Truman has discussed this matter with his confidants, but he has not kept it a secret. He mentioned this idea at the Potsdam Conference, where he strongly advocated "unrestricted public use" of the Rhine, Danube, Black Sea Strait, Kiel Canal, and internal rivers that divide European countries. In his report attending this conference, he even stated frankly that the United States will continue to work to realize this proposal in the future.

The reason why President Truman wants to adopt this policy is simple. Although the United States intends to help Europe recover, Europe must make its own efforts to recover internally. If Europe wants to recover, tariff competition, trade restrictions, currency chaos, etc., must first be eliminated, so that commodity exchange and industrial areas can supply all products.

For example, Norway now desperately needs salt to preserve fish, and Italy desperately needs fish, but the two countries cannot trade. Greece is maliciously isolated by neighboring countries and cannot sell its tobacco, while other countries cannot even find cigarette butts. The Ruhr and Saar regions, Silesia, and Dessau have abundant coal reserves, but the local people cannot eat or wear coal. At the same time, Denmark, Hungary, and the Netherlands are rich in food, and the local people want to exchange food for coal, but the two regions cannot trade. The coal-producing areas have to starve, and the Danes, Dutch, and Hungarians have to endure the cold. President Truman advocates creating a European federation for another reason: European countries must eliminate their suspicions, eliminate their hatred, and unite as one family; otherwise, there will inevitably be an arms race. All resources will be consumed in preparing for war, resulting in hardship for the people and perhaps another even more terrible war.

Speaking of the European federation, this idea is not new. In the nineteenth century, many visionary people, such as Mazzini, Garibaldi, and Hugo, believed that European countries were originally one family, with the same culture and similar customs. Therefore, they loudly opposed the division of countries. In wartime, the victor also suffers losses. Unfortunately, this federal movement was promoted for only a short time before being extinguished by Prussia's arrogant threats and the outbreak of World War I.

But in 1922, France's Briand shouted the slogan "Unite to live, unite to prosper." Support for this idea grew, and in 1926, the Pan-European Conference was held in Vienna. All European countries participated, with 2,000 representatives in attendance.

At that time, the conference compared the European countries to a state of anarchy. It advocated creating a federation to unify the currency and tariffs, publicly use waterways, and align military and foreign policies; guaranteeing the equality, independence, and security of each federation member. Respecting everyone's religious and ethical beliefs. All disputes should be resolved peacefully by the federal court. Cooperating with other countries as much as possible in accordance with international order.

The people promoting this movement were not just idealists living in an ivory tower. They were all reputable and successful figures. Churchill strongly supported this federation at the time.

Of course, there was no shortage of people who opposed the federation: arms manufacturers, nationalistic politicians, and international financiers who exploited tariff policies. But they never attacked the system itself; they praised the idea, but they said it was a utopianism, an unattainable ideal. According to them, how could such a large area with so many different ethnic groups and different languages succeed in forming a federation?

But advocates of the federation cited more counter-evidence. They said: Italy and Germany had previously been divided into many counties, but after arduous struggles, the entire country was finally unified. The elements of the United States are even more complex, but after successfully forming a federation, it became such a progressive country. Speaking of the size of the area, Europe is only two-thirds the size of the United States and not even half the size of the Soviet Union. Furthermore, Switzerland is a good miniature of the European federation: among the twenty-two administrative regions, there are different religions, different languages, different ethnic groups, and different political systems, but look at what happened after they formed a federation.

At that time, there were twenty-six governments protecting the Pan-European Federation. It seemed that this system could be successful, but unfortunately, Briand died in 1932, followed by Hitler's aggressive actions, which triggered a world war. This federation had long been forgotten until Churchill re-emphasized the necessity of European unity on March 22, 1943, when everyone became concerned about this system again. Although there is no Briand to promote it now, more and more knowledgeable people in various countries are supporting this doctrine.

According to the plan of the current group of promoters, Britain and the Soviet Union will not be included in the federation. Britain has its own federation. If the Soviet Union were to join, the scope of the federation would expand to the Pacific coast, and the Soviet Union is too large, and its joining would unbalance the organization of the federation. But at the same time, Britain and the Soviet Union should break down past prejudices and not use puppet governments or establish spheres of influence in Europe. Because to make the federation system successful, the will of each country in the federation must be free, and the governments of each country must be able to express the public opinion of that country. The European federation needs the friendly cooperation of Britain and the Soviet Union, but in addition to neighborly friendship, it should not have any other extravagant expectations.

What benefits does the European federation have for other countries? There are some. The military equipment of the federation is limited to self-defense, with no imperialist ambitions and will not launch aggressive wars. Therefore, after the success of the European federation, the Soviet Union can no longer worry about the "Western bloc" and can devote all its efforts to developing its rich domestic resources. Britain no longer needs to guard against Europe being controlled by Germany or the Soviet Union and can focus on sorting out its complex domestic affairs. The benefits of the federation to the United States are not obvious, but we can know that the United States will no longer be involved in the vortex of war, and the financial and material resources used for Europe can also be used in practice for construction, rather than being wasted.

President Truman's proposal to internationalize European waterways may be the first step in his efforts to organize a European federation.

### Chongqing Tidbits

— Mei Youyun

After several days of rain, the mountain city is muddy everywhere. The children who were looking forward to wearing new clothes and hats for the "New Year" had to spend it at home.

The "Folk Art Museum" run by the famous comic dialogue and drum singer Shanyao Dan is preparing to be completed before the Spring Festival. It is built in "Geling" in Central Park, and the first performance after completion is scheduled to be the multi-act drama "" by the Triumph Flying Car Dance Troupe.

Liu Fengzhao, who presented a horse in "July 7th" of the previous year, also brought his Chinese National Art Circus to catch the Spring Festival excitement. This 60-year-old gentleman said when he led his well-trained steed onto the donation platform in "July 7th" of the previous year: "If you have money and don't donate, you're not as good as Liu Fengzhao, who performs in the circus. If you have strength and don't contribute, you're like Liu Fengzhao's horse." The newspaper headline for him was "Presenting the horse with tears streaming down, hating people who are not as good as horses"? That donation increased the effectiveness of the gold donation considerably. This 60-year-old gentleman looks no more than 40 or 50 years old. His father is already 82 years old this year and can still wield a broadsword!

The "Shanghai Magazines" that the people in Chongqing are eagerly awaiting, except for a few small-paper-type publications that are sold in the market, not a single other excellent magazine can be bought. It is said that it is not that the Shanghai cultural world has forgotten the people of Chongqing, but that it is restricted by the regulations of the post office.

### The Doomsday of School Shops Has Arrived!

— Luo Yu

In the past, when the enemy and puppets were entrenched, not only did the number of primary and secondary schools in the city not decrease sharply, but school shops sprang up like mushrooms after rain. Therefore, you can often see advertisements for schools calling for transfer and takeover in newspapers. Unlicensed schools filled the city. These speculative merchants in the education industry, carrying the beautiful banner of private schooling, rented a little bit of housing. The pavilion can be used as an office, and the living room can be separated by three plywood into two classrooms. The patio, drying platform, and kitchen can be built to make up the numbers. Advertisements are posted in newspapers to attract customers. Some even use their brains to exhaust all means to "poach" students from other schools. Unfortunately, there are too few students who can afford to study. There are as few as dozens of students, but they can save expenses as much as possible and reduce class time. Teachers are paid by the hour, and salaries are as meager as possible. Good teachers are not hired. If teachers are absent from class, their salaries are deducted. School starts late and ends early. The school shop owners collect all the tuition fees at once and hoard the goods. When the goods rise in price, they are even more reluctant to sell them. The teachers' salaries can be dragged on. The teachers are committed to public service and dare not speak to the boss, fearing that their rice bowl will not be secure next semester. Which of the school shop owners is not pot-bellied, traveling in chartered cars, and can also do side jobs, such as selling diplomas and transfer certificates? The diploma of a certain middle school is sold for two dou of rice each, as long as you entrust someone who has studied in his school, and he shamelessly covers up and says: "Our school is enthusiastic about education and helps you to be able to go to school, just doing our best."

With victory, the school shop owners' sweet dreams are over, right? They have misled the children of so many families and destroyed so much of the country's vitality, causing the young people of Shanghai today to have the mentality of "If the young master has money, which school is not good to study in"?

Although my country's education is backward, we should encourage schooling more. Of course, we admire those altruistic and enthusiastic donors who run schools. However, in Shanghai, these school shops that hang a sheep's head but sell dog meat are actually harmful and useless to education. They should be severely banned and widely merged!

The reason why there are so many unemployed youths in Shanghai now is not that there are no schools, but economic reasons. On the contrary, after the school shops are abolished, the standard formal schools can increase their enrollment, and the economy can naturally be improved. With the elimination of redundant expenses, the problems of heavy studies, teacher treatment, and free education for unemployed youths can all be easily solved.

With the opening of the school season approaching, the school shop owners are changing their names and identities, and shamelessly posing as hard-working educationists. They are putting Li hats on Zhang's head and brazenly making me unable to come out and say these words.

How to Correct the Lack of Order Among Soldiers Taking Vehicles

Dear Editor: I take the tram at the end of North Sichuan Road every day. Passengers line up to wait for the bus, and the order is good. However, armed soldiers often do not follow the order and climb freely, preventing the people who are waiting in line from taking the bus. The police cannot interfere either, and everyone can only swallow their anger and see them off with angry eyes. If this continues, it will not be a good solution. Please ask how to correct this? (Mo Long)

(Answer) This situation is indeed visible everywhere. There is no denying that the quality of soldiers is low, and they lack training. It is hoped that the commanders of various troops will provide guidance during memorial weeks or collective talks. The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association should be responsible for correcting this. If everyone can maintain order and give people a good impression, they will naturally be respected by everyone, which would be a very good thing. Moreover, this matter is easy to do, so why shouldn't the military and political leaders be happy to do it!

How to Correct My Bad Temper

Editor: When I talk or argue with friends, I never want to suffer a loss, and I always want to fight for justice. I know that my temper is too hot, and I refuse to admit defeat. I cannot be patient, and I always want to meddle in other people's affairs. I have almost broken off with all my friends, and I feel very ashamed. Please, sir, instruct me on how to change my ways. (Lin Hui)

(Answer) The worst thing is when a person does not admit their own mistakes. Then, with stubborn prejudices, it will always be difficult to change their ways and start anew. It is really great that you can honestly examine your own mistakes. It is best to "think" more before getting angry and to endure your anger. You will naturally be calm and collected. Usually, you can read more of the teachings of ancient sages, such as books on the cultivation of famous people. You will definitely be able to change your temperament and measure.

### Letter

Sir: In the "Reader Opinions" column of your newspaper on the 12th, there are several questions from Yang Bujun regarding the promotion of the charity badge. Now, we reply as follows:

(1) The Charity Badge was printed by the China Cultural Investment Company with 50,055 honorary badges and 94,003 ordinary badges (receipts are available). It was originally intended to have the company print the numbers, but due to insufficient equipment and the impossibility of the time, the students arranged them themselves, and more than 60 students worked for two days and two nights to complete 90% of them. The remaining 10% only had numbers compiled on the first sheet of each strip, and the students of each school were notified to compile them in order. It is feared that the students were negligent, so charity badges without compiled numbers were found.

(2) In order to avoid misunderstandings, the Association had publicized in advance that the price of the charity badges was divided into two types, 1,000 yuan and 200 yuan, so the amount received by the Association completely matches the number of charity badges issued.

(3) All accounts will be published in the newspapers as soon as the settlement is completed. Shanghai Heavy Burden Charity Federation
