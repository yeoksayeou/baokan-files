### Government Ceasefire Proposal Advocates Marshall as Mediator; Political Consultative Conference Scheduled for the 13th

[United Press, Chongqing, 1st] On New Year's Eve, the government authorities proposed a ceasefire, advocating for the US Special Envoy to China, Marshall, as the mediator. Today, the entire country is eagerly awaiting the CCP's response. It is expected that the response will require thorough consideration by the CCP Executive Committee in Yan'an before instructing the CCP representatives in Chongqing to submit a reply. Regardless of whether the response is in agreement, the Political Consultative Conference is scheduled to open on January 10th, personally presided over by Chairman Chiang, with a session lasting thirteen days. In his New Year's Day broadcast, Chairman Chiang promised to make concessions as much as possible to seek national peace and promote genuine democracy. The only reaction from the CCP regarding the government's proposal was to publish the original text of its own ceasefire proposal. The CCP had previously refused to publish the full text, only revealing the general conditions to reporters. Now that the government has published the full text of its proposal, the CCP has also announced the original text of its unconditional ceasefire proposal, which includes the following: The CCP representatives, considering that previous talks had failed to reach an agreement to end the civil war, proactively proposed three unconditional methods for ceasing the civil war at the start of this round of negotiations, to alleviate the earnest concerns of people at home and abroad and to facilitate the progress of the Political Consultative Conference. First, both sides should order all armies nationwide to cease all military conflicts and remain in their original defensive positions. Second, all issues related to the civil war, such as surrender, disarmament, disbanding puppet troops, ceasing the use of enemy puppets, dividing military defense zones, restoring transportation, troop transport, and the recovery of liberated areas, should be resolved through peaceful consultation after the military conflict has genuinely ceased. Third, to ensure the implementation of the first point and the smooth progress of the second point, inspection teams should be organized by people from all sectors to go to areas where civil war has occurred, conduct on-site investigations, report the truth, and make it public. The government's proposals are as follows: (1) Cease all military conflicts throughout the country and restore railway transportation. (2) Because domestic military conflicts and transportation blockages are related to our country's obligations to the Allied nations regarding the surrender and repatriation of enemy prisoners, the government will appoint two representatives, the CCP will appoint two representatives, and together with General Marshall, they will promptly discuss and determine methods for ceasing military conflicts, restoring railway transportation, and other matters related to surrender, and submit them to the government for implementation. (3) The Resident Committee of the National Political Consultative Council will nominate five impartial individuals to form a military inspection team to go to conflict areas nationwide, investigate military conditions, transportation situations, and other matters related to the restoration of domestic peace, and submit and publish reports on the true facts at any time. When the Political Consultative Conference is established, it will also be invited to nominate impartial individuals to participate.

### Preparatory Committee for the National Assembly: Government to Select Seven to Nine Members

[United Press, Chongqing, 2nd] China enters 1946 filled with hope for peace. On the one hand, the government has submitted a counter-proposal for the KMT and CCP to each send representatives to discuss ceasefire steps with Special Envoy Marshall. On the other hand, the National Army in Southern Manchuria continues its advance, having recovered Fuxin, Xinmin, Yingkou, Chaoyang, and other places. The government's proposal is a response to the Communist Party's suggestion of an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, and it requests the restoration of railway traffic and calls for five neutral observers from the Standing Committee of the National Political Consultative Council (not the Political Consultative Conference) to inspect the conflict areas. At the same time, the government has ordered the formation of a preparatory committee for the National Assembly, scheduled to convene on May 5th. The committee will consist of seven to nine members, all selected by the government.

[United Press, Chongqing, 1st] The US Special Envoy to China, Marshall, met with CCP representative Zhou Enlai for two hours today. Judging from various signs, Marshall will serve as a mediator in China's internal conflict. The content of Marshall's conversation has not been disclosed, but it is known that the scope of the discussion was very broad, including the CCP's proposal for an unconditional ceasefire by both sides. The CCP had previously presented its position to Marshall, but today's conversation was extremely detailed and the first of its kind, suggesting that the CCP is willing to accept Marshall as a mediator between the KMT and the CCP. According to members of Marshall's staff, if the CCP agrees to the central government's counter-proposal regarding an unconditional ceasefire, then Marshall is willing to serve as a mediator. Marshall cannot announce his position until the CCP replies to the government's peace proposal, but it can be assumed that the government consulted with Marshall beforehand.

[United Press, New York, 1st] The New York Sun reported yesterday that General Marshall's mission as Special Envoy to China has had a "smooth start". "Although the conditions proposed by the Communist Party have not been made public, the report that the Chinese Communist Party has made a written proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire across the country is indeed good news from Chongqing. Spokesmen for the Kuomintang have often expressed dissatisfaction with the Communist Party's unreliability, saying that as soon as a proposal is accepted for consideration, new issues are often raised and new problems arise. Now that it has been put in writing, it is unlikely to be as fickle as in the past. The Communist Party's change may be due to the fact that the Soviet Union seems to have decided to take consistent steps with other Allied countries to support Chairman Chiang. But it seems more appropriate to say that the Communist Party's adaptability is due to the rapid exertion of General Marshall's power. When the Special Envoy first set foot on Chinese soil, he made it clear that the United States' main goal in China was to promote national unity. After arriving in China, he immediately consulted at length with leaders of various parties and brought representatives of various parties together for discussions. The newspaper said that efforts to end the civil war often showed signs of a solution, but ultimately failed due to the obstinacy of one party. The newspaper concluded with a warning that this situation may occur again.

### Chiang Ching-kuo's Mission to the Soviet Union: Exchange of General Opinions on Sino-Soviet Cooperation, Announced by Minister Wu at a Reception for Foreign Reporters

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] A reception for foreign reporters was held at 3:00 PM on the 2nd, hosted by Minister Wu Guozhen, Deputy Minister Liu Cuo, and Counselor Zhang Pingqun.

The reporter asked, what is the Communist Party's response to the three proposals for stopping the conflict put forward by the government on New Year's Eve? Answer: The government is still awaiting a reply from the Communist Party. Question: What is the extent of the damage caused by the excavation of the levee in the Jietan area of the Yellow River in Henan Province, which occurred in TaiKang? Answer: According to reports from the Seventh District Military Affairs Office of the province to the Executive Yuan, the Communist Army attempted to excavate and release the river dike north of Baitian on October 3rd of last year. The flooded area is approximately 120 li long and 3 li wide, inundating 2 million mu of farmland. The property loss is estimated to be 136 million yuan. Question: When will all departments of the government be able to fully move to Nanjing? Answer: Currently, transportation primarily relies on airplanes, so the capacity is limited. When the river water rises next spring and large ships can sail, it is hoped that all central government officials can work in Nanjing between March and April.

Editorial

### The Rebirth of Indonesia

The situation in the Dutch East Indies has been turbulent since the surrender of the enemy. Some radical elements in the nationalist movement, in the movement for national autonomy and independence, not only harbor anti-Dutch sentiments, but also inevitably have strong xenophobic actions; therefore, for a time, the situation in the Dutch East Indies seemed quite chaotic. The order in major ports such as Surabaya was also quite chaotic, so that the British army, which was responsible for accepting the surrender of the Japanese army in the Dutch East Indies, had to take decisive action. If this situation were allowed to develop, it would have a great impact on the reconstruction of peace in East Asia. A considerable number of Chinese people reside in the Dutch East Indies; we cannot but express our concern about the development of the situation in the Dutch East Indies. Yesterday's London telegram said that the United Kingdom and the Netherlands had reached an agreement on the policy towards the Dutch East Indies, and the Netherlands had revised its policy towards the Dutch East Indies. Following the meeting of the three foreign ministers, there is a new dawn in the Far East situation, which is really gratifying.

Since the Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor-General Van Mook flew to Europe, it has been generally hoped that an appropriate way to resolve the situation in the Dutch East Indies can be found. The communique issued from 10 Downing Street yesterday stated that the British government reiterated to its ally, the Netherlands, its obligation to quickly establish safe conditions so that the government of the Dutch East Indies could continue negotiations with representatives of Indonesia. At the same time, the negotiations conducted recently between Dutch Prime Minister Schermerhorn and British Prime Minister Attlee have also concluded and an agreement has been reached. Britain has declared that once the British army has completed its mission of disarming the Japanese army and liberating prisoners of war in Java, it will immediately withdraw. The two governments also believe that the solution to the political conflict is a major contribution to the task entrusted to the United Kingdom by the Supreme Allied Commander; and this task is to clear the Japanese army in these areas, which is related to the three parties, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the people of Indonesia.

At the time when the United Kingdom and the Netherlands reached an agreement on the policy towards Java, it was reported that the government of the Dutch East Indies had also revised its policy towards Java. In a speech to reporters in London, Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor-General Van Mook said that the conditions he and representatives of Indonesia put forward in November had been revised and believed that Indonesians would be able to accept them. As for what this new policy is, Van Mook has not yet revealed it; but according to qualified observers, this new policy will include granting the people of the East Indies a new constitution, so that the islands of the East Indies can unite as one and obtain a status like Canada and Australia, and be linked to the Netherlands. This is a "Dominion" system, which can be completely independent and autonomous in internal and even external affairs; but in terms of national defense and military affairs, it must be united with the Netherlands. Whether this system can be accepted by Indonesians is still unknown; but the proposal of this suggestion is undoubtedly a good step towards solving the situation in the Dutch East Indies.

Originally, the deterioration of the situation in the Dutch East Indies was inevitably due to the fact that the general radical elements were poisoned by the "Greater East Asia" deceptive propaganda. A group of Indonesians who cooperated with the Japanese under the rule of the Japanese, because the Japanese surrendered, were incited and supported by the Japanese army, obtained the equipment of the Japanese army, and accepted the training of the Japanese army, thereby raising the banner of national movement. The beginning of this movement, rather than seeking the independence and autonomy of Indonesians, was to cover up their past crimes of cooperating with the Japanese. The people who lead this movement still hope to win the sympathy of the world and give them support. But the world's public opinion will not give them strong support. China itself has been working hard for the national liberation movement for fifty years, and not only has moral sympathy for the liberation movement of the ruled nations, but also gives as much support as possible within the possible range. The announcement of the Cairo Conference and the support for the Korean national movement show our attitude towards the liberation movement of the ruled nations. If the Indonesian national movement is truly a spontaneous liberation movement, the Chinese people should give it moral support. A gratifying sign in the Indonesian national movement is the gradual rise of moderate elements, and there is hope that the poison of "Greater East Asia" can be cleared day by day.

It is under this situation that we see the agreement between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands on the policy towards Java and the revision of the Dutch policy. Although it remains to be seen what the new Dutch policy will be, if the telegram is reliable, it has to be considered quite generous and wise. The Netherlands and the East Indies have had a deep historical relationship for more than 300 years. In recent years, the Dutch rule over the East Indies has been relatively enlightened. If the "Dominion" system is proposed, on the one hand, it can satisfy the Indonesian people's desire for national autonomy, and on the other hand, it can prevent the historical relationship between the Netherlands and the East Indies for 300 years from being abandoned. It is indeed the most ideal way to resolve the situation. Indonesia is composed of countless islands scattered in the Southeast Pacific. In the past, Dutch rule has maintained the unity of Indonesia to some extent. Now is the era of atomic energy, and the international situation still needs to be further adjusted. Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor-General Van Mook himself is Indonesian, and he is very clear about the wishes of Indonesians; this time he returned from Europe with a new plan, and he believes that he may have satisfactory negotiations with Indonesian leaders, and then reach an agreement. The peace in Southeast Asia and the rebirth of Indonesia all depend on this.

### The Old Capital is Filled with Joy in the New Year; Pent-up Grievances Are Released Completely

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] The New Year has arrived in the old capital amidst a faint joy. Although, besides the fluttering of brand new national flags and some colorful arches on the streets, and the intermittent sound of firecrackers in the air, it seems that there is no enthusiastic atmosphere, but President Song's cancellation of the already decided postal and telecommunications price increase has poured cold water on the crazy prices, allowing people under the heavy pressure of life to breathe a sigh of relief and welcome the New Year. The drafting of the measures for the resumption of work in factories has also allowed unemployed workers in victory to see a ray of dawn. It has been very cold these few days, and there is snow everywhere on the streets and roofs. The roads are frozen and slippery, but fortunately, the flour from the Relief Administration arrived just in time, and poor children can also taste American flour. From 0:00 this morning, vehicles have been moving on the right side of the road. As of 8:00 PM, there have been no reports of any unfortunate events. Many cars that were driving on the left side of the road were reminded by oncoming vehicles. The whole city is on holiday for one day. The quiet cinemas and restaurants are all expanding. On the skating rink in Beihai, there are also more red and green young men and women. Only the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Office is the busiest, because it has to sort out a mess of silk since March in a few days. The Relief Administration is also working as usual, because many anemic hands are reaching out to them.

Comforting Poor Teachers

Poor and noble teachers have not been forgotten. Zhang Hongjie, a supervising commissioner of the Ministry of Education, is preparing to visit them door-to-door today to express his condolences and send them a bag of American flour. The students of the Temporary University Tutoring Class received 50 yuan in food allowance per person today, which is said to be enough to taste meat. Several major newspapers today doubled in size. The Huabei Daily editorial, "Welcoming the First Peaceful Year," appealed to politicians of all major countries to have a common sense of responsibility for the happiness of all mankind, and said that in the future, the person who can best enjoy the worship of mankind will be a politician with world aspirations, not a hero who pins the safety and prosperity of his own country on the terror and poverty of other countries. The Yishi Daily's editorial, "Our New Expectations," pointed out that the 35th year is China's year of destiny, and it loudly called for the people's livelihood to be stable. If there is more turmoil and displacement this year, it will be the great humiliation of the 35th year. If someone fires a shot, it will be a sinner of the times. If someone is corrupt, he does not deserve to live in the 35th year. Cheng Shewo personally wrote a big article in the Shijie Daily, asking the government and people to abide by the law, settle matters, and fulfill their responsibilities. There are several articles on the newspaper that cater to the occasion, but what is eye-catching is a passage in the news column about Zhang Ji's New Year's Eve speech to the Youth Corps. He used the example of building a house with engineers with many opinions that would inevitably fail, explaining that one-party rule is still necessary in the reconstruction of the country.

President Song and Others Watch a Play

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 1st] The celebration of New Year's Day in Beiping included a group worship and a military parade in the morning. In the afternoon, the New Year's Day Celebration Preparatory Committee, organized by Director Li and Chief Sun, with Mayor Xiong as the deputy chair, hosted a masquerade ice skating competition at 2:00 PM in front of the Ningzhai Hall in Beihai. The participants were dressed in novel and varied costumes. Beihai was open to the public for free, and the crowds of people who came to the venue to watch were extremely crowded. On the Yilan Hall, people stood like mountains, and around the ice rink, people gathered like ants, crowding together in a grand scene. At 7:00 PM, fireworks were set off in Dongdan Square. Silver flowers and fire trees, flowing light and scattered colors, coupled with the various firecrackers set off by the city's merchants and American barracks, from morning to evening, the sound of thunder added to the New Year's scenery. The exhibition of historical photos from the September 18th and January 28th incidents and the photos of the Premier and President will be held from New Year's Day for three days at the Waterside Pavilion in You Shan Park, open to the public. The Line Command's Propaganda Department and the Municipal Government held a soiree at 8:00 PM in Huairen Hall, gathering famous actors from Beiping to perform Peking opera. President Song, Special Envoys Zhang and Lu, and heads of various institutions were invited to watch the play, which was one of the most exciting scenes in the celebration of New Year's Day. During the period of the city's fall, under the oppression and trampling of the enemy puppets, the people of Beiping lived in peace and sought survival. They had no interest in seeking happiness during festivals, and they had few opportunities to vent their depression. Today, the country has regained its glory, and the whole world is celebrating together. As such, the people have the opportunity to participate in various celebration programs, and the pent-up hatred and grievances of the past have been released completely. From now on, the beginning of a new era, the officials and people will unite and jointly embark on the road to prosperity and happiness. Therefore, today's celebration of New Year's Day has laid the foundation for rejuvenation.

Guangzhou Celebrates Enthusiastically

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 1st] All sectors here enthusiastically celebrated New Year's Day, and the grand occasion was unprecedented. All government agencies and shops hung flags and decorations, and all pedestrians were full of smiles. A military parade was held in the morning, and a general meeting was held in the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in the afternoon. After paying tribute to the national father Sun Yat-sen, a New Year's group worship was held. Afterwards, a parade was held, and the procession was extremely spectacular.

The exhibition of historical achievements and war trophies of the War of Resistance opened today, and the relief fund-raising campaign was enthusiastic, with donations reaching 20 million yuan. All students in the city mobilized to sell national flags in response, and a recreational performance was held on the roof of the Sincere Department Store for seven days. The Japanese prisoners of war serving in various agencies were also granted three days of leave to return to the concentration camp to rest.

### The Plan to Airlift Troops to the Northeast Will Be Abandoned; National Army Can Gradually Take Over Defense; Director of the Line Command, Xiong Shihui, Goes to Tianjin for Inspection

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] Reliable sources say that the plan to airlift large numbers of National Army troops to Changchun and Harbin has been almost completely abandoned today. Because the Soviet army has postponed its withdrawal, our army can gradually take over the defense as the Soviet army withdraws, and there is no need to airlift large numbers of National Army troops. A certain division that was previously prepared for air transport has now been reassigned. Division Commander Sun and Li Zefen will leave Beiping for Tianjin and then Tangshan. However, in order to ensure the safety of personnel receiving the provinces and cities, a security team will be airlifted to Changchun and depart with personnel from various provinces and cities for takeover. Yesterday, on New Year's Day, Beiping heard that the airlift had been temporarily suspended for one day. It is reported that the personnel from the Songjiang, Hejiang, and Nenjiang provincial governments will depart on the 1st and 2nd. The personnel from Dalian and Andong are scheduled for the last, ninth batch. The order in Liaobei Province is stable, and Liu Lundong can move into the provincial capital Sipingjie in a short time.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd] Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Line Command, arrived in Tianjin by special train from Beiping at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, and immediately went to Zhangyuan to hold a meeting with the military and political leaders who had come to the station to welcome him. It is said that the area from Yuguan to Langfang on the Beining Road and Dezhou on the Jinpu Road has been placed under the jurisdiction of the Northeast Line Command. Director Xiong came to Tianjin today to inspect and give instructions to the heads of the various departments.

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 1st] Yang Zhuoan officially took over the Harbin Municipal Government on the 1st, and the Harbin branch of the Central Bank opened on the same day.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 2nd] Zhang Jia'ao, Dong Yanping, and Wang Zhong left Harbin by special train at 8:10 this morning and arrived in Changchun at 1:10 this afternoon. Zhang spoke to the heads of the stations along the way.

### The National Army Steadily Advances into Northern Jiangsu; Commander Tang Sincerely Comforts the Elders; The Communist Army's Deceptive Tactics Undoubtedly Failed

[Our Yangzhou Correspondent, 2nd] The elite National Army entering Northern Jiangsu is steadily reinforcing Taixian. The vanguard crossed Yiling yesterday. The Communist army's invasion of Yiling, a key point on the Yangzhou-Taizhou highway, was repelled by a small number of National Army soldiers in less than 24 hours. Although the Communist army appeared to be reinforcing, it failed due to insufficient transportation. Within thirty li on both sides of the Yangzhou-Taizhou highway, there will likely be no space for the Communist army to stand within three days. Commander Tang Enbo, during his inspection here, sincerely comforted the elders of Northern Jiangsu at a welcome reception, stating that Northern Jiangsu would see the light of day again. Public morale is boosted and the tense situation of ten days ago, which caused the price of rice in Yangzhou to rise to 20,000 legal tender per picul (石), even higher in the countryside, has recently fallen back to 16,000 yuan.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 2nd] As of today, the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu has spent two weeks, deploying more than twenty regiments to seize Gaoyou, besiege Taixian, and threaten Yangzhen. However, the results of their battles are tragic. Shaobo and Gaoyou have been retaken by the National Army. From New Year's Eve to the early morning of New Year's Day, Communist commander Su Yu used four regiments to launch a fierce attack on Taixian county seat from the southwest. They were bravely repelled by the defending troops and the National Army on the flank of Diaojiapu. This was the tenth fierce offensive launched by the Communist army after the defeat at Taixian, all ten ending in failure. According to those familiar with the geography of Northern Jiangsu, the organization of the Communist army, and its fighting ability, the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu is more coercive than effective, lacking in fighting spirit. If they do not stop fighting and retreat from Yancheng and Funing in time, they will inevitably suffer a disastrous defeat. There are three reasons for this: (1) The land on both sides of the canal in Northern Jiangsu is mostly plains. Outside Taixian city, there are very few high grounds and no tall and solid buildings, which is not conducive to guerrilla warfare. The National Army defends the city and guards the river, forcing the Communist army to attack uphill step by step. Therefore, the National Army can often repel a large number of Communist troops with a small number of defenders. (2) The National Army consists mainly of soldiers from Hunan and Hubei, and robust men from Shandong. These soldiers have fought bloody battles for many years and learned their lessons. Now that they are fortunate to witness the Japanese invaders surrender and the restoration of their homeland, they are celebrating their impending demobilization and hopeful return home. Unexpectedly, disaster has arisen within the country, and the Communist army has suddenly started a rebellion, filling them with grief and indignation, and strengthening their fighting spirit. On the other hand, the peasants who have been coerced into joining the Communist army in the counties along the canal in Jiangbei are mostly villagers who are content to stay at home and hate fighting. Education in the rural areas of Northern Jiangsu has always been backward, and very few peasants have received secondary education. They are easily coerced but difficult to teach. However, they have unwavering faith in and revere the intellectuals who speak truthfully and act respectfully. Now they see that the Communist army forcibly conscripts soldiers, and reduces taxes only to extort more. In order to facilitate looting, they do not hesitate to destroy the national currency system, issue "anti-currency" and worthless circulating notes, creating empty granaries and enriching their own families, while driving the people into ditches, glorifying it as "liberation". Although the peasants of Northern Jiangsu are ignorant, even women and children cannot be deceived by the true meaning of "liberation." No wonder that as an unorganized mob, they scatter like birds and beasts upon contact. (3) The biggest disadvantage of the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu in terms of terrain is the same as in other places, that is, they have people they can coerce, but no soldiers they can use. The Communist Party seems to have had a painful experience. Before the Japanese surrender, the Communist Party adopted an offensive strategy in politics and a defensive strategy in military affairs in Northern Jiangsu. Therefore, before September, the Communist army used anti-currency to absorb materials, adopting a cautious attitude. Their intention was clearly to use economic soft tactics to mystify their political deception, thereby consolidating their rule in the occupied areas of Northern Jiangsu. However, the people were already suffering miserably. Now, it is different. Since the beginning of September, the Communist Party has changed its offensive in Northern Jiangsu, attempting to seize Yangzhou and Taizhou, and expand its Yancheng and Funing base area, dreaming of drawing a line across the Yangtze River with the government army, and permanently solidifying its rule in Northern Jiangsu. It has repeated the mistakes of the puppet government, issuing circulating notes indiscriminately and forcing people to use them. The Communist army has undermined what it used to promote, that it would not issue banknotes indiscriminately, slapping itself in the face. Based on the above three factors, the Communist army's failure in Northern Jiangsu in the future will be a complete failure in military, political, and economic terms, without a doubt.

### Britain and the United States Engage in Diplomatic Activities to Prevent the Iranian Crisis, So That the Structure of the United Nations is Not Affected

[Associated Press, London, 2nd] Britain and the United States are currently engaged in diplomatic efforts to prevent the Iranian crisis from becoming a major problem at next week's United Nations General Assembly. London newspapers carry diplomatic reports from Tehran suggesting that the Iranian cabinet may experience its third resignation in a matter of days, and that after a day of efforts by the British and American ambassadors to Iran, the Iranian government may be reorganized. Officials of the United Nations organization hope that the first General Assembly will not be overshadowed by internal陰　, and want to maintain the strength of the first session to establish a security organization. The failure of the Moscow meeting to resolve the Iranian crisis has forced Britain and the United States to engage in diplomatic activities, as Iranian government officials are currently threatening to present this issue to the United Nations General Assembly.

[Associated Press, London, 1st] News revealed today stated that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will not attend the United Nations General Assembly to be held in London this month, greatly reducing hopes for the early resolution of the Iranian and Turkish issues. Diplomatic circles here originally believed that the foreign ministers of the "Big Three" would all attend the meeting and take the opportunity to hold informal discussions. Even if there were no definite actions, they could seek solutions to various issues. Britain is deeply concerned that the disturbances in northern Iran and the Soviet Union's demands on Turkey will threaten the political stability of the entire Middle East.

The Iranian Government is Expected to Undergo a Complete Change

[Reuters, Tehran, 2nd] Iranian Minister of Transport Firouz resigned yesterday. Observers believe this is a prelude to Iran facing a final crisis and a complete change of government. Some people closely related to the government now expect Prime Minister Hakimi to resign as well, and believe that the intensified diplomatic activities of the British and American ambassadors are a sign of "important developments." One development generally expected is that Iranian policy will shift to the left. However, so far there has been no indication of direct talks between the Iranian government and the Soviet military authorities. A prominent Iranian intellectual stated yesterday morning: "We already know that Sir Bullard is carrying important diplomatic notes to the Iranian government after the Moscow Conference, and the American ambassador has also received new instructions on Iran from American affairs 貝爾納斯." Bullard is the British ambassador to Iran. After attending the foreign ministers' meeting in Moscow, he flew to Tehran yesterday. Despite it being New Year's Day, he immediately convened the embassy staff upon his return and consulted with American Ambassador Murray.

On Spain, Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union are United

[United Press, Washington, 1st] According to diplomatic officials here today, the United States and Britain will formally recognize the annexation of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia into the Soviet Union this year. In addition, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will adopt a common policy on various diplomatic events this year. If this speculation is accurate, then since the Spanish Franco government has not been recognized by the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain will also sever relations with it. As for the recognition of the governments of Romania and Bulgaria by the United States and Britain, it has already been decided at the Moscow Conference. Since the convocation of the 21-nation peace conference and the conclusion of the peace treaties with the five enemy states have been fully agreed upon, the United States and Britain are unwilling to create further complications due to the Baltic and Franco issues, thereby disrupting the unity of the United Nations. Regarding the Spanish issue, the United States, Britain, and France will discuss the matter with Franco through diplomatic channels or formal meetings at the beginning of this year in order to decide on the attitude towards the Spanish government in exile. Some American officials believe that it is quite possible that the United States, Britain, and France will simultaneously sever relations with the Franco government this year.

As the water level in the upper Yangtze River continues to decrease, if necessary, the Ministry of Communications will be requested to increase the number of Hanwan... that is, Hankou to Wanxian. As for the public subsidy for the Yuyi line, the Ship Allocation Committee has decided to increase it from January.

### Customs Completes Inventory of More Than 700 Warehouses

Since the Shanghai Customs accepted the entrustment of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau to carry out the inventory of warehouses, as of now, the number of warehouses that have been inventoried has reached more than 700, among which the Hudong District has the most warehouses. It is known that this contribution work is expected to be completed in its entirety within two months.

### Two Fires

[Report from this newspaper] A large workshop of the Engineering Department of the Public Works Bureau at 44 Changning Road, West Shanghai, suddenly caught fire at 10:38 last night. The fire department drove to the scene to put out the fire, which was extinguished at midnight this morning, burning down one wooden house.

At around 0:10 this morning, a straw shed at a certain number at the end of Datong Road, Zhabei, caught fire due to carelessness. Forty to fifty straw sheds were burned down on the spot, a child was buried in the fire pit, and four or five men and women were burned.

### Experiencing Extreme Torture, Unjust Grievance Unresolved: The Blood and Tears History of Yang Wendao, Recalculating the Old Account of the Zhongshan Hide Case

— By Our Reporter, Ping Zhai

Who is Yang Wendao?

Shanghai people are notoriously forgetful. Mentioning Yang Wendao, perhaps very few people would know. Ten years ago, the three characters "Yang Wendao" once caused a sensation throughout the city and the entire country. He was the central figure in the shocking news of the Zhongshan Hidehiko international blood case!

Although Shanghai people have forgotten Yang Wendao, Yang Wendao cannot forget the people of Shanghai—cannot forget the great blood case of Zhongshan Hidehiko. Ten years of prison life, this fifty-one-year-old prisoner lives in the shadow of death every day. Yang Wendao thinks day and night: "I am wronged! For the sake of the country, I am in prison. When the day comes when justice is restored, I must have my grievance redressed!"

Hongkou Area as if Facing a Great Enemy

Returning to ten years ago, at 9:15 PM on November 9th of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, a Japanese sailor suddenly fell to the ground after being shot at the entrance of No. 209 Doule'an Road in Hongkou. The sailor's name was Zhongshan Hidehiko. At 1:15 AM, the soldier died in the naval hospital due to his serious injuries.

After receiving the news, the Japanese Marine Corps immediately dispatched more than a hundred soldiers to guard all key points in Hongkou. Armored vehicles sped through the streets, and the Japanese soldiers on the vehicles were fully armed, as if all the Chinese people in Hongkou were their charging enemies.

The hearts of the people in Hongkou were uneasy. Citizens packed their belongings and fled to the concessions for "refuge." Rumor had it that "The Japanese soldiers are about to rush in!" The situation was extremely tense at that time. The Public Security Bureau, the concession authorities, and the Japanese consulate offered a huge reward for capturing the murderer, a total of 12,000 yuan, enough to buy twelve gold bars at the market price at the time. On April 21st of the twenty-fifth year, a suspect was finally arrested.

Finding a Clue, Discovering a Book

The case was solved by Hirayama, who was actually Zheng Huimin, a Guangdong person who had become a Japanese national and a venereal disease doctor.

At that time, Zheng Huimin went to report to Japanese Detective Nakamura Nagao, saying, "The handgun belongs to Korean Jack. On the night of November 9th, Jack and 'Little Guangdong' and two others were walking on Baole'an Road when they encountered Zhongshan. Near Fengleli, Jack handed the handgun to Little Guangdong, who assassinated Zhongshan."

"Little Guangdong's" real name was Ye Haisheng, who was a dance hall leader. In December of the twenty-fourth year, he took dancers to Qingdao to open the Vienna Dance Hall. After the police obtained the lead, they sent people to Qingdao and arrested Ye Haisheng in mid-April of the twenty-fifth year, escorting him to Shanghai. Ye was a member of the Hongshun Society, and the police claimed to have found a clue, arresting Yang Wendao, the chairman of the Hongshun Society, on April 19th. At the same time, they found a green-covered "Practical Physics" book in Yang's home. Yang Wendao's fate was sealed by this book.

Self-Defense Handgun Had Been Returned Earlier

A handgun-shaped cavity had been hollowed out in this "Physics" book, which could hold a handgun. Yang Wendao said that his book contained his "Timon" brand self-defense gun, but that gun had already been returned to the police. However, when the police took out the Timon brand handgun and tried to put it into the cavity in the book, they couldn't fit it in. When they tried to put in the PB brand handgun that killed Zhongshan Hidehiko, it fit perfectly!

Because of these pieces of evidence, the police brought charges against Ye and Yang.

On May 1st, the First Criminal Court of the Shanghai Special Court began the trial. Ye Haisheng admitted to witnessing Yang Wendao firing the shot. On May 6th, when the court reopened, Ye Haisheng said that he did it all himself, and Yang Wendao was not involved at all.

Yang Wendao said that the "Practical Physics" book was definitely not the one he originally owned. He knew nothing about the killing of Zhongshan Hidehiko.

However, the atmosphere at the time was indeed tense. Every time there was a trial, many Japanese sailors with weapons would be in the audience, listening to the proceedings. The court was surrounded by detectives, and an armored vehicle full of armed Japanese soldiers was often parked outside.

Unwilling to Surrender Under Torture

In his prosecution speech, Prosecutor Zhang Zongru also said that Ye and Yang were indeed wronged. He said, how could someone who committed murder keep the weapon-hiding book at home? Moreover, there were fourteen fingerprints on the book, none of which matched the fingers of Ye or Yang. Moreover, the cut marks around the cavity were very fresh. He spoke passionately, with tears in his eyes. Ye Haisheng himself had already fully confessed, but when the court opened on May 27th, he burst into tears, saying that he couldn't bear the torture in the police station and had no choice but to confess.

Yang Wendao was a tough man. Every day (!), he was tortured for four hours by the Japanese detectives in the Dixwell Road police station. He was waterboarded, forced to kneel on bricks, kicked, beaten, and forced to confess. His only response was, "Shoot me three times in the chest first, and then ask me to confess." The Japanese were furious, took off their leather shoes, and beat him wildly. He fainted several times but never gave in. He lived like this for six and a half months!

It wasn't until October 2nd of the twenty-fifth year that the case was finally decided. Ye Haisheng and Yang Wendao were both sentenced to death.

Filing an Appeal, the Verdict is Rejected

On October 11th, Ye and Yang both appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. The High Court held a session and then declared the debate closed, rejecting the appeal. Yang and Ye then appealed to the Supreme Court. However, this was already December of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China.

In the twenty-sixth year, the sacred War of Resistance began. Until this day, the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on this case. Yang Wendao has been detained in the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison since October 2nd of the twenty-fifth year, and he is still waiting to this day. Ye Haisheng, however, died in prison four years ago.

This criminal sentenced to death is waiting every day. He prays silently, "When the day comes when justice is restored, I must have my grievance redressed!"

### Local Briefs

The Shanghai Bureau of the Jiujiang Road No. 36 Postal Savings Remittance Bureau has resumed remittances to various parts of North China.

Yesterday, the Fourteenth District Office of this city established the Baojia Reorganization Committee at No. 62 Nanxing Road, Zhabei, where it is located. A subcommittee was immediately formed to conduct separate discussions and studies on the reorganization of Baotian and segmentation, winter relief matters, and post-disaster reconstruction matters.

### Letter

Today's "Local Briefs" column in your newspaper stated that "Yuhua workers went on strike, and after mediation by the General Labor Union, the factory agreed to lend two months' wages, and work resumed yesterday." After investigation, the issuance of bonuses has not yet been approved by the company's board of directors. The statement in the newspaper that "the factory agreed to lend two months' wages" is a false rumor and should be corrected. Sincerely, Yubei Tobacco Co., Ltd., January 2nd

Commercial News

### One of the Objects of Speculation: The Tumultuous Process of Hong Kong Dollars, Calculated According to British and American Exchange Rates, The Price is Cheaper Than US Dollars

Hong Kong dollars in Shanghai have also become an object of speculation for general hot money in the past year. Rising and falling are often seen. There are usually two types on the market, old and new. Old goods refer to those issued in 1930 or before. There is also a 1935 version, which is about 10 yuan lower than the 1930 version. Small bills under 100 yuan are about 10% lower. The new goods are divided into the 1936 and 1937 versions, but the 1936 version with the number (2) is the same price as the 1937 version (number after C126000). There is also a 1934 version of 100 yuan bills (number after B485000) and 50 yuan bills (number after B350000), which are also the same price as new goods. The so-called new goods refer to those that have been declared invalid by the British government and whose numbers have been announced. At that time, when the market was still based on counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes, the market price of new goods plummeted from 16,000 counterfeit coins to below 2,000. Small money shops and general holders who were engaged in this business suffered great blows. Because the money exchange industry continued to buy and sell, the market never stopped. A few days later, there were rumors that the Chinese government had negotiated with the British government for reorganization, which attracted speculators who made huge profits, buying in again when the price was low, gradually rising to more than 30 yuan in legal tender. Later, it was said that these invalidated banknotes were actually issued by the Japanese to repay HSBC deposits. In any case, there was hope for reorganization, and the market price was pulled up again. After the resumption of Hong Kong-Shanghai transportation, there was news that Guangdong, Macau, and Hong Kong were also buying and selling new goods at half the price of old goods, which once rose to more than 80 yuan. Recently, because the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate was only 85%, the new goods there had fallen to within 30%, and the Shanghai market also fell to about 45 yuan. However, Hong Kong dollar old goods, calculated according to the exchange rate, have always been around 250 yuan in legal tender. Both sea and air routes are still buying new goods and transporting them from this city, and the inventory in this city is continuously decreasing. The market price of new goods the day before yesterday had recovered to about 75 yuan. It is heard that the price of new goods in Guangdong and Hong Kong has gradually risen to more than 100 yuan. Recently, the exchange rate has gradually been straightened out, and the trend is about to become popular again. Generally stable people, seeing that the market price of new goods is rising daily and the risk is also gradually increasing, have recently favored old goods, because old goods are legal Hong Kong currency. One Hong Kong dollar is legally convertible to one shilling and three pence in British pounds, which is equivalent to two and a half dimes in US dollars if calculated according to the British and American exchange rates. Comparing with the current US dollars, Hong Kong dollars are much cheaper. It is possible that in the near future, hot money will be dispersed to Hong Kong dollars.

### The First Batch of American Goods from Wing On Company Arrives in Shanghai: Gasoline and Diesel Oil Flood In

[Special dispatch from this newspaper] A large amount of gasoline and diesel oil arrived in port. The American ship managed by the Fulai Company, "Detry Head Victoria," entered the port yesterday afternoon. It is said that in addition to carrying more than 5,000 pieces of relief supplies, old clothes, and old shoes, there were more than 10,000 barrels of Texaco and Mobil gasoline and diesel oil, and another 13,000 barrels were transshipped to Hong Kong. It is heard that a batch of American goods from Wing On Company, such as several boxes of wool silk fabrics, etc., were also shipped to Shanghai on this ship.

### Economic Briefs

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangping ship, loaded with 850 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao, is coming to Shanghai and is expected to arrive today. Recently, prices in Fuzhou have soared, and the prices of various daily necessities have fluctuated violently. The Municipal Government is discussing effective ways to stabilize prices and will hold monthly price and wage discussion meetings to assess prices and wages.

From December 28th, the Tianjin Municipal Government and its subordinate bureaus and offices, from the bureau chiefs down to the staff, will receive 50 kilograms of wheat rations for December, with a price of 20 yuan in legal tender.

The Ministry of Finance ordered all banks and money houses in Peiping to freeze the deposits of traitors, and they are not allowed to be withdrawn. However, although the competent authorities in the Pingjin area have arrested traitors one after another, no official list has been published to date. The banks and money houses cannot know who is a traitor and who is not, but in order to comply with the ministry's order, they have frozen all deposits. General depositors who are not traitors are complaining endlessly.

The redemption of pseudo-Lianyin banknotes in Pingjin has been decided by the authorities to begin tomorrow.

A guest from Changsha talks about the banquet donation. It will be levied from 60 yuan, and there is no receipt. There are no less than 400 industrial enterprises, large and small, operated by Hong Kong Chinese, and there are also 300 household industries. After the recovery, only a few factories have started to resume production. According to a recent survey, there are more than 30 larger factories that have resumed work, including the Hong Kong Nail Factory. More than 300 factories have not been able to resume work.

### Hong Kong Pre-War Orders

Shipping at the Price Plus 25% Said

According to Hong Kong sources, for orders received by various foreign firms before the war that have not yet been delivered, it is heard that they will continue to be valid if the originally agreed price is increased by 25%. Once transportation is slightly restored, foreign manufacturers can ship the ordered goods to Hong Kong for delivery. It is found that the current market price of imported goods is much higher than before the war. If foreign merchants deliver the goods according to this method, the prices of various foreign goods will inevitably fall sharply soon.

Special Discussion

### How to Dispose of the Remaining Looted Yarn and Cloth

— Pan Shihao

The center of the industry, the factories established by Chinese people themselves, and the factories established by foreigners are all based here. Therefore, its textile beam factories and related businesses, such as the yarn and cloth industries, account for the center of the city's industry and commerce. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the source of foreign cotton and the mouth of colored cloth have been blocked, and this industry has inevitably declined. However, thanks to the efforts to acquire materials in the rear and the urgency of civilian use in the occupied areas, it can still maintain considerable prosperity. When the Japanese army occupied the former British and French concessions, the thickness of the yarn and cloth inventory showed that a certain part should be dedicated. Those in the industry, because their rights and interests are at stake, dealt with the situation in a roundabout way, while secretly accelerating the internal transfer to preserve their strength. The enemy was greatly angered and, on August 9th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, used pseudo-organizations to issue pseudo-orders, forcibly buying them. As soon as the news was released, it shocked all directions. Those who delayed slightly or hid slightly were hunted down everywhere, as quickly as fire. The enemy's and puppets' military police and economic security teams extorted and squeezed openly and secretly, taking the opportunity to harass them. A large number of factory workers and shop staff lost their jobs as a result. According to the statistics of the Pseudo-Chamber of Commerce up to September 6th, the amount of yarn and cloth that was forcibly taken was

Cotton Yarn 92,103 pieces

Gray Fabric 1,420,160 bolts

Processed Fabric 5,022,720 bolts

Later, after further searches, it accumulated to

Cotton Yarn 95,254 pieces

Gray Fabric 1,444,400 bolts

Processed Fabric 5,273,680 bolts

Calculating cotton yarn, each piece can produce 40 bolts of cotton cloth, obtaining 3,810,160 bolts of cloth. Adding gray fabric and processed fabric, the total number should be more than 10 million bolts. Later, 29,849 pieces of yarn and cloth were retained (each piece of cloth is calculated as 40 bolts) and 26,712 pieces were exempted, nominally retaining production businesses to maintain civilian consumption. In fact, it only accounted for two-tenths of the total number. The amount forcibly purchased was still around 8 million bolts. If each person made a new set of clothes, it would be enough to supply the clothing for more than 50 million people. The heavy losses of the industry are self-evident. At that time, there were more than 1,000 dyeing and weaving factories, about 2,000 cotton cloth shops, and more than 1,000 yarn shops. As of now, according to the membership rosters re-registered by the respective trade associations, there are more than 500 dyeing and weaving companies, 700 cotton cloth companies, and less than 400 yarn companies, and most of them only exist in name, without the power to operate. The factories are only empty shells, and the shops have empty stocks. It is extremely harmful to the country in distress. (To be continued)

### Once Panic in Gaoyou and Yangzhou: Communist Troops Harass Northern Jiangsu, Secretary-General of Jiangsu Province Chen Yan Reports

The Jiangsu Provincial Government received the press yesterday morning at 9:00 AM at the YMCA. Chen Yan, member and secretary-general of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, attended to report on the general situation in Jiangsu Province. Chen first described the relationship between Shanghai and Jiangsu Province, but to improve Jiangsu Province, it is necessary to pay attention to public security and the economy. He briefly said: (1) Banditry in Jiangnan is expected to be completely eliminated within two or three months. The public security problem in northern Jiangsu is even more serious than that in Jiangnan. At present, the counties controlled by our national army account for only one-fifth, while those controlled by the Communist army account for four-fifths. After the Japanese surrender, Huaiyin, Huaian, Xinghua, and Rugao were successively occupied by the Communist army. Recently, Yancheng was also lost. The Communist army recently attacked Gaoyou again. A few days ago, Yangzhou was once extremely panic-stricken. Therefore, from the perspective of public security, Jiangsu Province is still in a state of war. (2) Regarding the economy, local income currently only has five types: 1. License fee, 2. Vehicle license tax, 3. Slaughter donation, 4. Entertainment and theater donation, 5. House donation. The income is very limited, and the local economy is very difficult. However, the expenditure is much larger than in the past, especially for the troops under the county government. The economic situation in Jiangbei is even more serious. The Communist army issues "anti-tickets" everywhere, with each yuan priced at 500 or 1,000 legal tenders. As soon as the Communist army leaves, they become waste paper. The suffering of the people is not enough to be described by the four words "deep water and hot fire." At present, the county magistrate can only raise funds locally and establish a financial committee. All county government budgets, expenditures, and loans must be approved by the financial committee.

### Four American Soldiers Seize Legal Tender: US Authorities Take Back for Punishment

(Reported by this newspaper) At about 4:30 PM yesterday, four American soldiers suddenly broke into the Fulong Sugar House, commonly known as Mantingfang, located at Wuhu Road, Guangdong Road, rushed to the accounting room on the second floor, seized 50,000 yuan of legal tender from the accounting table, stuffed it into their pockets, and fled. However, one of them, Adama, aged 19, wandered from Shandong Road to the back door of the Huangpu Branch Bureau on East Zhongzheng Road, looking for his accomplices. Fortunately, the shop owner, Wu Bin, chased after him and secretly reported to the nearby police chief at No. 272, who arrested him and took him to the Huangpu Branch Bureau. Two American soldiers, one Azore El Arden, aged 19, and one Dickerson, aged 20, came to the branch bureau to turn themselves in, admitting that they had robbed the store. The remaining American soldier escaped without a trace. Later, the branch bureau notified the US military authorities to send personnel to the scene, and they were immediately taken back for punishment.

### Mountain City Wind and Rain

— Mei Youyun

There are a few humorous sayings in Chongqing:

Wedding Night - Next Door Neighbor;

When the Name is on the Golden List - Second Generation;

Long-Awaited Rain - Hailstones;

Meeting an Old Friend in a Foreign Land - Creditor.

For this election of senators, some people said: "The list of elected candidates" can be regarded as the Golden List, so to avoid the footnote of "Second Generation" for the four hundred and fifteen candidates. The enthusiasm for the election is quite "hanging". The streets and alleys have seen a lot of election flyers these days: "If you vote for ×××, not so many people will die of cholera this year"; "If you vote for ×××, the lights will not go out, and the tap water will not stop permanently"; "If you vote for ×××, every district will have a public toilet". These are all propaganda aimed at what the citizens of Chongqing are asking for. The most eye-catching is the manager of the Cathay Theatre, who drew his portrait on the advertising column on the theatre wall, writing: "Please vote for me". If you don't look carefully, you'd think it was a movie advertisement!

Anyway, this cannot but be said to be Chongqing's initiative, a new phenomenon in the mountain city.

The arrival of Special Envoy Marshall in Chongqing is even more of a major event that attracts attention. A shoeshine boy asked an old man selling peanuts: "What does Marshal Ma do?" The old man told him: "He is Xue Rengui, who crossed the sea to conquer the East in the past." Do you think this is ridiculous? No! It should be said to be shameful!

The first thing Mayor Zhang Dulun did after taking over was to clear the city's 500,000 dan of garbage. 140,000 dan have already been cleared, and they have been transported to fill a road to the airport. This proves that it is not afraid of having a lot of garbage, but afraid of not being willing to clear the team. "Obstacles" cannot hinder the construction of the main road.

The Political Consultative Conference is about to open: We hope it will bring us light and order.

Invention

### Fog Dispersal Device

— Yue Hao

In 1944, the climate in Europe was at its worst. The British Isles were entirely shrouded in heavy fog. German Field Marshal Rundstedt took advantage of this opportunity, recklessly driving his large army to launch a frantic counter-offensive against the American positions. He had already broken through the borders of Belgium, forcing the American troops to retreat step by step. It seemed that if the British and Americans could not deploy heavy bomber squadrons to join the battle at this time, the fate of the Allied forces would be uncertain! Rundstedt believed that it would be difficult for British and American aircraft to take off from airfields in such adverse weather conditions. In fact, it was indeed very difficult. However, to his surprise, before the American reserves had even arrived, large numbers of British and American heavy bombers were already roaring behind the German lines, disrupting supply and communication lines. This fatal blow finally caused the German army to retreat, and failure was sealed, with no way to recover!

In the main airfields of Britain, fog dispersal equipment had already been installed. This great invention not only allowed aircraft to take off and land safely but also saved many aircraft from crashes caused by heavy fog, and rescued numerous pilots who would otherwise have lost their precious lives due to such crashes.

In the spring of 1942, the number of aircraft crashes was increasing daily, far exceeding the number shot down by the Germans. Prime Minister Churchill was troubled by these alarming figures day and night. He ordered British scientists to quickly eliminate this enemy of aircraft. But they were all at a loss. Finally, Lout, the inventor of the flame-throwing tank, shouldered this great mission.

Lout mobilized more than five hundred experts, including famous figures in physics, chemistry, astronomy, and mechanics. Working day and night, they used various methods, such as air conditioning, electronic needles, and chemical absorption. Finally, they unanimously agreed that the most effective method was still to use hot air. The original steam becomes fog when the temperature drops below the dew point. If it is heated, it is not difficult to eliminate the fog by evaporating the water vapor. However, the focus of the difficulty was how to supply this large amount of heat?

They worked around the clock, constantly making fires, using coal, gas, and all kinds of flammable fuels. Finally, they tried using the most precious gasoline for experiments. A large tank, one hundred yards long, was filled with gasoline. Then a fire was started, and in an instant, the fire blazed, followed by terrifying yellowish flames. But there was no unpleasant ash like that from coal. The fog particles received the heat and quickly evaporated. In less than ten minutes, a space two hundred yards wide, fifty yards long, and eighty yards high was swept clean of heavy fog, revealing a clear sky with sparkling stars. This made them exceedingly excited. The initial experiment was finally completed.

In Granby in central England, a place with the heaviest fog, they installed a large-scale fog dispersal device near a large airfield, around the landing strip. It was a rectangular gasoline pipe five hundred yards long. When they started the actual test, its flames could be seen from fifty miles away. The dense fog gradually disappeared. Within an area three thousand feet long, one hundred and fifty feet wide, and one hundred feet high, you could clearly find any target.

In November 1943, the airfield in Granby rescued four aircraft that had lost their bearings due to heavy fog. By the end of the war, fifteen airfields had such equipment.

Ordinary use consumed 80,000 gallons of gasoline at a time, and 30 million gallons were used in an hour, costing 12 million U.S. dollars. Although this number is astonishing, it saved many aircraft and pilots. It seems that the price is always worth it!

Fog dispersal devices and radar both played an unparalleled role during the war. After the war, they will continue to be widely used by mankind, and will not threaten human safety like the atomic bomb.

Social Affairs

### Population Panic in Britain

— Ting Jun

According to recent statistics, the birth rate in Britain has declined sharply in the past fifty years. If this trend cannot be stopped in the next fifty years, then the British Empire will lose its military position and its economic importance. With a shrinking population in overseas colonies, it will no longer be a first-rate power.

This is not a trivial matter. Churchill was also anxious about this matter before. He once warned the whole country: "All those who care about our country cannot fail to pay attention to the future of our population!" Churchill also seemed very anxious.

Looking at the statistics, we really have to worry about Britain, because from 1923 to 1938, the British population continued to decline. If this trend continues, the British population of 46 million will only be 31 million by 1975, and less than one hundred years later, only 4.5 million will be left.

In order to deal with this serious problem, Britain has specially organized a population survey committee. The committee's tasks are: to conduct population statistics; to investigate the causes of low birth rates; to predict the impact of low birth rates on various aspects; and to study various preventive measures.

One thing that confused the survey committee was that the birth rate had increased compared to before in the recent four years. At first, it was thought that this was just a reaction to the previous sudden drop, but after careful study, it was discovered that there were other reasons. Originally, before 1938, Europe was first shrouded in war clouds, followed by a critical situation. Everyone was afraid to get married again, fearing the burden of family. Until the situation improved in the past four years, the arduous life had been endured, so the number of marriages increased, and the birth rate temporarily increased again.

The authorities know that this is only a temporary phenomenon. In order to ensure a real increase in the birth rate, it is more important to make people cherish the joy of family life. Therefore, the British authorities are now planning to issue family allowances to employees, pay attention to people's health, promote children's welfare, improve housing, and so on. The authorities are making every effort to deal with this problem, striving to curb this threat of a sharp decline in population.

Agriculture

### New Reforms in Agriculture

— Wang Guoxing

During this war, American agricultural science has made great progress, namely: new methods of rice harvesting and refining have been adopted. This reform will make white rice a cheaper and healthier food. Using the latest scientific methods, all kinds of unnecessary losses in the past can be avoided. For example, in the past, when rice was dried in the sun, unexpected losses were often incurred due to sudden wind and rain. It is said that when applying new harvesting methods, $15 US dollars in labor costs can be saved per acre.

Rice mills in Houston, Texas, are now using a new pneumatic method to mill rice. This can greatly preserve the nutrients contained in the rice grains. Under the treatment of the pneumatic method, the nutrients contained in the cortex of unhulled brown rice are driven towards the center of the rice grains. The harvested rice, after removing the outer husks, is placed in a vacuum device to remove its moisture. At this time, the surface of the rice grains is bright and shiny like jade, which is said to prevent insect infestation.

Another new advancement is the chemical method of changing the texture of wood. It is said that after treatment with this latest chemical method, even wood with a loose texture can have the hardness of metal. Wood such as poplar, after being treated with this method, has a hardness that not only surpasses teak but is even comparable to steel.

As for the chemical reagents used, the price is not expensive. Moreover, existing equipment can be used without having to start from scratch.

### Dream

— Xiao Chen

I have loved to dream and fantasize since I was a child. Fantasy often takes me into the air, where I soar like a lark. When I think of joy, I laugh happily. When I think of sorrow, I hide in my little room and sob.

But when I wake up from my dreams, I begin to feel pain. In my dreams, my love outweighs hatred, and joy outweighs disappointment. However, cruel reality strikes my fragile heart, and my dreams are shattered.

In reality, I experience sorrow and disappointment. But reason finally prevails over emotion. Gradually, I use my innate strong focus to cope with this terrible cursed reality. Soon, I become opposed to, and curse, this reality.

When another dreaming child comes along, I say to him:

"Dreams are empty! They are nothing more than a fleeting illusion."

I don't want to dream anymore. However, if this is a dream, isn't it too cruel? God sends down a drop of dew for every blade of grass, and also creates a beautiful spring day for every young life. Why say it's a dream?

But I can't say anything anymore.

Dreams! Dreams! Let them vanish!

### Democratic Education in the United States in the Future

— Yang Tongfang

Twelve professors at Harvard University in the United States have organized a Democratic Education Research Committee, responsible for investigating the entire education system in the United States, in order to have a practical understanding of the implementation of democratic education. After two years of research, they wrote the book "General Education in a Free Society," which was recently published.

This report provides many concrete opinions on the implementation of democratic education in the United States in the future, and also provides some suggestions for "democratized" courses and teaching in universities and secondary schools. In particular, the "democratization" of textbook organization, all kinds of issues that can promote the development of students' democratic thinking, are discussed in great detail.

American educational thought was originally "democratic." Taking the thoughts of well-known educators such as Dewey, Thorndike, Burkholder, Bode, and Wu Weishi as examples, it has fully expressed the spirit of democracy. The modern educational thoughts of "education is life," "school is society," "child-centered," and "personality adaptation" are all based on democracy. Now that the United States has gone through this anti-aggression and anti-fascist war, it feels even more necessary to further promote the "democratization of education," and to develop democratic thought, the most important thing is to rely on the power of education. Therefore, the research recently published by Harvard University professors is worthy of our attention.

This research report places great emphasis on the secondary education stage, because secondary education in the United States is very popular. At the same time, three-quarters of secondary school graduates do not go to university. How to make these secondary school students a good citizen in a free society after leaving school, with healthy bodies and minds, correct thoughts, practical knowledge, and excellent character, seems to be more important than simply developing higher education.

The United States has always had two different educational viewpoints: one advocates "specialization," with the purpose of providing students with the skills to engage in specialized occupations; the other advocates "generalization," with the purpose of enabling students to acquire general knowledge, and all subjects should be given equal importance. The former focuses on discovering students' strengths and training leaders with specialized skills. Each student should cultivate at least one special skill. Educators who advocate this kind of thinking can be said to be targeting the actual needs of modern complex industrialized America. The latter believes that to implement the spirit of true democratic education, it is not about training specialized talents, but about raising the level of national knowledge. The purpose of education, in addition to popularizing knowledge among the masses, is to strive for "mass education." There is no other more certain path. Educators who advocate this kind of educational thought believe that valuable national experiences should be instilled in children and young people. These two different educational thoughts, one can represent realism, and one can represent humanism. Of course, this is not absolute. There is no pure humanism in the United States today.

This research by Harvard University professors has reconciled these two extreme ideas, arguing that both theories have coexisting value. They believe that in the future, American education, in order to adapt to new needs, must have a center of gravity. This center of gravity refers to a highest goal of educational implementation: integrating specialized knowledge and general knowledge. The so-called center of gravity of education is that every student must receive "general courses," because what is included in general courses is the basic thought of free citizens in a democratic society. The traditions and culture of democratic thought will all rely on these "general courses" to connect and communicate. This is what citizens living in a democratic society cannot fail to understand, and further democratic thought must also break down national boundaries and connect and communicate the traditions and culture of human common democratic thought.

The report also said that this part of the educational work should begin in secondary school. In the four-year secondary school curriculum, "general courses" should account for at least half, including three English courses, three science and mathematics courses, and three history and social courses related to democratic government. In this way, the time for teaching special or specialized skills will not exceed half of the total teaching time. The professors at Harvard University also advocate excluding foreign languages, such as French, German, Spanish, Latin, and Greek, from the "general courses," because these are all tool subjects and cannot directly express the traditions and culture of democratic thought.

As for university courses, they are divided into three categories: the first category belongs to literature, the second category belongs to social sciences, and the third category belongs to natural sciences. The first category studies various literary theories, trends of thought, literary history, and literary works. The second category clearly emphasizes democratic thought, including the thoughts and systems of Western politics, economics, law, and society, American democratic thought and systems, the problems of people in a democratic society, and courses on human relationships. The third category includes courses on various modern scientific knowledge.

Looking at the opinions provided by Harvard professors on American democratic education this time, they can all be targeted at current needs and fully permeate the spirit of democracy. We hope that these programs can make great contributions to human culture.

### True and False Presentations

— Ke Ding'an

A Shandong man with real skills was performing "Swallowing a Sword" (popularly known as "Swallowing a Hard Sword") in a square. The surrounding onlookers did not seem to sympathize at all. Some people even said: "That iron sword is mobile, it can be stretched." This was wronging the Shandong man, he really had real skills, swallowing the iron sword straight down his throat.

At the same time, in another square, I saw a small performer selling candy, gesticulating and making faces. He sang some low-level tunes nonsensically. More people sympathized with him. Because what you hear with your ears is not as good as what you see with your eyes. If your eyes are nearsighted, perhaps when you see the Shandong man swallowing the iron sword, you only see an iron sword two inches long. Then, of course, it takes no effort to swallow it, and naturally you say it is fake and do not sympathize with him. When your ears hear the small performer's nonsense singing, even if you are nearsighted, it doesn't matter. What your ears hear is always real. So the surrounding group all said that the small performer sang well, and the Shandong man's performance was not realistic enough. In this way, society will not be peaceful.

There are so many cases of hanging a sheep's head but selling dog meat. Although there are also people with real skills, there seems to be a blind person there looking for dog meat that is pretending to be lamb. So the dog meat is lucky, and what is chewed in people's mouths is mostly dog meat. And they say, "I eat but do not know the taste," saying: "Lamb is so plump and beautiful!" There are too many people who eat dog meat and think it is lamb. The real lamb does not have someone like Yi Ya who can know the real taste of lamb and distinguish it. This is a considerable confirmation of not sympathizing with the Shandong man but echoing the small performer.

I don't believe that there is still such a situation in society now. The era of "using ears to see" has long passed. Can the progressive modern people really not distinguish between true and false?

### Oil Fields in Abyssinia

— Yu Fan

When Abyssinia was being coveted by invading countries in those years, King Selassie came up with an emergency plan: to sell the oil field mining rights within Abyssinia to American or British oil companies, hoping to cause international disputes, thereby deterring the invaders. This matter had a chance of success, but it was prohibited by the U.S. State Department, and Abyssinia was finally conquered by Italy. Now that the world is at peace and the territory has been restored, King Selassie has brought up the old matter again and has leased all the oil fields within 350,000 square miles of Abyssinian land to the American Sinclair Oil Company for mining. However, the treaty stipulates that the Sinclair Oil Company fully respects King Selassie's sacred sovereignty, and will set aside a portion of the profits for Abyssinia's public welfare in the future.

But in fact, until now, no oil fields have been discovered in Abyssinia.

### Stipulating Salary Standards for Shop Employees

— Jun Yi

Hoping the Social Bureau will implement it quickly

At present, the most impoverished of the salaried class are the employees of general stores, especially those ordinary commercial establishments that are not large in scale. Shop assistants, fearing that their rice bowls will be broken, simply listen to the arrangements of the capitalists, even if they want to speak out, they dare not. According to the author's investigation, to this day there are still many salaries calculated in counterfeit currency, with the most minimum being only 200,000 to 300,000 yuan in counterfeit currency per month. May I ask, in today's world of endlessly rising prices, this little money is not even enough for personal spending, let alone supporting a family! How can the Chang Bureau bear to turn a blind eye to this kind of unfair treatment?

Fortunately, the Social Bureau of our city has long been aware of this. After labor-capital disputes occurred repeatedly in various industrial and commercial establishments last month, it investigated the actual situation of employees' salaries and benefits, and hired experts to prepare pillow plans based on the cost of living index with rising prices, and stipulated the standard bottom number of employees' salaries and benefits, which were distributed to the industrial and commercial circles for discussion. If this measure can be implemented one day, it is indeed the most fair way to improve the treatment of shop employees. However, more than a month has passed, and there is still no definite news, which cannot help but make people wait expectantly! In addition to hoping that the bureau will implement it quickly, it is also hoped that after implementation, the capitalists must not regard it as a mere formality, and must abide by the regulations and implement them conscientiously, which is the most fair way.

### Investigating and Prosecuting Landlords for Mistreating Tenants

Editor: Since the outbreak of the war, until now, our situation has indeed been too much under the control of others! Without talking about big things, just take our second landlord as an example. He lives in three or four rooms for free, not only does he not spend a penny on the first landlord, but he also has a large surplus. Electricity and tap water, everything, he has never spent a penny, all of which are distributed among the third tenants. This time, the power company has increased the deposit again, and he is happy to distribute it to all the tenants, requiring each tenant to pay a deposit of 1,000 yuan. Our house has three upper floors and three lower floors, with a total of thirteen tenant families (excluding the second landlord), so besides himself, can't he earn another deposit of 13,000 yuan? (Omitted) I am submitting the various points of doubt to your column for instructions, in order to dispel the doubts of the masses. (1) Are the third tenants obliged to pay the water and electricity fees for the second landlord? (2) In addition to the legal profits, can the second landlord occupy a large house and make all the tenants bear the rent? (3) When the first landlord has increased the rent by several percent or several times in the past, the second landlord also increases the rent on each tenant by several percent or several times, and does not allow the percentage multiple added by the first landlord to be distributed, is this legal? (4) Who should bear the deposit for tap water, electricity, telephone, etc.? (5) If the tenants agree to pay this deposit for him, should they ask for receipts for the money paid? (6) If he insists on being strong and cannot be reasoned with, which agency should we appeal to? Please give instructions on each of the above points, and please publish a reply in the newspaper so that the residents of the city can follow. Sincerely, reader Zhang Fuming.

(Note) What Mr. Zhang said is indeed true. In the past, during the period when the enemy and puppets occupied us, second landlords oppressed third tenants, which was a common occurrence. At the same time, there were also third tenants who were unreasonable and did not keep their promises. In the future, I advocate that no matter the landlord or the tenant, they must abide by the law, respect each other, and not be unreasonable. Regarding the six points asked, here are brief answers: (1) There is no such obligation. (2) The second landlord only has legal profits and cannot make all the tenants bear the rent. (3) It should be distributed fairly. (4) The landlord should be asked to bear it. (5) You can ask for receipts. (6) You should appeal to the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental Management Committee.

### Enquiring About the Enlistment Period of the Security Corps

Editor: The Security Corps of this city recruited members, and after being admitted, it was announced in the newspaper that they would enlist, and it has been a month now, but there is no news at all. When asked, they said, "It will take another two weeks, the houses have not been selected, so there is no way to settle down," etc. I have gone to ask several times, but I have wasted my trips in vain, and I am a stranger in a foreign land, and I am currently temporarily living at my relatives' house. It has been more than a month, and I feel ashamed to bother my relatives. Moreover, my relatives are not wealthy, and the cost of living is rising day by day, and I really feel unable to bear the burden. I have always admired your newspaper as the voice of the people, speaking out for justice. I can publish it in the newspaper to ask the person in charge of the Security Corps and the relevant military and political authorities to reply immediately, then we will be infinitely grateful. Zhang Ying, Zhang Yi respectfully submitted.
