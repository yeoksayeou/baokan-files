### Marshall and Zhou Enlai Meet, Discussing a Truce in the Northeast

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd] Marshal Marshall's return to Chongqing five days ago has caused widespread anxiety among various parties. It is reported that Marshal Marshall and Mr. Zhou Enlai met on the morning of the 22nd. At 5:30 PM, Mr. Suthard, the chargé d'affaires of the American Embassy, ​​invited leaders of various parties to dinner at the American Embassy to introduce them to Marshal Marshall's wife. It is still difficult to predict when the three-person military team can start. However, the general belief is that Marshal Marshall's meeting with Zhou Enlai this time may reveal a glimmer of hope for the Northeast issue.

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco Broadcast: Communist representative Zhou Enlai met with Marshall today and reportedly made an unconditional ceasefire demand in the Northeast.

[United Press, Chongqing, 22nd] Special Envoy Marshall met with Chairman Chiang this afternoon. The content is unknown.

[United Press International, Chongqing, 22nd] Zhou Enlai, the Communist representative of the Military Three-Person Team, consulted with Special Envoy Marshall for two and a half hours today, explaining the Communist Party's position. It is reported that Marshall listened but did not comment. Although the content of Zhou Enlai's conversation with Marshall has not been disclosed, the Communist Party side indicates that this discussion is closely related to the Communist Party's recent assertion that the government must unconditionally cease conflict in the Northeast. Because the Communist Party now occupies a superior military strategic position, if the National Army attempts to seize its land by force, a bloody battle will inevitably ensue. Marshall also consulted with Vice Minister of Military and Political Affairs Yu Dawei this afternoon, and Yu agreed to cooperate fully.

[Another Dispatch] News reports: The situation is becoming more complex and serious due to the occupation of Changchun. However, it is believed that the talks between the government and Marshall will lead to a peaceful resolution. It is generally believed that the Communist Army will try to defend Changchun and develop natural resources within its ruling area for future use. Therefore, it is highly doubtful that the usual mediation efforts will succeed. After the occupation of Changchun, Marshall and General Gillon have gained a deep and new understanding of the Communist Party's political and military strategies. Therefore, it is expected that the conflict cessation method proposed by Marshall this time will be very different from previous agreements. It is also reported that Marshall already suspects a plan to resolve the Northeast incident, and it is expected that both sides will do their best to seize control of land before the ceasefire order is issued.

### Chairman Chiang's Address During Commemoration Week, Instructing on Matters Related to the Return to the Capital; First Batch of Diplomatic Corps Personnel Arrives in Nanjing from Chongqing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Whether the return to the capital and the convocation of the National Assembly can be realized as scheduled are the two major events currently attracting national attention. As of today, judging from various indications, it fully proves that the rumors circulating outside that the events will be delayed are unfounded. Hong Lanyou, the person in charge of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, stated publicly today that the committee has not made any instructions to slightly delay the preparatory work. On the contrary, his colleagues will add night shifts in the coming days, hoping to make the upcoming grand event as perfect as possible in terms of administrative affairs. Today, more than 20 representatives from as far away as Henan and Shaanxi arrived by special plane. Other representatives from various places have pre-announced their itineraries and will arrive in Nanjing one after another in the coming days. Dozens of workers are rushing to build wooden colored archways to the left and right of the National Assembly Hall of the National Government and opposite it, creating a magnificent scene. As for the schedule for the return to the capital, although the air transport plan has been slightly changed due to the Northeast war, it is expected that the five days from the 25th of this month to the end of the month will reach a climax. Chairman Chiang will receive a grand farewell from all sectors of the accompanying capital on the 24th and fly to Chengdu for one or two days, possibly returning to Nanjing at the end of the month.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] At the 9:00 AM Commemoration Week on the 22nd, after Chairman Chiang led the ceremony, Pu Xuefeng, the Deputy Director-General of the Executive Headquarters, reported on the recent work of the headquarters. Chairman Chiang gave instructions on matters related to the return to the capital: (1) For civil servants of various departments and commissions and their families who have special difficulties during the return to the capital, the supervisors should consider the situation and help them solve them and provide relief. (2) Currently, there is a lack of transportation. Supervisors should distinguish the priority of personnel and file transportation. Personnel and files that are not important to business can be left in Chongqing and transported to Beijing after water transportation is smooth. Finally, encourage all civil servants to return to Nanjing with the spirit of moving the capital to Chongqing eight years ago, to be worried and vigilant, and to work hard.

[Another Dispatch] Duan Xipeng, a member of the Central Standing Committee, flew from Chongqing to Beijing this morning to preside over the work of the Central Training Committee. Xue Dubi, chairman of the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan, also flew to Beijing at the same time. Most of the important personnel of the commission have already gone to Beijing, and the rest of the personnel can also return to the capital at the end of the month.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The first batch of diplomatic mission personnel returning to the capital arrived in the capital by plane from Chongqing at 2:30 PM on the 22nd. Among them were Ms. Fairbank, cultural specialist of the US Embassy, ​​Mr. Mel, second secretary, and five attendants. Mr. Codus, first secretary of the British Embassy, ​​and Mr. McKings, second secretary, and five others.

### Government Committee and National Assembly Representative Lists; Communist Party Still Refuses to Submit; Zhang Qun and Others Reply to Zhou Enlai Asking to Pay Attention to Responsibility

[United Press International, Chongqing, 22nd] The Communist Party officially announced today that they had requested four ministerial positions in the reorganized Executive Yuan and ten seats on the National Government Committee, so that together with the votes of the Democratic League, they would obtain a veto. The announcement pointed out that the Communist Party cannot publish the list of government and National Assembly representatives until various issues such as the cessation of conflict in the Northeast and whether the government accepts the above-mentioned number of seats are resolved. According to the Communist Party, the representatives participating in the government have been selected, but if issues such as political freedom and the implementation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference are not resolved, Yan'an does not intend to submit the list of representatives. A spokesperson said: If the issues are resolved, the National Assembly representatives sent by the Communist Party can still arrive in Nanjing before May 5th. The date of the Communist personnel's move to Beijing is uncertain, but "if Chairman Chiang and General Marshall move to Nanjing, Zhou Enlai must also go to Beijing for work."

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Zhou Enlai wrote to government representatives Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, and Zhang Lisheng on the 21st, and attached a statement from the Chinese Communist Party representative, stating that they cannot consider candidates to participate in the National Government and submit a list of National Assembly representatives at this time. Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, and Zhang Lisheng immediately replied in a letter. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Mr. Enlai, greetings. Yesterday, we received your letter of April 21 and the attached statement from your party delegation. We have already forwarded it to Mr. Zhe Sheng (Sun Ke), Tie Cheng (Wu Tiecheng), Liang Hao (Wang Chonghui), Xue Ting (Wang Shijie), and Li Fu (Chen Lifu). Our unanimous opinion is that at this time, we should still make our best efforts to ensure the success of the Political Consultative Conference agreement. We do not want to argue about the points in the statement of your party delegation that do not match the facts. The date for the convocation of the National Assembly agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference is extremely imminent. We are willing to make our final efforts, and we sincerely hope that you will act with the greatest sense of responsibility and immediately disclose the list of representatives so that the National Assembly can be convened as scheduled. If the meeting is delayed as a result, the responsibility will be assigned. Sincerely, may you be well."

### Chen Bi-jun Sentenced to Life Imprisonment, Chu Min-yi Sentenced to Death: Suzhou High Court Announced Verdict Yesterday Afternoon

[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Suzhou, 22nd] At 3 PM on the 22nd, the Suzhou High Court announced the verdict in the treason case of Chu Min-yi. Presiding Judge Sun Honglin, Chief Justice Shi Meiyu, Justice Lu Jiarui, Prosecutor Wei Weiqing, and Clerk Zhu Wuqiu ascended the bench. Chu Min-yi was brought to the court. After the presiding judge inquired about his name, he stood up and, in a very solemn tone, read the main text of the judgment: "1. Chu Min-yi, in collusion with an enemy country, plotted to resist this country, and is sentenced to death, with perpetual deprivation of civil rights, and all his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, shall be confiscated." The presiding judge then read the reasons for the judgment aloud. Upon hearing the verdict, Chu Min-yi's face turned pale, his lips trembled, and he appeared to be痉挛 (spasmodic). He repeatedly attempted to express his feelings about being sentenced to death, but was prevented by the court. At 3:04 PM, Chu Min-yi was led away. The court then summoned Chen Bi-jun to the court. Presiding Judge Sun Honglin again read the main text of the judgment, which was identical to Chu's case except that Chen was sentenced to life imprisonment. Although Chen had appeared very assertive during the trial, at this moment, tears welled up in her eyes, and she frequently wiped them with a handkerchief. The court informed both convicts that if they were not satisfied with the judgment, they could apply for a retrial within ten days. However, even if the defendants did not wish to request a retrial, the High Court was legally obligated to apply to the Supreme Court for a retrial. When Chu heard the verdict, he forcibly composed himself and said, "I am very satisfied. I said during the last trial that I was ready to die, and now my wish has been fulfilled. Those outside who hoped for strict punishment of traitors can now also be satisfied. The prosecutor has achieved his goal and is probably also satisfied." The court sternly rebuked him, stating, "This court sentenced you to death not because of your own request, nor based on public opinion, but based on your actions." Chu Min-yi continued to chatter on, so the presiding judge angrily said, "The court's time is not for the defendant to use arbitrarily. If you have any reasons for dissatisfaction, you can submit them in writing." Chu Min-yi then remained silent and was led away. After Chen stated that she was not satisfied when asked by the presiding judge "Are you satisfied," she replied with tears in her eyes: "Of course I am not satisfied, but I will not appeal." The presiding judge then said, "It's not an appeal, it's an application for a retrial. It's good that you expressed disagreement, and you can write down the reasons." At this point, Chen gradually regained her old assertive demeanor and replied, "There's no need to write it down. It's the same anyway. A revolutionary naturally has too many opportunities to die." She finished speaking and was led away. The time was 3:25 PM. (The original text of both judgments is published on page 2.)

From 1 PM, the Suzhou High Court inside and outside was already crowded with spectators, with far more women than men, which surprised reporters. At 2:45 PM, the High Court issued an order, and the Suzhou Police Chief led three bailiffs, with a carriage, to the detention center. On the way, the crowd was as thick as a wall. Chen was wearing a blue cloth qipao, tea-colored crystal glasses, black shoes, and gray socks. Chu was wearing a chestnut-colored silk jacket, meticulously ironed, black leather shoes, and was carrying a file folder. The two convicts walked out of the detention center shoulder to shoulder. When they reached the carriage, they were mutually modest, and as a result, Chen boarded the car first. After arriving at the High Court, the bailiffs ordered Chu into the No. 4 Criminal Waiting Room and Chen into the No. 5 Waiting Room to rest for a while. Each was given a cup of plain water. Chu appeared timid and uneasy, while Chen had a resentful expression. Yesterday, the order of the court was much improved due to the effective command of Secretary-General Yang, but the Central Film Studio did not come to film.

When Chu was taken out of the court, he distributed several copies of his "Thoughts After the Verdict," which were written on carbon copy paper, to the reporters. He personally signed his name in ink at the end of the document, but the wording was absurd and vulgar, and most reporters discarded them.

After the court session, the reporter visited High Court President Sun Honglin regarding Chen Bi-jun's (Li Jianzhuang, wife of Gong Bo, wrote Chen's "Request for Retrial," in which she raised new facts) and inquired whether it was necessary to summon witnesses again. President Sun replied, "According to the law, new evidence cannot be presented during the third trial." He also said that the possible actions of the Supreme Court after the request for retrial are as follows: (1) Approve the original judgment and submit the case to the Judicial Administration Department for further review, and after confirmation, the execution will be scheduled. (2) Return the case to the original court for a retrial. (3) Transfer the case to Nanjing for a retrial. Because President Sun was the Chief Prosecutor of the Suzhou High Court who handled the "Seven Gentlemen" case of Shen Junru and others in his younger years, the reporter mentioned the old events, President Sun could not help but become colored and said: "They weren't happy with me back then, and now when I look at it, how could I have let them go back then?"

Chief Justice Shi Meiyu personally supervised the printing of the judgments of Chu and Chen, carefully proofreading and being extremely cautious. He told reporters that he would be going to Beijing in two or three days because he also serves as the Chief Justice of the Beijing Military Tribunal. There are twenty-five Japanese war criminals in Nanjing who will be awaiting him to preside over the trial. The judgments of the three major traitors in this trial of the Suzhou High Court were all drafted by Shi, who worked diligently day and night and appeared slightly thin, but remained energetic, talking and laughing happily. He said: The uniforms of the judges of the Military Tribunal will be military uniforms with swords, which are different from ordinary judges. He was originally in Shanghai before the incident, and then went to Tunxi after the war, so he still cannot forget the fine wine of Tunxi.

### Obstacles to the Restoration of Traffic in Shandong Province: Repair Work Stalled Again; An Ding Attacked, Tianjin-Pukou Train Service Interrupted

[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Jinan, 22nd] Since the 20th, the repair work on all railway lines in Shandong Province has been completely halted again. The Communist army stated that it had received orders from above not to continue repairing forward.

[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Nanjing, 22nd] It is reported that the Military Three-Person Committee meeting will be reopened soon, and the restoration of traffic will be listed as the main topic. Recently, the restoration of traffic on the Jinpu, Jiaoji, and Longhai trunk lines has been very slow, because while they are being repaired, they are also being destroyed by the Communist army. Currently, the total length of restored sections on these three trunk lines is less than 100 kilometers. According to people from Shanxi, the mediation work in Shanxi is doubtful due to the lack of sincerity of the Communist Party, and the restoration of traffic is nowhere in sight.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st] The Military Mediation Executive Department Qinxian Team arrived in Qin from Bing on the evening of the 19th, and agreed to restore the Qin (County) Jin (City) light railway on the 20th.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 22nd] Several hundred Communist soldiers suddenly attacked the area of Sanhuali near Anding Station on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line at 11:15 AM today. The gunfire was dense for a time. One artillery shell landed inside Anding Station. All Tianjin-Pukou trains were suspended. The Communist soldiers retreated by 1 PM, and traffic resumed.

### Judgment of Chu Min-yi

Criminal Judgment No. 408 of the Jiangsu High Court, Special Character of the 35th Year

Prosecutor: This Court's Prosecutor.

Defendant: Chu Min-yi, male, 64 years old, from Wuxing, Zhejiang Province, Ji'nantao Town.

Designated Defender: Gao Rong, Public Defender of Wu County.

Regarding the defendant's case of treason, the prosecutor of this court filed a lawsuit, and this court ruled as follows:

Main Text: Chu Min-yi, in collusion with an enemy country, plotted to resist this country, and is sentenced to death, with perpetual deprivation of civil rights. All property is confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family.

Facts: Chu Min-yi was a close relative of Wang Jingwei, and originally served as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he took refuge in Shanghai. Later, in the summer of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], Wang arrived in Shanghai and secretly conspired with the Japanese to negotiate peace, and convened the Sixth National Congress of the puppet Kuomintang. Chu Min-yi immediately participated, serving as the Secretary-General of the puppet Central Party Headquarters, a member of the Central Executive Committee, and a member of the Supervisory Committee. He followed Wang in running between Nanjing and Qingdao, discussing the reorganization of the puppet "United Reform" and "Provisional" governments. After an agreement was reached, the puppet National Government was established in Nanjing on March 10, 29th year of the Republic [1940]. Wang served as the puppet chairman and puppet premier, and Chu Min-yi served as the puppet deputy premier and puppet foreign minister, and presided over the relocation of the puppet government. Also, in May of the same year, as the puppet deputy envoy, he accompanied Chen Gongbo to Japan to return the courtesy, and then concluded the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty with the Japanese, allowing the Japanese to station troops in Mengjiang and North China, and station a fleet in China's territorial waters, and implement economic cooperation. At the same time, he issued a joint Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo declaration, recognizing Manchukuo, in order to destroy China's territorial integrity. In February of the following year, he was transferred to serve as the puppet ambassador to Japan, liaising with the Axis countries to recognize the puppet government. In September, he returned to China and continued to serve as the puppet foreign minister. After the puppet government declared war on Britain and the United States in the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he again concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with the Japanese, and accompanied Wang to Tokyo to participate in the Greater East Asia Conference. He repeatedly used fallacies to promote the destruction of Britain and the United States and the elimination of the Central Government. In July of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], he served as the puppet governor of Guangdong Province, the puppet commander of the Guangdong Provincial Security Forces, and the puppet pacification director of Guangzhou. Shortly after, the Japanese surrendered. Then he was detained by the Military Affairs Commission's Investigation and Statistics Bureau, and transferred by the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army to the prosecutor of this court for investigation and prosecution.

Reasons: The defendant in this case, Chu Min-yi, jointly organized the puppet National Government with Wang Jingwei, serving in various important party and government positions, and accompanied Chen Gongbo to Japan to return the courtesy. During his tenure as the puppet ambassador to Japan, he liaised with the Axis to recognize the puppet government, and later accompanied Wang to the east to participate in the Greater East Asia Conference. Also, during his tenure as the puppet foreign minister, he concluded the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with the Japanese, issued the joint Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo declaration, and declared war on our Allied countries of Britain and the United States, expressing his intention to live and die with the Japanese. Finally, he served as the puppet governor of Guangdong Province and other positions, which he himself has admitted without denying. This is consistent with his "Self-Description of Participating in the Peace Movement" and the confessions of accomplices Chen Gongbo and Chen Fengjun in another case. There are also the seized appointment certificates of the puppet National Government, the "Joint Declaration of the Greater East Asia Conference," and the "Record of the Puppet National Government's Delegation to Japan to Return Courtesy," "The Theory and Implementation of the Political Program of the Puppet National Government," "The Conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Treaty and the Greater East Asia War," and "Domestic News Clipping Books," which can be used as evidence. His traitorous acts of colluding with the enemy are extremely clear. He should be charged with the crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors. Although he argued: "The puppet government resisted Japan peacefully, and the armed resistance of Chongqing was a division of labor, with different routes but the same destination. The territory in which it exercised puppet power was taken from the hands of the Japanese, originally hoping to rescue the people and preserve vitality, and prepare to seize the opportunity to counterattack, in order to coordinate. How can it be said to be treason? As for the Japanese concluding treaties, issuing declarations, and declaring war on Britain and the United States, they were all signed by Wang, and the defendant did not co-sign them, nor is he responsible. Moreover, during the relocation of the puppet government, he worked hard to build and restore prosperity, and also negotiated the recovery of the British and American concessions, which was not without merit." However, after investigation, (1) the defendant consistently advocated uniting with the Japanese to destroy the Central Government. This is evident from the defendant's broadcasts "Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the Relocation of the Puppet Government" and "Reviewing and Understanding 918," recorded on enemy records, and the defendant's words recorded on page 21 of "The Conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Treaty and the Greater East Asia War" compiled and printed by the puppet Propaganda Department. Moreover, the resolution of the puppet Central Political Conference in which the defendant participated also contained the record that "All internal and external government orders, treaties, agreements, and contracts of Chongqing are invalid." Later, as the puppet ambassador to Japan, he colluded with the Axis, recognizing the puppet government, hoping to deprive the National Government of its international status. This is enough to show his deliberate efforts to stand against the Central Government. Now, to say that it is a division of labor is obviously contradictory. As for the suggestion of coordinating with the National Army at the opportune moment, it is a mere empty promise, and it is difficult to believe. Moreover, even if the Japanese were making a final struggle before their collapse, if the defendant and the puppet government personnel had indeed prepared to break away from their bonds to show their inclination towards the Central Government, it would be a clear sign that they saw the general trend was gone, hoping to preserve themselves, and it cannot be used as favorable proof for them. (2) At the beginning of the war, the enemy's forces were fierce, and our army shifted its position for strategic reasons, and adopted a war of attrition to resist the Japanese attempt to fight a quick battle and win a quick victory. Therefore, in the occupied areas, troops were still deployed, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack, and local governments at all levels also remained on the border, enforcing government orders, originally hoping to recover lost territory and appease the people, with absolutely no intention of abandoning them. However, the Japanese, because the occupied area was too large and difficult to control, used the defendant and Wang to organize the puppet government for their own purposes, causing the National Army to be unable to operate, the Central Government's orders to be unable to be implemented, and the Japanese forces to become increasingly stable, carrying out searches and looting, plunging the people into misery. Tracing the origin of the disaster, the puppet government is responsible. The so-called rescuing the people and preserving vitality is a deceitful talk. (3) The conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the issuance of the joint Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo declaration, and the declaration of war on Britain and the United States, were all done during the defendant's tenure as the puppet foreign minister. That is, the defendant also participated in the pre-event deliberations, and Wang handed all the treaty declarations to the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs for processing. Therefore, the defendant, occupying a leading position in this important diplomatic event, should bear joint responsibility. How can he only use Wang's signature and publication as a reason for exemption from responsibility? As for completing the task of relocating the puppet government and negotiating the recovery of the concessions of various countries, they all relied on the power of the Japanese and usurped the authority of the Central Government. This kind of behavior has already constituted a crime, so how can it be used to claim credit? In summary, all kinds of defenses are nothing more than attempts to avoid the issue, and are not sufficient to be adopted. According to the defendant, he was originally a member of the Kuomintang and held an important position in the Central Government, but at a time when the enemy army penetrated deeply and the war was urgent, he did not know how to work together to save the situation, but instead echoed Wang, betrayed the Central Government, and destroyed the anti-Japanese grand plan, which almost shook the foundation of the country. He was indeed willing to take risks, and his crime was unforgivable. Therefore, the extreme penalty is imposed to maintain discipline. All property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, is confiscated. Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Regulations on Criminal Cases, the preceding paragraph of Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1, Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, Article 9 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors, Article 1 of the Temporary Law on Increased Punishment for Criminal Party Members, the preceding paragraph of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, Article 28, Article 64, Paragraph 1, Article 65, Paragraph 1, Article 57, and Article 37, Paragraph 1, judgment is made as in the main text. This case was executed by Prosecutor Han Tao of this court. April 22, 35th year of the Republic of China [1946], Criminal First Division of the Jiangsu High Court, Presiding Judge Sun Honglin.

### Judgment of Chen Bi-jun

Criminal Judgment No. 410 of the Jiangsu High Court, Special Character of the 35th Year

Prosecutor: This Court's Prosecutor. Defendant: Chen Bi-jun, female, 56 years old, from Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, residing at No. 30 Fazheng Road, Guangzhou. Public Defender Gao Rong, Public Defender of Wu County. Regarding the defendant's case of treason, the prosecutor of this court filed a lawsuit, and this court ruled as follows:

Main Text: Chen Bi-jun, in collusion with an enemy country, plotted to resist this country, and is sentenced to life imprisonment, with perpetual deprivation of civil rights. All property is confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family.

Facts: Chen Bi-jun is the wife of Wang Jingwei, and originally served as a member of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Wang was used by the enemy chieftain Konoe Fumimaro to secretly negotiate peace, and Chen Bi-jun participated in the deliberations. Then she followed Wang from Chongqing to Hanoi, Vietnam, where Wang issued a pro-peace telegram. Then she went to Shanghai to negotiate a basic plan for peace with the Japanese. On March 30 of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], she organized the puppet National Government in Nanjing. Wang served as the puppet chairman, and Chen Bi-jun served as a member of the puppet Central Party Headquarters Supervisory Committee and a member of the puppet Central Political Committee, and guided the affairs of the puppet party, government, and military in the southwest provinces. At the same time, under the command of Japanese Yasaki Sakai and others, she and her brother, Chen Yaozu, the puppet governor of Guangdong Province, handled Guangdong's affairs. Until Japan surrendered, she began to resign from her position. Detained by the Military Affairs Commission's Investigation and Statistics Bureau, she was transferred to the prosecutor of this court for investigation and prosecution.

Reasons: Regarding the defendant in this case, Chen Bi-jun, having participated in the secret peace negotiations of her husband Wang Jingwei with the Japanese, and after the establishment of the National Government, having held important positions in the party and government and guided the affairs of the puppet party, government, and military in the southwest provinces, she has admitted without denying this in this court and during the investigation. This is consistent with the statements of Chen Gongbo, Chu Min-yi, and other traitors in another case. There is also the special dispatch issued by Wang, which was seized, and the identity card issued by the enemy's special service agency and the puppet Guangdong Provincial Government as evidence. The fact that she handled provincial affairs in Guangdong under the will of Japanese Yasaki Sakai and others, together with Chen Yaozu, is also proven by the telegrams in which Chen Yaozu used the code names "Cliff" and "Hua" to report and request instructions from the defendant. It is certain that her collusion with an enemy country and plotting to resist this country is well-documented and beyond doubt. Although it was argued that Wang initially supported the war of resistance, he later believed that the time for peace had arrived, and he still had the original aspirations of saving the country and the people, and resolutely advocated peace. After the suggestion to the Central Government was ineffective, he left Chongqing and repeatedly discussed with the Japanese to establish another regime to promote comprehensive peace. His mission was more complex and arduous than the war of resistance, and it was parallel to the Central Government's strategy and did not contradict it. At that time, the people in the occupied areas were suffering deeply, and the Central Government was unable to maintain them. The defendant and Wang could not bear to sit idly by and organized the puppet government to rescue them. How can it be said to be colluding with the enemy and betraying the country?" However, after investigating, Wang, at the beginning of the war of resistance, saw that the National Army had suffered setbacks, and his will was suddenly shaken. He did not obtain the consent of the Central Government and agreed to negotiate peace with the Japanese chieftain. He did not hesitate to bow his head to the captives and accept conditions that humiliated the country and deprived it of its power. He also willingly accepted the support of the Japanese to organize the puppet government, forming a situation of confrontation with the Central Government. Its impact on the people's psychology and international observers was profound and great. The resolution of the puppet Central Political Conference on March 22 of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], in addition to declaring that the internal and external government orders and treaties of Chongqing were invalid, also called on all troops to cease fire and await orders, and civil servants to report to Beijing. This is recorded in the book "The Theory and Implementation of the Political Program of the National Government" in the Chen Gongbo case. Its purpose was to obstruct the war of resistance and subvert the government, which is even more obvious. The defendant did not dissuade Wang from his absurd actions, but instead supported him, causing him to be deluded and act arbitrarily, willing to sacrifice great principles and lose national rights to suppress his desire for leadership. Now, to say that Wang's advocacy of peace was also aimed at saving the country and did not hinder the Central Government's policy of resisting Japan is clearly self-deception. Moreover, the Central Government cared for the people in the occupied areas and had local governments at all levels stationed there, implementing government orders under the coordination of the army to carry out rescue work to alleviate the suffering. If Wang and others were not used by the Japanese to implement Qingxiang blockades and obstruct them in various ways, the people's difficulties could have been slightly alleviated. Without planning, the puppet government acted as a tool for the Japanese, facilitating the Japanese control of resources and the looting of wealth, leading to the decline of the people's livelihood, which was even worse than hanging upside down. The so-called purpose of organizing the puppet government was to rescue the people in the occupied areas, which is difficult to justify. Based on what she did, she should be charged with the crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors. However, according to the defendant, she and Wang are husband and wife, and she was caught in the web because she echoed his advocacy, which is different from ordinary situations. As for the fact that the defendant presided over the southwest puppet special agents as stated in the indictment, she repeatedly denied it when questioned by the defendant, and the reports of the puppet special agents Liao Gongshao and others that were seized were marked as being submitted to the puppet Central Executive Committee, which is inconsistent with the defendant's title of puppet Supervisory Committee, so it cannot be proven that the defendant participated in the southwest puppet special agents. Therefore, within the scope of the statutory penalty, it is measured as a sentence. All property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, should be confiscated.

Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Regulations on Criminal Cases, the preceding paragraph of Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1, Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, Article 9 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors, Article 1 of the Temporary Law on Increased Punishment for Criminal Party Members, the preceding paragraph of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, Article 28, Article 64, Paragraph 1, Article 65, Paragraph 1, Article 57, and Article 37, Paragraph 1, judgment is made as in the main text.

This case was executed by Prosecutor Wei Weiqing of this court.

April 22, 35th year of the Republic of China [1946], Criminal First Division of the Jiangsu High Court, Presiding Judges Sun Honglin, Judges Shi Meiyu and Lu Jiarui.

Editorial

### New Prospects for Sino-French Relations

In recent days, General Yu An, Chief of the French General Staff, leading the French delegation to China, and Ambassador Merillon and his wife, have flown from the wartime capital to Beiping. After a short stay, they will come south to Nanjing and Shanghai. In Chongqing, General Yu An, in his capacity as a special envoy to China, also presented President Chiang with the French Oak Leaf War Cross on behalf of French President Gouin. As the domestic and international situations become increasingly serious, we must not ignore these activities aimed at strengthening Sino-French relations. Originally, since Ambassador Merillon took office and the new Sino-French agreements were signed, relations between China and France have been built on a new cornerstone, characterized by equality, trust, and love. All past unpleasant shadows have vanished with the new agreements; and at this time, after the new Sino-French agreements, the French government has specially sent a figure like General Yu An to visit China. We fully understand the efforts of the French government to enhance Sino-French relations.

Both China and France have suffered equally significant and profound wounds in this war against the Axis powers and against aggression. China resisted the violent Japanese for the longest time, and vast areas were once occupied by the enemy. Thanks to the wise leadership of our Chairman Chiang, the enemy finally knelt and surrendered. Similarly, a group of French patriots, unwilling to accept enemy puppet rule, either actively participated in the anti-Axis war overseas under General de Gaulle's banner, or launched a large-scale anti-Nazi campaign in the country to uphold and promote the national integrity of France. In World War II, China and France had each made their best efforts and earned a glorious position. The past friendship between China and France has always been close, although there have been some unpleasant events, such as the recent "Pei Er Ding" (Paulding) incident. However, due to the French side's sincerity in resolving the incident, and the traditional spirit of loyalty and forbearance of the Chinese government and people, not wanting to escalate the situation, a peaceful resolution was quickly reached. China has no territorial ambitions in Southeast Asia, as our Chairman Chiang has long declared to the world. In the past, due to the Allied war effort, the Japanese surrendered, and we sent troops to northern Vietnam to handle the surrender and takeover of Japanese troops. This time, with the new Sino-French agreements, we will transfer northern Vietnam to the French military for defense, which shows that China has absolutely no political ambitions in Vietnam. All of this is sufficient to demonstrate the traditional friendship between China and France.

Today, although World War II has ended, to be honest, the international situation still seems to require our joint efforts to maintain world peace. Mankind has not yet awakened and freed itself from the suffering of war, and some people still vainly hope to dominate the world with hegemonic tactics. In this post-war world, China and France are in the same position. Just look at Eastern Europe, from Finland, Poland, Romania all the way to the Mediterranean, which was once an appendage of the Nazis. Is it not now becoming a new bulwark? Germany and Italy have been defeated. Is not France the only strong fortress of Western civilization and democracy left on the entire European continent, apart from the vast country of the Soviet Union? France, therefore, bears a more important mission in today's Europe. How to prevent the entire Europe from being destroyed by power politics is the responsibility of every citizen of the Fourth Republic. Every Frenchman has a duty to continue to promote the glorious tradition of the French Revolution. In today's rampant collectivism, Frenchmen, in particular, have the mission to rise up and defend "Liberty," "Equality," and "Fraternity." The situation is similar in China. Many of the Three Principles of the People of the revolution were influenced by the French Revolution. China and France have somewhat similar national ideals and share the same mission of defending "Liberty," "Equality," and "Fraternity" in this post-war world. In this situation, China and France need to join hands more closely to maintain lasting world peace.

The interests of China and France are the same. In the current turbulent international situation, China and France are in the same position. Having suffered great pain and deep wounds, only China and France need a stable international order to engage in post-war reconstruction. As mentioned above, we have no territorial ambitions, but we are closely concerned about the welfare of Vietnam, which is a brotherly nation to us, and we are deeply attached to them like siblings. We do not need to point out the past relationship between China and Vietnam. However, we must appeal for the future of the Vietnamese people. The colonial policies that France pursued in Vietnam in the past have indeed left regrettable marks on France's glory. We only need to look at the situation in other colonies in Southeast Asia to know how undesirable France's rule in Vietnam was. This war was not fought to maintain colonial empires, and the post-war world is not simply a return to the old ways. France should do its best to realize the national aspirations of the Vietnamese people. It may not be permissible to talk about independence now because of the circumstances, but in any case, the Vietnamese people's desire for autonomy should be satisfied as much as possible. This is also something that France itself should do. Even Britain knows to change its policy towards India, let alone the French who love "Liberty," "Equality," and "Fraternity," who should have no reason to discriminate against the Vietnamese people. Because General Yu An will visit Vietnam after his visit to China, we will briefly state our feelings about the situation in Vietnam.

China's nation-building emphasizes benevolence, righteousness, trustworthiness, and peace. We express our sincere welcome to General Yu An's visit to China. We wish General Yu An a safe journey and that Sino-French relations will become increasingly close!

Changzhou: County Expenses Fall Short, Borrowing Funds from Merchants

The administrative expenses of Wujin County have long been tight due to the shortfall in tax revenue. Although efforts have been made to economize according to the county government's budget for the fourth, fifth, and sixth months of this year, 50 million yuan is still needed. Considering the county's five taxes, the revenue for these three months is estimated to be only 34 to 35 million yuan, falling short of the required expenses by 15 to 16 million yuan. County Chief Sun had previously proposed a relief plan to the County Provisional Consultative Council, which was resolved to borrow funds from various industries to supplement the budget.

The National Army garrisoning the port, which consisted of only one company, and two teams of the county police force, resisted as much as possible, but were ultimately overwhelmed by the disparity in numbers, and nearly the entire army was wiped out. Xingang was then lost. In this battle, the Communist troops suffered 2,000 casualties. Including the National Army and local people, the total casualties were over 6,000. Houses were destroyed by gunfire and arson by the Communist troops. Only a few broken tiles and remnants remain. The Communist troops, resenting the people's welcome of the National Army, looted everywhere after the National Army withdrew. Upon hearing the news, the city defense shook and declared a special curfew. The city gates were tightly closed, and traffic was prohibited.

### The Hitherto Cabinet Resigns after Half a Year of No Achievements. The Three-Party Association Forms a Coalition Government. The Japanese Emperor Scheduled to Greet MacArthur for the Second Time This Morning

[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 22nd Dispatch] According to reliable news from the Japanese Imperial Household: Emperor Hirohito of Japan will visit MacArthur at the US Embassy at 11 o'clock tomorrow morning. This will be the Emperor's second visit to MacArthur, the first being on September 24th of last year. It is heard that the Emperor will discuss the situation after the resignation of the Shidehara Cabinet with MacArthur. Following the recent election, Japanese newspapers and political parties (except the Progressive Party) have unanimously attacked Shidehara, which has made the fall of the Shidehara Cabinet inevitable.

[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] Japanese Prime Minister Shidehara presented his cabinet's resignation to the Emperor at 5:30 PM (Tokyo time) today. Emperor Hirohito has accepted the resignation of the Shidehara Cabinet, but according to convention, he has ordered Shidehara to remain temporarily in office until a new cabinet is formed. In the six months since the establishment of the Shidehara Cabinet, it has been under constant attack for failing to solve the food and other livelihood issues of the people. In addition, there has been growing dissatisfaction with the Shidehara Cabinet's "lack of achievements," which is likely the main reason for the resignation. According to well-informed sources, the Emperor will not interfere in the selection of the new Prime Minister. It is expected that Shidehara will consult with Jiyuto party (Liberal) leader Hatoyama and Socialist Party leader Katayama, in his capacity as leader of the Progressive Party, but only after obtaining the consent of Hatoyama and Katayama. Most people believe that Shidehara may agree to form a coalition cabinet. It is generally speculated that the Jiyuto party will occupy four seats in the new cabinet, and the Progressive Party and the Socialist Party will each occupy three seats. However, Hatoyama is still under investigation by MacArthur's headquarters and the Japanese government due to suspicions of extreme nationalism. Therefore, many believe that the occupying authorities will not allow him to serve as the leader of Japan.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 22nd] Less than two weeks after the Japanese general election, the Shidehara Cabinet formally announced its resignation at 6:30 PM tonight. Chief Cabinet Secretary Kōtarō Narakashi read a statement to the press, stating: The Cabinet has resigned to help stabilize the political situation and to solve the important problems facing the country. The statement pointed out that the Cabinet has completed its task in conducting fair and impartial elections. The Cabinet respects the establishment of a democratic government based on public opinion. As for the reason for resigning immediately after the election, it is because the situation at the time was complex, and no political party had obtained more than one-third of the seats in the parliament.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd Dispatch] It is generally speculated that Shidehara may nominate Yukio Ozaki as his successor, but it is believed that this 88-year-old politician may not be able to handle the job due to his physical strength. Under the current circumstances, who serves as Prime Minister is not important. What is important is that certain measures must be implemented to ensure stable cooperation among the recently elected political parties.

### MacArthur Orders Japan to Report on Property Seized in Wars of Aggression and Forbids Movement or Transfer. The American People Support the Purge Program

[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] The Civilian Property Custody Committee today ordered the Japanese government to notify the entire country to list all the property looted in the occupied areas in the past nine years and submit it to the United Nations Command before June 1st. All property must be properly kept and not transferred or moved in any way, or else punishment will be imposed. The report must list the property items, the names of the owners, the circumstances of the disposition after reaching Japan, and the current nominal holders and locations.

[United Press, San Francisco, 21st] The San Francisco Chronicle editorialized today that the American people will support MacArthur's decision to automatically carry out his political purge program in Japan, even though the Soviet representative on the Allied Council for Japan opposes it. The relationship between the Allied Council for Japan and MacArthur is like that of a cabinet to the US President. MacArthur's rank as Supreme Commander of the United Nations and the special powers granted to him as a soldier are unprecedented. The United Nations Committee is an advisory body and can make suggestions to MacArthur regarding the conduct of the program, which is valuable. However, neither the committee nor any of its representatives has the right to tell MacArthur what to do or what not to do. MacArthur's ability to respect this relationship is extremely fair, and he can continue to implement his sound and firm policies in Japan.

### The Japanese Use Soybeans to Propel Warships and Aircraft

[Associated Press, Honolulu, 22nd] The US Naval Technical Investigation Group reported yesterday on the results of its investigation into Japanese wartime technological research over the past seven months.

### Japanese Teachers Dismissed for Holding Anti-Democratic Ideas

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 22nd] It was announced that Kazumaru, a teacher at Nagasaki Middle School, a retired Japanese naval officer, has been banned from teaching by the United Nations Command for declaring democracy a "sin" to his students. The teacher told his students, "I would rather be hanged than give up my imperialist and militarist ideas. So-called democracy is just to destroy Japan by surrender or starvation."

### A New Shangri-La Discovered on Sakhalin Island, south of Nanjing. The "Lost Island" Russians Know Nothing of the Last Half-Century.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 22nd] The Red Army discovered a "Lost Island" inhabited by 97 Russians when they occupied southern Sakhalin Island. Reporter Orton of the Aid to Soviet News reported: "They look very much like Russians from half a century ago and know nothing about any of the changes in the country. Since moving to Sakhalin Island in the previous century, they have continued to live in the manner inherited from their ancestors."

### The US To Hold Dangerous Military Trials Regularly at the Mouth of the Panama Canal

[Associated Press, Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, 21st] The US Army Panama Canal Department announced today that dangerous military trials will be held starting April 30th on San Jose Island, about 50 miles from the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal. The nature of the trials has not been specified. During the trial period, no people or ships may travel within three miles of the island.

### Bevinus Will Fly to France Today to Attend the Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting. The British and Soviet Foreign Ministers Arrive Before the Meeting. France will assume the role of mediator at the meeting.

[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 22nd broadcast: US Secretary of State Bevinus is scheduled to fly to Paris tomorrow morning. Molotov and the British Foreign Minister are also expected to arrive before Sunday to attend the Foreign Ministers' meeting.

[Associated Press, Paris, 21st] French authorities pointed out today: France will assume the role of mediator between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to break the current deadlock when the four foreign ministers' meeting opens in Paris on Thursday. The meeting is intended to form an agreement on peace treaties with Italy and other Axis satellite countries, and may also draft a broad plan for the future status of the Rhineland, the Ruhr, and German administrative matters.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] A New York Times reporter said: The London Council of Foreign Ministers has completely failed because the Soviet representative, Gusev, was not a real negotiator. The success or failure of the Paris Foreign Ministers' meeting will depend on whether Molotov brings new proposals and whether he has a flexible deadline.

### US To Propose Negotiations on Aviation Agreements to the Soviet Union

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] A senior US government official told the Associated Press today that the United States will soon propose to the Soviet Union that negotiations begin to establish a commercial aviation agreement.

### British Labour Party Chairman Laski's Talk; New American-Made Atomic Bomb; Terrifying Power; One Can Destroy Two Major American States; The American Side Believes This is Absurd

[United Press International, Brighton, England, 21st] British Labour Party Chairman Professor Laski said at a meeting today that the new American-made atomic bomb is more powerful than the one dropped in Japan. One bomb can destroy the two major states of Indiana and Illinois, and five bombs can destroy all of America south of the Mason-Dixon Line. Professor Laski criticized the policy of keeping the development of atomic energy secret, calling it an "attack on human security." It is said: "I hope that we will mobilize all our forces to end the illegal application of this secret policy. This policy threatens to poison every channel of our international relations." When Laski was at home tonight, someone asked about the source of his knowledge of the atomic bomb. He refused to answer and only said that it came from "Americans." He learned of this new bomb during a recent visit to the United States.

[United Press International, Washington, 21st] Atomic bomb experts here expressed dissatisfaction with Professor Laski's remarks. Although Professor Laski's opposition to keeping the development of atomic energy secret is roughly similar to what some American scientists advocate, it cannot gain much official sympathy. People familiar with atomic bombs were surprised by the destructive power of the atomic bomb as described by Laski. As far as is known, the atomic bomb made according to the Manhattan Diagram has not changed much in style compared to the one used to bomb Nagasaki. Some scientists estimate that the effectiveness of this bomb is about 25% more effective than the one that bombed Hiroshima. The official announcement is that the strength of this bomb is equivalent to 20,000 tons of explosives. However, when the efficiency reaches 20,000 times, the actual destructive effect is much lower, or equivalent to 100 to 300 times. Based on this deduction, the current experimental work is more focused on improving the performance of existing bombs than on manufacturing giant bombs with a large bombing range. At the same time, Senator Hart, a member of the Senate's Special Committee on Atomic Energy, also criticized: I deeply feel that Mr. Laski actually knows nothing about what he said. Even if he knows something, I cannot agree to disclose it.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Captain Qi Xiaer, the official observer at the scene when American planes bombed Nagasaki with atomic bombs, issued a statement today, pointing out that Laski's remarks about atomic bombs were completely inaccurate. Lai (Laski) said that the United States now has atomic bombs with extremely high strength, each of which can destroy all of Indiana and Illinois after it explodes, or an area larger than the total area of ​​England, Scotland, and Wales. Captain Qi said: Without continued inventions in the next few years, the radius of the destruction circle of the atomic bomb is only a few miles.

### Five Japanese War Criminals Hanged; Cried Out Loudly Before Execution; Feet Tied, Eyes Blindfolded; Dead Instantly Upon Hanging; Bodies Cremated and Ashes Delivered to War Criminal Liaison Officer

[Our Own Dispatch] Former Chief of Staff of the 34th Army of the Japanese War Criminals, Major General Kaburaki Masao, Warrant Officer Fujii Tsutomu, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Military Police Branch, Sergeant Major Masui Sozo, Private First Class Shirakawa Yosaburo, and Sergeant Major Matsui Koichi, an official of the Military Police Headquarters, were hanged by the American authorities yesterday morning in Wald Road Prison.

They were the masterminds behind the killing of an American pilot. After the pilot was captured by the Japanese army in a bombing raid over Hankow, the Japanese army subjected him to severe torture, forced him to parade through the streets, and then strangled him with ropes that night at the crematorium. One of them was not completely dead after being strangled. The Japanese army tightened the rope to kill him. Its methods were extremely vicious and inhumane. Therefore, when the American military court finalized the case in March, it sentenced the five principals to hanging.

The small room where the execution was carried out was heavily guarded. Except for the executors and witnesses, outside participation was strictly prohibited. The five war criminals were led out of the prison by American military police in order of military rank. Kaburaki Masao was the first to be hanged at 8:17. The other four were executed in the same way one by one. After each hanging, there was a short pause of several minutes. Masui, who had studied at a church school, was baptized by Spanish priest Jiang Chaila before entering the execution chamber.

After each war criminal left the prison, they were first taken to a nearby room where military police tied their hands behind their backs, and then walked into the execution chamber. Then, Captain Ham, the translator of the interrogation committee, read out the charges and judgments to each person. Captain Ham asked the prisoners if they had any last words, and all four shook their heads in silence. But Masui asked that his will be changed from April 20th to April 22nd. Then the four criminals successively had brief conversations with the local monk Kamba. Masui had one with Father Jiang. Then they stepped onto the gallows, and Lieutenant Basak, the former personal guard of General Eisenhower and the current warden of the 701st Military Police Prison of the United States, presided over the execution. The feet of each criminal were tightly tied, their eyes were blindfolded, and the neckbands were adjusted. Then the mechanism was activated, and each criminal died instantly. After the execution, Captain Li Queci, a medical officer, checked to make sure they were dead, and then wrapped the bodies in sheets and placed them in wooden coffins. Before the execution, each criminal requested cremation after death. The ashes and personal belongings of each were handed over to Colonel Matsushita, the current liaison officer of the 6th Japanese Army in Shanghai.

In addition to Lieutenant Ba, there were four others from the American military authorities who performed the execution, including Sergeant Major Ben. Those who testified on the scene included Lieutenant Colonel Weisman, Lieutenant Gira, and Lieutenant Colonel Cade, the head of the US military news liaison team. It is said that the five war criminals did not have deep expressions when they were sentenced, but according to the guards and military police, the prisoners had been crying out loudly in the prison.

### Robbery Followed by Fire: Significant Losses at Shanghai High School. Silver Chests Opened and Cash Stolen, Students' and Teachers' Property Lost. More Than Ten School Buildings Destroyed by Fire, Estimated Value of 40 Million Yuan.

[Our Newspaper Report] The Provincial Shanghai High School in Wujiagang, South Shanghai, is vast. Around 12:00 AM on the 18th, more than ten bandits, including two armed with guns, broke into the administration office downstairs from the north side, near the lead wire silk shop. Inside were three silver chests. The bandits forced the tea boy to hand over the keys to the silver chests, but he refused. They tied him to a tree and stuffed his mouth with cotton wool. Then, they managed to open a safe on the west side, stealing 385,000 yuan in legal tender. The middle chest remained untouched (containing no valuables), while the one on the east side was eventually carried away by the bandits. The losses are said to be heavy.

Teachers Injured in Attacks

At the same time, several teachers who refused to hand over the keys were beaten and injured. As a result, all students' suitcases, clothing, private gold rings, and other valuables were stolen without exception, totaling over 7 million yuan. The robbery lasted for two hours before the bandits left through the front gate. It is reported that heavy foreign chests and other items were loaded onto a truck. Before leaving, they fired three shots into the air as a show of force. It was not until 6:00 AM that the Changqiao police station was notified, which then reported to the Longhua Branch Bureau.

Unexpectedly, around 11:30 PM on the night before last (the 21st), a fire suddenly broke out in the toilet on the right side due to an electrical fault. It was late at night, and there were no fire-fighting facilities. All the buildings in that area were bungalows built by the Japanese during the enemy-puppet period (where Japanese troops had been stationed for a long time). Because they were all wooden structures with lead sheet roofs, the fire spread quickly. In an instant, more than ten bungalows in the east and west rooms of the Yong dormitory were completely destroyed. It was not until after 3:00 AM the next morning that the fire extinguished itself. The estimated loss is over 40 million yuan. Fortunately, there were no casualties.

### Women Participate in the Election: Truly an Opportunity to Enjoy Rights and Fulfill Obligations. Zhu Su'e Says It's Not About Competing with Men... Hopes for More Representatives to Speak for Women.

— ·Our Newspaper Reporter Mai Tian·

The election of city councilors on the 28th is fast approaching? In the past few days, at least several hundred candidates have temporarily set aside their official duties.

Being busy with activities on all fronts, in China, which is striving to embark on the path of democratic politics, this phenomenon should be worthy of joy. In particular, women's participation in the election should not only be supported by the women's community but also by the people of the whole country. If they remember Sun Yat-sen's teachings of "equal rights for men and women," they should truly realize a democratic country and encourage their female compatriots to open up a broad avenue.

The female candidates in this city include Zhu Su'e, a resident member of the Shanghai Provisional Assembly in the Fifth District, Fang Yingda, an officer of the Women's Movement Committee of the Kuomintang Party Headquarters in Huangpu District, Ling Qishen, an officer of the Women's Movement Committee of the Kuomintang Party Headquarters in Changshu District, Tian Shujun, Lu Huimin, a senator of the Provisional Assembly in the Jiangning District, Xie Neng, Zhang Yinggu, Yang Minghui from the education sector, and more than ten others who are representatives of their professions.

Yesterday afternoon, a reporter visited Zhu Su'e, a lawyer and one of the most enthusiastic members of the women's movement. Ms. Zhu previously served as a Shanghai representative to the First National Women's Congress, worked underground during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, and currently serves as a member of the Women's Movement Committee, a standing director of the Shanghai Women's Association, and an executive member of the Lawyers' Union. She said: "Women must achieve economic independence and open up real professional doors to truly achieve equal status between men and women. Otherwise, chanting rights, prohibiting this, and abolishing that are all in vain. Women are not willing to degenerate, they are also doing it for a living!" "Women should serve as senators," she continued, "not based on personal viewpoints, but must strive to seek welfare for the public and truly serve all female compatriots." She feels that in China today, not only men but also women themselves understand the importance of women's status. Therefore, she hopes that more female senators will be elected this time, not to compete with men, but to have more representatives to speak for women in the future.

There will be 181 senators elected in Shanghai. According to the city's population of over 3.3 million, women account for over 1.5 million, and men account for over 1.8 million, which is almost half. If one-tenth of the 181 senators are women, that is not too much! If female compatriots are unwilling to succumb to the power of men again, this is truly a great opportunity to enjoy rights and fulfill obligations. You cannot enter without rushing in!

Senate Candidates Deliver Campaign Speeches

[Our Newspaper Report] Chen Gongda, secretary of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, is enthusiastic about social welfare and has now resigned from his position in the municipal government to participate in the public office election in the Xincheng District. Mr. Chen has served as an engineer in the Shanghai Municipal Council, a section chief and secretary of the Municipal Kuomintang Party Headquarters, and is currently the general manager of the Huada Engineering Firm. Mr. Chen hosted reporters from various newspapers at the municipal government cafeteria yesterday afternoon and expressed his views on municipal affairs. He said that the price of goods in the city is rising endlessly, and people's livelihoods are difficult. In the future, materials should be distributed to households according to the number of people, and food should be rationed accordingly. Rent increases are also unreasonable, and residents are actually producing a part for the landlords. Labor-capital disputes must be regulated in a certain way. If this continues, society will never be stable. In terms of education, funding should be increased, and private schools should also be equally subsidized. Enemy-puppet transportation vehicles, milk sheds, etc., should be organized immediately, otherwise the losses will be huge, which is a pity.

### One Puppet Policeman's Crime Compounded, Two Japanese Deny Violating the Law. Puppet Township Head Dong Zhongming and Two Other Cases Scheduled for Sentencing. The Case of the Owner of the Jingyong Nail Factory Postponed for Re-opening of Debate.

[Unknown Source] Two Japanese nationals, Kanishi Gaishi and Oshima Kichiichiro, were accused of recruiting more than 1,000 mixed troops to cause chaos and disrupt order after the victory, violating Chinese criminal law. The High Court Prosecutor's Office initiated a public prosecution. The case was heard by the High Court yesterday. The defendant Kanishi claimed that he came to China in May 1940 and served as a lieutenant medical officer in the army. He retired and returned to his country in August 1942, and then came to China again in January 1944, working as an employee of the Shanghai Kwangshan Trading Company. The other defendant, Oshima, also claimed to be an employee of the trading company. Both firmly denied recruiting troops. The court ordered the case to be postponed for further questioning. On the same day, the High Court announced the verdict in another case, and the hearing of multiple cases is recorded below:

Huang Guangjiang, a puppet policeman, was sentenced and executed by the puppet court at the time for the case of chasing the boatman Chu Xin'gen, causing Chu to fall into the water and die. Now, the High Court Prosecutor's Office has re-investigated and prosecuted the case. After the High Court concluded the trial, the verdict was announced yesterday: Colluding with an enemy country, plotting to resist this country, sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights for three years, and all property confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for family members.

Wang Wanqing, manager of the Universal Iron Factory, and Chen Shizhen, assistant manager, were accused of providing iron machinery and other materials to the enemy, and manufacturing various machines and parts for the enemy's Huazhong Silk Company. The first defendant claimed that he was forced, while the second defendant claimed that he knew nothing about it. The court decided to wait for investigation and postpone the hearing. Gu Yousheng was accused of serving as a secret agent for the enemy's New World Gendarmerie, framing underground workers. The accusers Lu Jinyuan and Sun Dianliang came to court to present the details. The defendant denied the charges. The case was postponed for further questioning.

In addition, two cases were opened for trial and the debate was concluded by the collegiate panel: (1) Dong Zhongming, the puppet township head of Zifentownship, First District, Shanghai County, was accused of collecting and procuring food rice for the enemy, and assigning civilian labor. The defendant denied the charges and was released on bail. (2) Four puppet policemen, Shi Yuwen, Luo Tingzhang, Gao Qingyu, and Xing Shimin, were accused of extorting merchants, and were sentenced by the puppet court at the time. The case is now being re-tried. The debate in the above two cases has concluded, and the court has ordered the sentencing to be held at 2:30 PM on the 29th.

Also, the case of Zhu Ruilin, the owner of the Jingyong Nail Factory, manufacturing wire nails for the enemy, was originally scheduled for sentencing yesterday afternoon, but the court believed that further investigation was necessary and ordered the re-opening of the debate.

### Nanhua Industrial Company Actively Expanding Business.

### Grain Administration Implemented in Taiwan Province According to Local Needs. Loans for Merchants Shipping to Taiwan Are Not Obstructed.

[Our Newspaper Report] According to Mr. Bao Kehong, a specialist committee member of the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, he told reporters: Recently, various sectors often do not understand the facts regarding the administration of grain, industry, mining, and trade in Taiwan Province. A separate explanation is provided below: The grain production in Taiwan Province has decreased sharply because the farmland has not been fertilized for three years, so there is a shortage of grain. The Administrative Office once tried to implement grain rationing, but it ended in failure due to opposition from various sectors. Currently, the Tainan area is demanding rationing, while Taipei is opposing it. Therefore, the Administrative Office will temporarily implement the grain administration according to the needs of various regions. There is no so-called forced rationing system implemented. Regarding the industrial and mining enterprises in Taiwan Province, the Administrative Office abandoned the sealing policy and adopted the supervision method. Therefore, the various important industrial and mining enterprises can still continue to operate without interruption, and they have now entered the takeover stage. Most of the original Japanese technicians will be sent back to their country before the end of April, except for those who have been specially approved by MacArthur to remain. Currently, the Administrative Office's Shanghai Liaison Office is rushing to send a large number of takeover personnel to Taiwan in batches to complete the takeover work. In terms of trade, various sectors often criticize the control. It is said that in fact, any merchant who ships any goods to Taiwan Province will not be obstructed by the Administrative Office except for those prohibited by customs. The only obstacle currently felt is the restriction of shipping tonnage. The only item restricted for export from Taiwan Province is grain, which is to prevent the grain situation in Taiwan Province from becoming increasingly serious. The export of Taiwan sugar is based on the principle of exchanging for fertilizer, otherwise, the fertilizer for producing Taiwan sugar in the next two years will be impossible to solve. As for the coal in Keelung, it is supplied to the Fuel Management Committee of the Executive Yuan for unified allocation. Other items such as camphor, tobacco, and alcohol have always been monopolies in Taiwan Province, so it is intended to protect trade, and there is no so-called control. It is also reported that since November last year, the Administrative Office's Shanghai Liaison Office has sent nearly 3,000 public officials to Taiwan in batches, and is still continuing to send them.

### The World's Metropolis Reveals a New Look! A Stroll Through New York in Early Spring

— A Dispatch from Our Correspondent in New York, Zhu Jiarang

Here, spring doesn't officially begin until March 21st. Although the cold wind from the river sometimes still bothers us, the time is different after all, and spring has finally arrived! The sun shines high for days, illuminating the earth, and the shoots of green in Central Park are also full of life. People are gradually emerging from the stifling atmosphere and embracing nature. This world-class metropolis is once again dressed up.

Like an overture to spring, the New York International Flower Show opened in the Central Building, symbolizing the arrival of spring. According to the newspapers, this flower show had been suspended for four years due to the war. This year, it is making a comeback and raising its banner again, so all those involved in horticulture are competing to show off their skills, exhibiting their best plants for public viewing.

It is difficult to describe this grand and impressive exhibition. One point, however, can be made: their efforts are not only comprehensive and colorful, containing the meaning of a comprehensive exposition, but also seem to emphasize horticulture and practical applications. The exhibition occupies three floors of the building. Some displays use gardens as backdrops, others are decorated with home furnishings; some are large-scale, others are small displays, each in its place, each with its own charm. Here, they also tell you how to plant flowers, how to care for flowers. When a bunch of red roses is delivered to your door in a cardboard box, how should you handle it to maintain its beautiful life for a week or ten days? How can you insert various kinds and colors of fresh flowers into vases of different diameters and shapes to make them graceful, charming, and full of laughter? There are experts who have studied every aspect in detail. From the perspective of those of us who still struggle to make ends meet, they are truly engaging in "gilding the lily."

If New York can represent the United States, seeing New York is equivalent to seeing the entire United States. In fact, their life and society do have many similarities and differences with ours. They certainly owe their current status to industrialization, which has raised the general standard of living many times higher than that of other countries, and their vitality and social customs also have their unique aspects. Occasionally strolling through the streets, looking and listening, and then closing your eyes to think, even if you don't have a set of "mixed feelings," you can still express yourself freely.

First of all, we cannot deny that the United States is a capitalist country, where the authority of money is everywhere apparent, and the evils of capitalism are inevitable. But sometimes, when you think about it, their current situation also has its social logic. The so-called capitalism is originally rooted in free competition and the private ownership system. If private ownership is allowed, then there must be free competition. Without competition, how can there be private ownership? At the same time, because everyone can compete, everyone can obtain private ownership. This principle of relying on one's own strength to win fairly has promoted Western civilization and laid a solid foundation for wealth and strength. This is the good side. On the side of abuses, according to some, it inevitably leads to the emergence of hegemony, and most people will have no food to eat, but this phenomenon is not seen here. They believe that the harm of this kind of practice is not as bad as some propagandists say. While capitalists certainly concentrate wealth, the government's implementation of heavy tax policies can restrain them, and religious leaders, educators, the Red Cross, and public opinion often cause wealthy people to generously open their wallets, disgorging large sums of money to establish social undertakings and even send them overseas. Furthermore, the lives of the general public, although a large portion rely on wages, generally have relatively high incomes, and prices can be stabilized. In particular, their highest philosophy is production. As long as they produce more and produce quickly, prices will fall, wages will increase, and of course, life will be better. The stability and prosperity of American society can be said to be developing under this logic.

We don't need to make any praise or criticism of this kind of social ideology here, only look at one thing in practice that is noteworthy, that is, the eight characters "Make the best use of everything, make the best use of everyone" (物盡其用，人盡其才) have unexpectedly been realized here first. They have truly achieved the ideal of "benefiting the people by utilizing resources" (利用厚生). Everything is used to its fullest extent, not only to avoid the slightest "waste of goods on the ground," but also to exhaust its performance, making full use of it, so that everything in the universe is used by people, and not a single piece of wood or stone is wasted. On the other hand, to be a person, one must truly be a person, not something that resembles a person but isn't. Life in this world is about using things, not about being used by others. Everyone is a person, and should have human dignity and not be used by others. Based on this reasoning, we can see three social phenomena: First, material resources are therefore particularly abundant, ubiquitous, and dazzling, changing with each passing day, and human enjoyment is rapidly reaching its peak. Second, the social system encourages research and rewards success. People's competition is directed toward a broad and generous nature, there are more opportunities to stand out, and everyone can become "talented." Third, because of strong productivity, everyone is well-fed and clothed, the minimum standard of living is guaranteed, they can stand up straight, the opportunity to bow to others is reduced, the concept of equality is increased, and personality is universally improved, so everyone can become a "talented" "person." Finally, because everything is used to its fullest extent, and everyone has something to use, there is no need to use people. Therefore, apart from barbers and shoeshiners, whose services are relatively indispensable, the rest are obviously being reduced. Not to mention household servants, even waiters in restaurants, bars, and teahouses sometimes face a "manpower shortage." Many shops often have "help wanted" signs posted in their windows. Occupational changes in an industrialized society are of course a normal phenomenon, shifting from directly serving people to social egalitarianism. Isn't this another explanation of raising people's character?

But the key point remains one. Everyone must first make the country rich, everyone must have food to eat, everyone can hold their heads high, and only then can everyone be considered a person. It must be stated here that whether this kind of practice can achieve thorough equality, as socialism says, is still unknown; but it is clear that further production makes human society take a big step, this principle is common, and it is also beyond doubt.

Earning Money First, Enjoying Life Above All Else

Based on the above social structure, extrapolating another picture, I think they are really about "earning money first, enjoying life above all else." Earning money is the foundation of life, the way to obtain bread. In their capitalist society, everything is calculated in terms of money, so money can fully represent human happiness. People want to live, people want to be extravagant, the only thing they need is money, so everyone wants to earn money, everyone uses all means to get money. Moreover, the minimum wage for workers is regulated, and there is no limit to the maximum compensation, so as long as you are willing, as long as you have the ability, you can earn as much money as possible. At the same time, material enjoyment is increasing, and you have to earn money actively enough to keep pace with the times and the desires of mankind. Therefore, the enthusiasm for earning money is indeed a cut above the rest.

Open the newspaper or sit on the subway, and everywhere you look, there are eye-catching advertisements. The design of the advertisements exhausts the abilities of advertising, needless to say, the main reason is nothing more than wanting to do more business and earn more money. Although several large companies are closed on Sundays as usual, they are still open on Saturday afternoons, and every week there are two or one days when business hours are extended to 9:00 PM. Other ordinary stores are even more unrestricted, especially those called drug stores (Drugs), which are actually general stores, they simply have to be open until midnight every day (restaurants and entertainment venues are no exception), with no weekly holidays, just like our ordinary stores. This is very different from the strict restrictions in England, where stores close at 5:30 PM every day, and are closed on Saturday afternoons and Sundays. Furthermore, Americans really know how to do business. When you walk into any store, the clerks all seem to have read salesmanship books. They want you to go in empty-handed and come out with a purchase. You originally wanted to buy one item, but in the end, they "convince" you to buy two or three. This is certainly a universal phenomenon of business acumen, but their interest in making money is naturally more intense.

The question after earning money is how to use it, which is the purpose of earning money, and Americans seem to understand this very well. Therefore, generally speaking, in addition to necessary savings, they try to use money as much as possible, to seek as much satisfaction in life as possible, and to strive for enjoyment and fun as much as possible, to make up for work and not waste a lifetime. They believe that this can also accelerate the circulation of money and promote social prosperity, so consumption, extravagance, and general enjoyment have developed accordingly. In particular, this city of New York is a dazzling world, nothing more than a place of consumption, and no matter how much money you have to eat and use, you cannot fill the desires of people. The brightly lit and clean restaurants are crowded everywhere, orange juice and milk gushing like springs, fish, meat, rice, and noodles are available on demand. People are constantly eating and drinking there from morning to night, without any "market open" or "market close" times. Here, in a broad sense, in addition to eating and drinking (recently, due to price controls, some items such as butter are in short supply, and food may be reduced soon to relieve Europe and Asia), clothing is slightly lacking due to price controls, and general industrial production of daily necessities is even more insufficient due to labor strikes (such as automobiles, radios, electric refrigerators, etc.). It is currently slightly suppressed, but in reality, their areas of seeking pleasure have not diminished. The entertainment venues on Broadway are packed every day, and people line up in double rows to buy tickets. Rockefeller Center has a huge theater called Radio City Music Hall. In addition to movies, there are also songs and dances. Its magnificent architecture and luxurious decoration are probably second to none. Every morning, a large group of men and women wait in line to buy tickets. The entire theater has about 20,000 seats, and people still have to wait for half an hour at a time to get in. As for nightclubs, bars, and dance halls, the city is open all night, which is even more imaginable.

Another thing that can be mentioned here is that they seek pleasure and work together, using pleasure to increase work efficiency. Therefore, whenever they have free time, they all look for some entertainment to activate their spirits. Americans usually compete in everything they say and do for lightness and humor, to make people laugh, and their principle is to say things that make people happy. Chinese customs like to be polite and formal, which inevitably suppresses emotions and is not amusing, which may also be a difference between Eastern and Western cultures. However, Westerners are accustomed to being unrestrained, always wanting to move towards pleasure and joy, and not caring about small details, which is really expressed very fully. To give another example: In our country's concept, universities should be places for learning, so-called "lofty institutions of learning," but who knows that here, in addition to attending classes, they are also exactly like large hotels. Dining halls, bars, billiard rooms, everything is available. Downstairs in the men's dormitory at Columbia, music echoes every night, dancing late into the night, which really makes old scholars clap their tables in anger; but Columbia's being Columbia has not damaged its reputation in the slightest.

### Seeking Progress in Life, Demanding Reasonableness in Waste

The United States consumes a lot of materials, and from the perspective of economists, this is naturally very wasteful. To give a few examples: New York's tap water is piped in from mountains hundreds of miles away, which must not be easy to obtain, but the supply is unlimited, and no ordinary user goes to conserve it. According to their own statistics, no one uses less than one hundred gallons of water every day, and the total daily consumption of the entire city is staggering. Electricity is also worthless, with brilliant lights and roaring furnaces everywhere. No ordinary household does not have several electrical appliances, and the landlady will never argue with you about the electricity bill. Also, the use of paper here is quite extravagant. Paper cups and paper towels are scattered everywhere, and any paper utensil becomes a discarded item once it has been used. Like newspapers, there are about ten major ones, and their circulation is very considerable. Taking the New York Times as an example, its Sunday sales recently exceeded one million copies, with as many as eighty to one hundred pages, plus special Sunday supplements, book reviews, and weekly magazines. If you flip through it roughly, it will take you an hour, and the consumption of paper is staggering, which is conceivable. There are countless other examples. Not to mention that from the perspective of those of us who have long been involved in the conservation movement, they are too wasteful, even Americans themselves cannot help but feel that they are sometimes too "squandering the gifts of nature." Especially in the midst of the current world famine, the United States, with its already hungry and drowning heart, must reduce consumption to relieve others. Many political figures and social celebrities in Washington, starting with President Truman, have successively called on the people to reduce consumption and help Europe and Asia. The Post-War Relief Conference held in Atlantic City, and former Director-General Lehman even advocated that the United States resume rationing. Americans enjoy their uniquely blessed resources and inevitably consume too much, which is also a fact.

However, the author is not defending them here. I feel that although they are wasteful, they also have their reasonable principles. In other words, while they waste on one end, they save huge, intangible consumption on the other end. I still sometimes think that they can make good use of materials, using all resources for our use, so since they are already rich, why be stingy? Isn't it foolish to have things and not use them? Therefore, enjoying nature is of course reasonable. Moreover, consumption is aimed at improving human life, health, and culture. A country that has already developed production cannot talk about conservation to block production. On the contrary, it should encourage consumption to share the fruits of production and raise the standard of living. But in reality, aren't they still pursuing rationalization everywhere? Look at the elevators in large buildings, moving like shuttles, with hundreds of male and female drivers. This can be said to be a waste of manpower, but for the sake of the thousands of people who ride the elevators, these drivers are saving them countless time and energy. It is not necessary to use washable towels in public places, but to consume large amounts of paper towels. Isn't this somewhat pointless? However, it is precisely for this reason that infectious diseases are prevented and the consumption of countless public energy and money is saved. Let's talk about drinking water. As a joke, this foreign water is really good to drink. Tap water is a completely safe beverage anyway, wash water for washing your face and drinking water are the same thing. The major companies here are equipped with drinking fountains. If you want to try it, just turn a small key, and a fountain will gush out, cool and delicious, and it won't cost you a penny. Naturally, this kind of water supply project is arduous, but from now on, you will never have to boil water, and hygiene is guaranteed, saving coal, salary, and money, and no one knows how many? Here is another example: In addition to a few public buses that still hire conductors (actually, they only collect money and do not check tickets), all other means of transportation have been abolished. Passengers automatically insert money when they get on the bus. If they insert money, no ticket is given, and only the passenger knows if they don't insert. But maybe their level has reached this point. This saves people and saves paper, and the effect is still quite good. The New York subway also never sells tickets. Passengers simply drop a nickel into the gate and turn around to enter the station. Therefore, there are no ticket sellers, and the paper saved from bus tickets every day is even more staggering. Looking at it this way, they are superficially wasting, but in reality, they are still striving for conservation everywhere. They still don't do unnecessary and unreasonable waste.

### Thank You, Forgive Me: Harmonious Interpersonal Relationships

In terms of attitude and demeanor, some reveal that Americans are more lively, but lack a bit of solemnity. They shrug their shoulders, wave their hands, and while speaking, their expressions, eyebrows, eyes, and face often move together; most people seem to have naturally become accustomed to it. However, generally speaking, they still pay great attention to politeness and order. Twenty-four hours a day, unless you are alone in your room and not in contact with anyone, you will always receive or send countless "thank yous," "forgive mes," and "I'm sorrys"... If you lightly bump into someone on the road, you're sure to get an "I'm sorry," and they'll say "thank you" for letting them go first. When a waiter brings food to you in a restaurant or teahouse, it is originally his duty, but the diner still has to say "thank you." When a shop assistant takes money after a purchase, they routinely express thanks. Even in the classroom, after a teacher asks a student a question, they say "thank you." Moreover, the number of times thanks are offered is imaginable. The number of times "forgive me" is said is equally numerous: When asking someone for directions, it's essential to start with "please forgive me," otherwise, it's somewhat rude. If you don't hear what someone says clearly and ask them to repeat it, you don't reply with "What?" or emit a heavy "Huh?" from your throat, but rather a genuine "Pardon." In short, when asking a favor of someone, an apology is offered first. When someone provides you with a convenience, regardless of whether it's substantial or minimal, or whether their service stems from enthusiasm or is simply their responsibility, gratitude is expressed without exception. Thus, "thank you" and "forgive me"... have become everyone's catchphrases, the "opening remarks" and "grand finale" of every conversation. Naturally, these phrases, from our Chinese perspective, sometimes seem redundant and excessive, and whether they are spoken sincerely by the general population, and what value they actually have, is also a question; however, in all fairness, we shouldn't be too critical. These habits are sufficient to harmonize interactions and lubricate human contact, and are certainly more than just "the art of speaking."

Moreover, these catchphrases, if considered thoughtfully, are also very reasonable. When a person always holds a grateful heart, knows that others bestow much upon them, and increasingly remembers their own debts to others, and acts in a way that demonstrates "self-restraint," harmonious relationships will be created in society between people as a result of this concept. Speaking of this, I can't help but think of our Confucius, who also had his "Way of Loyalty and Forgiveness." Loyalty means "exhausting oneself," and forgiveness means "extending oneself." It seems that this is slightly different than "thank you" and "forgive me," but in fact, it is very consistent. Only by fearing that one has not "exhausted oneself" are they constantly and sincerely fearful and apologetic, asking for forgiveness. Not having enough "extending oneself," they offer fervent thanks. It shows that the principles of Eastern and Western cultures are only one; even if there are small differences, they are still largely the same. However, there is one point of custom that may also be related to national character, and the habits of Chinese and foreigners are ultimately inconsistent. Easterners, especially the character and interests of us Chinese, tend towards the latent. They always like to suppress and then promote, hide a bit, and are not good at expressing themselves, while Westerners are very different. They have seven points of ability and must express ten. When dealing with people, although they also speak with elegant phrasing, they do not use excessive politeness, so as not to dampen the atmosphere and make it difficult to become close. Therefore, Chinese people who initially set foot in foreign lands often cannot fully adapt when interacting with foreigners. Here are a few small examples: If someone praises you for speaking English well, we usually deny it outright, saying, "Ah no, my English is too bad." Sometimes, when you dance with an American for the first time at a social gathering, according to the majority of customs, you should first declare, "I'm sorry, I can't dance." Little do they know, we consider these words very appropriate and polite, but they often consider them strange. Furthermore, there are things that they find pleasing and delightful, but because we consider them unnatural, we hesitate to say or do them. For example, when inviting someone to dinner, we don't praise our own elaborate dishes; when receiving a gift, we don't open it immediately to show our appreciation and satisfaction. Also, in appropriate situations, we don't publicly praise a female guest's beauty in a timely manner; these things often disappoint people. However, these things are absolutely not customary for us Chinese, because the preconceptions are deeply ingrained. According to the general explanation, wouldn't these words intentionally be trying to make people happy?

Spiritual Life Is Still Not Neglected

America's material life can be considered to have reached its peak. Especially in this world's number one city, paper drunk and gold obsessed, globally unmatched, its more than seven million residents are constantly exposed to the temptations of sights, sounds, and colors, and the pursuit of material things, the degree of its frenzy need not be said. But in this environment where money is omnipotent and material things are prosperous, strangely, they still pay attention to spiritual life, they still pursue religious comfort. After material satisfaction is achieved, they do not forget the spirit. Even with material life, they do not look down on spiritual life, and this point is closely related to the maintenance and development of their country and society.

In this country, the religions are Catholicism and Christianity. Although the two have some differences, they both have the same Old and New Testaments. So generally speaking, their beliefs are still the same. I say that the religious atmosphere here is strong. First, you can see the number of churches. I am afraid that there is no place other than Rome that can compare to it, and its magnificent architecture is also not easy to see in many places. The distribution of churches is very common. Whether you are in the bustling Wall Street or Fifth Avenue, they stand tall everywhere. Some of the buildings have new colors, while others are completely charred black. Second, the number of churchgoers is large, and they are full everywhere on Sundays. Many churches hold two services, morning and evening, and St. Peter's Cathedral often divides into groups, with one group going in and one group coming out, which is very busy. All the churches are open all day on weekdays so that pedestrians can enter and pray, and in some places, there are morning and evening services every day, without sermons, only singing hymns and prayers, and male and female church members are also very crowded. In addition, in the religious atmosphere of society, such as radio broadcasts, newspaper reports, and speeches and announcements by celebrities and politicians, there is always some religious meaning, in various forms, indicating that Americans have religious beliefs and are in awe of God.

But if you ask these religions, what strong organization do they actually have? After asking many people, they all say they are very free and scattered. Except for Catholicism, Christianity is not subordinate to the Pope of Rome, and it is not fundamentally related to the federal government in any way. According to the Church Yearbook of 1945, there are a total of 253,762 Christian churches in the golden country, with 72,492,669 church members. (In 1936, there were only 190,000 churches and 50 million church members). But the number of Catholics is probably even greater. Of course, these people may not all be devout at ordinary times, but most of them pay donations and fulfill their obligations. The church expenses here are divided into recurring expenses and overseas mission expenses, and the annual figures are not small, all borne by church members separately. Therefore, some large churches have sufficient finances and pastors receive huge salaries. Most churches have Chinese missionary organizations, and regularly send people to preach in China. Their work areas and the allocation of funds are planned separately in China.

Now let us ask again, what role does their religious belief play in their social customs and people's hearts? This question is certainly not easy to answer, because it is ultimately abstract. Especially in large cities like New York, there is a lot of social crime. It is difficult to see a significant negative effect; but according to the comments of most church people and impartial people, if this country had no religious beliefs, then human desires would be even more rampant. Now there is only this social education and training institution, which energizes people every week, polishes them up, raises the torch of morality, and acts as a mainstay. The moral standards of this country are being actively maintained in this way. For example, in terms of social atmosphere, despite the casual relations between men and women, there is still the public opinion supervision of the church. If a person wants to do some business and has moral flaws, this is very tricky. The United States has a national church organization that often publishes opinions and criticizes politics and society. Not long ago, a conference was held, and even the atomic bombing of Hiroshima was criticized. In fact, this religious force is indeed the mainstay of this country's morality. They usually speak out in a completely democratic and free way based on their religious beliefs, leading the masses and influencing people's hearts, and directly influencing the country's policies, which is also of great importance. At this time of worldwide chaos, the United States has not only used its strong material resources to defeat the enemy, but now also wants to have compassion for others, save the famine, and vigorously establish justice. We cannot deny that they mainly benefit from religion for this great moral force.

### Looking Down and Remotely Thinking of the Motherland: Still Too Busy Saving the Dying

Now, looking at others, I can't help but think of myself. This country has only been established for 170 years, and it has progressed to such an extent that the people are well-fed and well-clothed, which is truly called people's livelihood and happiness; but looking back at the motherland, most of my compatriots are still chewing on grass roots to make a living. How dare this contrast make people look at it squarely? We have a long history and culture that people admire us for. This time, the long-term war of resistance won victory, and the country's status rose to the top five powers, so we certainly have a lot of face; however, if we are not blindly arrogant! But if there is some conscience and feeling, being abroad is really sometimes embarrassing and even unable to hold our heads up.

The news about our country is recorded in great detail in the newspapers here. Especially the telegrams from Chongqing, Shanghai, Changchun and other places are all lengthy. But after saying this and that, there is only one impression, that is, reunification still has obstacles, and the country's fortunes still need to be stabilized. The Soviet Union does not want to withdraw its troops in the Northeast, and the criticism here is unfair, but it is the most undeniable fact that our own country is not strong and there are still problems internally. Especially like some time ago, Washington and some public opinion said that if China is not unified, it will not be able to share the responsibility of world peace, and the title of the top five powers will also have an impact. Obviously, the country has not yet escaped from difficulties, making every citizen less glorious, especially those living abroad, the degree of reflected light is particularly strong. Thinking that their own government is still in a difficult environment and coping hard, the overall situation after the war has not yet embarked on a broad road. The economic panic is no less easy than during the war, and because prices continue to soar, the people have not received the benefits of victory at all. The lives of ordinary people are getting harder and harder, and the famine in the Central Plains is especially tragic. How can this fellow countryman not want to think about it? But how can I bear to think about it?

The fact is very clear, our own progress is still far behind the international achievements in recent years. Although the name belongs to us, the essence has not yet arrived. The content and reputation do not match. Come out and take a look. There are too many countries that are smaller than us, but when it comes to construction and people's lives, we only have a false name and we really can't compare to others. Others have industrial products, but we only have agricultural products. Like Switzerland, a small country, the people of a small country are drilling in a small circle to study and manufacture small machines. Today, watches, musical instruments, and typewriters are famous all over the world. The three countries of Scandinavia in Northern Europe, in terms of international status, can't catch up with our country, but Danes and Swedes eat and use a lot today, and songs are all over the streets. What about us? Although the vast majority of the people have newly won the title of the top five powers, if it is not to reduce our own prestige, we can't help but feel discouraged. Who doesn't regard most Chinese people as poor boys, pitiful human beings in the eyes of foreigners? If you walk into a pharmacy, the shop assistants will very sensitively solicit you to buy vitamins. Once, the author was a little annoyed by him and asked him the reason. He had a sympathetic face and said that many people in China don't have food to eat now, so they need this thing. At that time, I wanted to save face and immediately replied that China produces rice and wheat, and there is a lot of food, but I thought that this kind of pretending to be fat to fill your face is very meaningless. China's poverty is obvious to all, and it is too stupid to hide it like this. What's more, in the pictures on the movies and books, from India to here, how many of the topics related to China are pleasing to the eye? Along the way, there are photo exhibitions that are dotted with the characteristics of various places, and the representatives of China are either "King Wen's divine class" or poor old women or women with bound feet in ragged clothes. The United States is now demobilizing on the one hand, and still recruiting soldiers on the other hand. To recruit soldiers, they have to use various advertising methods to attract strong men. The day before yesterday, an advertisement was published in the newspaper. They actually took the sedan chair in Sichuan as the subject. Several allied soldiers sat on the sedan chair, and the Chinese sedan chair bearers moved forward in a panting sweat, saying that they were enjoying world travel. At the same time, there are some books and periodicals published here that have this situation. Recently, I saw an issue of the magazine that used water buffalo plowing the fields to symbolize China. Although this backward fact is true, I don't understand why it is still emphasized. There are still many beautiful shots of the country. Wouldn't it be better to expose your own weaknesses less?

Finally, a little point: There are not a few of us who live here now. Everyone is on other people's land, wearing other people's clothes, and eating other people's food, but when I think that I am Chinese after all, and I rely entirely on other people's civilization, I only steal a day of peace. When I look at myself again, what I brought from the motherland, I can't help but be ashamed. Of course, although we don't have industrial products, it's not that we don't have good things, but the rivers and mountains are still "broken" and the people are still in dire straits. At the door of post-disaster relief, we are still a group of pitiful people waiting to be fed. Others are "adding flowers to the brocade", and we are still "too busy saving the dying". What can we show in front of others? Even to talk about a small matter, some people who like to collect stamps often ask the Chinese for stamps. It is very common, but they do not know that our stamp numbers are too alarming. In order to avoid disputes, some people have withdrawn their hands. Take this as an example, and the rest can be summarized. In short, we are bad, bad, bad, too bad. We must bow our heads to admit it and reflect deeply. The moon in a foreign country and the moon in China are of course the same; but if one side is a garden pavilion and the other side is always broken walls, the reflected moonlight will be different. It doesn't matter that we have difficulties now. The problem is only whether the whole country, at this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, can not miss the opportunity to turn the world around? Everyone has a share in this responsibility. Complaining is not the solution, but we must all take out our conscience and truly take responsibility. (Huanghuagang Martyrs Memorial Day in New York)

Education and Sports

### The United States and Britain Praise China: Wartime Education Is Flourishing and Developing: Higher Education Has Made Great Progress During Wartime: The Foundation of Education Has Not Been Shaken by the War

[Atlantic City, American News Service, 21st] Dr. Egloff, Dean of the American Institute of Chemistry, was invited by the Chinese government to China to investigate oil sources for eight days. He recently returned. He praised China's higher education for making great progress despite being devastated by the war.

American Doctor Examines Statistics, April 15th, The Christian Science Monitor published an article mentioning that Egloff had conducted an on-the-spot investigation of China's education situation and obtained statistical data from reliable education circles. The article stated: Dr. Egloff said that since the Japanese army occupied Manchuria in 1931 and launched military operations more than ten times, the number of higher education institutions in China has increased from 108 to 133 by 1940. As far as he knew, there were 33,000 graduates of liberal arts and other subjects in 1931 alone. Although there were only 25,000 graduates in the above-mentioned subjects in 1940, there were also 25,000 graduates in agricultural sciences, which shows that many students have shifted their research objects and diligently studied animal husbandry, keeping "soil" and "fertilizer" and other courses. According to Egloff's observation, the vigorous phenomenon of wartime education is not only limited to universities, but also to lower-level schools.

Britain Attributes It to the Aid to China Fund

[British News Service, London, 22nd] China's most difficult task in peacetime is to build educational institutions, rebuild schools, train teachers, revise textbooks, and educational equipment. Although China has suffered incomparable difficulties in the long war, the foundation of education has not been shaken, and educational institutions have also been retained. This is all thanks to the assistance of the British Aid to China Fund, which is supplemented by education as one of the main purposes of the association's activities. The importance of this assistance can be proved by the letter received by the association from the director of the Chinese Christian Education Association, which said: "The relief of secondary schools is very important, because they will soon enter universities and various specialized schools. We have received many letters of thanks from schools. Without the help of the British Aid to China Fund, some students will not be able to continue their studies." The total amount of the British Aid to China Fund is 1,704,706 pounds.

### Jiangsu Province's Post-War Education: Schools in Jiangnan Have Resumed and Increased: Schools in Jiangbei Are Gradually Recovering

[Special report from Zhenjiang by this newspaper] Jiangsu Province's educational institutions and schools had 79 units before the war. Since Chen Shi-zhen took over as the Director of the Education Department after the Anti-Japanese War, he has worked hard to restore education. Although a part of the counties in Jiangbei are restricted by the environment, education has not yet restored its old appearance, and considerable progress has been made in possible advancement. At present, there are five units of provincial educational institutions and schools that have been restored and newly established in the province, and the number of schools has increased at the local level. Some secondary schools have more than 2,000 students, so although the number of schools is smaller, the number of students is more than before the war. However, the most difficult problem at present is school buildings. For example, the school buildings of Nanjing Provincial Nanzhong, Provincial Girls' High School, Louxia Township Normal School, Zhenjiang Middle School, and Normal School were quite large in scale before the war, and the vocational school in Hushu Pass and other middle school buildings were mostly razed to the ground, which has a great impact on the current restoration of schools. The situation of all provincial schools and educational institutions that have been restored and newly established in the province, and the situation of schools that will be relocated from the interior, are recorded below.

Higher Education

Jiangsu currently has four provincial colleges and universities: (1) Jiangsu College, which was relocated from Fujian and restored, moved to Xuzhou, (2) Jiangsu Education College, which remained in Wuxi after restoration, (3) Provincial Sericulture College, (4) Provincial Industrial College. The above two colleges were established during the Anti-Japanese War and have now been restored.

Secondary Education

The established "Provincial Middle Schools" include Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Shanghai, Changzhou, Yangzhou, Nantong, Xuzhou, Yancheng, and Huai'an. Yancheng Middle School is temporarily located in Taixian County. Huai'an Middle School is temporarily located in Yangzhou. In addition, Songjiang Girls' Middle School is being planned by Principal Jiang Xue-zhu to repair the school building. After the repair is completed, it will be restored. In addition, the Second Temporary Middle School has not yet moved back in Tunxi. Public Nan Jing Middle School has been restored in Jiangyin. "Normal Schools" include Taihui, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Ru _, (Rugao Normal School is temporarily located in Taixian County), Xuzhou, (Xuzhou Normal School is newly established), Donghai, Xuzhou Women's Normal School, Suzhou Women's Normal School and other normal schools, and Wujiang Township Normal School, Huangdu Township Normal School, (Huangdu Township Normal School building has been destroyed and classes are now held in Anting) and other ten schools. In addition, the newly established Jiangning Normal School has been temporarily received by Principal Ma Ke-tan to use the former Nanjing Provincial Experimental Primary School building to prepare for the establishment of the school. In addition, a temporary normal school is located in northern Anhui, and will be merged into a provincial normal school within the province after the summer. "Vocational Schools" include Suzhou Industrial, Hushu Pass Sericulture, Yixing Senior Agricultural and Forestry, Songjiang Vocational Middle School, Suzhou Agriculture, Yixing Ceramics, and other six schools. Among them, Songjiang Vocational School is being prepared by Principal Xue Tian-you, and will be fully restored after the summer.

Elementary Education

Provincial Primary Schools include four provincial experimental primary schools in Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Shanghai, and Yangzhou. There are six affiliated primary schools in Wuxi, Taicang, Xuzhou, Donghai, and Xuzhou Women's Normal School, and Wujiang Township Normal School. The remaining experimental primary schools and affiliated primary schools will be restored again after the summer. As of now, according to the statistics of more than 20 counties that have reported their restoration to the Education Department, there are more than 10,000 national schools with more than 300,000 students.

Social Education

There are currently three provincial people's education centers in Zhenjiang, Xuzhou, and Nantong. Zhenjiang and Suzhou libraries, and Nanjing Provincial Guoxue Library. The Provincial Zhenjiang Sports Ground and Jiangsu Education Forest Farm have offices in Jiangpu and Tangshan.

Relocation of National Middle Schools

The province arranged for the relocation of national middle schools in the interior. The National Aquatic School is looking for land along the Yangtze River and the sea, and plans to set it up in Chongming. The National Senior Agricultural School is planned to be located between Jiangyin and Wujin. National Second Middle School. There are more than 300 students from Suzhou and Xinyang who are looking for a school building. If they can find a school building, it would be best. Otherwise, they will be assigned to corresponding provincial schools to continue their studies. National 21st Middle School is looking for a school building in northern Jiangsu. (An)

### Ministry of Education Dispatches Supervisor Peng to Inspect Higher Education in Hunan and Jiangxi

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] To understand the situation of the restoration of higher education in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, the Ministry of Education has dispatched Supervisor Peng Baichuan to inspect the National Chung Cheng University, Chung Cheng Medical College, Jiangxi Provincial Industrial School, Agricultural School, Medical School, Physical Education School, and Engineering School, as well as the National Hunan University and Xiangya Medical College.

### Scientific Conferences to Be Held Grandly in London

[British Embassy, London, 22nd] Two important scientific conferences will be held grandly in London during June and July. One is convened by the Royal Society, and the other includes scientific representatives from various governments of the British Empire. The purpose of the conferences is to strengthen scientific cooperation, reduce duplication of research work, and increase work efficiency. Significant progress has already been made in this cooperation, especially in colonial regions. For example, research on the East African tsetse fly is undertaken by a special committee of the Economic Advisory Committee. The 1939 campaign to prevent rinderpest in Africa was a joint effort. Academic institutions in British colonies enable students scattered in various locations to gather and conduct joint research. The Colonial Development and Welfare Act facilitates closer cooperation in research within the colonial empire. The Colonial Research Committee was established in 1940, with annual research funding reaching 500,000 pounds. The research work of British scientists is mostly directed by British research institutions, but the research institutions of various self-governing dominions have been well organized, and the research groups of various self-governing dominions are extremely supportive of the summer's London scientific conferences.

### Guilin Normal School Petitions: Student Meal Expenses Deficient by More Than Two Million Monthly; Requests Provincial Government to Issue Rice Substitute Funds

[Dazhong News Agency, Guilin] Due to dietary problems, all students of the Provincial Guilin Normal School sent representatives to Guilin to petition the Standing Committee. According to them, in the past, each student could receive 41.4 catties of unpolished rice in public grain and over one hundred yuan in supplementary food expenses per month, which was enough to maintain life. Starting this year, the government stopped issuing public grain and instead provided a meal allowance of 4,000 yuan per student per month, including supplementary food expenses. At the current grain price, this is only enough to last for ten days. The total meal expenses for the 316 students in the school are short by more than 2.8 million yuan per month. The school cannot subsidize the shortfall, and the students are threatened with starvation. If the provincial government does not change its methods, the students will have no choice but to drop out of school or continue to go hungry. The following requests have been submitted to the provincial government: (1) Request the provincial government to change the 4,000 yuan meal allowance to a rice substitute fund equivalent to 41.4 catties of rice at the market price, plus 3,000 yuan for supplementary food expenses. (2) Request the provincial government to allocate and lend current funds to purchase grain in order to alleviate the current food shortage.

### National Northeastern University Prepares to Move Back to Shenyang

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] National Northeastern University, originally located in Shenyang, moved to Santai, Sichuan, after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. It is reported that the university plans to move back to its original site within the year and is actively preparing for it.

### Book Shortage Problem: Mr. Gu Shusen Visits Shanghai Several Times to Discuss Future Solutions

[Our City News] Mr. Gu Shusen, Director of the National Education Department of the Ministry of Education, has recently visited Shanghai several times to seek solutions to the book shortage problem in various regions. Due to paper shortages, transportation difficulties, and the prevalence of puppet textbooks in the recovered areas, the resulting textbook shortage problem has been repeatedly appealed by various parties and has aroused the serious attention of the Ministry of Education. In addition to repeatedly ordering local educational administrative agencies to strictly prohibit and destroy puppet textbooks, and imposing appropriate punishments on those who sell and use them, Director Gu recently came to Shanghai again to investigate the printing and supply of national textbooks. He also consulted with various bookstores to negotiate with the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau and decided that all enemy and puppet newspapers sealed in warehouses would be purchased at cost by the National Textbook Supply Office for use in printing textbooks. Various companies have recently been raising funds to purchase and collect them in order to rush the printing. However, the quantity of sealed enemy paper is very small, and the total number that can be used for printing books is less than 40,000 reams. After returning to Nanjing, Mr. Gu plans to come to Shanghai again within days to guide various companies in finding additional ways to increase purchases and to help solve various technical difficulties, such as investigating the number of students in each province and city and the quantity of books needed, considering the adoption of cooperative methods, and resolving issues such as land and water transport tonnage and time. It is expected that the situation of books for schools in various regions will definitely improve this autumn.

### Respect Teachers Movement

Fully Launched with Notable Achievements

[Our Newspaper News] Under the leadership of the Municipal Education Bureau, all sectors of this city have fully launched the Respect Teachers Movement, achieving notable results. We report to all parties as follows:

School Side

Most school authorities in this city have instructed students to solicit Respect Teachers Donations from their parents. On the parents' side, there are not a few who excuse themselves by claiming that paying the second round of tuition fees is already too much of a burden. However, those who feel that respecting teachers comes first and are eager to donate, believing it is their inescapable duty, account for seven or eight out of ten. Therefore, schools have been fairly successful in raising Respect Teachers Donations.

Committee Members Side

The Respect Teachers Movement Committee has appointed additional staff to post slogans and promote the Respect Teachers Movement with unreserved effort. However, regarding how to donate, the procedures are not yet clear to many committee members. Usually, donations have a register, but this time, because there is no register, many are still waiting and watching. However, some committee members have already donated spontaneously, submitting their donations directly to the designated bank for collection. In addition, committee member Yin Duhe recently broadcasted "The Meaning of Respecting Teachers" on Shanghai Radio, stating briefly: The Respect Teachers Movement is everyone's responsibility. For the sake of our second generation, we should be righteous and willing to contribute enthusiastically. Those with money should contribute money, providing material assistance. Everyone can watch one less play, smoke a few less packs of cigarettes, drink a few less glasses of wine, save on unnecessary expenses, and do a beneficial and righteous deed. Why not do it? Listeners were quite moved. The general director of the association, Mr. Li Ximou, will also broadcast on Shanghai Radio at 8 p.m. today, with the topic "Prospects for Shanghai Education."

Social Side

Famous Peking opera artists Mei Lanfang and Zhou Xinfang have performed charity shows to raise funds for the Respect Teachers Movement. It is also heard that the Peking opera performances of Mei Lanfang and Zhou Xinfang, as well as the singing of Guan Furen and Lang Yuxiu, will first be broadcast on Shanghai Radio. Famous calligraphers and painters Ma Gongyu and Zheng Wuchang have also invited famous calligraphers and painters in Shanghai to prepare for a charity exhibition of calligraphy and painting in support of respecting teachers. In addition, calligrapher Tan Yunshan, in response to the Respect Teachers Movement, has instructed the Wang Xingji Fan Shop to contribute 50% of his commission as Respect Teachers Donations, starting today. As for the business community, the Children's Bookstore has automatically held a "Respect Teachers Movement Week" and donated a percentage of its business revenue. The Wang Kai Photo Studio also automatically donated 300,000 yuan, setting an example for all sectors.

### Rectifying Past Academic Styles

President Zhang Also Addresses Students Yesterday

[Dazhong News Agency] Zhang Yi, President of National Fudan University, due to the professors' suspension of teaching, convened a meeting of all students yesterday morning to address them, rectifying past academic styles, and encouraging all students to earnestly acquire knowledge. He also stated that the school's buildings are still lacking and classrooms are few. In the future, students returning from Chongqing will inevitably face difficulties in attending classes. Therefore, he is currently requesting the relevant authorities to allocate buildings left by the enemy Japanese to solve future difficulties.

### The Health and Hygiene of American Schoolchildren

The illustration shows a nurse testing the eyesight of three girls in an American public school to determine whether or not they need glasses. This is but one of the many health measures. School doctors and nurses begin testing each kindergartener at the beginning of their school years. Several times a year, dentists also check their teeth. If a child has a disease, the school will immediately call the parents to discuss treatment. There is no place to treat dental diseases in the school, but children can visit dental hospitals for free treatment. Early treatment of common diseases can prevent serious conditions later in life. Regular exercises and competitions begin in the lower grades. Students from twelve to eighteen years old engage in more strenuous exercises and are also taught personal health and hygiene.

### Solving Pathways

Pinglin University Preparatory Students Assigned to National Universities

[Dahua News Agency, Beiping] The pathways for the students of the Pinglin Provisional University Preparatory Class have been resolved.

### Ten Trends in American Education

— Jiang Jianbai

In the last ten years or so, the educational administration and the schools themselves in the United States have undergone many new changes and adaptations. In terms of educational theory, the development of pragmatism has led to many revisions to the content of schools. Democracy, as the fundamental goal of education, has faced great threats from various theories in the last decade, and after much refinement, it has both strengthened its responsibilities and clarified its proper focus. Americans believe that democracy is the cornerstone of a free and equal society, with adaptability in people's livelihoods and government forms, developing in a dynamic and progressive process. Therefore, education is a dynamic adaptation that complements and reinforces democracy.

Due to the adaptations arising from environmental needs, the research and exploration of educational leaders, the exchange of ideas, the mobility and implementation of teachers, and the dissemination of new means of communication—newspapers, movies, and radio—among the people, certain opinions and proposals can be harmonized and compromised, gradually converging. The author has summarized the progress in American education over the past decade or so, and the central issues for development in the next ten or twenty years, into ten major trends, and will outline them below:

(1) The Defects of Local Administration and the Development of Central Authority and Responsibility: American education has always emphasized local freedom and development. Although the 111,500 educational administrative units across the United States have common points, they also have significant differences. Most states are only legally in charge, while the federal government has no regulations on educational matters in the constitution. As a result of the development of local units, many malpractices have inevitably occurred in some areas: (1) Manipulation by party factions, (2) Interference by local bullies, (3) Units that are too small to develop independently, (4) Lack of local leaders, (5) Weak economic strength, (6) Difficulties in youth training and relief, (7) Inability to balance and universalize compulsory education, and (8) Reduced educational standards and lack of national adaptability are all significant issues. Therefore, during the Roosevelt administration, there were organizations for youth training and relief, civilian assistance camps, and teacher work administration, all of which were managed by the federal government. During the war, some educational administration was directly handled by the federal government. The federal government's participation in and management of educational matters was originally for relief needs and for areas that could not be managed locally, but over time, it gradually became a precedent. This fact has caused serious disputes in the national education community. On the one hand, it is recognized that local units have certain factual shortcomings and that there should be a need for overall assistance, while on the other hand, it is desired to preserve the free development of localities and to avoid federal control of education. Some educational scholars have a compromise proposal, believing that the federal government should play an encouraging and leading role, and provide as much financial assistance as possible. All matters to be handled should be managed by local governments through administration. In other words, the federal government should subsidize funding without adding control, but certain special matters can also be handled by the central government. In the future, a Federal Education Agency can be established, with the case passed by Congress and directly under Congress, as a leadership research, coordination, and liaison agency. Due to the above-mentioned facts and opinions, future educational administration will, on the one hand, maintain a considerable degree of local freedom, and on the other hand, the central authority and responsibility will also have further development. On the one hand, it cannot be centralism, and on the other hand, it will not be entirely local decentralization. This is the trend for the future.

(2) Education's Social Policy and the Launching of Civil Rights: Educational scholars recognize that education is a social policy, not something transcendent and independent. The objectives set by social policy and the methods it uses should be consistent and mutually reinforcing. Certain objectives must be achieved by certain methods, and only certain methods can achieve the true objectives. The social policy of the United States is democratic socialism, so the social policy of education is to develop democracy—a way of life that is free and equal. Since the goal is to achieve democracy, the method must also be democratic, that is, only democratic methods can achieve democratic goals. The main purpose of educational administration is to promote and develop the goals and methods of this social policy. Therefore, it is necessary to educate young people, train the public, and exert democratic civil rights to make them a source and base of power. The launching of this base relies on the power of education, and the expansion of education's function depends on this base of the public. The American education community deeply feels that local utilitarian groups and individuals exert heavy pressure, causing many obstacles to the progress of education and the welfare of the educated. The only way to resolve this is to appeal to the people, use civil rights, and exert public power, because education belongs to the people and is managed under the trust of the people. Educational administration that educates the people and assists in educational facilities is the spirit of democracy. This has become a common trend loudly and urgently called for by knowledgeable people in the education community.

(3) Implementing Balanced Planning to Accelerate Equal Opportunities: The United States has been implementing compulsory education for several years, and there has certainly been significant progress in both quantity and quality. However, according to surveys and statistics, the number of people who can read but not write and those who cannot read or write still account for 7% to 8% according to American illiteracy standards, and the level of education varies greatly. The basic reason is the difference in economic ability. Taking a class unit as an example, the highest annual expenditure reaches $6,000, while the lowest is only $100, a difference of sixty times. This difference varies from state to state, from county to county within the same state, and from village to village. The disparity between rich and poor families is also shocking. Children are all national treasures and have the right to equal educational opportunities. They cannot be deprived of their due rights in education due to differences in local and family economic strength. In recent years, the United States has made great progress and contributions to the study of educational economics and educational finance. Educational scholars are very aware of the interrelationship between national economic development and educational economics, and have incorporated educational economics into the proper domain of education to break the economic inequality of educational opportunities and implement a balanced plan in educational finance. The content of this plan is based on the existing funding of each school level in each state, to find the average of each state, and then list the average of each state in a table, taking the median number as the national minimum standard. The differences within each state are also handled in this way, setting a minimum standard for a certain state. Each locality should complete the minimum standard of that locality according to its wealth and the degree of effort in raising funds, and the shortfall should be made up by the state's overall planning. Each state should complete the national minimum standard according to its wealth and the degree of effort, and the shortfall should be made up by federal appropriations. In other words, the federal appropriation standard is determined according to the amount needed by each state to complete the national minimum standard. The lower the distance from the national minimum standard, the more appropriations, and the higher the distance, the less appropriations or no appropriations. The method of each state for its localities is also the same. The purpose of this balanced plan is to alleviate economic barriers and increase equal opportunities. The federal government has repeatedly passed appropriation bills in Congress, and the states are implementing them separately. This plan will continue to be promoted and continue to raise standards, and will be a major policy in future educational administration.

(4) Emphasis on Infant Education and Adaptation to Individual Differences in Elementary Schools: Most universities have departments of infant education, and the number of people studying infant education is increasing year by year in proportion. The number of infant education classes established in various places is also increasing year by year. This is because the individual differences and the development and cultivation of interests in infancy occupy an important position, and parents are unable to take care of infants due to work, which affects their future. This is a social responsibility and the work of educators. There will be no end to the development of infant education in the future. As for the elementary school stage, the most significant progress in recent years has been the widespread emphasis on and adaptation to individual differences. There are as many as four or five groups in the same grade, with each group having three, five, or seven students. Their progress is divided according to their intellectual development and interests. The learning experience is presented and guided according to their interests and needs. In addition to the class teachers, there are expert consultant teachers, expert psychology teachers, and specialist doctors and psychiatrists, all of whom are assigned by the educational administrative organs. Large-scale schools have all the personnel, and decentralized small-scale schools are assigned by region. Consultant teachers and psychology expert teachers are particularly common. In the past few years, there has been great progress in the actualization of teaching in elementary education. (To be continued)

### Four Banks Joint Office Revises Investment and Discount Methods, Treating State-Owned and Private Enterprises Equally

The Joint Office of the Bank of China, Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China has revised its investment and discount policy in order to cooperate with the government's economic recovery policy, balance prices, and promote production. The methods that loan applicants should adopt for investment and loans to state-owned and private enterprises, as well as the points they should comply with, have also been revised at the same time. The details are recorded below:

For all investment and loan applications for public and private industrial, mining, agricultural, and forestry enterprises, the branches of the Four Banks Joint Office shall first designate professional personnel, or entrust relevant competent authorities, to conduct a thorough investigation of the personnel organization, business, plant assets, equipment, and operating results of each enterprise. Only those that meet the following conditions may be invested and loaned:

(1) The business is suitable for the economic recovery policy, balancing prices, promoting production, and facilitating trade, and the operation has achieved results.

(2) The organization is sound, the technology is excellent, and the products are selling well.

(3) The machinery, equipment, and raw materials can be continuously supplied, and the work has officially started, or will start in the shortest possible time.

(4) The purpose of the loan is legitimate.

As for state-owned business institutions, if it is necessary to borrow funds in advance for budgetary approvals, they should first obtain a guarantee from the competent authority and file it with the Ministry of Finance before proceeding with the Four Banks and Two Bureaus.

For emergency projects that need funds outside the government budget to promote national policies, they should consult with the highest competent authority of the central government, obtain the consent of the Ministry of Finance, and then proceed with the application after guaranteeing it.

If borrowing working capital outside the government budget and repaying it with its own ability, it should be handled in accordance with the loan methods for private enterprises, and the competent authority shall be responsible for guaranteeing it.

The Four Banks shall carefully audit the financial accounting of the private enterprise units assisted by investment and loans. If deemed necessary, they may send personnel to be stationed in each unit. If the Four Banks believe that the financial accounting of each unit needs to be improved, each unit should accept it as much as possible.

The production items of the invested business units should reach a certain limit, and the monthly production and sales volume and value should be reported to the Four Banks for verification on a regular basis.

If any hoarding and speculation are found in the products manufactured by each borrowing unit, all loan principal and interest, whether due or not, shall be recovered immediately by the office.

Regarding export trade products, for goods that have arrived at the exporting port, the exporter should handle foreign exchange settlement with the bank and apply for packing loans or acceptance drafts.

As for merchants who purchase goods at the place of production, they may negotiate with the Four Banks and Two Bureaus for collateral loans and collateral drafts when purchasing raw materials and manufacturing packaging and transportation at the place of production. The term of this collateral loan shall not exceed three months.

For merchants who pledge daily necessities, they should be limited to merchants who operate in the industry and join the industry association. During the recovery period, each industry may apply for loans by pledging existing raw materials or finished products on the principle of not promoting hoarding and speculation due to insufficient working capital. In addition, transportation will be more convenient in the future, and production enterprises can also apply to the Four Banks for collateral drafts when purchasing raw materials and materials from other ports or transporting finished products to other ports. However, the term of the collateral loan shall not exceed three months and shall not be extended.

The office also stipulates that all central government agencies should clear all loans borrowed with expenses to be received in the past when they expire and should not be extended.

All local government agencies should clear all loans borrowed from the Four Banks in the past within the time limit in accordance with the unified national treasury revenue and expenditure methods stipulated by the Ministry of Finance.

For all industrial, mining, transportation, agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, and trade enterprises belonging to central and local government agencies that have debt relations with the Four Banks, the Four Banks shall investigate their business and, if necessary, recover part or all of the loans before they are due.

In addition to the various loans mentioned above, the Joint Office shall also step up the supervision of borrowers to fulfill their obligations to repay principal and interest in accordance with the agreement for all other joint discount loans.

According to authoritative sources in the Four Banks Joint Office, any industrial, mining, manufacturing, or trading companies that need to borrow funds in the future must complete the procedures before applying. The government authorities, in order to develop state-owned and private enterprises in a mutually complementary manner, have decided to treat state-owned and private enterprises equally for operating capital loans, so as to avoid emphasizing one over the other.

### Police Constantly Patrol, Government Bonds Still Active

Government bonds were slightly active yesterday because the accounts of large investors were full. The meeting places were broken up into smaller units and gathered together in the east and west. However, they were often dispersed by the police. Tongbing opened in the morning and jumped to over 5,700 yuan. Buyers continued to scramble to absorb them, creating a new high price of 5,980 yuan in the middle. However, the price of a thousand yuan was soon frustrated because the buying and selling could not proceed smoothly. The bulls took profits and gradually fell back, with the low price falling to 5,600 yuan. Finally, they still stood above 5,700 yuan. As a result, the price of Jia and Yi rose 470 yuan compared with Saturday, Bing rose 250 yuan, Ding rose 400 yuan, and Wu rose 300 yuan.

### Mexican Gasoline Shipped to China in Separate Packages

[Reuters, Mexico City, 22nd] The Commercial Daily reported that the Chinese oil tanker "Hung Cho" is currently loading a large amount of gasoline in Tampico to be shipped to Shanghai for delivery. The "Hung Cho" is the first Chinese merchant ship to dock in Tampico. It is reported that another large batch of gasoline orders will be shipped to China by Chinese oil tankers. China has become a new market for Mexican gasoline.

### The Result of Rice Loans: Market Prices Steadily Stand at High Peaks, Rumor Has It That 10,000 Bags Will Arrive in Shanghai, Food Administration Office Discusses Suppression and Stabilization Measures

The first phase of the rice industry loan of 100 billion yuan caused rice prices to soar at the beginning of its disbursement, and all sectors expressed dissatisfaction, believing that the measures were a failure. The municipal government and food administration authorities attached great importance to this and, in addition to advising those who received rice loans to immediately go to the producing areas to purchase rice, also sent personnel to secretly investigate the market for any instances of using loans to hoard rice. It is now known that, under the strict supervision of the authorities and the urging of public opinion, most of the rice merchants who obtained loans have indeed sent personnel to Suzhou, Wuxi, Songjiang, Kunshan, Qingpu, Jiashan, and other producing areas to carry out purchases. Among them, 10,000 piculs have been transported to Shanghai by land. They will continue to arrive one after another and will be sold on the market at any time to meet the needs. The food administration authorities declared that rice prices should gradually return to lower levels in the future, with sufficient supply. They hope that major factories or companies that need rice will not purchase it in large quantities on the market, which will cause rice prices to rise. If a large purchase is needed, it is best to go directly to the producing area to purchase it, and the food administration authorities are very willing to assist and facilitate it. It is also known that the Office of the Food Administration Commissioner held a meeting yesterday morning, gathering the persons in charge of the flour mills, rice mills, and grain merchants under its jurisdiction. It was presided over by Acting Commissioner Wang Daren. It is reported that in addition to reviewing past work, the issue of suppressing and stabilizing rice prices and stabilizing the market in the future was discussed.

Yesterday, rice seemed firm in the morning and slack in the afternoon, with little activity. Flour was selling very well and the supply could not meet the demand. It continued to rise again by 300 to 400 yuan, and miscellaneous brands of flour rose by 700 to 800 yuan. Bran was still being digested in the interior and continued to rise again by 500 yuan. Soybeans from Zhejiang were slightly taken and the local street price rose by more than 1,000 yuan. Bean cake was tight in the morning and slack in the afternoon, with the price increasing by 100 yuan. Raw kernels remained stable. Red beans from Hong Kong and Luzon were very popular, and sellers became more firm, with demand exceeding supply, and prices not being offered. The oil market still had a lot of goods arriving and sales were still acceptable. Vegetable oil, green oil, and soybean oil all increased by about 500 to 1,000 yuan. According to rice market news, yesterday, a total of eight types of white japonica rice, totaling more than 8,800 piculs, arrived in the city. The types and piculs are as follows: White japonica 3,964 piculs, thin rice 2,024 piculs, early rice 1,643 piculs, yangxian 128 piculs, duxian 602 piculs, wuxian 120 piculs, baiyuan 200 piculs, yinyuan 180 piculs.

### The Yarn Market Is Mediocre, Small-Scale Yarn Still Has Strong Demand

The yarn market was extremely mediocre yesterday. About 10,000 bales of 20-count Shuangma yarn were not traded because the Cantonese brokers had no intention of buying, so the large-scale factory yarn was lackluster. On the contrary, small-scale yarn was thriving and continued to rise by more than 10,000 yuan. Customers from various ports along the Beijing-Shanghai railway had strong demand for small and medium-sized 20-count yarn. The existing stock still could not meet the demand. Yesterday was also the time for Qufang Jiankai Yarn to offer 29 counts of yarn and thread as usual, with each color from 1 count to 100 counts available. The price of 420-count yarn was marked down by 45,000 yuan, and the rest was average.

### Spot Cotton Trading Is Quite Active

Yesterday, New York American cotton continued to be closed, and there were still no telegrams. Spot cotton trading in this port has become more active. Factories are making a good profit by buying cotton and spinning yarn, so private yarn factories have a strong need for cotton. The intention of industry players to absorb cotton is still strong. Statistics show that 1,350 bales were traded, and the market price was tight, continuing to rise by 1,200 yuan.

### Wool Continues to Arrive with Orders

The wool market was still sluggish yesterday. Retail sales were good, but wholesale sales were limited. British and American orders continued to arrive, such as Wanliding women's colored wool fabrics. In addition, Bi Ji Tu samples used for making suits also arrived in port. It is said that the cost price of each book is 8.5 US dollars, and the market price is 20,000 yuan. Industry players, seeing the high profits from the arrival of goods, all want to be the first to order them. Yesterday, foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson, Lawford, and Changming had transactions.

### Gold and Banknotes Are Both Weak

Yesterday, the spot market was peaceful. Due to the situation, people's minds were still stable. The opening was slightly higher. Securities firms took profits at high prices. Although the allocation price of the Bank of China has not changed, no one remembered it. However, suppliers saw that the gold market had entered a consolidation phase and supplied the market one after another. The price once fell to 1.55 million yuan in the middle of the day, and then gradually stabilized, but the momentum of the rebound was limited. At noon, it was around 1.56 million yuan. The afternoon was also mediocre. As a result, it continued to fall by 15,000 compared with last Saturday. Jewelry gold was 168,000, pure silver was 1,600, and silver dollars were still stable. The hidden discount was average, and the interest rate was from 12% to 15%.

Foreign currency US dollars were settled less frequently, and the buying interest was weak. Holders began to sell off one after another. American firms continued to supply, and the chips gradually became loose. It hovered down from 2,220 yuan in the early morning. It once fell to 2,150 yuan before noon. At noon, it was hovering around 2,170 yuan. The afternoon may be slightly weaker, falling by 10 yuan. As a result, it continued to fall by 55 yuan compared with the previous close. Hong Kong notes were also dragged down by 5 yuan due to the unfavorable overall situation. Hong Kong telegram was 415 yuan, Robi was 515 yuan, and the US exchange rate was still flat, with designated banks supplying 2,050 yuan slightly.

### Chinese Stocks Implement Next-Day Settlement, Market Buying Interest Suddenly Strong, Foreign Stocks Jardine Matheson and British-American Tobacco Are the Hottest

Chinese stocks implemented next-day settlement yesterday, which slightly stimulated people's hearts. The opening immediately saw a slight increase. After the opening, the buying momentum once became strong. Yongsheng Yarn rose to 5,250 yuan, Meiya 4,450 yuan, and Jingfu 450 yuan. Those who took profits rushed in. After that, the situation turned and trading gradually became leisurely. The market situation also changed from splendid to bland. Market prices did not advance but retreated. At noon, all prices were low. Buyers of Yongsheng Yarn and Meiya waited and watched. Meiya was slightly inferior. Qindian sold stocks short, and the price was stronger than Xinguang. The noon close was up 280 yuan for Yongsheng Yarn, only 50 yuan for Meiya, 10 yuan for Jingfu, 18 yuan for Xinguang, and 33 yuan for Qinxing, while the rise and fall of other stocks were slight. The same was true for veteran stocks. Speculative forces in foreign stocks focused on Jardine Matheson and British-American Tobacco. The two hot stocks have both risen to outside the 14,000 yuan mark. Seeing that the situation was hot again, securities firms rushed to make up for it. The two major hot stocks rose straight up, approaching the 15,000 mark near noon. The noon close finally broke through. As a result, Jardine Matheson and British-American Tobacco each rose by less than 10% compared with last Saturday, and the rest followed up by about 5%.

### The Third Allocation of 500 Boxes of Rayon

According to this newspaper, the application procedures for the third allocation of 500 boxes of rayon have been handled by the Electrical Industry Association starting today. The prices are recorded as follows: 1.36 million yuan for 120 count bright, 1.38 million yuan for 120 count semi-dull, and 1.41 million yuan for 75 count semi-dull.

### Chinese Silk: Highly Welcomed by American Silk Industry, But Must Be Inexpensive and Stable

[Reuters, New York, 22nd] According to the Commercial Daily, silk industry circles here believe that the various difficult issues concerning Chinese currency have been sufficiently clarified to resume the import trade of Chinese silk, and declare that they are quite willing to accept China as a permanent source of silk supply. They believe that although there is competition from mixed fiber fabrics, natural silk still occupies a firm place in the American market. Traders are willing to carry out large-scale plans to develop new uses for natural silk and improve its quality.

[Reuters, New York, 22nd] Mr. Doudan, manager of the American Testing Company, recently returned to the country after representing the American government on a tour of Japan. He said: If silk is to compete with rayon fabrics, it must focus on quality rather than price. In order for textile factories to re-adopt silk, it must first be more profitable to use silk as a raw material than rayon. Silk prices must be stabilized, and special attention must be paid to quality.

### Sugar Prices Rise Again

Yesterday, the sugar market was initially soft in the morning because it was the period for another tender. The Central Sand and White Association set a price of 51,500 yuan per thousand, but in the afternoon, because actual sales were still active, prices rose again, reaching 52,500 yuan to 53,000 yuan. Another 3,000 bags of Central Sand and White sugar were tendered at 51,000 yuan, an increase of 7,000 yuan. 2,200 bags of three-and-a-half white sugar were tendered at 61,000 yuan, an increase of 3,000 yuan. All were sold. 1,000 bags of raw sugar were tendered at 48,000 yuan, an increase of 6,000 yuan, but were not all sold. The market is selling 54,500 bags of Central Sand and White sugar.

### Chinese Embroidery Goods

The First Batch in Five Years Has Arrived in Sydney

[Reuters, Sydney, 22nd] The first batch of Chinese embroidery goods in five years has arrived in Sydney, transported by the newly established Sino-Australian Air Transport Company.

### Goods Transportation Not Smooth: Uneven Slackness in Medicinal Materials

Domestic medicinal materials have been sluggish for many months, due to transportation obstructions and frequent interruptions of freight transport. In the Tianjin market, goods from Guangdong can earn double the profit. Merchants from the Guizhou and Xi'an regions often come to purchase goods in person, mostly Guangdong goods. Therefore, although Guangdong goods dealers have received a large batch of Mu Xiang, which has not been seen for several years, namely Yin Yuan Xiang, opening price is 1,650 yuan, old Yuan Xiang opening price is 3,400 yuan, Gong Liao Xiang opening price is 1,000 yuan, Yuan Mo Yao opening price is 700 yuan, etc., the market price is still considered profitable, and Guangdong dealers can also make a profit. Shipping from Shantou has been obstructed for four or five years, but it has now resumed, although only for sporadic mountain goods. There is business from Taiwan, and the quantity is also strong, mostly Sichuan-Han mountain goods. Labor for various dealers in the Shanghai market can therefore remain stable, but Guangdong dealers find it difficult to profit from goods prices due to the lack of smooth shipping, and mostly take a wait-and-see attitude. However, Ming Dang Jie Geng and other mountain goods are urgently needed in Guangdong because they have not been shipped for several years. Sichuan-Han dealers find it difficult to calculate prices for incoming goods, and it is difficult to make a profit on outgoing goods due to the high cost of transportation from Sichuan.

### White Coal Prices Turn Stable, Bituminous Coal Trends Downward Again

The coal market sees sporadic transactions of white coal, and sales are still not smooth. However, it is rumored that the price has stopped falling and turned stable, because a small-scale group organization has recently been formed by Shanghai distributors, setting uniform prices, unlike the previous chaos of selling off at falling prices. The price distributed to dealers is 320,000 yuan per ton for Yangquan Tongkuai (80-90% screened lump) and 220,000 yuan per ton for Sino-British Tongkuai. The price at which dealers resell on the market is 350,000-360,000 yuan for Yangquan screened lump and 220,000-230,000 yuan for Sino-British screened lump. After screening out coal dust and adding handling fees, the profit is extremely small. After bituminous coal was allocated at a flat price from dealers, a small number of factories that have not resumed work are reselling the allocated coal on the market. The market is flooded with goods, market sentiment is weak, and prices continue to trend downward.

### Bank of China Stipulates Principles for Loans to Exporters

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance on January 17, requesting that a simplified method for collecting income tax in the recovered areas be separately formulated, so that municipal businesses could overcome difficulties, consider all aspects, and fulfill the request for handling.

Elements 95 and 96 Discovered

Professor G.T. Seaborg, chemistry professor at the University of Chicago and discoverer of element 93, Plutonium, announced the new discovery of elements 95 and 96 in a speech at the American Chemical Society. Seaborg, who studied atomic bombs with other prominent scientists at the University of Chicago, said that these new elements can be produced by bombarding uranium U238 and plutonium PU239 with high-energy helium ions in a cyclotron. In another speech on December 13 of last year, Seaborg explicitly stated that Plutonium is the basic raw material for making atomic bombs.

British Atomic Scientists Association Established

The British Atomic Scientists Association, representing all scientists in the UK who study atomic science, has been established. The main tasks of the association are:

(1) To disseminate and explain the latest developments in atomic energy to scientists and the public everywhere. (2) To review British and international policies regarding the development and management of atomic energy. (3) To maintain contact with overseas atomic scientists groups at any time.

Another Contribution to Penicillin

Patients with scarlet fever now have to be isolated from the outside world for at least three or four weeks. However, with Penicillin treatment, the isolation period can be shortened to ten days.

### A Tour of the YVA Power Circle

— Lin Han

According to Savage's Yangtze River Hydropower Project plan, a hydropower project will be built in Yichang Gorge, with the power plant located inside a mountain cave (to prevent air raids). It will be equipped with 90 generators, each with approximately 150,000 horsepower, totaling approximately 15 million horsepower, generating 10,056,000 kilowatts. Its supply river reaches Nanjing, Yibin, Chengdu, Guilin, Guiyang, Tianshui and other places. Moreover, this project can absorb the Yangtze River's major floods, irrigate approximately 60 million acres of farmland, and allow giant ships with a displacement of 10,000 tons to reach Chongqing directly.

This is indeed a magnificent and extraordinary plan. Since Savage proposed it to President Chiang and the US government, the governments, industrialists, engineers, and civilians of China and the United States have been constantly thinking about it, dreaming about it day and night! Therefore, I think the draft of the YVA plan has already been drafted in everyone's mind, so-called "Everything is ready, only waiting for the east wind." As long as the project is done well, any plan will become a reality. We might as well take a spiritual tour of this YVA power circle first to get a general idea.

For convenience, let's take Yichang as the center, and draw a circle with the straight-line distance from Yichang to Nanjing or Guilin as the radius. This circle can be called the YVA power circle. Suppose we depart from Shanghai and take a 10,000-ton ocean-going ship straight to Chongqing. When we arrive in Nanjing, we will be able to see the world of electricity. The trams, needless to say, will be faster and more numerous than the foreign-owned trams in Shanghai. The traffic will be so busy that we will not have to wait in long lines or squeeze onto the cars. The political city of Nanjing will surely grow some silent, smokeless factories! At night, it will still be the Nanjing of the daytime. Sailing upstream from Nanjing, if it is a night voyage, you can see cities shining brightly on the shore. The broadcasts of radio will give you comfort and drive away monotony and loneliness. When you get to Wuhan, you may be surprised that the number of smokestacks in Wuhan, the national center of heavy industry, has decreased, or that some of them no longer emit black smoke. But when you go into the factory to visit, you can see that its machines are still moving up and down! In addition, you can find many manufacturers with old brands from Shanghai or ...., or emerging chemical plants, smelting plants, electrical plants, etc., decorating the great Wuhan. Moreover, here, you don't have to call a rickshaw to drag you to Zhongshan Park or Luojia Mountain for a visit as you used to. You can just spend the price of a cigarette to get on the tram and reach your destination comfortably. Also, here, you can choose some inexpensive and high-quality industrial products from the available ones, which are better than imported goods, and you will be completely satisfied. The ship arrives in Yichang—this is a place famous at home and abroad, with factories standing in great numbers, worthy of being the industrial center of VYA! Yichang upstream, past the magnificent water gate, where giant cranes or winches will be used to lift this 10,000-ton ship up, or open the water gate wide to let the giant ship rush up! After entering the Three Gorges, you can't help but stand on the deck and browse the towering cliffs, but you will hear deafening machine noises, and you can see wooden signs hanging in front of each stone cave that say "No Visitors Allowed." You can imagine that in addition to the power plants hidden inside, there are also many national defense-related heavy industries hidden there! When you arrive in Chongqing, the citizens there will surely welcome you, this 10,000-ton ship, with surprise. At that time, you will see Chongqing, which has declined after the war and is now re-energized. The bright capital will no longer have power outages in different districts, and the factories will no longer have to stop work due to a shortage of coal! Here, you have to part ways with the ocean-going ship you took. You can taste the electric train on Chengyu Street. On the way, you can go to Ziliujing to see the electrolytic salt industry there. Chengdu, a famous ancient city, is wearing a thin modern dress, decorated with light industry or chemical industry; from here north to Tianshui, from Baotian, Longhai, Jinpu three railways back to Nanjing, along the way you can see the rising national industry, the previous purely rural life has undergone a revolution, people's lives will always be improved, life will no longer be stained with foreign goods! They have reached the point of self-sufficiency! Or going south from Chongqing to Guiyang, you can see that Guizhou, which is known for its poverty, has changed its appearance, and the saying that "people have no three cents of silver" is no longer applicable. In addition, the aluminum mines stored in Guizhou will be refined in large quantities. Then take the Guizhou-Guangxi railway train from Guiyang to Guilin. This time, it is guaranteed that you will not be stranded in the remote mountains and wilderness due to poor coal quality or lack of coal; when you arrive in Guilin, the booming light industry there, the clear city appearance, and the bustling tourists have given you a very good impression! From here, you can take the Xiang-Gui Road and the Yue-Han Road to see Hunan, the granary of China. The electrified agriculture will arouse your great interest!

After such a rough walk, you will always feel that in this big circle, the face has indeed changed, there are really all kinds of things, everything is electric, you can't see it all, you can't say it all, and there is a feeling of joy.

### Collection of Feelings

— Wang Xingzhuang

Judging from the current situation, the blood of soldiers is cheap, the mouths of public officials are cheap, and the pens of journalists are cheap.

The most profound irony in the world is not produced by writers, but widely exists in every corner of society.

A senator from County submitted a proposal to the Senate, asking the Senate to ask the County government to buy a few atomic cars. People have not used them yet, but some of us advocate buying them. Who says that everything in China is backward? Isn't our enjoyment hundreds of years ahead of others?

Opium, bound feet, braids... are our forgotten national treasures. And the current national treasure is the very simple word "nobility". When a part of the people are overwhelmed by life, the average outsider can easily use "nobility" to shut their mouths. As a result, society is peaceful and tranquil.

### New Words

— Yang Huai

"Spring cold" is not to be feared, it only freezes your hands and feet; be careful! "The coldness of human feelings" will freeze your heart.

A hero is one who can withstand the whip in the open but cannot withstand the tricks in the dark. A great power should also be like this.

The beginning of all "clumsy" things in the world is often the desire to "be clever", and the result is futile.

On the "March 8th" Women's Day, a modern woman took the stage to give a speech:

"...Now prices are soaring, and everything is expensive. However, there is one thing that is the least valuable, and that is the warmth and tenderness of men..."

The women in the audience applauded thunderously.

Deception is the greatest enemy of love, but many people in love like to cultivate this enemy.

Balzac said: "Love is a lovely flower, but you must have the courage to pick it on the edge of a terrible cliff." Therefore, how many careless or clumsy people in ancient and modern times have been buried in the deep valley for that "lovely flower".

A person only feels the joy of deceiving others and forgets the sadness of deceiving himself. - So-called "deceiving others is deceiving oneself."

Humans are the most intelligent of all things, but understanding "between people" is more difficult than mutual understanding between any animals; a country is composed of people, so understanding "between countries" is even more difficult.

### Words of Experience

— Analyzer

(1) Men and women with brilliant personalities possess two talents: the art of dealing with the world and the art of dealing with oneself.

(2) Learn to cope with difficulties and learn to prepare for failure.

(3) You should be temperate, you should be cooperative, and you should be moderate in your ambitions.

(4) Loneliness is not a disaster, but a blessing. It gives us the opportunity to settle our own affairs and the opportunity to formulate our life strategies.

(5) We need lonely thinking and smart introspection.

### Replies to Readers - Medical and Health

Chen Xuelu asks: I was framed by a friend last April, who designed to defraud and embezzle important seals, causing severe mental stimulation. At that time, I only knew that those people had created evidence and the organization was complete, and I could not resist. I was panic-stricken, worried, angry, and suspicious, and finally went to the neurology department of the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. I was hospitalized for 50 days and injected with 25 doses of Yishi Meng factor Lin produced by Yang's Pharmaceutical Factory, thinking that I was cured and discharged. Now, a year later, I feel weak, and many diseases are born, such as dizziness, deafness, blurred vision, especially the mind is like a monkey, thinking is degraded, like the mind and brain are gone, but timid as a mouse, liver fire is strong. I am suffering from such a serious disease in my later years, and a family of six is ​​likely to become hungry corpses. I would like to ask: (1) Is this disease affected by injections? (2) Is there a most effective treatment method, and how long will it take to heal at least? (3) Can traditional Chinese medicines such as Ma Bao be used, and are there any other miraculous pills?

Dr. Tang Renjin answers: (1) Injections will definitely have no effect. (2) Focus on psychotherapy, followed by drugs. You can use brain-boosting and strengthening agents, such as drugs containing arsenic and phosphorus. A good environment of at least one year is required. (3) The drug has no clinical and theoretical basis, and I dare not assert.

Ding Yuanji asks: My father developed herpes zoster on his left arm in July last autumn, and had a small hole on his ankle. Both feet were swollen, and the wetness went down. I asked someone to repair the fire and treat it with vegetarian medicine. The small hole was healed immediately. Unexpectedly, in mid-winter, the same disease occurred on the yin side of his right arm. At the same time, it was also on the ankle. I ignored it, and ate meat as usual, and did not repair the fire. After delaying for half a month, the small hole suddenly healed, and the damp poison went up, and it started to fester, making it difficult to move an inch. For four months, the pain has been unbearable. I would like to ask what medicine is most suitable for treatment?

Dr. Tang Renjin answers: It is best to test the blood once to prove whether there is syphilis, and it is necessary to check whether there is a cause of tuberculosis before determining the treatment plan.

Chen Jianchang asks: I have been suffering from erysipelas for four years. In the beginning, it occurred once a year. In the first half of last year, it recurred once a month. Recently, it has not recurred for more than half a year. I don't know what will happen in the future? My feet are currently swollen. I would like to ask what medicine can be used to reduce the swelling?

Dr. Tang Renjin answers: The medical name for erysipelas is erysipelas. Sulfa preparations can be taken or injected during recurrence. Locally, Iktol ointment can be applied, or magnesium sulfate wet compress can be used. Such treatment can reduce recurrence, but the swelling caused by repeated attacks subsides very slowly.
