### Soviet Troops to Withdraw from City Today; Changchun's Fate to Be Decided; Nationalist Troops Advance Near Siping Street

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] The situation in the Northeast is exceptionally tense. Changchun is on the eve of a storm. Liang Huasheng is currently at the Changtu command post directing troops, removing obstacles to the advance. Du Yuming has largely recovered from his illness and is preparing to leave the pass on the 17th to personally direct military affairs.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] Jinzhou, the military and political center of the Northeast, experienced a scare the night before last. It is reported that plainclothes Communist troops were discovered in an area two *hua li* from Jinzhou, but they were quickly dispersed by Nationalist troops. The situation near Suizhong is also quite tense. Communist troops are gathering forces at the Mingshuitang Gate northwest of the city, intending to attack Suizhong.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] Soviet troops will completely withdraw from Changchun in 24 hours. The newly appointed defense commander, Chen Jiazhen, has agreed with Major General Kalov, who is about to relinquish responsibility for the city's defense, to hold their first and last meeting at 9:30 a.m. on the 14th. At that time, Kalov may provide information on the city's defense. It has not yet been decided whether a simple ceremony will be held. Furthermore, the commander of the 14th Air Force District returned here yesterday from Shenyang and spent the entire day inspecting the two airfields after the Soviet withdrawal. One is the Japanese military airfield from the puppet Manchukuo era, the equipment of which has been completely destroyed, and the buildings are also dilapidated, but the taxiway is still usable. The other is the civil aviation airfield, which is currently in use, and the interior of the airfield is generally intact, only the furniture in the buildings has been moved out. After our takeover, our planes have landed at the airfield three times.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 12th] Communist troops occupied Songjiawuzi, a northwest suburb of Changchun, this afternoon. The area is six or seven kilometers from the city center and has no security teams stationed there, only a small number of civilian armed forces. After the outbreak of the war, all city security teams were ordered to enter their positions. Schools were dismissed early, and some streets have been closed to traffic. Major General Kalov, the Soviet city defense commander, sent his deputy commander to visit Chen Jiazhen to discuss methods for restoring order. Chen has ordered his subordinates to strictly guard their positions, and Soviet tanks have simultaneously moved to suppress the unrest, as the Soviet army is still responsible for the city's defense.

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Military observers commented on the situation in the Northeast, saying that at least four areas in the Northeast are engaged in fierce fighting. The fate of Changchun will be decided in the next 24 hours. Currently, the New First Army is blocked south of Siping Street, and Changchun is almost surrounded by Communist forces. If no miracle occurs, it will be difficult for Nationalist troops to enter Changchun when the last batch of Soviet troops withdraw on the 14th. Recent news indicates that a unit of the New First Army has bypassed the Communist artillery line in the Siping Street area and appeared at Ershichazi (transliteration) on the highway leading to Gongzhuling. Observers believe that although the Nationalist troops succeeded in the surprise attack, it is unlikely to reverse the situation in Changchun, as there are still many Communist defense lines around the city.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 13th] The government troops advancing northward along the Shenyang-Changchun Railway reached an area approximately 30 kilometers from Siping Street on the 8th. They were subsequently subjected to fierce attacks by more than five brigades of Communist troops. By the morning of the 9th, the government troops had cleared the Communist obstacles and advanced to an area 25 kilometers from Siping Street. The Communist troops attacking government forces south of Fushun were unsuccessful due to the government troops' strict defense, and their offensive has now been thwarted. On the 9th, another unit of Communist troops attacked the government troops guarding Da Yingshoutun northeast of Liaoyang, and the attack has not yet ceased.

### Xiong Shihui's Remarks in Shenyang: We Have No Intention of Modifying the Soviet Withdrawal Period; The Allegation of an Agreement to Dismantle Factory Equipment is Pure Fabrication

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 13th] Recently, there have been many rumors about the Soviet withdrawal from the Northeast. To clarify the truth, the reporter visited Xiong Shihui, director of the Northeast Headquarters, who provided the following answers:

Question: It is said that Marshal Malinovsky recently broadcast that the Chinese side requested a delay in the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast before the end of April. Has Director Xiong heard of this?

Answer: I have heard nothing of the sort. Our government has no intention of modifying the deadline for the Soviet withdrawal from the Northeast before the end of April.

Question: It is rumored that the government has reached an agreement with the Soviet Union, especially to dismantle the Shenyang Arsenal and its equipment. Is this true?

Answer: Absolutely not. If there are such rumors, they are fabricated from beginning to end.

### Eight New Chinese Warships Complete Training in the United States

Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Within Three Months

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Wu Guozhen, Minister of Propaganda, is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on the 15th.

### Northeast Begins Arresting War Criminals; Military Tribunal Established in Jinzhou for Trial

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] The authorities responsible for searching for and arresting traitors and war criminals have begun work in the Northeast and have achieved considerable success. It is reported that among the war criminals arrested, there are still many Axis war criminals. Jinzhou will immediately establish a military tribunal to conduct trials.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Since the victory was transferred, the government has been actively processing war criminals. As early as November last year, the War Criminals Processing Committee was organized by various relevant agencies to plan and guide various war criminal processing matters. Recently, a War Criminals Processing Team has been established in the Military Law Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs to carry out this work. Various relevant regulations have been formulated and promulgated to various military agencies for compliance. War criminals have been arrested in large numbers in various places. Fourteen military tribunals for trying war criminals have been designated to be established by various military agencies in various places to carry out trial work separately.

### Decision to Exempt Land Appreciation Tax to Still Collect Tax According to Law

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 13th] It was previously decided that the land appreciation tax in the front and rear provinces and cities should be exempted for one year in the same way as the land value tax. It is now known that there are many difficulties after implementation, because the taxation of land appreciation tax is targeted at landowners, and it is only levied when the ownership is transferred and there is appreciation, which is different from the annual general levy of land value tax. The landowner's flexible filling in of the date of land transfer cannot be controlled. With the decision of the competent authorities, the tax will still be collected according to law. It is reported that the Executive Yuan decided in this meeting to approve the exemption from the exemption.

### News Briefs

### Major and Minor Traitors in Custody in the Capital to be Transferred to the High Court for Trial; Measures for Handling Overseas Traitors Under Discussion

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] According to Judge Li of the Supreme Court: The Supreme Court has not yet received Miao Bin's appeal. All appeals from special traitors will only be decided in writing and not formally. More than one hundred and forty major and minor traitors are planned to be transferred to the Capital High Court for trial. The High Court has decided to open a criminal holding room to detain all the traitors. In the future, they will all be treated as ordinary prisoners, given prison rations, and traitorous families will not be allowed to send food. The High Court's traitor trial court is rushing to make six hundred chairs to serve as the auditorium. Once the puppet Manchukuo ruler Bo Yi Lianjing, the High Court will renovate the traitor trial court in imitation of the courtroom design of the US Federal Court, and its site is still in the Dacheng Hall.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 13th] It is reported that the Army Headquarters believes that domestic traitors are currently being tried separately in various places, and how to deal with overseas Chinese traitors has not yet been specifically decided. One is because during the war, our troops were stationed in various parts of Nanyang. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, our troops have successively withdrawn back to the country, but there are many traitors who were used by the enemy during the war. Now, due to the relationship of sovereignty in various places, we cannot go to establish a court for handling. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee has been contacted for opinions on this matter, and it is heard that the meeting will be opened for discussion.

### Marshall Leaves the United States to Fly to Chongqing; Possible Resumption of Negotiations Between the Nationalist and Communist Parties

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] Marshal Yuan Cheng took a plane to Chongqing at 10 p.m. on the 12th (Eastern Time). Several of Marshal's personal attendants were on the same plane.

[United Press, Chongqing, 13th] The tense relationship between the Nationalists and the Communists during the past few weeks may have cracked, but the current situation has improved. It is believed that this has a lot to do with General Marshall's upcoming visit to China. Observers here believe that during Marshall's return to the United States, the two sides tried their best to attack each other in order to strengthen their respective positions. The failure of the Nationalist and Communist parties to give way to each other on the Northeast issue in the three-person team was not due to the incompetence of General Gillen in guiding the negotiations, but because both sides wanted to strive for the greatest concessions. Today, the news that the Nationalists and Communists are willing to compromise is a good sign of the resumption of negotiations after General Marshall's return to China.

[United Press, Chongqing, 13th] The news that US Special Envoy Marshall is currently on his way back to China seems to give new impetus to political activities in the accompanying capital. Leaders from both the Nationalist and Communist parties held meetings, apparently wanting to end the deadlock that had existed almost since the Marshall envoy returned to Washington. First, there was the meeting of the Comprehensive Subcommittee of the Political Consultative Conference, which attempted to complete the draft constitution so that it could be submitted to the Nanjing National Congress next month. Secondly, there was the meeting of party leaders under the leadership of the Democratic League, calling on the ruling Communist Party and the Kuomintang to quickly reach a compromise on the military and political differences. There is currently no concrete reason to believe that the internal crisis, which had worsened to a dangerous stage during the Marshall envoy's departure from China, has any hope of being resolved. But the optimistic atmosphere here now is very real. There are two main disputes today: first, the most serious issue of the recovery of the Northeast, where Nationalist and Communist troops are in conflict over the reception of the Soviet withdrawal area, and second, the resolution of various controversial points in the draft constitution. An agreement on this matter is very important, because this move can alleviate the current dangerous tensions in the Cambodian Northeast against the background of hundreds of thousands of troops. The Northeast trip of the Military Three-Man Team (including the representative of the Marshall envoy, Shire) may clear the atmosphere and allow the Marshall envoy to start again on the difficult task of national unification.

[United Press, Chongqing, 13th] A spokesman for the Democratic League said today that as a result of many Northeast leaders calling on the Nationalist and Communist leaders to accept the mediation of the Democratic League, the Northeast issue is very likely to be compromised. Chen Cheng, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, has agreed to a proposal that if the Communist army can restrain its troops and allow the government army to recover Changchun and Harbin, the government army will also limit the scope of the Northeast reception.

### Secretary of Zhejiang Province: Lei Fazhang Internally Appointed

Also Serves as Mayor of Hangzhou

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 13th] It is learned that the Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Provincial Government has been internally appointed to Lei Fazhang, and it is heard that he will also temporarily serve as the Mayor of Hangzhou and will go to Zhejiang to take office within days.

### Complete Japanese General Election Results Revealed; Conservative Party Secures Victory; Leaders of Liberal and Progressive Parties State They Do Not Intend to Immediately Demand Resignation of Current Cabinet

[Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 13th] The Japanese government has not yet released the final results of the general election. However, this reporter has learned reliable information from authoritative sources: The Liberal Party won 139 seats (including 5 women), the Progressive Party 91 seats (including 6 women), the Social Democratic Party 93 seats (including 8 women), the Communist Party 5 seats (including 1 woman), the Cooperative Party 16 seats (no women elected), smaller parties 38 seats (including 8 women), and independents 84 seats (including 10 women), for a total of 466 seats.

Furthermore, the Liberal Party is scheduled to convene a general affairs meeting on the 15th and a meeting of elected members on the 18th to determine future policy direction. [Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 13th] In this general election, the individuals with the highest number of personal votes were Social Democratic Party member Kasa Ronofu and the so-called "Father of the Japanese Parliament," Ozaki Yukio.

[United Press Tokyo, 13th] The results of the Japanese general election will be announced before the meeting of the Governmental Section of the Allied General Headquarters on the 17th. General MacArthur is currently preparing an analysis of the election situation. He is particularly pleased that 38 women have been elected to the Diet.

[Reconstruction Daily Tokyo, 13th] As a result of the general election, although the Liberal Party has gained the position of the leading party, it has failed to secure an absolute majority of seats. The Progressive and Social Democratic Parties are also evenly matched. Therefore, the direction of Japanese politics after the general election is likely to become quite complex. Cabinet Secretary Yu Hashi stated today that because the current cabinet has the important mission of revising the constitution, there is no need to resign. He hopes to continue to maintain the cabinet until the special Diet session adjourns. According to Liberal Party President Hatoyama yesterday, he has already stated that he will not immediately demand the resignation of the Shidehara cabinet. Progressive Party leader Saito also said that he would not take an active attitude to push for the resignation of the current cabinet. Currently, Japan cannot overcome the difficult situation through a single party or faction, so he supports the formation of a coalition cabinet by all parties. If the current cabinet wants to continue to exist to complete the mission of constitution-making, it must seek the understanding of all parties.

### Political Platforms of Japan's Five Major Parties

[Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 13th] "Asahi Shimbun" published the political platforms of Japan's five major political parties (Social Democratic Party, Communist Party, Liberal Party, Progressive Party, and Cooperative Party). With the exception of the Communist Party, the other four political parties all retain the Emperor system in their platforms. Regarding the food problem, the Communist Party advocates people's management of food and rationing and suggests exposing hoarded goods. However, the Liberal Party's policy opposes searching for hidden grain among the rich and only suggests raising rice prices, allowing free trade on the market after farmers have paid their grain taxes. As for the outlines of the Progressive and Cooperative Parties, they are similar to the Liberal Party except for one or two points. The Social Democratic Party advocates retaining the Emperor system, which is in line with the opinions of the three right-wing parties and different from the Communist Party. However, in terms of inflation and the food problem, it is consistent with the Communist Party's advocacy. Before the general election, this reporter spoke with people from all walks of life and found that intellectuals tend to support the Social Democratic Party, workers and students most enthusiastically support the Communist Party, but victory will go to the Liberal and Progressive Parties because Japanese farmers still regard the Emperor as sacred and believe that the Liberal and Progressive Parties still represent the Japanese government.

### Soviet Union to Demand Application of Charter to Deal with Franco Regime; Spain Claims Polish Government is a Puppet

[Report from Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 13th Broadcast: A spokesman for the Spanish Embassy stated today that Spain will refuse to attend if the Security Council invites Spain to attend to hear Poland's accusations against the Franco government. It is said that the current government in Warsaw is a puppet regime that is occupied by the Red Army on its land. The spokesman also denied that German scientists had used Spanish gold to experiment with atomic bombs.

[Central News Agency, New York, 12th, United Press] It was learned tonight that when the United Nations Security Council discusses the case of the Spanish Franco regime threatening world peace next week, the Soviet Union will demand that the Security Council apply the United Nations Charter to deal with the current political system in Spain. According to Moscow broadcasts received from London, the Soviet Union believes that this is the time to apply the United Nations Charter for all countries to jointly take action against the Spanish regime. This broadcast was the Soviet Union's response to the British and American positions, which considered that the current situation should be decided by the Spanish people themselves. The Moscow broadcast said: "The Franco fascist regime obviously cannot be regarded as a purely internal Spanish affair." News from London believes that this broadcast represents the official Soviet opinion. Britain may propose that Britain, the United States, and France jointly discuss ways to oppose the Security Council taking action against Franco. If Britain adopts this approach, Britain and the United States will agree on the one hand that the Security Council should discuss the situation in Spain at its meeting next week, and on the other hand, they may try to postpone action by the Security Council. A spokesman for the United States Department of State said: He did not know about the proposal to hold a three-power conference.

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Approaching; Important Issues Await Resolution; Post-War Development of Europe at a Critical Juncture; Entirely Dependent on Whether Countries Can Formulate Plans

[Reuters London, 13th] People in Europe are now awaiting the meeting of the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, which will be held in Paris on the 25th, with particular anxiety, because the post-war development of Europe has now reached a critical juncture, entirely dependent on whether the major powers will formulate a peaceful solution. All European countries now expect the four foreign ministers to answer whether Europe will engage in stable reconstruction work or will allow its political, economic, and social affairs to remain in chaos for a long time. They deeply hope that the major powers can immediately clarify the peace mechanism in Europe. However, in view of the failure of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference to reach an agreement on a peace treaty with any European country, it is almost a luxury to expect the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference to achieve anything in European peace.

[Central News Agency Washington, 12th Special Dispatch] A spokesman for the United States Department of State stated today that he did not know that the three foreign ministers, as reported from London, would hold a consultation in the British capital before attending the Paris meeting on April 25.

### League of Nations to Die After Holding Final Meeting Next Week; Aftermath to Be Handled by Liquidation Committee; Proposal by Our Representative Liang Passed

[United Press Geneva, 12th] The League of Nations Committee today unanimously voted that the League of Nations will announce its dissolution after holding its final meeting next week. Thus, the international peace organization, which has failed for more than 30 years, is declared to be dead. The resolution was proposed by the British representative, and its contents are: (1) The League of Nations will no longer exist after the close of this session, and a liquidation committee will be responsible for handling all closing matters until 1947 and will distribute all assets of the League of Nations to its member states. (2) The International Labor Office will continue to exist and enjoy full autonomy.

[Central News Agency Berne, 12th Special Dispatch] The motion proposed by our representative Liang Long regarding the issue of mandated territories after the dissolution of the League of Nations was passed by the Second Committee on General Issues this afternoon. All representatives present voted in favor, except for the Egyptian representative, who did not vote because he had previously announced reservations on issues related to Palestine.

### UNRRA Supplies Relief to Our Country; Scheduled to End Early Next Year

[United Press Washington, 13th] UNRRA Deputy Director-General Hunter Kendrick, in charge of relief efforts in China, stated today that from the establishment of the UNRRA to April 2 this year, a total of 298,148 tons of relief supplies have been transported to China. It is planned to transport a total of 375 million yuan worth of relief supplies by the end of June, including 111.6 million yuan for food, 22.1 million yuan for clothing and textiles, 24.6 million yuan for medicines, 42 million yuan for agricultural recovery supplies, and 149 million yuan for industrial recovery supplies. China's grain losses due to the war are estimated at 7.7 million tons. In addition to what has already been transported, an additional 3 to 5 million tons of relief supplies are needed. The relief plan for China is scheduled to end in early 1947. China is currently in urgent need of 370,000 tons of rice, and UNRRA is working hard to obtain assistance for this. Rice production in various regions in East Asia is not as good as normal and rely on the Western Hemisphere to export food to provide relief.

— Yin Zhizhong

After the victory of the War of Resistance, the country needs to adjust to truly countless things; among them, promoting economic construction is particularly important. After eight years of war, China has formed a situation of production stagnation, lack of material resources, and economic hardship. The whole country is shrouded in a low-pressure atmosphere of unemployment and lack of support, almost suffocating. The right solution is to achieve several conditions of production recovery, sufficient daily use, and social stability, so that the unemployed have jobs and the unsupported have support. To achieve these conditions, the rapid recovery of industry is, of course, the key to promoting this performance. We have a large number of laboring masses, and we should use their potential strength and material coordination to work together to revitalize our economy and develop our national capital; so that people can use their talents, the land can use its materials, and things can be used to their full extent, then the country can be prosperous and the people can live in peace.

Before the war, in terms of light industry in our country, because of the low wages and the coordination between labor and capital, we were still able to have considerable gains. At that time, Japan's national power was strong and its productivity was high, and our country was inevitably relatively inferior. Now that Germany has been defeated and Japan has surrendered, the general view is that China's industry can replace some of the domestic and foreign markets, or provide a large amount of supplies. On the surface, this is indeed not a fantasy. If we can seize this opportunity, the bowl of China's national capital can be raised, but if we try to look at the current situation, it is a big mistake. Not only can we not be better than before the war, but the country's potential is even more profound than before the war. This is by no means alarmist talk, and everything is in front of us.

Now, the recovery of labor is being hit. There are only two things: first, traffic is obstructed, second, ports, and third, labor unrest, etc.; but in general, it is political instability, which is the failure of speech, and traffic cannot be smooth, and raw materials cannot be supplied. The trend must not be made in order to recover labor. The obstacles mentioned above have little impact on foreign countries, but a great impact on domestic countries. Because foreign transportation can be restored in a considerable period of time, and domestic politics, if it does not take a bright road, the extension of time cannot be predicted. Raw materials naturally have a relationship with transportation, because of the continuous rise in prices, the more workers are unemployed, and the income of workers who have jobs cannot keep up with the high prices; so the increase in workers' requirements for living conditions is very reasonable in my opinion, but I think labor and capital should sincerely cooperate and not mix in any emotions or political effects. The recovery of the national economy, labor and capital occupy equal importance. Wages are raised to a considerable standard, the capital should be frank to accept, and the labor should also work hard with the capital to produce, so that they can sympathize with each other and understand each other, so that industry can gradually recover and gradually prosper. If we cannot follow this path to enter the door, we will definitely suffer both losses, because the ones who will fight with us in the future are not the labor and capital of our country, but the competition with people in domestic and foreign markets.

Don't think that because Germany and Japan have been destroyed, China can sit back and relax to develop our industry and promote our markets. If the understanding and cooperation between labor and capital cannot be improved, I am afraid that not only will the market not be expanded, but it will also be increasingly reduced. For example, after Japan surrendered, we must have the opportunity to replace it in the Nanyang market, so the reason why we can replace it is that Japan is in the process of Tao Rong evolution under the influence of the times and political laws, and it is not allowed to have the opportunity to recover for a while; while our country is taking this opportunity to step up recovery and step up production. After the recovery, we must double, no, multiply by ten times to increase production, so that we can replace Japan's products with our products. "Time waits for no one", this opportunity is fleeting. And today we are still unable to restore our original position, let alone others. At the same time, Japan has been able to freely develop its various light industries under General MacArthur's promise, and is allowed the desire of the Japanese to obtain a better life from production. If we take the raw materials given by the Americans and the power of the hard-working and resilient Japanese people's labor and work together, I am afraid that the fate of China's industry is not optimistic. Then, can China still hope to expand the Nanyang market and other foreign markets now and in the future? Can we still maintain our original position? Looking back again, if the country does not have special incentives or protective policies, Japanese and other countries' goods can still invade our domestic market, then, wouldn't our sweet dreams after victory fall empty?

Recovery, recovery, recovery first, for the sake of my industrial circles that have left their position. - Of course, most of them are forced to do so. - Recovery is to make the labor and capital engaged in the industrial world return to their positions. Capitalists cannot divert capital to speculation, hoarding, high-tech loans, and other abnormal operations, and quickly stick to their positions to produce; this is the capitalists' recovery. The labor side cannot just listen to high-sounding and pursue theories, and under acceptable conditions, quickly return to his position to work hard to produce; this is the labor side's recovery. After both sides recover, cooperate and support each other to achieve their respective satisfaction. We need to know that there is a big self outside of the small self, and there is a country outside of people. Labor and capital must be patient for the sake of the country. The capitalist makes the labor side able to maintain his reasonable life, and the labor side makes the capitalist able to get a considerable profit. We must not go to extremes and use methods. The labor side's launching a strike is used only when it is absolutely necessary. If it is abused, it will lose its sympathy and effectiveness, because when the capitalist really has no way to go, he can only abandon his production career. This situation has been seen many times in various places. It is not allowed for the capitalist to threaten the labor side with closing the factory for no reason; but when he is really unable to support it and there is no way to appeal, he can only take this step. This is a dead end, a dead end for both sides! We must not have this phenomenon happen. If we want to prevent this unfortunate phenomenon, we can only sympathize with each other, understand each other, and be patient with each other.

The opportunity is fleeting. If our labor and capital can truly cooperate sincerely from today onwards, I believe that even if there is external competition, the future is still bright. Unlimited manpower, inexhaustible raw materials, and deep international friendship are all the foundation of our industrial circles, but we can no longer hesitate and wait and see. How the "grand plan" will be in the future, there is no need to talk about it; the labor side and the capital side must quickly recover and sincerely work together hand in hand and work hard in their respective positions.

### Local Dispatches

Songjiang

County Government Seals Up Zhonghua Pawnshop

Han Ren (Korean) Zhuo Shicai, using the name Jiang San of Japan during the enemy's occupation of Songcheng, opened a Zhonghua Pawnshop. After the victory, he changed it to Zhonghua Heji Pawnshop. Zhuo Shicai, fearing that his actions would be reported, secretly left Songcheng and entrusted his brother Zhuo Shirong to manage the pawnshop. Recently, he privately transferred it to Tong Huaiyu to take over. The county government believes that Korean prisoners and overseas Koreans are currently being concentrated for repatriation to their home countries. The handling of all Korean property should naturally be submitted to the provincial government for processing. Before receiving instructions, no unauthorized transfer is allowed. Therefore, officials were immediately dispatched to order the pawnshop to close and all business assets were inventoried and sealed.

### Transfer of Traitor Assets Begins Yesterday; Handling Bureau Conducts Inventory; Assets of Wu Kaisheng and Five Other Households; Complete Transfer Expected to Take Two Months; Difficulties in Handling Discussed by Head of Traitor Asset Section

A large number of assets of traitors seized by a certain military agency under orders began to be transferred yesterday to the Traitor Asset Section of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Bureau for inventory and takeover. It is reported that more than 300 traitors arrested by the military agency in Shanghai have recently been transferred to the court in batches. The traitor assets seized from these more than 300 traitors are listed in a clear list for each household. Yesterday, a part of the clear lists was sent to the Handling Bureau. It is reported that the assets of Wu Yingkaisheng, the puppet ambassador to Italy, and Liu Weijun and other five major traitors were inventoried yesterday. During the transfer and inventory, a special commissioner sent by the Executive Yuan was present as a representative to supervise the transfer. After receiving the traitor assets, the Traitor Asset Section will hand them over to the Central Bank, Central Trust Bureau, and Jianghai Customs for management in accordance with the regulations of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Bureau. It is expected that all the traitor assets will be inventoried within two months.

Many Difficulties in Safekeeping

According to the person in charge of the Traitor Asset Section to the reporter, the handling of traitor assets is not as simple as enemy assets. It is necessary to wait for the court to rule on the traitor's crime before the traitor assets can be disposed of according to the judgment. Therefore, the traitor assets will be temporarily kept in custody. The most troublesome thing for the Handling Bureau is how to dispose of the traitor assets. Especially if a certain traitor is sentenced to death, the main text of the judgment must state "all property will be confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for family members;" what standard should be used for living expenses, and how much should be reserved, there are no regulations in the law. For sentences of five or ten years of imprisonment, whether all the property will be confiscated, or part of the property will be confiscated, and whether the amount of confiscation of property will be increased or decreased with the severity of the crime, there are no clear regulations in the law. Therefore, this group is seeking to establish close contact with the court and consult the judicial authorities on this issue. On the one hand, it is also planning to request instructions from the Executive Yuan to determine a solution. In addition, another difficult problem is the safekeeping problem after the takeover. At present, part of the traitor assets is guarded by soldiers sent by a certain military agency, but after the transfer, the soldiers sent by the military will be withdrawn, and the Handling Bureau will have to transfer a large number of personnel to take over the guard.

Careful Prevention of Corruption

Another part of the traitor's houses is still occupied by their families, and all the property in the house is also ordered to be kept by them. Whether they will continue to be kept by the traitor's family members in the future, or whether other custodians will be entrusted, and how to deal with the houses, are currently under study. It is also planned to invite relevant agencies to discuss and decide on a proper custody method in the near future. The person in charge also said that regarding the gold, silver, jewelry, and antiques in the traitor assets, the Traitor Asset Section will hire experts to identify their authenticity, color, and value, make a sealed package, put diamonds and pearls in the seal, mark the type, accounting price, and price on the outside of the seal, and then include them in a sealed package, one package per household, stating the name of the traitor owner; both ends of the sealed package will be stamped with sealing wax by the person in charge of the transfer and inventory, and sent to the Central Trust Bureau for safekeeping, in order to prevent abuses.

### A Red Dancer is Conned by a Big Swindler; Daring to Impersonate Relatives of Mayor Qian and Making a Big Show; Pretending to be an Attendant, a Bodyguard, and a Rich Man; Chen Lili Actually Falls into the Trap

[Special Dispatch] Chen Lili, a red dancer at the MGM Ballroom (20 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 442 Fumin Road, Nanshi), was recently swindled out of a gold watch and 1 million yuan in legal tender by Huang Bodu (33 years old), a big swindler from Sichuan. The case was only solved yesterday. It is reported that the big swindler falsely claimed that the mayor was his uncle, dressed in Western suits, and acted lavishly. He also claimed that his accomplice Jiang Yiping (from Jingjiang) was his bodyguard and Zhao Atu (from Shaoxing) was his attendant. He also managed to borrow a car from a former bank manager surnamed Zhu and lied that the car was his own. He also forged many documents, such as the Chief Secretary's Office of the state-run China Merchants Bureau issuing a commission to him as a purchasing agent for the Jiangxin ship. When he met Lili a month ago, he spoke sweetly and used various means of seduction. He asked the woman to quit dancing and stay at home. He also forged an "engagement invitation" with Chen, with Mayor Qian's name as the issuer. He also booked the International Hotel on the 31st of last month to hold a fake wedding, with Qian Dajun as the officiant. At first, Chen's parents quite believed it to be true, and they were successively swindled out of 1 million yuan in cash and watches, etc. However, he subsequently avoided meeting, and on the 3rd of this month, the person claiming to be Huang Bodu went to Yongfeng Silver Shop to exchange a gold ring and tricked the woman to go out again. The woman's mother, Ms. Weng, had already discovered that she had been swindled, so she reported it to the Penglai Road Police Station. Branch Director Yao ordered Yao Zhilong, the criminal section chief, and staff members Yang Mianzhi, Zhang Shusheng, Yang Lian'geng, and Chen Hailin to investigate. After ten consecutive days, they finally arrested Huang and the four accomplices, Jiang Yiping, Zhao Atu, and Huang Baobao (a woman who is Huang's concubine), at the Vienna Ballroom at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. They then went to Huang's room No. 38 in the Changzhou Inn at No. 11 Hua'an Lane at the end of North Zhejiang Road, and seized the original stolen watch and a large number of forged documents, resumes, and small photos. The Criminal Section of the Branch has already confirmed that the suspect has committed two previous cases, so the number of victims may be more than just Chen. It is hoped that other victims will report to the Penglai Branch to facilitate verification.

### Residents of Harbin Road and Other Areas Petition

Residents living along Kulun Road, Harbin Road, and other areas in Shanghai East were old tenants before the war. After the victory, they renewed their leases with the owners. However, these houses were occupied by the enemy and puppets during the period of the occupation. At 9:00 yesterday morning, personnel from the police agency went to order all the residents to move immediately. The residents were extremely shocked and gathered at the City Government at 4:00 p.m. to petition for relief. The City Government sent personnel to meet with them and requested assistance from the agency in charge of enemy and puppet housing.

### Xi Yushu Expresses Full Agreement with the Executive Yuan's Housing Allocation Measures

In order to alleviate the housing difficulties of civil servants, the Executive Yuan has specially stipulated seven measures for allocating houses to various agencies in Shanghai. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Mr. Xi Yushu, executive director of the Free Association, and talked about the newly established housing allocation measures. According to Mr. Xi, the allocation measures are not fully in line with the actual situation in this city. Enemy and overseas Chinese living in houses owned by enemies and puppets are ordered to be taken over and sold uniformly, while those not owned by enemies and puppets are ordered to be leased uniformly, which seems unfair. During the period when the enemies and puppets were entrenched, civilian houses were forcibly occupied, and people suffered deeply. Now that the enemies have surrendered for more than half a year, there are many enemy and puppet houses left, most of which have been recovered by the owners for their own residence or leased with a contract. Repairs and renovations to the houses are unavoidable, and a lot of money has been spent. Now that new measures are being formulated late, forcing them to move will cause further damage to the people. Moreover, the contracts concluded by both parties will also become invalid, and the handling of disputes between landlords and tenants will only become more chaotic. I believe that people who return to Shanghai need housing, and we should find ways to solve it. However, I hope that the authorities should prioritize the fair and reasonable allocation of enemy and puppet houses. If it is still not enough, they can negotiate with housing and real estate companies to allocate a part of the housing for civil servants to rent. Forcibly enforcing this will not only infringe on the freedom of people to live, but also increase the pain of the people who have long been trampled on by the enemies and puppets. Government measures should be based on facilitating the people, and should also take into account the facts, so that all laws and regulations can be implemented to the greatest extent possible. I hope that the Executive Yuan will reconsider this housing allocation measure.

### Robbery and Murder on North Henan Road; Boatman Shot Dead

[Special Dispatch] Lu Rongsheng, a 30-year-old from Songjiang, earned his living by rowing a boat. He came to Shanghai from his hometown a few days ago and stayed in a small inn. Yesterday morning at 10:00, he went to a certain bank to withdraw a large amount of legal tender. When he went to the toilet inside No. 365, North Henan Road, bandits followed him. They immediately rushed forward, displayed firearms, and robbed him of the large amount of money he was carrying. Lu shouted for help, and the bandits fired a shot, which hit his abdomen. He fell to the ground injured. The bandits took advantage of the situation to escape with the stolen goods. The injured man was sent to the Municipal Fourth Hospital by the police but died.

### Efforts to Ensure Thoroughness in Grain Loan Processing; Establishment of a Subcommittee to be Responsible for Review

The Shanghai Grain Administration Special Commissioner's Office has been ordered to handle the case of grain merchant loans. There have been many reports in the local newspapers of this city in recent days. The content has slightly varied. In order to clarify the truth, the reporter visited the person in charge of the office, who provided a detailed explanation. The office considers this matter to be of great importance to ensuring the abundance of food for the people of this city, so the handling is extremely prudent and prompt, and the procedures are also as thorough as possible. After approval, a review subcommittee has been established, jointly organized by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Soybeans and Rice Industry Association, and the lending bank, to be responsible for the introduction and review. It is reported that the first batch of reviews includes 17 companies with bank guarantees, but this is a pilot project. If it is effective, it will be continued to promote. Those who apply for loans must follow the procedures stipulated by the office. The procedures are quite strict, and the key points include: the loan must be used entirely to purchase grain in the producing area, and must be sold entirely in the market of this city. The review committee will supervise whether the applicant is handling the matter in accordance with the regulations at any time. If there are any cases of concealment, misrepresentation, speculation, or hoarding, they will be severely punished in accordance with the law once they are discovered.

### Higher Court Yesterday Heard Three Cases of Traitors; Son of the Late Hu Bailongshan; Wang Shuxian Released on Bail, Did Not Appear in Court

[Our Newspaper] The High Court opened one investigation court and two collegiate panels yesterday afternoon to hear cases of accused traitors. The details are as follows:

Wang Shuxian - 54 years old, from Wuxing. He is the son of the late famous calligrapher and painter Wang Yiting, known as Bailongshan Ren. He was recently prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office. The indictment alleges that in March of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), the defendant served as a standing director and head of the Shipping Department of the China Shipping Company, jointly operated by the puppet government's Ministry of Construction and the enemy's East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd. He colluded with another defendant, Yu Jianmin (46 years old, from Zhenhai), to open the New China Shipyard, repairing the puppet ship "Tiansheng Maru" for the enemy. Claiming a lack of funds to pay for the repairs, after the victory of the war of resistance, he took 31.5 tons of iron material and hid it in Nanshi. After being investigated and seized by the Penglai Road Police Station, he was transferred to this office. After investigation, it was deemed that he had violated the Regulations on Punishing Traitors and was therefore prosecuted. After the case was accepted by the High Court, it was personally tried by Court President Liu Yugui yesterday. Wang Shuxian was granted bail and was absent yesterday. According to the defendant's lawyer, the defendant went to Huzhou on business and could not return in time. The other defendant in custody, Yu Jianmin, stated that the China Shipping Company was a commercial institution, and Wang Shuxian had no shares in the New China Shipyard. Regarding the repair of the "Tiansheng Maru," he stated that because the China Shipping Company had no money to pay, 31.5 tons of iron bars and plates were used as collateral. He denied that the "Tiansheng Maru" was used to load military supplies for the enemy. The ship is a small wooden-hulled ship, now renamed "Jianghong Lun" by the China Merchants Bureau, which the court can inquire about. He also hired lawyers Fei Xizhen and Zhou Yongquan to defend him. The court ordered the case to be heard again at a later date.

Shi Yuwen, Luo Tingzhang, Gao Qingyu, and Xing Shimin - These four previously served as police officers at the Huashan Road Branch of the puppet police bureau. In February of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), they were found guilty of extorting Zhu Debao of Daxi Road, Yidingpan Road, and were sentenced to imprisonment by the puppet court. The High Prosecutor's Office is now re-investigating and prosecuting them for treason. A debate court was opened yesterday, and the defendant was defended by lawyer Zhou Yongquan, appointed by the court.

Huang Wenlong - 24 years old, from Shanghai. He graduated from the Nie Zhongcheng Chinese Children's Public School. He was recently reported by Xu Jianyuan, who claimed that Huang had served as a staff member of the Foreign Affairs Section of the puppet Haimen County Government in Jiangsu Province and had used his position to seize 450 bundles of firewood. The High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution, and when the court opened yesterday, the defendant denied all the allegations. He also hired lawyer Gu Wenguang to defend him. The court ordered that the debate in the above two cases be concluded and that the verdict be announced at 2:30 PM on the 20th.

### Credit Eases, Buyers Flock, Gold Prices Gradually Rise, US Dollar Also Breaks Through 2,000 Mark

Red continues to rise yesterday. The Bank of China's allocation price is still 1.6 million. At this time, because the market price is lower, no one registers. It is said that there are 40 bars allocated. Starting next week, the Bank of China will require gold traders to register for allocation, and each bar must prepay a security deposit of 500,000 yuan to prevent returns after registration. After 11:00 AM, it exceeded the allocation price, and the situation became even stronger. The allocation price next Monday is attracting much attention. Whether the gold market will rise again is a critical moment for the Bank of China, which has been controlling it for a long time. It opened flat, and once fell after opening, but buyers used the loose credit to continue their activities. After selling stocks, speculative funds flowed in, and scattered buyers gathered everywhere due to the current situation, gradually pushing the price up. After 10:00 AM, it was still hovering around 1.57 million. When the US dollar exceeded the 2,000 mark, the gold market also broke through the 1.6 million mark. At noon, it was around 1.63 million. After 2:00 PM, some kind of pressure increased, and it broke into the 1.6 million mark again, finally stabilizing, and closing 55,000 higher than the previous day, ornamental gold 174,000, silver ingot 1,500, silver dollar 1,005. The shadow interest rate is even more abundant, with interest rates ranging from 1.2 to 1.6 jiao.

In the foreign exchange market, the US dollar's buying trend was repeatedly launched under semi-speculative and semi-actual sales. Speculators used their abundant strength, coupled with large-scale imports of merchant ships, and non-compliant settlements were bound to borrow cash to offset the price, and the process was very firm. Although the US exchange rate has not changed, the overall trend is upward, and there is hope that Liu will have flexible management. It opened at 1,970 yuan in the morning and struggled around 1,950 yuan. After that, the gold market rose, and US dollar buyers continued to flow in, calling each other. After 11:00 AM, it broke through the 2,000 yuan mark, and at noon it was already standing firmly above the US exchange rate. In the afternoon, the electric market fell back, and the rising trend was blocked. As a result, it closed 70 yuan higher than the previous day. Hong Kong tickets, new and old, are at par value. As a result, the old goods are 5 yuan better, and the new goods are 10 yuan higher. The US exchange bank's transaction price is 2,000 yuan, and the buying price has slightly increased to 1,960 yuan. The Hong Kong Electricity Robbie is stable.

Rumors About Foreign Exchange Lengthening Are Pure Fabrications

[Our Newspaper] For the past two days, gold and currency market speculators have moved with the slightest opportunity, and news about the lengthening of foreign exchange has been circulating from time to time, causing the trend of gold and exchange rates to strengthen again in the past two days. The reporter specifically inquired about this matter from relevant parties. It is reported that the rumor that the supply of foreign exchange positions is limited is completely untrue. The lengthening of foreign exchange is also purely a rumor fabricated by speculators in an attempt to gain speculative profits. Yesterday, the highest peak of the gold market once reached 1.62 million. Seeing the situation, the Central Bank immediately entrusted gold shops to sell a small amount of gold, and the market situation stabilized.

### In the Midst of New Tea Season, Tea Merchants and Companies Spring Up, Planning to Develop Foreign Trade

New teas from various places are coming on the market one after another, and the industry is actively planning to develop foreign trade. Newly established companies are springing up like bamboo shoots after the rain. As for the new Longjing tea, according to news from the Wenhang production areas, customers are still loading and transporting it these days, and it is expected that there will be wholesale arrivals within a few days. Old tea varieties have little turnover and are as tired as before.

### Rice Prices Are Firm, Coarse Grains and Oil Cakes Are All Rising

Yesterday's rice market saw balanced arrivals and sales. Shippers of bagged rice could not make a profit and sold very firmly. Japonica rice rebounded by 300-500 yuan. Both "Baiyuan" and "Laiqu" varieties remained temporarily stable. Arrivals of "Yinyuan" were not as good as sales, and the price continued to rise by 1,000 yuan. Flour from Chaozhou was actively traded, and it rose by another 800-900 yuan. Bean skin gradually increased and continued to increase by its own yuan. Soybeans were firm in the morning. In the afternoon, the price of high-quality soybeans rose by 1,000 yuan due to small purchases from Shantou. The price of medium and low-quality soybeans in the local market rose by 300-500 yuan without being active. Raw peanuts were actively retailed and rose by another 1,000-1,100 yuan. The situation in Shantou was tight, and the price increased slightly by 500-600 yuan to 1,000 yuan at noon. Cotton cake also rose by 100-200 yuan.

Furthermore, according to news from the rice market, a total of more than 6,000 shi of seven types of rice, including japonica rice, arrived in the city yesterday. The types are as follows: japonica rice 3,068 shi, "Baoshao" 1,165 shi, early rice 1,025 shi, "Yang" 390 shi, indica rice 531 shi, "Baiyuan" 77 shi, "Yinyuan" 146 shi.

### White Tung Oil Continues to Arrive, Rosin's Situation is Weak

Exports of white tung oil are still uncertain. Recently, Han tung oil has continued to arrive, which could have been smooth, but exports are still hindered because foreign exchange cannot be calculated. According to a Han telegram, it has fallen to 54,000 yuan, which must be 62,000-63,000 yuan in Shanghai. The US telegram currently shows the price of oil at 38 and 8/3 cents, which seems to be passable based on the current exchange rate, but it is not known whether the exchange rate can stabilize. Therefore, whether foreign trade can be smooth in the future depends on whoever takes the lead. As for domestic sales, they could have been launched, but they were delayed due to prolonged rainfall. The selling prices of various companies have been slightly reduced, generally between 67,000-68,000 yuan and 70,000 yuan, and tung oil continues to arrive. Zhejiang tung oil is expensive, and no one cares about it.

After a long period of rain, the sales of rosin and Shantou could have been prosperous, but the sales of factories that make rosin are still silent, and the sales of soap are not as lively as expected. The reason is that all commodities are trending downward, and the public's psychology cannot help but hope for lower prices, so the way forward has not been smooth. The price that each firm sold over 55,000 yuan, delivery at the factory, now each factory hopes for lower prices, while sellers want to maintain the original price, and the transaction is deadlocked, but the market is indeed weak. Recently, firms have sold Kaihe Benzhi for 60,000 yuan, Inner Ping oil for 50,000 yuan, Degan oil for 46,000 yuan, Lan oil for 42,000 yuan, and Macheng oil for 38,000 yuan.

### Caustic Soda Arrives and Sells, The Saying That Manila is Not Allowed to Export, The Appetite of Hankou Gang is Very Strong

[Our Newspaper] Last month, more than 3,000 barrels of US-made caustic soda from Manila arrived, and the market price plummeted from 600,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan, and there is still no owner. On the green factory side, due to the weak sales of products and weak appetite, it is said that Bu Neimen Foreign Company will arrive with more than 1,000 barrels of Yuepai, which will soon be allocated to each factory. However, according to news from overseas Chinese, Manila does not allow the export of caustic soda. The future market is still expected to rise. In addition, the appetite of the Hankou gang is very strong, the market price in Hankou is around 800,000 yuan, and American goods also need 600,000 yuan. In addition, Fuhua Lin yellow petroleum jelly, bleaching powder, etc., have also arrived in the United States.

### Government Bonds and Chinese Stocks are Gradually Becoming Lukewarm, Speculative Funds Are Concentrated in Foreign Stocks Again, The Hong Kong Stock Market is Established

The situation of government bonds is uncertain, and both bulls and bears have settled each other. Tong Bing opened steadily in the morning, falling to a minimum of 4,220 yuan, and then rising back to around 4,500 yuan. At noon, it hovered below 4,400 yuan. Big players are waiting for opportunities. As a result, Tong Bing Ding rose slightly, Jia Yi remained flat, and Wu Zhong fell slightly. Chinese stocks were initially stable and then weakened. The bulls made their best efforts, but holders transferred their funds abroad, and low prices were seen near noon. The initial high prices were Yongsha 5,330 yuan, Meiya 4,350 yuan, and Weilong 448 yuan. Although there was a lot of struggle along the way, most speculative funds tended to foreign stocks and gold and silver. The selling pressure was strong. As a result, Yongsha Meiya Jingfu three popular stocks each saw a half a share of light. Xinguang Qinxing fell by 10%. Except for Rongfeng's higher transaction price, the rest of the colder stocks continued to decline slightly. In the afternoon, the term delivery for the week ended on Saturday, and speculative funds from foreign stocks in Chinese stocks returned. The power faction of the Chinese Merchants Bank continued to absorb them. The bank's own account was satisfied with the collection of Yisha, and Yinglian became more popular. The supply from foreign merchants was extremely limited. Under the public's favor, foreign stocks also rumored that the stock market organized by Jewish merchants in Hong Kong has been established, which is even more dazzling. Yisha once fell to below 12,000 yuan due to the settlement of overnight profits, but large speculators abandoned Chinese stocks and gradually moved speculative funds. Finally, the price rose steadily. Before noon, both Yisha and Yinglian saw a high price of 14,000 yuan, but then they turned stable due to profit-taking. The afternoon closing was Yisha Yinglian the most popular, rising by about 10% alone, and the rest were stable. The situation followed in the footsteps of Chinese stocks, and only one or two popular stocks were manipulated.

### Yarn Market Wants to Rise but is Powerless, Spot Cotton Trading is Still Good

Yesterday's yarn market started to rise but ended weakly. In the early morning, 20 counts of miscellaneous brands were shouted at a high of 230,000, but because there were few buyers, they could not support it. Moreover, Shuangma did not rise, so it immediately fell back. People's hearts were not as excited as the day before. It is now powerless for the yarn market to rise. Whenever the price is high, a large number of manufacturers will sell, and it is not easy to fly high for a while. Comparing the closing market with the previous day, it is about 10,000 yuan better, but Shuangma fell by 15,000 yuan instead.

Yesterday, New York US cotton plummeted 57 to 72 points, with recent US dollars at 27.30, forward at 27.36, and Meterlin spot at 27.87. Trading of spot cotton in Mubu is still good. Shenxin No. 2 Factory entered 400 bales of Taicang flowers, and the industry did each other, which was quite lively, about 800 to 900 bales. In addition, Fangjian and most private yarn mills did not negotiate, and the market price was slightly softened by the stimulus of the plummeting US cotton.

### Business Information Summary

Sugar: Each gear continued to decline slightly. The China Sugar White Association trained Sheng to 43,500 yuan, and the line sold 44,000 yuan.

Qingbai vs. Judah

Judah has high hopes for this cup, but their star right-winger, Fuen, may not be able to play due to illness. Qingbai will approach the match with the same spirit as their victory against Donghua, so there is no reason for failure.

Donghua vs. Righteous Overseas Chinese Semi-final

Several Donghua players will be unable to play today due to injuries. Dai Jiazhen and Zhuang Youren have decided to be absent. Jia Youliang and Zhang Lingen may play with injuries, and the young player Chen Mingzhe will be used as the right winger. Youliang will play as the right forward, and Long Hai will play as the center forward. With this arrangement, the lineup is considered strong.

It is said that some Americans are also participating in the launch of this "Children's Village," and its effectiveness will depend on its subsequent progress.

### Travel· Speech· Tasting the Sweet, Sour, Bitter, and Spicy: Churchill in America

— March 23rd Dispatch by Air. Special Correspondent in the United States for Three Newspapers, Zhu Jiarang

Former British Prime Minister during the war, Churchill, has returned by ship the day before yesterday after a two-month vacation in the United States. Although Churchill is now in the opposition, his reputation remains strong, especially given the current turbulent world situation, as he is the person who most clearly understands the past events. Therefore, as soon as he arrived in the United States, he naturally attracted the attention of the masses. Coincidentally, the investigation of the Pearl Harbor incident by the Senate and House of Representatives in Washington was still in progress at the time, and some members even proposed inviting Churchill to testify in person. Although the proposal was not passed due to etiquette considerations, it also shows that Churchill is still a figure of the times. Moreover, although he called this a vacation, he was actually very busy, visiting Washington repeatedly, holding cordial talks with Truman, delivering eight speeches, and receiving four honorary doctorates, making the atmosphere quite lively. Americans naturally have both praise and criticism for him, but generally speaking, they are mostly favorable.

Travel Lineup

Churchill arrived in New York on the Queen Elizabeth on January 14th and immediately transferred to Miami, a winter resort in the southern United States, for a rest. He was accompanied by his wife, daughter, two secretaries, one attendant, and two detectives, a total of eight people. This can be said to be his travel lineup. He spent about two-thirds of his time in Miami, USA, truly resting, and began traveling and activity from the beginning of March until he left for England. Now, let's give him a brief itinerary:

Rest Stage

From about January 15th to March 2nd, Churchill spent all his time sunbathing by the sea, watching the scenery, swimming, and exercising. Generally speaking, this old man has had a hard life in recent years, coupled with the difficulty of obtaining materials in England, so he took the opportunity to come to the United States to recuperate. He ate a lot of fresh eggs and local fruits that are rare in England. He also accepted the gift of fine cigars and a wonderful 20-pound fatty chicken. But it is said that Churchill was reluctant to slaughter and eat it. This can be said to be Churchill's stage of resting.

Travel Stage

From about March 3rd to 11th, Churchill met with Truman twice and also visited Secretary of State Bernas, Secretary of War Patterson, and Chief of Staff Eisenhower. His itinerary included Havana, Columbus, Fulton, Richmond, Hyde Park, and Albany, a total of more than ten cities, covering a distance of 10,000 miles. He received four honorary degrees and gave a speech at each, needless to say, the most important of which was the one he gave at Westminster College in Fulton with President Truman. (Churchill had four other speeches, one in Richmond and three in New York, the main points of which have probably been seen in the telegrams, so I won't go into detail here.)

New York Stage

From March 11th to the 20th, when he left the United States, although it was almost the end, it was very tense. As Churchill's trip approached, the New York City government had actively prepared to welcome him, and all the procedures were properly arranged. Especially after Churchill's bombshell speech in Fulton was released, it sparked a widespread wave of welcome and rejection. New York is a diverse city, and security aspects need to be more cautious. Therefore, when Churchill's group arrived by car at Pennsylvania Station, detectives were densely deployed, and the route from the station to his residence was also heavily guarded. The day after Churchill arrived in New York, he went to Albany (the location of the New York State government) to pay a visit to Governor Dewey, and went to Hyde Park to lay a wreath at the tomb of his old partner, the late President Roosevelt. After that, he went to New York to begin accepting the welcome procedures from the city.

New York in the Rain

The New York City government's reception of Churchill reached its climax on March 15th. It happened to be raining heavily that day, but Churchill still proceeded with the planned parade through the city, and New Yorkers were still excited and eager to see him. Surrounded by detectives, Churchill wore a raincoat, held a cigar, and stood in an open car, receiving cheers, always raising his right hand in a V-shape to thank the crowd. This leisurely and elegant demeanor was truly unique. After the parade, he went to City Hall to meet the mayor and receive an honorary citizenship certificate, followed by a grand banquet in the evening, where Churchill gave another great speech, which was broadcasted by all the city's radio stations to every corner of the United States.

Reactions to Speech

Churchill's speech in the United States this time made it clear that he was speaking in his capacity as an opposition figure and based on his personal qualifications, so his words were indeed more unreserved. Therefore, his attitude towards the Soviet Union, an ally, was particularly direct, which led to a counterattack from Moscow and also provoked some resentment in the United States. On the day of the reception at City Hall, a crowd of 1,000 people organized by the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) demonstrated; opposing the city government's move, they actually formed picket lines (This question is customary for workers) to carry out strikes and demonstrations, guarding key points and parading, shouting slogans, and surrounding Churchill's residence. On the 18th, Columbia University awarded Churchill an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Three hours before the event, 700 students also held a temporary meeting, declaring their opposition to Churchill's incitement to war. They strongly opposed Churchill's advocacy of an Anglo-American alliance (which he had denied) and the provocation of a third world war. They also disagreed with Churchill's frequent appeals to the "English-speaking people," because doing so would split the world and leave the Soviet Union, China, India, and others in what position. Furthermore, many people are dissatisfied with the practices of the British Empire, so much so that they directly shouted that the Second World War had inflicted deep pain and that we could no longer sacrifice and fight for British imperialism.

Student Slogans

After the meeting, a group of students also formed picket lines and lined up "waiting" on the side of the school gate, with no fewer than two hundred men and women, with signs hanging on their bodies and shouting slogans in their mouths: "No more blood, sweat and tears," "Uno peace, not a tory war" and so on. But because the police were closely monitoring and limited them to circling in a small area, their shouts were not heard by Churchill. Churchill, as usual, arrived with his wife under the escort of a car, with a cigar in one hand and making a V-shape with the other, smiling as he climbed the steps amid the cheers of the crowd. Churchill is seventy-one years old this year. Perhaps because of this vacation, he looked better and his spirit was particularly radiant. It will not be long before he returns to London and suffers again in the chaotic parliament all night long.

Farewell Speech

Churchill's life in New York was really very busy. In his suite on the top floor of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, he drafted his speeches and often took advantage of his wife and daughter's shopping trips to read the newspapers to observe the reactions. Of course, there were many other social engagements. Until the last day, he went to visit Bishop Spellman and prayed in the church. In summary, Churchill's trip was generally very satisfactory and enjoyable. Even though he encountered criticism and picket lines, and even a gathering demonstration by the "American-Soviet Friendship Association" in New York on his departure, he understood that this was precisely the freedom of speech and assembly of the American people (only thirteen people were detained and charged for disobeying police orders). His own several speeches were all of the same right as President Truman's saying that "we cannot interfere with anyone's speech in this country." Therefore, after getting on the boat and setting off, he once again spoke freely to reporters, and couldn't help but happily say in his farewell speech: "Thank you all, and may God bless you all!" (New York, March 23rd)

### We Also Need to Say a Few Words!

Editor: "According to a United Press Nanjing dispatch on the 17th, in addition to the 300 divisions of the 'regular army,' there are also local and guerrilla troops in various provinces..." This is a section of important news from the front page of a Shanghai newspaper on February 19th. What makes me suspicious is the use of quotation marks around the words "regular army." I want to ask the newspaper whether the "regular army" mentioned by the United Press has the same value as the words "liberated area." If it is believed to have the same value, we must

Raise a Protest

We, tens of thousands of passionate young people, ran into the army when our hometowns fell and participated in the sacred work of resistance against Japan. Moreover, we had to enter military academies for training after the war and travel long distances to serve in the designated units. With a pure heart and passionate blood, we fought the enemy, competing for life and death, year after year. When it comes to treatment, there's nothing to talk about. The misery of life is several times greater than for young people in any era. Eight long years buried our precious youth, but we don't resent it, and we don't blame anyone. Our purpose is right, and our will is pure. We also joined the Kuomintang because (1) the Kuomintang unified China, (2) the Kuomintang led the resistance against Japan, and (3) the Kuomintang has a great leader, an unprecedented great man in Chinese history and a globally recognized great man. We didn't take the wrong path, and we didn't do anything wrong. We don't want anyone to casually look down on our personality, nor do we want anyone to use any means to

Erase Us

Our contributions to the country, and even to doubt the regular army.

Now that the War of Resistance has been won, our group wants to find a new path. We don't want to be soldiers anymore, and we don't want to be ambitious in politics. We are willing to be ordinary people. During the War of Resistance, we suffered untold hardships, even risking our lives, dying and coming back to life several times, but after victory, we don't hope to get tens of thousands of yuan in victory bonuses, nor do we hope to receive thousands of yuan in severance pay. As long as the career is valuable, any sacrifice is worth it. This is the truth, without any falsehood.

But now, apart from a few Kuomintang official newspapers, they open their mouths and scold the Kuomintang for being corrupt, decadent, failing, and having low efficiency, etc. I tell everyone that maybe what they say is true for a few, but not everyone is like that, especially

In the Army

Ninety-nine percent eat coarse rice issued by the military food bureau, wear inferior cloth clothes issued by the Ministry of Military Administration, and receive several thousand yuan a month in living expenses. If it weren't for the leader's inspiration and the national consciousness, how could we have kept going?

Now it seems that Kuomintang members don't talk about democracy or popular will, and other parties and factions use the talk of democracy and popular will. Again, it seems that Kuomintang members are all incompetent, and members of other parties and factions all have the ability to reach the sky. Our group has repeatedly stated that they don't want to have a position in politics because they know they don't have political experience. How many times have people from various parties and factions been in power? What special merits and high abilities have they shown to the people? Political work is like driving a car. It's not something that anyone can say they can do. You need training and real skills. Once you overturn the car, there's no way to fix it. National affairs must not be handed over to novices to do, and even things that have been done too much that make people dissatisfied, and even people who have admitted their mistakes should not be allowed to do it.)

Democracy and Popular Will

Are not unique to the Zhangs and Lis, nor can a few people in Chongqing and a few people in Shanghai represent the national public opinion, nor are they tools for individuals to get promoted and get rich, let alone tools for one party or faction to seize power. When ordinary people see your name, they always ask what you have done in the past and what contributions you have made to the country. I honestly tell everyone that the consistent slogan of ordinary people is that we believe in "Chairman Chiang," and we obey "Chairman Chiang" because he is an outstanding figure in the world and a miracle in Chinese history. We should not maliciously attack the Kuomintang he leads and the people he trusts, and do things that actually undermine his work. Even more, we should not support him in words but do things that mess with him. A country that forgets "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" and only talks about realism, only cares about the interests of one person or one party, and sacrifices the entire nation is a big mistake. The people of the Soviet Union all support Stalin, which is why they have the results they have today. Can the opposition parties in the Soviet Union exist in the country?

We are the regular army of the Chinese National Government. Before 1940, Russian advisors came to help us fight. When attacking Kunlun Pass, we also saw Russian advisors sharing our hardships and walking with us. In 1941, after the Soviet Union and Germany signed a non-aggression treaty, the Russian advisors all ran back, but we still fought on. After the Pearl Harbor incident, a large number of Americans came to help us fight. To this day, the spirit of friendship remains indelible in all the units that have been equipped by Americans. We are the Chinese army recognized by all countries in the world, and also the army recognized as fighting the Japanese. Why are quotation marks still added to the words "regular army"? This is underestimating our military character and personality and questioning our sacred will. We formally raise a serious protest! (Liu [name unclear], Yunzhou, western Yunnan, March 15th)

### General Wang Yaowu in Jinan

— Sixth Day Air Mail, Special Correspondent Jiang Jun Reports

"I am still young and ready to work for another twenty years!" - Wang Yaowu

Among the rising stars in the new China, General Wang Yaowu has recently attracted attention as a newsworthy figure. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, he never suffered a single defeat. The great victory in Western Hunan pioneered the prelude to victory. What kind of person is this commander, renowned both at home and abroad? It is something everyone is interested in.

First, let the reporter describe his appearance: of medium build, with a solemn and upright face, radiating enthusiasm. Hardworking and practical, sincere and humble, he is a typical revolutionary soldier without the habits of corrupt officials.

The general is young, only forty-two, yet he holds the official position of Commander of the Second Pacification Zone. He is a young man engaged in this work. But according to those familiar with the general's character, he possesses the conditions for success. In addition to being promoted through accumulated military achievements, he has something that most people lack: popularity.

General Wang's usual attitude towards people and affairs is: to fulfill obligations more and seek rights less. Because he can do this, he is welcomed everywhere. Everyone knows that the great victory in Western Hunan occupies the most brilliant page in the history of China's War of Resistance. However, General Wang has no arrogance whatsoever. This spirit of winning without being arrogant is truly admirable. Furthermore, his work is as he advocates in his slogan: Do the things people think are the hardest to do, the things people think are the most bitter to do, and the things people think are impossible to do. In other words, he is shouldering the arduous task of cleaning up the mess in Shandong. At the same time, he has another glorious title: Member of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.

Some say that he is a lucky person who achieved success at a young age because in 1930, he was already a regimental commander with the rank of colonel, when he was only twenty-six years old. He also has a spirit of being eager to learn and ask questions, willing to adopt the opinions of his subordinates, and respecting every reasonable suggestion and request. He only employs the talented, without any regional or selfish concepts. In his career history, he has never staged the ugly drama of "setting up positions for people." He does not easily accept someone introduced by a friend, nor does he easily recommend anyone. Among his current senior staff, apart from the chief adjutant, there is no one else who is from Shandong.

He and his staff get along without conflict in terms of public matters. In private, there is even more emotional connection. He often invites company and platoon leaders to share simple meals, listen to their opinions, and express his appreciation for their hard work. Therefore, whenever the troops commanded by General Wang go into battle, the soldiers are all grateful and willing to give their lives, advancing bravely.

Everyone who has ever talked with General Wang feels that the general is kind and approachable, always giving people a pleasant impression. He always maintains harmony with friends and subordinates. However, when working, he is serious and hardworking, without the slightest sloppiness. This excellent style has now been widely adopted by his subordinates through "assimilation." The reporter has noticed that his staff are diligent and conscientious during office hours, and their work mood is as tense as if they were working on the battlefield.

Based on these kinds of facts, we can conclude that General Wang is not only an outstanding military strategist but also has the demeanor of a politician. Yes, he is very interested in politics. He believes that most people in politics in China today lack a spirit of hard work, which has led to the current state of ruin. However, General Wang has no political ambitions. He only hopes to do more things that are beneficial to the country. He once told the reporter, "I am still young and ready to work for another twenty years!"

Film and Drama

### Brief Notes on Kunqu Opera

— Luo Zhenzhi

Since Mei Lanfang performed Kunqu Opera at the Majestic Theatre, the fashion for singing Kunqu in Shanghai has revived. Young women compete to sing and harmonize, transmitting melodies with clarity, beautifully flowing. This is certainly more refined than Hu Cen's style and provides excellent amateur entertainment. Research shows that Kunqu opera originated in the late Ming Dynasty when Wei Liangfu and Liang Bolong invented the "water-grinding tune" in Taicang, paying attention to the four tones, yin and yang, and the five notes, flat and oblique. They selected the best romances and adapted them into Kunqu plays. The so-called "stage steps have drama, sleeves have drama, and the eyes have even more drama," such as the scene in "The Pavilion Meeting" where the character looks at the shadows of the trees, the Drunken Concubine gazing at the clear stream, and Qin Tao seeking his lover in the middle of the night, all are abstractly derived from the lyrics. Even without stage scenery, one can still vaguely see the circumstances of the time. Compared to today's spoken dialogue and film images, which require some effort to understand, Kunqu evokes a lingering sense of contemplation.

Plays such as "Farewell Mother and the Random Arrows," "Assassinating the Tiger," "Wu Yuan Entrusting His Son," "Writing a Memorial to Execute Yang," and "Mother Yue Tattooing the Words" all contain great aspirations of loyalty, filial piety, righteousness, and integrity, and are sufficient to rectify people's hearts. "Red Pear and Western Tower" do not encourage licentiousness, and among Tang Xianzu's "Four Dreams," "The Peony Pavilion" is the most frequently staged. "The Purple Hairpin" only features the scene of "Breaking the Willow at Yangguan Pass," as Li Yi's departure for the army and subsequent loss caused deep sorrow. Huo Xiaoyu sends him off to Ba Bridge, with the lyrics saying: "Tell him not to unsheath his sword wherever he goes beyond the borders, and to have someone send letters on the road." The deep affection and righteousness are so different from today's casual abandonment.

Singing the Xiaosheng (young male role) emphasizes elegance and refinement. In the "Visiting Suo Zhong" scene from "Red Pear," the "Yichun Tune" is melodious and moving. My friend Wu Yizhi, a native of Suzhou, sings the phrase "willing to be drunk with the beautiful woman, brocade zither, emerald screen, pearl curtain" with notes that sound like scattered pearls falling onto a plate, truly delightful to hear. Recently, a guest from Chongqing said that during the War of Resistance, Kunqu opera was still valued in the south, and its popularity signified a shift towards a prosperous and peaceful era.

Wang Junji and Liu Fengshu jointly compiled a music score, which is meticulously researched. Fengshu was from Puyuan, Jiaxing, and his elder brother, Longbo, whose name was Fu Huai, was awarded a scholar's degree in both the Gengzi and Xinchou years. He taught at Peking University and lived with his brother. The brother studied phonology and collected music scores from collectors across the country. After several corrections, the book was finally completed after several years. Wu Shuangya regarded him as a knowledgeable friend and asked Fengshu to fill in the music after he had set the tune for his own play. Liu readily agreed without hesitation. Now both have passed away, but Liu's old residence still exists, with a small garden called Se Garden, thirty miles from the city. Many of his writings remain, housed in a special room. His descendants can still steadfastly maintain the old family customs, leaving a long-lasting legacy.

Pingju Opera Review

### "Chongqing Twenty-Four Hours"

"Chongqing Twenty-Four Hours" uses a comedic approach to reveal many tragic and painful facts of human life, portraying the ugliness and darkness of social customs, and further illustrating a good moral quality that people should have: perseverance and benevolence. It has tears within laughter, and sorrow within joy. In between, there is a heavy mood.

After watching "Chongqing Twenty-Four Hours," we understand the hardships and difficulties of the eight-year war, and the severe tests imposed on the people. They were heavily hammered between the hammer and the lead, they needed patience, and even more they needed to resist that pain, and then they could be reborn and be victorious.

I don't say that everyone has suffered in these eight years, and that everyone can suffer. There were wavering elements in the middle, pessimistic and disappointed people, and even those who undermined the War of Resistance, such as merchants who hoarded goods for speculation, who are good examples. The author wants to expose them, attack them, and let us laugh at their inhumanity, their confusion, and their ugliness.

These are two aspects of society, these are two attitudes to life, and their opposition is ubiquitous. Time has not washed them away, and the eight-year war has not eliminated them. They still exist today; and in the reality of life at this time and place, they have become even more acute. Therefore, "Chongqing Twenty-Four Hours" not only reminds us of the past hardships but also makes us face the present, continuing to maintain the spirit of perseverance and struggle, and carrying it forward.

The director of this play only gets tears within laughter, and he is not willing to let "laughter" become a gimmick, so he can reveal the heavy mood here.

The designer, who is from Chongqing, can grasp the characteristics of the general architecture there, especially the distant view of a house standing firmly outside the window, which further suggests the dilapidated appearance of the building, but there is also a kind of support that refuses to fall down, which symbolizes people's spirit of perseverance in hardship.

Actor Han Fei, with his skilled technique and emotional transformation, tightly grasps the key. He gives us a cheerful and playful character, but his heart is extremely sincere. His portrayal of Kang Tai is successful, and the audience likes him the most. Bi Yun plays a weak and contradictory woman, and her true feelings are compelling. We all shed tears for her sadness and pain. Feng Zhe's Lin Bai cannot please the audience the most, because he is a character with the most speeches, so he must fill the speeches with true feelings to make people close to him, and Feng Zhe's performance can have this advantage. Other actors, such as Fang Bo, Xie Yibing, Yang Yingwu, and Lu Shan, all perform well. This performance is worth watching, because it has advantages in all aspects, and it is a complete performance.

Movie Review

### "Bathing Beauty"

— Chen Wei

The history of film has spanned decades to date, and its progress cannot be fully described in a single word. The techniques used in the current film "Bathing Beauty" can be said to have reached the pinnacle. We can see very vibrant colors in this film, no wonder it was called a "ten-color film" in the rear. In addition, a new instrument called Mares Phere is used, which can avoid the angle of refraction in the water and directly and clearly shoot underwater swimming scenes. Compared with the previous dim and unclear, and the confused scenes of deep blue water, there has been considerable progress.

However, this film, which has gathered so much manpower, material resources, and financial resources, is just a soulless film, without consciousness, without the character of the characters, and in the eyes it is just a group of urban men and women, falling in love, swimming, acting, and jazz music, just like a club. If someone talks about "film is education" again, no matter how many evidences he lists, I am afraid that it will not be applied to the social educational nature of this film. On the contrary, it may be very possible to induce young people to enter the circle of eroticism.

This film has already been shown in Chengdu. At that time, a gentleman in the New China Daily said angrily: "Watching this film can destroy three years of education in one day;" Although this is too much, at least he is well-intentioned, and he advises young men and women in the city not to watch too many erotic films, and to waste their studies and careers, and stagnate on the road of life.

Leaving aside consciousness, let's look at his story. This is a completely copied love story. By chance in the swimming pool, the two will immediately get married before the judge, and soon someone will invite a singer to destroy it, so there are repeated twists and turns, and many jokes, ending this bizarre and nonsensical story. Therefore, like other comedies and farces, it is a film based on a love story.

Red Skelton, has a lot of acting experience, and used to play comedy roles. This time, he plays a composer who, for the sake of love, does not hesitate to sacrifice his time and go to Victoria Women's College to study. He is the only male student in the entire school, so he has to receive the same education as other students, so he takes dance classes, wears a red uniform, and wears a Freshman red hat, which creates a lot of laughter. Skelton is experienced and steady, and his acting skills have reached success.

Two-thirds of the film is played in concert music, and the soundtrack of this band is indeed not bad, and there are also two or three opera scenes, and the scenery and lighting are very good. The most commendable thing is the neatness of the actors, without a trace of disorder.

The skeleton of the whole film is the two swimming scenes at the beginning and the end, and the swimming pool in the latter scene seems to be a stage according to the plot, and this stage is incredible. At the end of the scene, there is a switch that can turn on many sprinklers surrounding the gas pipes in the middle, and the water and fire reflect each other very interestingly, and the material resources can be imagined. Also, the swimming girls are arranged in a pattern, neatly lined up, which cannot be achieved without long-term training, and its manpower and financial resources are also very impressive.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has made this film, but it has no contribution to cultural level and educational level. However, which place and which scene is not full of black market tickets? This is very clearly telling everyone: "What is the love of the metropolitan audience after all?" Alas!

### Film News Snippets

— Zao

"Rebecca"

Speaking of literary films, people who care about movies will always think of "Rebecca." It and "Gone with the Wind" are both works that were prominent at the time, and their natures are the same, but each has its own strengths, and they can be said to be a pair of jewels that illuminate the film world, and the impressions they have left on the audience are still very deep.

In terms of the crowding of viewers, it is undeniable that "Rebecca" is not as good as "Gone with the Wind," but this cannot be used as a standard to measure the merits of the two films. The former's achievements in art have their own unique merits.

Recently, an American film magazine published that the New York University Film School believes that the techniques and characteristics of "Rebecca" are worth analyzing and studying, and has listed it as one of the five masterpieces of film, and placed it in the film library established by the school for the five films as research material. Also, when selecting the film, a ceremony was held, presided over by Dr. Harold O Voorhis, Vice President of the school, who judged it and made a detailed argument on the film's characteristics.

From the above facts, it can be seen that "Rebecca" can be so praised and valued by scholars who study films, and its true value can also be seen. As for the remaining four films, they are: "Stagecoach," "The Great McGinty," "Here Comes Mr. Jordan," and "The Grapes of Wrath."

Those who hold this stock can submit a request to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau for verification and handling.

Anonymous Poor Person asks: During the War of Resistance in Shanghai, the government issued patriotic bonds, and those who purchased them were all enthusiastic patriots. These patriots would certainly not do anything that would assist the enemy or hoard goods. The difficult situation over the past eight years is self-evident. I also purchased some of these bonds, but recently, due to urgent needs, I tried to mortgage these bonds to a friend, but was not granted. I wonder if these bonds can be mortgaged to a bank? If you know anything, please provide details in your column, much appreciated.

It is said that the market price of this bond is around 2,000 yuan, but it has not been traded for a long time. Because there is no formal transaction, it is not easy to use it as collateral.
