### Citywide Display of National Flags to Warmly Welcome Chairman Chiang's Arrival in Shanghai from Chongqing Yesterday, for a Victory Parade to Console the People

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] Chairman Chiang departed from Chongqing by special plane on the morning of the 11th for Shanghai, and is scheduled to return to Chongqing within the month.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th Special Dispatch] The special plane carrying Chairman Chiang to Shanghai passed over Nanjing at 4:00 PM today. Upon hearing the news, the citizens of the city were greatly excited. Evening newspapers prominently published the news that the price of pure gold in Shanghai had plummeted due to Chairman's arrival. A selling spree also occurred in the Nanjing market, and the prices of general goods have generally declined.

[Our Newspaper] Our leader in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, Chairman Chiang, arrived safely in Shanghai at 4:20 PM yesterday (the 11th), amidst the warm welcome of the city's citizens, for his first inspection tour after the victory.

Chairman Chiang's special plane, the "Meiling," landed at Longhua Airport at 4:20 PM. Those accompanying Chairman Chiang to Shanghai included Chief Commissioner Zhang Daofan, Director of the National Government Military Affairs Bureau Yu Jishi, Director of the General Affairs Bureau Chen Xizeng, Chief Adjutant Tang Zong, Secretary Zhou Hongtao, Director of the Guard Room Li Tiehan, Head of the Guard Group Zhu Peiji, and Aide-de-Camp Wu Wenzhi, totaling nine individuals. Chairman's accompanying guards arrived in Shanghai earlier at 4:00 PM, aboard a C-47 aircraft, number 260.

The "Meiling" special plane was originally scheduled to land at Jiangwan Airport, but after a brief stopover in Hankou, it was temporarily changed to Longhua Airport. Upon receiving the news, Mayor Qian rushed to the Chairman's private residence on Jia'er Road, to accompany Madame Chiang to the airport to welcome him. Those who went to the airport to welcome him also included Huang Renlin, Zhou Zhirou, Xuan Tiewu, General Wedemeyer, Admiral Kirk, Air Force Chief of Staff McNair, and many heads of Chinese and foreign agencies. Chairman, wearing a black woolen overcoat and radiating vitality, smiled and shook hands with each of the welcomers after disembarking. He then rode in a car with his wife back to their private residence on Jia'er Road.

The people of Shanghai have been separated from Chairman for eight years and nine months. The last time Chairman came to Shanghai before the War of Resistance was on May 6, 1937, when he flew from Nanjing to Shanghai for medical treatment. He then flew from Shanghai back to Nanjing with Qian Dajun and others on May 17. During the War of Resistance, Chairman personally went to the front lines of the Shanghai area for inspection, but at that time, his movements were kept very secret, and very few outsiders knew about it. As of last night, the length of Chairman's stay in Shanghai has not been officially disclosed. It is reported that Chairman's visit to Shanghai is specifically to console the loyal, struggling, and sacrificing citizens of Shanghai. Chairman and his wife will host local reporters in the coming days.

The enthusiastic welcome of Shanghai citizens for Chairman is a rare sight after the victory. After the citizens of Shanghai received the news of Chairman's arrival this morning, they hung national flags and set off firecrackers to celebrate. The masses all thought that the special plane carrying Chairman would land at Jiangwan Airport, so before noon, Beisichuan Road and Jiangwan Road were crowded with welcomers. Along Jiangwan Road, soldiers and police were stationed from noon onwards, and citizens lined the streets to catch a glimpse of Chairman's demeanor. However, the "Meiling" special plane was temporarily changed to land at Longhua Airport, and over ten thousand citizens waited until dusk before dispersing.

Chairman's special plane took off from Jiunengpo Airport at around 10:00 AM. As early as 8:14 AM, Chairman's entourage took off in two C47 aircraft. The "Meiling" and other two special planes arrived in Hankou at around 2:00 PM, and after a brief stopover, they took off for Shanghai. After inspecting Beiping at the end of last year, Chairman had the intention of visiting Shanghai when he arrived in Nanjing. Later, due to the arrival of US Special Envoy General Marshall in China, he returned to Chongqing, and the trip to Shanghai did not materialize. Chairman's visit to Shanghai this time has the same meaning as his trip to Peiping last year, that is, to console the people, inspect various situations, and inquire about the people's concerns. It is reported that Chairman may meet with responsible persons from all walks of life in the coming days to inquire about the situation in Shanghai.

### Local Commanders Tasked to Assist in Restoring Transportation Lines, Executive Headquarters Announced Agreement Among Three Commissioners

[US News Agency, Beiping, 11th] The Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation issued Joint Communique No. 10 today, stating briefly: The three commissioners of the Executive Headquarters have reached an agreement to immediately restore transportation lines in North and Central China.

The following order has been issued today to the governments and Communist military commanders in North and Central China for their information. (1) All commanders should immediately take all steps to assist in the reconstruction of transportation lines as part of their fulfillment of the ceasefire order. These transportation lines include all highways, railways, waterways, postal facilities, telephone lines, telegraph lines, or radio devices. (2) All commanders should immediately remove or destroy all mines, naval mines, fortifications, anti-theft devices, fortresses, and other military works on or along all transportation lines. All military facilities that may impede transportation operations should be removed or destroyed. All acts that obstruct civilian travel and cargo transportation, such as forced inspections, damage to private goods or commerce, and illegal measures that obstruct postal and telecommunications services for any reason, should be stopped or eliminated. (3) All commanders should be responsible for protecting the technical personnel and workers of the transportation line repair teams. Any movement of troops for this purpose should be approved by the Executive Headquarters. (4) All commanders should be responsible for assisting the repair teams with the labor, food, housing, and other necessities required locally in all feasible ways. Labor should be given appropriate remuneration and should not be coerced. All commanders should also be responsible to the fullest extent possible for returning rails, equipment, and supplies that were accidentally moved due to the War of Resistance or subsequent self-defense. (5) All commanders should be responsible for executing the above tasks within their areas of control (the area controlled at 12:00 PM on January 13, 1946). Reconstruction work will be completed by personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Transportation under the supervision of the Executive Headquarters. The Executive Headquarters will dispatch executive groups to major regions to inspect transportation restoration work and, if necessary, will also go to other regions. Other instructions will be issued from time to time as appropriate. At this time, it is hoped that this highest responsibility, second only to stopping the conflict, will be entrusted to all commanders. It is hoped that all commanders will understand that this is to rebuild peace and prosperity in China. With the permission of those participating in the Chongqing negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the commissioners of the Executive Headquarters agree that neither the National Government nor the Communist Party can take military advantage of the restoration of transportation lines. Absolutely no troop movements or armed forces are permitted on the reopened transportation lines except with the permission of the Executive Headquarters. The restoration of long-severed Chinese transportation lines and the spirit of cooperation required to implement this matter will be regarded by all sectors of society and the world as an expression of sincerity on the part of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for a genuine and effective ceasefire. At this favorable time, all commanders should place this motivation above all else in order to achieve lasting peace. In addition to the above agreement and order, the Executive Headquarters today requested the National Government to provide technical personnel to complete the reconstruction of the railways, and at the same time requested the Ministry of Transportation to have its representatives contact the Executive Headquarters executive team as soon as possible.

Regarding the agreement to order all commanders to restore transportation lines and the request to the Ministry of Transportation to immediately restore railway reconstruction work, the commissioners have passed the following principles:

(A) For the convenience of this agreement, the word "temporary" refers to the period before the National Government agreed upon by all parties is formed and the execution is declared.

(B) Regarding the reconstruction of railways and the work in Central and North China, the representatives of the Ministry of Transportation will initially be placed under the supervision of the Executive Headquarters. This supervision will be terminated immediately after the above-mentioned temporary period has passed, but with the unanimous agreement of the commissioners, this management can be waived at other times or for other reasons.

(C) Railway Management Group. In order to facilitate the smooth implementation of railway construction and execution in North and Central China, a railway management group will be established within the Executive Headquarters executive team. Generally speaking, the railway management group will not interfere in technical matters of construction and execution, but will focus on

(D) Railway Protection. During the period, the leaders of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will each include these teams, including technicians and workers. This measure can prevent the recurrence of destruction. Any troop movements required for this goal must be approved by the Executive Headquarters.

(E) Training of guards. Administrative management and executive personnel will be placed directly under the management of the representatives of the Ministry of Transportation and supervised by the Executive Headquarters.

(F) Priority of Construction. The priority of construction and activities of each railway line will depend on its relationship with the national economic recovery. The railway needs used to facilitate the disarming of the Japanese army and the repatriation of Japanese to their country will be fully considered.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] In order to understand the transportation takeover situation and restoration status in various places, the Ministry of Transportation has organized two inspection teams, one for Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) and one for Jiangbei (north of the Yangtze River). The southern team is led by former Director of the Highway Department Yang Chengxun, and has left Shanghai with more than ten team members for Taiwan. The northern team is led by Ministry of Transportation Technical Supervisor Wei Yifu, and this morning led eleven team members by special plane to various parts of North China, as well as Dalian and Zhangjiakou, to inspect.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] The door to negotiations on the restoration of transportation has not been closed, but the door to success has not been opened either. What are the specific opinions of the Communist Party on the restoration of transportation? No official and specific explanation has been given in the past two weeks. Today, the Beiping branch of Xinhua News Agency revealed the Communist Party's claims as follows: (1) It should be guaranteed that railway transportation will not be used for military purposes and will not be affected by military affairs. For this reason, a neutral railway bureau and railway police should be organized, composed of personnel from both the National Government and the Liberated Areas. The former puppet police under the enemy and puppet rule should be disbanded. In the railway police and leadership organizations at all levels of the railway in North and Central China, such as the director and deputy director, the director and deputy director of each department, the director and deputy director of each section, and the director and deputy director of each station, personnel from the "Liberated Areas" should participate. Which party is the head and which is the deputy can be decided by the alliance according to local conditions. (2) Both parties should be responsible for quickly removing all obstacles on the traffic lines. The minefields set up by both parties should be removed by both parties. The fortifications and other blockade line works should also be completely removed. Those that are still under construction should be stopped immediately and leveled. (3) In the work of restoring transportation, the principle of cherishing the people's strength should be strictly observed. Military labor should not be used to avoid possible disturbances or other disputes. (4) Transportation should be restored in a broad sense, and travel inspections and mail inspections should be cancelled.

### The Yalta Secret Agreement Announced Simultaneously by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union Stipulating the Conditions for the Soviet Union's Declaration of War Against Japan

[United Press, Washington, 11th] The Soviet Union joined the Yalta Agreement a year ago today, and decided to declare war on Japan. It proposed three conditions, the content of which had been kept secret until now. The secret clauses were released simultaneously in Washington, London, and Moscow today. According to the clauses, the Soviet Union should join the Far East War within two to three months after Germany's surrender. It was generally speculated in the past that the dropping of the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6 last year prompted the Soviet Union to advance the date of the declaration of war. In fact, Germany surrendered on May 7 last year, and the Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 8, which was exactly three months. The agreement frankly stipulates that "the Kuril Islands will be transferred to the Soviet Union." The other two conditions are as follows:

(1) The status of the People's Republic of Outer Mongolia should remain unchanged.

(2) All Soviet rights before "Japan's perfidious attack in 1904" should be restored, including: (A) The return of the southern part of Sakhalin Island and its adjacent islands to the Soviet Union, (B) Dalian is an international port, and Lushun is returned to the Soviet Union for lease, (C) Sino-Soviet co-management of the Middle East Solution. It states: "The leaders of the three great powers have agreed that the various demands made by the Soviet Union should be earnestly fulfilled after Japan's defeat."

US Secretary of State Byrnes also issued a statement at the same time, saying: This clause is kept "extremely secret" and there is sufficient reason, because if Japan learns the content of the agreement, it will immediately attack the Soviet Union, which will increase the sacrifices of the US military and encounter more difficulties.

### Byrnes Statement

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] The Yalta Conference has passed a year, and its secret agreement was also announced today. US Secretary of State Byrnes also issued a statement at the same time, defending the late President Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin for keeping this agreement secret, and saying: The relationship between China and the Soviet Union is not bound by this memorandum, but is actually within the scope of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 14 of that year. When the country announces this secret agreement and issues a statement at the same time, it specifically explains the price of the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan. Byrnes said: When announcing this agreement, we should pay attention to the aspect of the Chinese government on this agreement. The relationship between China and the Soviet Union is not bound by this memorandum, but is completely based on the terms of the Sino-Soviet Treaty signed in Moscow on August 14 of that year, and the agreements between the two governments thereafter. Byrnes said: The three leaders believed that this was a "military agreement" and should be "strictly confidential" because the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan was based on this agreement. Soviet leaders had notified US military generals that the Soviet Union would not be able to participate in the war against Japan within ninety days after Germany's surrender, because it would take ninety days for the Soviet troops to be transferred to the front line of the war against Japan. At that time, the Allied forces were busy in the west, and they still needed the Soviet Union to help in the east. If Japan learns the content of the agreement, it will immediately attack the Soviet Union, and the result will inevitably be that the Soviet army will withdraw from the eastern front. Byrnes said: He did not learn the content of this agreement until September 2, 1945, after Japan surrendered on August 12 of that year.

### The Minyun Steamer Had an Accident, It is Said that 130 Passengers Have Not Been Rescued

### The Reorganization of the National Government is Still Under Discussion, It Will Be Realized After the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, and the Nanjing National Assembly Hall Will Be Repaired Immediately

[United Press, Chongqing, 11th] Regarding the reorganization of the National Government, behind-the-scenes negotiations are continuing, and it is generally expected to be realized after the closing of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee on March 7. The Communist Party and the Democratic League have not yet nominated candidates to participate in the Administrative Yuan Political Affairs Committee. Dong Yu first wanted to know who would be appointed as the dean, and what kind of ministers the government would give to the two parties. At the same time, the method of allocating the twenty seats in the National Government Committee occupied by other Gu parties and non-partisan people has not been discussed. It is heard that non-partisan people suggested that they occupy five seats, the Communist Party occupies seven seats, and the Democratic League and the Youth Party each occupy four seats.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] According to Hong Lanyou, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs, the plan to repair the National Assembly Hall has been reported to the National Government, and bidding for construction can be invited in the coming days, which is expected to be completed in two months. The issue of National Assembly representatives has been specifically discussed by the Political Consultative Conference, and will be submitted to the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee for approval and implementation by the government. The rumor that National Assembly representatives will come to Nanjing to hold a preparatory meeting is understood to be a plan for some representatives to exchange opinions and connect emotionally. Currently, the preparatory work for the National Assembly has come to an end in terms of affairs.

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 11th] The Jiangxi National Assembly representative, Su Cunzhuang, and others were presumed to go to Nanjing first to participate in the preparatory meeting, and telegraphed the central government to rush to repair the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Nanchang-Xunyang Railways to facilitate transportation. Su and others will set off for Nanjing in the coming days.

### Soviet Army Posts Notices in Shenyang, Harbin, and Changchun: Withdrawal Set for June 1st; New Concoctions Brewing in Inner Mongolia under Soviet Incitement

[United Press International Tianjin, 11th] According to sources in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia is brewing the formation of an autonomous government with Soviet assistance. Once established, this government will form another buffer zone between the Soviet Union and Asia. It is claimed that the government is located in Wangye Temple, Xingan Province, and is being organized by a 19-member committee jointly formed by the Chinese Communist Party and Soviet Army advisors. Recently, Outer Mongolia declared independence, and at the same time, the Soviet army entered and stationed itself in Northeast China, wielding influence over Dalian's free port. Now, with the establishment of an autonomous government in Inner Mongolia, the buffer zone is complete. The chairman of the committee is Lieutenant General Bai Xinen (transliteration), former commander of the Mongolian Security Force. Wangye Temple is currently garrisoned by Soviet cavalry units, and it is reported that Soviet officials are also participating in the committee. The available military force is estimated at 10,000 men, all equipped with Japanese weapons, of which 4,000 are under the command of General Bai and 2,000 are Chinese Communist troops. Another report claims that the autonomous government is expanding its influence to other towns in Xingan Province. The new government will be formally established in a month or six weeks. Meanwhile, the Soviet army is still stationed in Shenyang and other parts of Northeast China. Reports from several major cities in Northeast China state that the Soviet army has posted notices in Shenyang, Harbin, and Changchun stating that they will remain in Northeast China until June 1st before withdrawing. According to residents who have lived in Northeast China for a long time, they do not believe that the Soviet army will withdraw from Northeast China before the American troops withdraw from North China, and a considerable amount of time will still need to pass. The Soviet army was originally scheduled to withdraw from Shenyang on February 1st, and General Du Weiming's troops have been waiting to enter the city since November of last year, but to date, General Du's troops have shown no signs of advancing, only moving 20 to 30 miles closer to the city. It is reported that Shenyang residents are now under strict control by the Soviet army, German expatriates are still confined to their homes, and the transportation of heavy machinery to Dalian continues. The Soviet army's plan to protect the free port area is apparently still in progress. In the Yingkou area north of Dalian, along the coast of the Liaodong Bay, Chinese Communist troops are reportedly building fortifications.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] The flag of the "East Mongolian Autonomous Republic" has a red background with a yellow hoe (not a sickle) and a herding whip.

[Agence France-Presse, Beiping, 10th] It is reported that the Northeast Political Affairs Committee has established a three-member subcommittee to handle the Mongolian nomadic peoples scattered across the eastern and western grasslands of the Xing'an Mountains and the northwestern part of Northeast China.

It is said that Shen will wait for Zhang Jia'ao to return to Beiping from Chongqing before deciding on his next move. Zhang's trip to Chongqing was originally scheduled to last two or three days, but his return is now delayed, indicating that diplomatic issues have not yet been resolved smoothly. Hu Jiafeng, the secretary-general of the Executive Headquarters, plans to lead a group of Executive Headquarters personnel to Changchun soon, but whether or not he can make the trip depends on the outcome of Zhang Jia'ao's trip to Chongqing.

### Eisenhower's Speech: America Must Maintain Strength; Military and Civilians Alike Must Be Ready to Address Threats; Genuine International Cooperation Requires Eliminating Suspicion

[United Press, Washington, 11th] U.S. Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower, in a speech to the masses today, said: The United States must maintain its strength until the world is fully prepared to abandon the use of force as a means of resolving international disputes. We must be prepared, or else fear will cloud our judgment and weaken our strength to the point of uselessness. Our army, navy, air force, and the entire nation must be ready to defend the principles we believe to be just and sacred, and to address any threat. I vow to you that to the extent of my power, I will do everything possible to eradicate the ignorance, intolerance, and stupidity that mislead nations into using force to aggress and cause you suffering. Regarding the issue of building peace, must it be driven by a shared and deadly fear before people can cooperate? This is necessary to defeat a strong enemy and is essential for peaceful coordination. Those who do not understand us must engage with us; those who suspect our motives must cooperate with us, for we also sometimes suspect the motives of others. To achieve genuine cooperation, such suspicion must be eliminated.

### Security Council Continues to Discuss the East Indies Issue; U.S. Representative Holds Decisive Position; Will Oppose Organizing a Committee to Conduct Investigations; British Cabinet Unanimously Supports Bevin's Stance

[This Newspaper Report] London, 11th Broadcast: In a few hours, the Security Council will discuss the Indonesian issue for the fourth time. This matter is extremely important to all Asian nations. In tonight's meeting, the position of British representative Stettinius will be of decisive importance. According to well-informed sources, the U.S. representative will oppose the Soviet proposal to organize an international committee to investigate the situation in Indonesia, but Soviet representative Vyshinsky is unlikely to withdraw his appeal. The British Cabinet met this morning and unanimously supported Foreign Secretary Bevin's stance.

[This Newspaper Report] According to a London broadcast on the 11th, UN General Assembly President Spaak left here today for Belgium and will return to London in a day or two. The purpose of this trip is unclear.

[United Press, London, 11th] The Security Council is prepared to continue debating the East Indies issue due to Soviet accusations that the Java war is ongoing. However, some quarters predict today that the dispute may be temporarily shelved pending the outcome of negotiations in Batavia between the Dutch government and East Indies leaders.

[United Press, London, 10th] Soviet Representative Vyshinsky warned this afternoon at the UN Security Council meeting that the unresolved East Indies could be the fuse for a third world war. He also supported the request previously made by Ukraine, advocating for the "immediate" dispatch of an investigation team from the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, and the Netherlands to the region. The meeting involved sharp words and frank language, no longer adhering to diplomatic courtesies. At that time, the British representative quickly responded that sending any investigation team would be an insult to the British forces stationed in the East Indies.

[Reuters, Batavia, 11th] After the Dutch government's statement on its policy regarding Indonesia was released, Dutch-Indonesian Deputy Governor Van Mook held a press conference here yesterday, stating that the statement sufficiently demonstrates the new development in Dutch-Indonesian relations. The definite goal of Indonesia's political development has been confirmed for the first time. The local people's right to self-determination has been recognized, and a clear and reasonable path has been prepared for democracy and freedom.

[United Press, Batavia, 10th] The British Embassy issued a press release stating that both sides of the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations have agreed to release the entire process and avoid provocative propaganda.

### Britain in 1941 Faced a Critical Moment; Shipping Losses Reached Four Million Tons; Churchill's Secret Speech Released

[Reuters, London, 11th] Churchill's third secret speech during the war has been released. At that time, Britain was facing an unprecedented defeat in its history, with British shipping losses in the Atlantic War reaching as many as 4.6 million tons. Churchill told the secret meeting of the House of Commons on June 25, 1941, that a year ago, no high-ranking authority would have believed that we could continue to fight. Hitler's experts must have told him that our fate had been decided. In March of that year, Churchill had ordered that Britain's lifeline be defended to the death, with all efforts devoted to attacking German submarines and aircraft, and merchant ships equipped with self-defense equipment. Churchill announced that he would no longer release shipping loss figures. Roosevelt had occasionally mentioned the British losses, and the British government had previously agreed to their release, resulting in adverse effects on observing countries such as Spain, Vichy, Turkey, and Japan. The Japanese ambassador specifically inquired about this matter, and of course, this matter must have been related to the determination of Japan's national policy.

### Britain and the United States Establish an Agreement; Both Have the So-Called Fifth Freedom

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th Special Dispatch] It is learned that Britain and the United States have reached a complete agreement at the Bermuda Aviation Conference, granting both countries the so-called fifth freedom. This point was the most important issue left unresolved at the two previous international civil aviation conferences in Chicago and Montreal. According to the fifth freedom, British and American airlines can carry passengers to third countries within each other's operational boundaries. If this agreement is true, then American aircraft will have unlimited flights and capacity to London, and can carry passengers and cargo from London to various parts of Europe. As for Britain, it gains the privilege of landing in Honolulu during trans-Pacific flights.

### Rockets Guided by Radar; Humanity Will Be Able to Enter the Moon

[Reuters, New York, 11th] Recently, there has been news of radar contact with the moon. American scientists are now predicting that soon, automated [unclear character] driven rockets guided by radar can be used to travel to the moon, and wireless image programs can be transmitted from the moon. According to Professor Lee, director of the Northwestern (Chicago) University Observatory, "Rocket missiles can be fired to the moon without a doubt. Its realization may be within five or ten years. We already have fuel—atomic energy—and now we have a guide—radar. The amazing spectacle of the first unmanned rocket trip to the moon will be more significant than its scientific value. When humans can reach the moon and establish an observatory, we will be able to obtain a clearer view of the universe." As for whether radar will establish contact with other planets, there is still doubt.

### The World Food Panic Situation Reaches Its Peak; The Soviet Union Has Agreed to Submit Famine Relief Proposals to the UN; Vietnam Starved a Million People During Japanese Rule

[This Newspaper Report] According to a London broadcast on the 11th, China, Britain, France and the United States have submitted proposals to the United Nations General Assembly, urging all countries to increase production and conserve unnecessary consumption in order to cope with the world's unprecedented food shortages. The four countries also requested the Soviet Union to participate, and the Soviet side has now agreed to sign. The proposal will be presented by Bevin.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] After investigating the situation in 65 countries, the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts that the food consumption per person in the United States this year will reach a record high, while people in many other countries are on the verge of starvation. Italy, Germany, France, French North Africa, Spain, India, and China face the most difficult food problems. The world's rice and wheat supply situation has reached an unprecedentedly serious period. The production of various major foods has decreased significantly compared to pre-war levels, and supply is particularly insufficient during the period between harvests. Production in the 1946-47 season may increase, but its output will still be less than [unclear character] before.

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 10th] The food shortage in Northern Vietnam is becoming increasingly serious. It has not rained for three months, and the prospects for spring plowing in various places are very slim. Last year's [unclear character] teaching has exhausted the remaining grain, and the price of grain has suddenly risen from 200 yuan per 100 catties to 800 yuan. According to information obtained by reporters from various sources, Northern Vietnam will need 400,000 tons of food in the next three to four months. This amount cannot be resolved by Vietnam's own resources. In the past two years, during the period of Japanese control, an estimated one million Vietnamese died of starvation, which is a major tragedy in human history. Although the war has ended this year, the Vietnamese people are once again trapped in the terror of a great famine. Foreigners residing outside are also terrified by this serious food shortage. Vietnamese people facing the great famine have begun to disregard order and are looting everywhere. In the face of this serious great famine, UN charitable relief organizations should send personnel to Vietnam as soon as possible to investigate and provide relief.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Former British Prime Minister Churchill arrived here by plane from Florida this afternoon, braving bad weather, wearing a black coat and smoking a cigar as always. After disembarking, he exchanged greetings with President's representative General Lee and British Ambassador Halifax and his wife. The crowd, in the sub-freezing cold, broke through the lines of military police to surround Churchill in order to catch a glimpse of the British statesman.

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] Churchill met with President Truman at the White House yesterday for an hour and a half, discussing world affairs extensively, emphasizing his talks with Roosevelt and Stalin during the war. White House officials said that the meeting was extremely cordial. Churchill mentioned to President Truman that he planned to give a speech at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, on March 5th, and President Truman would accompany Churchill at that time. It is anticipated that this will be Churchill's most important speech since leaving Downing Street, and it will specifically address the relationship between the three powers after the war. Since the deaths of Roosevelt and Hopkins, Churchill is one of the most familiar with the initial three-power negotiations. Perhaps there were other secret agreements at that time, which are not yet known. Truman is well aware that this knowledge is crucial for the decision-making of future American foreign policy, so he has to ask Churchill for guidance.

### President of the U.S. Associated Press Discusses Freedom of the Press; If Human Thought Is Controlled, Military Conflict Is Inevitable

[United Press, London, 10th] Kent Cooper, General Manager of the Associated Press, in a letter to U.S. Chief Representative to the United Nations General Assembly Stettinius, discussed freedom of the press, which was released today. The letter concluded: Mutual understanding in the world can only succeed when news can flow freely to all countries and be published freely in all countries. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to make good use of the new electronic sciences to greatly expand the world's communications network so that people can know each other. If this is not achieved, communications agencies will again be used by governments for despicable propaganda, and human thought will be controlled. The result of this will inevitably be military conflict.

[United [Press?], Washington, 10th] Deputy Secretary of State [彭數/Peng Shu?] announced today that the Virginia Press Association has recommended to the State Department's International Information and Cultural Affairs Bureau that it invite several foreign journalists to work together at several newspapers in the state.

### Cold Wind Howls, Moods Are Depressed; Japan Celebrates National Foundation Day; Government Agencies Closed, National Flags Fly Sparsely

[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] Today is the 2,606th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Empire. Only Japanese national flags fly sparsely in the cold wind in Tokyo. The mood of the Japanese people is quite sad. The Japanese originally regarded National Foundation Day as a major event, celebrating it every year. MacArthur has specially allowed the Japanese to celebrate as usual this year, but all the national assemblies and parades previously hosted by the Japanese government have been canceled. Government and commercial agencies are closed for one day today. Japanese schools previously taught students that the Japanese Empire was founded in 660 BC, but this claim is now being doubted by the Japanese.

### Japanese Political Trends; Old Figures Are Active Behind the Scenes; Still Possess Powerful Influence

[United Press International, Tokyo, 11th] According to Kyodo News, political observers here predict that after the upcoming election, the Japanese parliament will be filled with unfamiliar faces, but they believe that the old political parties will still be pulling strings behind the scenes. The actions taken by the Japanese government in accordance with MacArthur's directive to purge officials will affect thousands of former politicians, civil servants, and professional soldiers who have been exceptionally active in the past. Hereafter, they will still possess powerful influence within their respective spheres of activity. The news agency went on to say that most of these people have decided to hide behind the scenes, intending to arrange puppet figures so that the direction of all work and actions will be in accordance with their wishes. Observers have noticed that this "dangerous tendency" is particularly evident in the Progressive and Liberal parties.

### Egypt Firmly Demands the Withdrawal of Foreign Troops

[Reuters, Cairo, 11th] The demonstrations and riots by Egyptian students worsened yesterday afternoon. Workers in Alexandria joined the students' demonstration march, clashing with the police. The police opened fire, injuring fifty people.

### Czech Black Market Profiteers Paraded Through the Streets with Placards

[Reuter Prague, 11th] The Czech authorities are strictly sanctioning black market transactions, and prices are trending downwards. The risks for those engaged in the black market are increasing daily. The authorities are adopting medieval punishments for profiteers, such as having the police escort the offenders through the streets with a placard hanging from their necks, bearing the words "I am a Black Market Profiteer." Several people in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, have already been subjected to this dishonorable punishment.

### Unprecedented Enthusiasm in Soviet Elections; Final Results to be Announced in Several Days

[Reuter London, 11th] Moscow Radio announced: As of noon on the 10th, voter turnout in the Soviet elections had reached 91.6%.

[United Press Moscow, 10th] The current Soviet elections have seen unprecedented enthusiasm. The Soviet Union covers more than one-sixth of the world's land area, and the number of voters could reach 110 million. Counting began at midnight, and due to the vast territory and the isolation of many voting areas, the final results may not be announced for several days. Military personnel constitute a relatively high proportion of the candidates, with at least 20 marshals, 22 generals, one admiral, and several fleet commanders. This has no special significance, as most of these individuals are simply being re-elected.

### Chinese Delegation to the UN General Assembly Proficient in Various Languages

[British News Service London, 11th] In assessing the progress of the United Nations conference, the News Chronicle stated: One of the obstacles to the UN General Assembly remains that some attending delegates are not proficient in English, the official language. In terms of language proficiency, the Chinese delegation is perhaps the most successful. Dr. Wellington Koo, the acting chief representative of the Chinese delegation, is well-known for his mastery of English. Mr. Chang Peng-chun's argument for launching a new war to eradicate bacteria, delivered in English at the General Assembly, was a speech of the utmost wisdom. However, the true expert is Mr. Hu Shih-tse, former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, who is proficient in four languages: Chinese, Russian, English, and French.

### Five Million Citizens Eagerly Await Chairman Chiang's Arrival in Shanghai: A Chronicle by Our Newsroom

On the second day after Madame Chiang arrived in Shanghai, the reporter learned that Chairman Chiang was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on Monday. Chairman Chiang did not hastily confirm the date of his arrival in Shanghai, in order to avoid alarming the citizens of this city. However, upon hearing the news of Chairman Chiang's arrival, all five million citizens of Shanghai were overjoyed. Indeed, we have missed our leader, whom we have been separated from for eight years, eight months, and twenty-five days, so dearly!

At 1:05 PM the day before yesterday, this newspaper was the first to receive an urgent telegram from Chongqing stating that Chairman Chiang was scheduled to depart on the morning of the 11th to fly to Shanghai. His first batch of attendants had already taken off from Jiulongpo Airport at 8:14 AM on a C47 aircraft, number 218. Chairman Chiang would wait one or two hours before arriving at the airport. His special plane, the "Meiling," and aircraft number 260 were on standby. At the same time, we also obtained some leads from the Air Force Third District Command of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai Branch of the Battlefield Service Corps. To enrich our coverage, we divided into three groups: the first group was sent to Chairman Chiang's residence on Dongping Road, the second group was sent to Jiangwan Airport, and the third group was sent to Longhua Airport. Another reporter was stationed in the newsroom to be responsible for liaison.

National Flags Fluttering Like a Vast Ocean

As we set off, we jokingly said to a colleague who was dispatched to Longhua Airport: "You can be considered lucky, because the news we obtained from all parties at the time unanimously believed that Chairman Chiang's special plane would land at Jiangwan Airport." However, facts proved that the prediction was absolutely accurate, and the lucky one finally became the real lucky one!

On the way to Jiangwan Airport, all the shops and residents had already hung national flags that fluttered like a vast ocean. Everyone's face showed infinite excitement. When the car reached Sichuan Road, the military police had already begun to deploy their forces. When it reached Jiangwan Road, soldiers of the newly deployed 146th Division of the National Army were actively stationed there, with guards every ten steps, majestic and solemn. At 1:50 PM, the car arrived at the airport. After being inspected by the MP, it drove straight to the parking lot. At this time, apart from one or two American aircraft taking off and landing, everything else was peaceful. At 2:00 PM, colleagues from other news organizations arrived in succession. The reporter learned there that the first aircraft that took off from Chongqing had arrived in Hankou and continued to fly east.

The Vast Sky Eagerly Awaits the Arrival of the Special Plane

At 3:15 PM, Shen Wanqian, the commander of the 23rd Gendarmerie Regiment, also arrived, along with Zhu, the head of the press release team of the Municipal Government. At this time, three Mustang fighter jets suddenly appeared in the vast sky, constantly circling there, causing cheers from the 22 male and female colleagues present, who believed that this was a sign that Chairman Chiang's special plane was about to arrive. But after waiting and waiting, the fighter jets disappeared, and there was still no sign of anything. Some colleagues became anxious and asked around, wanting to find out the reason. At this moment, the large sedans of Peng Xuepei and Kong Xiangxi's son drove in, and the reporters seemed to have taken a dose of stimulant, and all the doubts disappeared immediately. Everyone stared eagerly at the sky, concentrating on hoping to find a trace of the plane. The shadow of a plane was not non-existent, but when it flew closer and looked, it turned out to be an American transport plane.

Good News Falls From the Sky on the Signal Platform

The sky was gradually darkening, and the wind was also getting stronger. The reporter still held a warm, sincere heart, waiting for Chairman Chiang's gracious arrival, and even hoping that the attendants could fly there quickly.

It was 4:00 PM, and there was still no sign of anything. What surprised us the most was that, apart from Kong's son Peng Xuepei and several relatives of Chairman Chiang, why had no one else come to welcome him? Especially Madame Chiang and Mayor Qian. But when the press release organizer called the Municipal Government to inquire, they replied: "The Mayor just left the Municipal Government to go to the airport." Therefore, we waited again—waiting for the arrival of the four-engine C47 aircraft.

At 4:50 PM, there was still no trace of the special plane. As we were filled with doubts, a shout suddenly came from the signal platform: "Chairman Chiang has safely arrived at Longhua Airport. The time is 4:20 PM. Please return quickly." This news made the colleagues present feel like they had been struck by lightning, shaking our hearts and minds. However, this was only a momentary psychological phenomenon, and afterwards it was replaced by a burst of light and joy.

Leaving the airport, the sentry posts along the way saw our vehicles driving straight through one after another, and thought that Chairman Chiang had arrived, so they all stood at attention and saluted. When we turned into North Sichuan Road, thousands upon thousands of citizens stood respectfully on both sides, the cheers and the sound of firecrackers blending into one, almost making us feel ashamed. The citizens' ardent love for their leader was fully demonstrated here.

Director Xuan Goes Back and Forth Three Times by Dongping Road

Writing here, the reporter's pen must turn to another scene. The quiet Dongping Road (Route Jullien), showed extreme tension and excitement throughout yesterday, but still maintained its tranquility. There were no guards, and vehicles and pedestrians could still pass freely. However, there were eight more news reporters who were constantly patrolling back and forth. Zhou Zhirou, the chairman of the Aviation Commission, Huang Renlin of the Battlefield Service Corps of the Military Commission, and Xuan Tiewu, the director of the Shanghai Police Bureau, arrived at Chairman Chiang's private residence by car one after another at around 2:00 PM. Especially Director Xuan was the busiest. He left by car for a while, and then came back again. From 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM, within a short hour, Director Xuan came back and forth as many as three times.

Chairman's Private Residence Is A Semi-New Western-Style House

Chairman Chiang's private residence is the second house near Beidang Road on Route Jullien, a semi-new Western-style house that is not very luxurious. Countless sharp pieces of glass stand on the light green fence. The three iron gates are the same size, and one closes immediately after opening. From outside the fence, you can vaguely see the plants and trees in the garden, and the house hiding behind the fence. Madame Chiang's car is parked on the lawn. Chairman Chiang's attendant's office is in the red Western-style house on the left side. The communication soldiers of the Garrison Headquarters specially installed a temporary telephone line to the Central Military Academy Alumni Association on Qilu Road. Neighbors often curiously stood at the door or window to look around, and pedestrians also pointed to the "Number Nine" house number, frequently talking about something.

The Iron Gate Opens; Madame Chiang's Car Suddenly Appears

At 3:30 PM, a red security car from the police station drove in, full of policemen, but Section Chief Li, who was responsible for directing the guards, did not need them, so they returned to the police station. But they brought the news that Chairman Chiang would land at the Tihua Airport around 4:30 PM.

So the reporters immediately got busy. Some were making phone calls, and some were preparing their cars. At 3:50 PM, the iron gate of Chairman Chiang's official residence suddenly opened. Madame Chiang rode in a small, streamlined black car and drove out like the wind. The reporters immediately drove to follow closely, unwilling to miss the opportunity.

Madame Chiang was wearing a black woolen coat, with a lynx fur stole around her neck, leaning on the left side of the back seat of the car. Apart from the driver, there were no other attendants. The car left Dongping Road, turned into Beidang Road, and headed south straight to Tihua Airport. Madame Chiang's car was very fast, and the reporters followed closely. Approaching the airport, the military police were heavily guarded, and the reporters' car was suddenly stopped. In a few minutes, Mayor Qian, Zhou Zhirou, and others also arrived one after another. At 4:10 PM, the first special plane carrying the attendants landed first.

Five minutes later, after Chairman Chiang's special plane, the "Meiling," landed, the reporters watched from outside the venue as Madame Chiang and the welcoming personnel went to the side of the plane. Chairman Chiang, wearing a black cloak, slowly got off the plane and warmly shook hands with each of the welcomers. After a brief greeting, he returned to the official residence with Madame Chiang in the same car. At 5:40 PM, the third special plane arrived.

At around 4:30 PM, the people lingering outside Chairman Chiang's private residence, although they had not yet seen Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang arrive, observed the situation and knew that they would be coming soon. Before long, the sound of firecrackers erupted, and the outside of the mansion became lively and bustling, like boiling water. The reporters' spirits were also invigorated. Sure enough, at 5:05 PM, big cars and small cars arrived one after another. The gate of Chairman Chiang's private residence had also been prepared to be opened, and the car carrying Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang gracefully drove into the gate.

### Question Regarding the Promotion of Educational Aid Badges

To the Editor: Regarding the promotion of educational aid badges by students throughout the city, every citizen of Shanghai and every compatriot of China should contribute to help students who are out of school. The promotion of educational aid badges by students is indeed an excellent way to alleviate the pain of being out of school, but I have three questions regarding the promotion of educational aid badges: (1) The educational aid badges are not printed with serial numbers. I have seen several educational aid badges where the students themselves use a fountain pen to write a number, such as M1213. I think it is uncertain how many educational aid badges have been issued, which may lead to abuses. (2) When enthusiastic students promote educational aid badges to generous benefactors, the amount donated by the benefactors often exceeds the face value of the educational aid badge, such as 2,000 yuan in legal tender for one badge. Of course, the more donations received, the better, but should the students give the benefactor one more honor badge, or should they give him one thousand yuan in change? The Iron Report of February 6th stated that someone donated 100,000 yuan. Should he be given an official receipt, or should he be given 100 honor badges? The money donated as a result of the fundraising cannot match the number of badges given, and the money will certainly exceed the number of badges, which will inevitably lead to many abuses. (3) Will these donations be published in the major newspapers later to clear the accounts? How will the donations be distributed? Should impoverished students who request educational aid apply to the Shanghai Student Educational Aid Federation? Where is the location of this organization? Who is in charge of which school? These are my three questions. The above three points are what the citizens of Shanghai urgently need to know. Please provide a detailed answer from the Shanghai Student Educational Aid Federation. Every citizen who has already donated money wants to see satisfactory results. Wishing the students success. Yang Bu, February 9th.

### My Views on Handling Labor Disputes

By Yuan Suzhong

Since the victory until now, labor disputes in Shanghai have arisen one after another, endlessly. The newspapers have daily news reports with similar content, either demanding severance pay or demanding relief, either demanding higher salaries or.... Various kinds, and as of now, it has not subsided.

Someone asked: "Why are labor disputes rising one after another after the recovery of the territory?" This is indeed a question worth studying.

In the past, Shanghai's important enterprises were mostly controlled and monopolized by foreign merchants, who relied on unequal treaties as a shield to oppress and exploit in many ways. Not only could the workers not lift their heads, but our government authorities could not do anything. Therefore, the workers had no protection, and the government could not interfere, so of course it did not dare to act rashly.

The reason why labor and management were able to coexist peacefully under the enemy's occupation was entirely due to the oppression of the enemy's violence. If workers went on strike, the representatives in charge would often suffer unexpected disasters.

As for profiteering merchants who were speculating, they only sought rapid production, and the workers' demands for increased treatment were relatively easy to achieve. Because the prices of products were rising every day, anyway, the rising tide lifts all boats, and the petty wages were of course insignificant.

Since the victory, the enemy and puppet factories in the recovered area have successively closed down. The workers felt threatened under the whip of life and had to rise up to demand severance pay from the original factory owners, and on the other hand, request government relief. If they did not achieve their goals, they would of course only investigate and question and launch labor disputes. There are also several factories that have started work, and the workers have requested improved treatment under the high pressure of prices, and strikes have broken out when they could not be resolved, which is not uncommon.

Improving working conditions and raising workers' treatment are indeed urgent tasks. At this time when extraterritoriality is abolished, it is appropriate to learn from the past and be careful in the future. The handling of labor disputes should be carefully considered. The government should mediate labor disputes, and in terms of technology, strive for simplicity and reasonableness, handle them impartially and in accordance with laws and regulations, without bias, without compromise, and without allowing the陋习 of bargaining. Capitalists often only care about making profits and do not care about the lives of workers. It seems that it is rare to hear of the capital side automatically increasing workers' wages or giving annual awards, and the labor side feels the embarrassment of life and cannot help but change their minds on the wage side. When the labor side puts forward certain conditions, the capital side feels a headache, seemingly reasonable and unreasonable. When the workers take out the last weapon (strike), they have no choice but to comply with the authorities' call for negotiations and reluctantly concede. In this way, the capital side becomes a "candle," the labor side thinks it has won a victory, and an interest in 　　arises, so a wave of strikes arises 　　.

Improving labor welfare is indeed the only way to solve labor disputes, but do not unilaterally compromise. 对拿尽　体, Does not affect foreign investment, develop our country's industry, protect workers' welfare, and should be taken into account in all aspects. The spirit of the rule of law must be used to establish a good model, so that foreigners do not regard it as a dangerous path, and give people 口实, Affect the future of the nation.

In short, workers' representatives should not ask for excessive demands and get more and want more. Especially do not be greedy and use strikes as a threat at every turn, and do not deliberately encourage and incite labor disputes. Most workers with relatively naive knowledge will be overjoyed and echo when they hear that it will increase their income. They only know how to blindly follow strikes, but they do not know that labor and management must not be in an opposing position. They must cooperate sincerely and understand each other. This is the proper way to eliminate labor disputes and develop enterprises. (February 8)

### Like Vigorous Grass in a Gale, Like True Gold in a Raging Flame, Adding to the Glory of the National and Ethnic Personality: Chairman Chiang's Words of Encouragement to the Citizens of Shanghai

After an absence of eight years, eight months, and twenty-five days, Chairman Chiang finally returned triumphantly to the East, reuniting with the elders and brethren of Jiangnan! If we are not forgetful, we should deeply believe that Chairman Chiang has always been concerned about the citizens of Shanghai. He once said, "Although I am separated from my Shanghai compatriots by thousands of miles, our spirits and voices are always connected." His current visit can give the citizens a deeper and more firm confidence. On the second anniversary of "August 13th," we solemnly recited with the most fervent hearts an important document that he proclaimed to us citizens, and even reading it today, our hearts are still moved.

Today, good and evil cannot coexist, and the loyal and treacherous cannot stand together.

What I ask of my Shanghai compatriots is to uphold righteousness, maintain personal integrity, never give up, and fight to the end.

Shanghai has a profound historical connection with China's reform movements of the past century, and even closer ties with the National Revolution. Since September 18th, our entire nation has been working hard for independence and self-reliance, strengthening national power. The economic, journalistic, academic, industrial, and other circles of Shanghai have made many contributions in various aspects. Shanghai compatriots must fulfill their historical mission in the history of China's independent nation-building.

Our Shanghai compatriots' enthusiasm in donating money and goods to support the front lines, their perseverance and struggle without fear of sacrifice, and their courageous acts of serving in the War of Resistance, have written countless moving and tragic histories, established the glory of the early stages of the War of Resistance, and inspired our final victory.

I hope that the cultural and journalistic circles of Shanghai will build a strong spiritual fortress. Based on this spirit, persevere and struggle, report correct news, and combat the fallacies of traitors. Every time they attempt to steal our righteous opinions, they will only expose their despicable and shamelessness to the people.

Shanghai is the location of an international market and has been a financial center for many years. I hope that the economic circles of Shanghai will unanimously strengthen their confidence, trust legal tender, and stabilize finance. As long as our people understand that supporting legal tender is an expression of patriotism, capital flight should be regarded as an act of treason and aiding the enemy. We must supervise and encourage each other.

I hope that the youth in Shanghai will work harder to motivate themselves, know shame and strive for self-improvement. They should also know that Shanghai, due to its convenient transportation, has much easier access to various research, advanced studies, books, and tools than the inland areas.

Our Shanghai workers must strengthen their unity, encourage each other, clearly distinguish right from wrong, strictly separate good from evil, endure hardship, and persevere to the end.

Hard work is our true character. The pain that general industrial and commercial countries consider unbearable, we can take in stride. Now that we are all in trouble together, we must promote the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation.

We especially cherish Shanghai's past contributions to our country, like vigorous grass in a gale, like true gold in a raging flame, supporting this difficult period to add to the glory of our country and national character! (From our newspaper's archives)

Editorial

### Chairman Chiang's Triumphant Return to Shanghai

Chairman Chiang flew to Shanghai yesterday, a grand event that a million Shanghai citizens have been looking forward to day and night for the past eight years. Madame Chiang said that Shanghai is her hometown, but the citizens of Shanghai regard Chairman Chiang as their compassionate mother. The past eight years have been a critical time for our nation's survival, and also a period of suffering for the citizens of Shanghai, who were separated from their mother's embrace and subjected to the abuses of evil neighbors. Chairman Chiang's triumphant return to Shanghai, witnessing the hundred-year humiliation and eight-year occupation of Shanghai, now adorned with the national emblem of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth, must be very gratifying. The joy of the Shanghai citizens in seeing Chairman Chiang's healthy and benevolent countenance is even more difficult to describe.

Chairman Chiang's return yesterday was a triumph. Reflecting on the pain, we cannot help but think of the wartime. The sound of cannons at Lugou Bridge was followed by the bloody battle of Shanghai on August 13th, which determined the start of the full-scale War of Resistance. The fate of the Chinese and Japanese nations was decided by the war in the past eight years. This eight-year war was the longest war in modern history, unprecedented since the Napoleonic Wars. We fought against Japan, a self-proclaimed first-class power, with a backward production and poorly equipped army. The hardship is self-evident. Moreover, the war was conducted over a long period. Those who couldn't endure it would have collapsed long ago. However, the reason why we were able to disregard these factors, persevere, and adhere to the principle of "responding to all changes with constancy," finally overcoming all kinds of difficulties, and achieving a glorious victory from the brink of destruction, is entirely due to our great eight-year war. It not only repelled the enemy, but also enabled us to achieve the goal of abolishing unequal treaties. Chairman Chiang is truly the savior of our nation! Now that the enemy has surrendered, and Chairman Chiang has won the victory, the citizens of Shanghai are naturally overjoyed and inspired. After an absence of eight years, Chairman Chiang has returned to his old place, reuniting with the elders and brethren of Jiangnan, and must also have a deep sense of joy.

Shanghai is China's first metropolis, the center of our national economy and finance, a vital base of the National Revolution, and a frontline fortress of the War of Resistance. After eight years of enemy ravage, although it has now been recovered, it is full of wounds. On the surface, it is still prosperous, but the people's livelihood is actually deepening day by day. Chairman Chiang cares about the people's suffering. During his tour of Beiping and Nanjing, he set up people's complaint boxes to receive people's opinions, which shows how much Chairman Chiang cares about the people's welfare. On this triumphant return to Shanghai, instead of writing a welcome speech praising his merits and virtues, we might as well represent the people and present the current hardships of the people's livelihood without any concealment. Chairman Chiang's great achievements are deeply imprinted in the hearts of every person, and there is no need for us to praise them. In the future, there will be historical pens to fully praise his abilities. What Chairman Chiang is deeply concerned about is not the praise for him personally, but the suffering of the people, especially the plight of the people in the recovered areas. The Shen Bao's relaunch had already stated that it bears the responsibility of reporting the people's plight, so we respectfully wish to present some aspects of the people's plight in the recovered areas to Chairman Chiang.

First, the swift and severe punishment of traitors is the unanimous demand of the people in the recovered areas. The recovery of our homeland has been more than five months, but in fact, there are very few cases of traitors that have been quickly concluded and severely punished. Moreover, there are still a large number of traitors who are still at large. There may be some factors that prevent the widespread arrest of traitors and the prompt and severe punishment of traitor cases; but this will ultimately cause a negative impact on the people's psychology. Loyalty and treachery cannot coexist, and right and wrong must be distinguished. Today in Shanghai, there are inevitably people who were shameless in the enemy-puppet era, wagging their tails before the Japanese soldiers and bullying our compatriots. With a change of identity, they swagger and appear before us in another guise. These people should be arrested and severely punished immediately, and the government should have no dissent. Traitors who have been arrested and are under interrogation should be publicly and severely punished as soon as possible. More than five months have passed since the Japanese surrendered, but we have not yet seen the execution of important traitors. France's Pétain and Laval have already been publicly tried and convicted. Laval has been sentenced to death; Norway's Quisling has also been sentenced to death; Britain's "Lord Haw-Haw" and others have also been subjected to their due punishment. Even Yamashita Tomoyuki, known as the "Tiger of Malaya," has been sentenced to death. Why haven't our traitors, our Lavals, our Quislings, been punished according to the law of the land? In recent years, Chairman Chiang has vigorously promoted the New Life Movement, using "understanding propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame" to proclaim to the world. This is truly the foundation of nation-building. We believe that the swift and severe punishment of traitors is the best opportunity to make the people "understand propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame."

Second, since the recovery of Shanghai, there was initially competition among various parties for taking over, resulting in poor order. Then, materials were sealed up and could not be utilized, so that the operation of industry and commerce has not been flexible. Recently, in order to utilize the takeover of industries, various state-owned companies have emerged, even in light industry. All these measures were originally this . It has been our established national policy that heavy industry should be state-owned and light industry should be privately owned. The textile and silk companies that have been organized this time are light industries in nature, and private ownership would be more appropriate. However, the government has established large-scale state-owned companies at this time, which seems to be inconsistent with the principle of private ownership of light industry. How can it win the trust of the people? As for the numbers of the seized materials and their utilization, the government has not made a full public announcement. For the present, the government should quickly publish all the details of the takeover, so that the public can know.

Third, regarding the hardships of the people's livelihood, nothing is worse than the soaring prices. We know that Chairman Chiang has repeatedly ordered the relevant authorities to find ways to suppress and stabilize prices, but it is like speaking earnestly to those who turn a deaf ear. Administrative efficiency is not only slow but also clumsy. Many factories have been taken over, but they are allowed to remain closed. Many materials have been taken over, but they are allowed to rot. And when holding sales at reasonable prices, they must haggle over every penny, selling at 70% or 80% of the market price. When the market price rises, the reasonable price can never have the effect of suppressing prices. We have also never seen the relevant authorities come up with any concrete measures to make all factories resume operation and start work immediately, bringing back production. What is even more incomprehensible is that the main reason for the rising prices is speculation and the scourge of idle capital. The authorities only hold meetings to discuss how to curb speculation, absorb idle capital, and stabilize the value of the currency, but there is no real solution. They sit back and let the old Lunar New Year pass, gold prices jump wildly, and prices soar. The ordinary people are groaning on the verge of starvation! Chairman Chiang's triumphant return to Shanghai is at a time when prices are fluctuating violently. The five million citizens of Shanghai wish Chairman Chiang to exert his heroic judgment, punish the treacherous merchants who are speculating, and stabilize the soaring prices.

All things are reborn in spring! The citizens of Shanghai have groaned under the enemy-puppet rule for eight years. Now, with the triumphant return of Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang, all things are truly reborn in spring, bringing them warmth and joy.

### Xi Yushu Suggests Selling Shanghai's Gold Reserves at Official Prices; This Will Effectively Stabilize Prices

Recently, the prices of gold and goods in this city have been fluctuating drastically, which has had a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. This reporter visited National Assemblyman Xi Yushu, who told this reporter that the current surge in prices in Shanghai is worrying if effective measures are not taken. He telegraphed Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance about this matter, asking him to quickly sell Shanghai's gold reserves at the government's official price to stabilize prices, which is a readily available and relatively effective method. The original telegram is recorded below:

Readily Available and Relatively Effective

"(Omitted titles), Recently, the price of gold in Shanghai has been soaring, and all goods have been rising in succession. The livelihoods of ordinary people are severely threatened, and people are panicked, fearing that the situation cannot last. Although the labor strikes in various factories in this city have just been resolved, they are now being affected by prices again. The newly increased wages cannot keep up with prices, and I fear that they will recur as a result. If this continues, the hidden dangers to society are unimaginable. I understand that you are aware of all these situations. I believe that the current fluctuations in gold and commodity prices are caused by the long delay in determining foreign exchange rates, which has led to a flood of rumors and speculation by merchants who are fueling the flames. However, this matter concerns national policy and may not be convenient to announce at this time. Now, stabilizing prices requires comprehensive planning and concerted efforts to be effective. However, I believe that the immediately feasible and relatively effective method is to stabilize the price of gold. Therefore, I humbly suggest that you do what you can and coordinate the Ministry's position on gold and money. It seems that a prompt decision should be made to quickly sell the gold reserves seized from the enemy and puppets in Shanghai at the government-set gold price as much as possible. Or, gold can be transported from Chongqing to Shanghai, which can arrive in the evening if it departs in the morning. Such measures will immediately bring down the price of gold, and commodity prices will fall as a result, and people's hearts can be turned to peace, which is deeply beneficial to the country and society. I offer my shallow views for your consideration, and I hope you will make a wise decision."

### Regulating Food Supply, Selling Rice as Much as Possible

Regarding the recent sharp rise in rice prices, the food administration authorities stated that they are determined to make the greatest efforts to stabilize grain prices. In order to effectively suppress rice prices, the Food Administration Commissioner's Office is constantly selling rice to regulate the food supply. Yesterday, rice merchants in this city went to purchase rice, and it was very crowded. At the same time, large quantities of rice are arriving in Shanghai to replenish reserves. The authorities have decided to continue to implement the following policies regarding the food supply in the future: (1) Replenish grain sources from rice-producing areas. (2) Sell rice to regulate the food supply. (3) Strive to balance supply and demand and stabilize grain prices. Solve transportation problems and dredge sources.

### Cantonese Cuisine Industry Goes on Strike, Social Affairs Bureau Arbitrates

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau has drafted a solution to the Cantonese cuisine industry's strike. The decision will be sent to both labor and management today, ordering them to comply. If either party is dissatisfied, they may file an arbitration request with the municipal government within five days. The content of the decision is as follows:

(1) Year-end bonuses are divided into three levels: 25,000, 20,000, and 15,000, to be paid within seven days. (2) The employer contributes 10% of the 20% gratuities, and 5% of the extra bonuses. The rest goes to the employees. (3) Wages are to be adjusted by each restaurant on its own. (4) The reinstatement of the dismissed employees of Meihua, Dadong, Sisister, and [some other place] will be decided later. If the above conditions are accepted by both parties, work should resume today.

### Power Company Labor Strike, Both Sides' Opinions Close

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Power Company's labor strike has undergone many twists and turns. Yesterday, under the joint mediation of Director Wu Kaixian and Section Chief Zhang Zhenyuan of the Social Affairs Bureau, the opinions of both parties gradually became closer. Eight of the eleven conditions proposed by the labor side have been resolved yesterday. Only conditions one, two, and three remain to be discussed today. The management insists that company administration is not to be interfered with, while the labor side believes that if this cannot be achieved, their jobs will not be guaranteed, so they will not concede. Further frank discussions are needed today.

Also, the company will advance the payment of this month's salary tomorrow. The company has agreed to bear the medical expenses of those injured in the unfortunate incident last time. The Social Affairs Bureau also stated that it will thoroughly investigate the incident, expressed its gratitude to the workers for complying with the advice to resume work, and hopes that a quick solution can be reached as soon as possible to calm people's minds.

### Business Employees Make Four Demands

The employees of the Shanghai Commercial Press have meager salaries and live in poverty. After adjusting salaries and allowances in January of this year, they are still only 14,000 to 15,000 yuan, which is difficult to maintain. Therefore, on the 10th of this month, they made four demands and again requested the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate fairly.

### Telegrams to Various Places in the United States Resume Acceptance

The Western Union Telegraph Company of the United States previously suspended the acceptance of telegrams to various places in the United States, except for Washington, San Francisco, and New York, due to a labor strike. It is now reported that the company's labor strike has been resolved. The Ministry of Transportation's International Radio Station has resumed accepting international commercial telegrams to various places in the United States since yesterday. The previously ordered method of temporarily suspending the use of registered mail instead of the recipient's name and address has also been canceled.

### US Military Continues Trial of Japanese War Criminals, Fierce Debates on Both Sides, Court to Reconvene This Morning for Further Hearing

[Reported by this newspaper] The US military war crimes court held its fourth hearing at the Ward Road Prison at 9:00 AM yesterday, trying the eighteen Japanese war criminals who killed three US airmen in Hankou. The atmosphere in the courtroom yesterday was even more tense than before. In addition to the court officials and dozens of newspaper reporters and photographers, there were nearly a hundred spectators. Yesterday's hearing lasted for a total of seven hours and has not yet been completed. The defense lawyers on both sides argued fiercely.

Whether it is legal to try war criminals

After the court opened, the defendant's defense lawyer, Major Li Wen, stood up and argued that the US military authorities' establishment of a military court in China to try war criminals was an illegal move. The US government has already abolished extraterritoriality in China and has not occupied any land within China. At the same time, military courts can only be established by military governments. According to the law, the US military cannot organize a military government in China. The plaintiff's defense lawyer, Lieutenant Colonel West, immediately stated that the judicial power of a military government is not restricted by territory, nor is it restricted from trying war criminals. The authority to establish the US military court belongs to the US military commander in the China war zone, and the US military commander's establishment of this court is also ordered by the Joint Committee of the Pacific Theater. This situation is the same in the Philippines, Japan, or Germany. The Chinese government has the right to establish this court, but the defendant has no right to cancel it.

Major Li Wen argued again that the Chinese government did not say it wanted to establish a military court. If the US military commander is ordered by the Pacific Joint Committee to organize a military court, then this committee can also make mistakes. At this point, the presiding judge, Colonel Middleton, asked both sides to temporarily cease arguing and said that he would consider the opinions before making a decision. Colonel Middleton then named the Japanese war criminals one by one and asked if they were guilty. The eighteen war criminals loudly replied "Not guilty" one by one.

Four pieces of evidence presented in court

The lieutenant colonel then described the arrest of the three American pilots and their torture to death. The court announced a recess, and then continued the hearing after fifteen minutes. The plaintiff's defense counsel introduced Major Maunaga of the US Military War Crimes Tribunal to testify. Major Mao had previously investigated the case officially. West presented a total of four pieces of evidence, including a letter from the US government to the Swiss government, informing the Japanese government that it should abide by international law and not kill prisoners of war. There was also the entire report and testimony of US pilot Lieutenant Sheff. Lieutenant Sheff was arrested and tortured by the Japanese army with the three murdered American pilots, Lieutenant Hua Mai, Sergeant Forbes, and Sergeant Hui Den, but fortunately he was not killed.

Three Chinese testify in court

The plaintiff's defense counsel also introduced Tatsuta Sotjiro, a Japanese guard at the Hankou prisoner-of-war camp of the 134th Army, to testify, reporting on the situation of the American pilots being held in the prison, and that he himself had delivered food to them. At twelve o'clock, the court temporarily adjourned. At 1:30 PM, the interrogation of witnesses continued. There were also three people from Hankou, Yang Deyou, Song Wenqing, and Zhang Jiayuan, who were specially summoned to testify. They were translated by Captain Bosding of the American War Crimes Tribunal in Beiping, who was fluent in the Beiping dialect. Yang Deyou was a farmer living near the Japanese civilian crematorium in Hankou who witnessed the Japanese burning the three American pilots to death. Zhang Jiayuan was a gardener at the crematorium who was forced by the Japanese to light the fire to burn the three men to death. Later, the ashes of the three were secretly buried without telling anyone. It was not until recently that the US military authorities investigated the area and revealed the truth.

By this point, it was 5:15 PM, and Song Wenqing had not yet been questioned. The court announced that it would resume the hearing at 9:00 AM today.

### Taiwanese Compatriots Return Home One After Another

[United Press, this city] The president of the Taiwan Construction Association told a United Press reporter today that the Chinese citizens of Taiwan origin in China were subjected to oppression by the Japanese during the war. A portion has been sent back to Taiwan to start their new lives and are enthusiastically assisting in reconstruction work. The first batch of evacuees, a total of 1,816 people, were assisted by the US military's United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Chinese Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the Shanghai Repatriation Headquarters of the Third Route Army of China, and returned to Taiwan aboard the US transport ship "Loomis." There are currently several thousand people in Shanghai waiting to be repatriated. It is estimated that 6,000 Taiwanese will return home via Shanghai. This work has been delayed due to a lack of ships.

### Yu Rupin Appointed Commissioner of the Social Affairs Bureau

Yu Rupin, the chairman of the Shanghai Southern Goods Industry Association, worked hard for national salvation during the War of Resistance and was arrested and tortured by the enemy's military police. However, Mr. Yu's will was firm and he remained unmoved. It is now heard that Wu Kaixian, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, has appointed Mr. Yu as a commissioner of the bureau.

### Repatriating Japanese Residents

Japanese residents and prisoners in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places, as well as those in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, except for a very small number of technicians who are temporarily requisitioned by various agencies, are all concentrated in Shanghai, awaiting ships to return home. There are approximately 80,000 Japanese residents in the Nanjing area, who are about to be completely repatriated. The Shanghai-Hangzhou line has relatively few means of transportation, so the Railway Bureau allows 500 Japanese prisoners of war to be transported to Shanghai for concentration every day. Currently, approximately 6,000 Japanese prisoners of war set sail from Shanghai every day to return home. According to US military authorities, 100 Liberty ships and multiple landing craft will be allocated for use in the near future. At that time, 25,000 Japanese residents can be repatriated every day.

### Lu Wenlong Righteously Saves a Youth

[Reported by this newspaper] At 8:15 PM yesterday, a man named Zhang Mingyuan boarded a ferry from Pudong to Nanshi. When the boat reached the middle of the river, Zhang actually jumped into the river to commit suicide. Lu Wenlong, a member of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, bravely rescued him and sent him to the Huangpu Branch of the Police Bureau's water patrol team for temporary custody. Zhang Mingyuan, 34 years old, recently came to Shanghai from Tianjin alone, with no one to rely on, and was forced to do so by the hardships of life.

### Old Zhabei Precinct: A Large Number of Bandits Arrested

[Our Report] The head of the Old Zhabei Precinct, Sun, received a tip that a large number of notorious bandits were hiding at No. 40 Southeast New Hotel on Baker Road, the Central Hotel, the Shenzhou Hotel, the Dafang Restaurant, No. 4 Xingyuli on Zhaojiabang Road in the South City, and the Jiewang Temple in Nanxiang. At around 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, he ordered the head of the judicial section, Song Bingzheng, to lead police officers Qu Shaoquan, Feng Xiushan, and Zhang Kuidong to these addresses. Over the course of forty-eight hours, they arrested more than forty bandits. They seized one submachine gun, four Mauser pistols, three handguns, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, and brought them all back to the precinct for interrogation. They confessed that they had robbed the Lao Zhengxing Restaurant on Xinzha Road, the Dashun Gong Southern Goods Store on the same road, the Longchang Southern Goods Store on Shandong Road, the Yuantai Clothing Store on Fujian Road, the Huaxin Woolen Goods Store on Hubei Road, a certain incense and candle shop on Zhongzheng Road, and dozens of stores including a certain Southern Goods Store, a furniture store, and a candy store at the Old North Gate. It is said that there are still large groups of accomplices on the run, and the precinct is currently conducting a vigorous search.

### Zhou Family Residence on Wuxing Road: A Major Bloodshed Incident Occurred the Night Before Last; Three Victims: a Red Dance Girl, Her Mother and Younger Brother; The Murderer Committed Suicide by Shooting Himself After the Incident

[Our Report] A major bloodshed incident involving the shooting of four men and women occurred suddenly at midnight the night before last at No. 3, Block C, Zhou Family Residence, No. 517, Wuxing Road, West Shanghai. The victims were a red dance girl, her mother, and her younger brother. The murderer also committed suicide by shooting himself after committing the crime. The details are as follows:

Zhang Xinhua, from Hebei, age 26, formerly the captain of the "puppet organization Finance Minister" Zhou Fohai's puppet guard, is currently employed at the Sino-American Cooperative. In his spare time, he frequents theaters and dance halls, and he has formed an inextricable bond with Wu Jieying (age 21), a red dance girl at the Xinhua Dance Hall.

A Deep Bond

Their affection grew ever stronger, and they established a "golden house" in an apartment on Hualong Road. Two months ago, Zhang began living at No. 3, Block C, Zhou Residence on Wuxing Road, West Shanghai. Wu's mother, Ai Zhu (age 46), and her younger brother, Wu Jiexin (age 21), both lived at No. 17 Mikang Lane on Linsen Road. Her father, Hanqing, works as a barber at the Lujiawan Precinct. At around 7:00 PM yesterday evening, Jieying, along with her mother and younger brother, went to the office of the Sino-American Cooperative at No. 262 Hunan Road to invite Zhang out to return to their Wuxing Road residence to discuss and resolve

marriage issues. Around 11:30 PM, multiple gunshots were suddenly heard from inside the house. Shao, a student living in the same residence (and a colleague of Zhang), heard the gunshots and opened the door to investigate. He saw Wu Aizhu, with a bullet penetrating her right ear and exiting the back of her head; Jieying, with a bullet in her lip and a hole in her left leg; and Jiexin, with a bullet entering his left ear and exiting his right temple. Xinhua was shot in his right temple, with the bullet exiting his left temple. All were lying in pools of blood, a truly tragic sight. Because it was late at night, the incident was not reported to the Changshu Precinct until around 7:00 AM. Zhang Canguang, the head of the judicial section, led a large group of police officers to the scene to investigate. They found four bodies lying horizontally in the room,

blood coagulated all over the floor. They found two handguns: one with six bullets still in the chamber, and the other with six of the seven bullets spent. Afterwards, according to reporters' investigation, the cause of the tragedy is said to be related to a love affair. Because Zhang was running out of money, Jieying intended to seek another partner. The old woman Aizhu threatened to report Zhang's traitorous and harmful deeds. The negotiations the night before were likely about Jieying's intention to end the cohabitation relationship, leading to this enormous bloodshed.

### Japanese Fugitive Arrested

[Our Report] On the 7th of this month, a prison break occurred at the detention center of the Shanghai Local Court on North Zhejiang Road. Apart from the Korean Shin Jeong-gyun, who was captured on the spot, the remaining two Japanese and one Chinese fugitive escaped without a trace. After Wu, the acting director of the center, worked with the North Railway Station Precinct to conduct a vigorous search, the Japanese fugitive Wei Ming was captured yesterday. The police department has handed him over to the prosecutor's office of the local court. The other two fugitives are still at large, and no clues have yet been obtained.

### Shipwreck; Bodies Recovered and Transported

[Our Report] The Shanghai Enterprise Company's chartered China Merchants Bureau No. 109 motorized sailboat (formerly known as "Kitamaru") wrecked at sea. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to the company's news, five bodies recovered from the sea off Zhoushan have now been transported to Longgang. Among them, in addition to Zhang Minyuan of the Jinjiang Tai Customs Brokerage, Zhao Zhenmin, the chief clerk of the company, was also identified by a gold ring he was wearing on his hand. Yesterday, Captain Xu of Bailonggang sent someone to deliver it. Therefore, there is no doubt that the ship has sunk. The company plans to send personnel to Bailonggang today to identify the corpses. They are currently discussing the aftermath with the families of the victims.

Sea Surface Often Has Hurricanes

The sea surface weather has been unstable recently, with frequent hurricanes. The British ship "Wilfred Mather" was sailing to Qinhuangdao the day before yesterday when it encountered a storm in the Sheshan waters. For safety, it turned back to Shanghai and will continue its voyage after the weather clears.

Taipei Ship to Sail to Shanghai: One of the largest merchant ships received by our country from the Japanese, with a deadweight of 7,000 tons, sank off the port of Keelung, Taiwan, when the Japanese army surrendered. After Chief Executive Chen Yi took office, he tried every possible means to salvage and repair it, and named it "Taipei." It is now known that the Taiwan Provincial Government will use it to transport Shanghai-based staff members and relief supplies allocated by the Relief Administration to Taiwan, and it will sail from Taiwan to Shanghai within a few days.

### Plaintiffs and Defendants Made Their Own Statements; Li Ze Retried Yesterday; The Court Ordered Both Parties to Submit More Evidence if Possible

[Our Report] The Li Ze case was retried yesterday. The defendant's defense lawyer presented various pieces of evidence, and the plaintiff also made a statement. The details are as follows:

The case was carefully questioned by Chief Judge Liu Yugui, along with two judges, Cao Jun and Zhu Zonghai, and prosecutors and clerks in a collegial panel. Both lawyers, Zhang Shijian and Chen Tingrui, who were hired by the defendant, appeared in court. After Li Ze was brought to the court, Chief Judge Liu ordered the clerk to read the record of the defendant's previous statement and asked Li Ze

whether there were any errors. Li immediately said there were two points: (1) The puppet commodity control association did not have a chairman system, but a director system. (2) The price of the pig iron sold to the Sendai Iron Factory was 5,600 yuan of puppet currency per picul, not per catty. Then, Attorney Chen stood up to defend, stating five points: (1) Regarding the sale of pig iron, the prosecutor claimed that the free transfer of metal products was prohibited at that time, but the investigation showed that internal movement within the city was not restricted. This is evidenced by the "News Daily" in October 1944, which was full of

advertisements for the sale of scrap iron. (2) Not only did the Xinxin Company sell pig iron to the Sendia Iron Factory, but in September 1944, two other companies, Dingfeng and others, also sold pig iron to Sendia. (3) At that time, the payment method of Sendia was to use appropriation orders in three batches. As there was a surplus, there were check stubs of Xinxin returning the balance. (4) Li has helped the underground work, which can be proved by the certificate of the Shanghai Representative Office of the Military Commission. (5) The defendant has subsidized a large amount of military expenses to the loyal rescue army. At this point, the court ordered the clerk to read the previous statement records of the accusers and asked Shu Yueqiao and others if there were any errors. Shu said it was correct, but added three points: (1) Li claimed that he was forced to serve as a director of the Puppet Chamber of Commerce. This is to justify himself. (2) The employment of Japanese consultants was said by Li to be in response to the situation at that time, but this was Li's own desire to contact the enemy. (3) Li claimed to have helped the underground work, why did he not declare it in the police bureau and the prosecutor's investigation court earlier, but did not raise it until the last court session, which is suspicious. In addition, other accusers, Han Wucheng, Ye Qiubin, and others, stated that the Xinxin Company evaded taxes and sold Japanese goods before the war, and was therefore

punished by the authorities. At this point, Li immediately defended his own actions of comforting the national army, helping to rescue and repatriate refugees, and rescuing underground workers Lin Yaopo, the leader of the New Capital Hotel, and Xinxin employees Wang Zhihong, Chen Baozhang, Wang Qiuyue, and US military communications officer Huang Ruitang after the Shanghai War. He had also donated 77 million yuan in puppet currency to Yang Hailin's loyal rescue army in Pudong; organized a group to supply the national army with materials with Guo Shun and others; and was ordered to rescue materials during the Allied bombing of Shanghai, all of which can be verified by the Military Control Bureau of the Third Theater Command and other agencies.

Investigations and certifications finally stated that if he had done anything harmful or evil during his tenure as a director of the Puppet Merchant Chamber of Commerce, he would willingly accept legal sanctions. The court then questioned Yang Shenrui, the accountant of the Xinxin Company, Han Zhiyun, the manager of the Sendai Iron Factory, and the manager of the Xinda Bank, which had dealings with the Xinxin Company, and reviewed the accounts of the sale of pig iron. Chief Judge Liu questioned Li because there were two receipts in which

signatures did not match. Li said that the signatures were usually the responsibility of himself, his brother, and Deputy Manager Xiao. The accusers, Shu Yueqiao and others, believed that there were suspicious points in this, and both parties held different opinions. Lawyer Chen Tingrui then requested that the court appoint an accountant to investigate all accounts with the accountant of the Xinxin Company, which was the most fair way. At this point, the court ordered both parties to collect evidence within one week and wait until 2:30 PM on the 18th to open the court for investigation again.

Interrogation of Witnesses in Three Traitor Cases

Yesterday morning, three other traitor cases were heard: (1) Zhang Qipin, who manufactured洋釘 (a type of nail) for the enemy, was questioned by the witness Hou Wenbin. (2) Gu Youtang, who recruited workers for the enemy, was questioned by the witness Shimazaki Seizo, a Japanese national. (3) Yin Ziming, the captain of the Qingpu County puppet security brigade, was hated by Ma Jiwu, a loyal rescue army cadre, for instigating his subordinates to revolt, and looted all of Ma's property. Ma then reported the incident and filed a civil suit to recover the losses. Because the bandit is on the run, the court ordered that the cases be retried when they are arrested. Also, the Gan Deyun case will be sentenced this afternoon.

### Import and Export Reality: Machinery and Other Items Cannot Come Suddenly

[Our Report] After the restoration, many domestic industrial circles have ordered textile machinery and other machinery from the United States. However, it is said that new machinery will not be easily shipped to China in the short term, because it must be given priority to markets such as the United Kingdom. Similarly, other materials, such as certain raw materials, also have considerable reservations. For example, several batches of pigments ordered by this port have been ordered, but people in the same industry recently received calls saying that the quantity must be greatly reduced and the price must be increased. Those that can be shipped to China smoothly are still general consumer goods. According to a certain importer and exporter yesterday, since the exchange rate has not been determined, its import and export business is still limited to barter trade, and it is not easy to develop for a while.

### Newspaper Trade Union Hosts Various Newspaper Authorities Yesterday

The Shanghai Newspaper Trade Union held a tea party for the heads of various newspapers at the Central Vegetable Club on Fourth Malu at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon.

During the meeting, a preliminary exchange of views was held on issues such as salary adjustments in the industry. In the spirit of labor-management agreement, the results were extremely harmonious.

### Speculation Group Suffers a Head-on Blow; Gold Price Plummets by 100,000; US Dollars and Hong Kong Dollars Also Follow the Drop

Yesterday, the fragile minds of speculators were unsettled by the news of Chairman Chiang's arrival in Shanghai, showing some concern. Silver and money businesses contracted their lending one after another, and credit became extraordinarily tight. The bulls were slaughtered endlessly. With supply exceeding demand, the price drop was severe. It was even worse near noon. Although the opening price in the morning was 1.39 million, the long positions from the previous week were frightened by the news of Chairman Chiang's arrival in Shanghai, and they scrambled to sell, causing the price to fall all the way to below 1.29 million before it stabilized. Jewelers bought in at the low price, and the price recovered to 1.32 million and then entered a consolidation. Unfortunately, the recovery was only a fleeting moment, and the downward trend had already been established. The long positions were unable to stabilize their footing and began to cut their losses. The "ten-day" loans needed to be repaid, and the silver and money businesses were also concerned about new loans due to the environment and were unwilling to comply. The arrogant speculators were now crestfallen. The price drop resumed near noon, and at noon it even fell to below 1.22 million before recovering slightly. The final transaction price was about 1.24 million, a massive drop of 100,000 compared to last Saturday. The next-day delivery price rose from 1.25 million to 1.27 million in the afternoon. Banks from Sichuan were eager to sell their shares, jewelers' workers went on strike, and there were rumors that gold and silver jewelry stores were unwilling to buy in. The price fell again to 1.15 million. Gold jewelry in jewelers' shops was reduced to 126,000, silver to 1,300, and silver dollars to 780. The interest rate for clearings was from 1.2 to 1.8, and finally 1.6.

Although the US dollar was affected by the gold market, it also suffered a severe drop. However, because the speculative atmosphere was weaker, and there were no long positions standing, although it fell, it was not as severe as gold. The swap price shrank from about 720 yuan to about 690 yuan. In the afternoon, there were rumors that it would be pegged at 2,000 to 1, and it rose from 178 to 1,820. In the blink of an eye, the gold market plummeted, and the US dollar inevitably followed the downward trend, finally settling at around 1,750 yuan. The swap head also squeezed closer to 650 yuan per 10 taels, a drop of 150 yuan compared to last Saturday. Although old Hong Kong dollars were slightly affected, banks were buying, and they were very stable. New Hong Kong dollars ended at a low price. As a result, old Hong Kong dollars fell by 30 yuan, and new Hong Kong dollars fell by 15 yuan.

### "Ban on Speculation" News Spreads Fear; Stock Prices All Show Low Prices

Chinese stocks were also unfavorable due to the environment and lacked new stimuli. Under the panic of the long positions, supply exceeded demand. Yong Yarn fell from 2,680 yuan, Meiya from 2,060 yuan, and Jingfu from 138 yuan, falling all the way. Although there were struggles in the middle, the closing price at noon was still low. Compared to last Saturday, Yong Yarn and Meiya each fell by more than 400 yuan, Jingfu fell by 22 yuan, Qinxing by 24 yuan, and Xinguang by 25 yuan. The remaining unpopular stocks also followed the decline by about 10% to 20%. After the close, due to the news of a ban on speculation, the asking price continued to decline.

Foreign stocks saw a small setback as soon as they opened in the morning. Lacking a main buyer, sellers were eager to unload their shares. At noon, they all closed at low prices and sell-offs, falling 10% to 20% compared to last Saturday.

### Government Bonds Plummet; Internal Unification Bonds a Little Over 100 Yuan

Government bonds plummeted yesterday because the reports said that the proceeds from the internal unification (統) A bonds must wait until there is a surplus in customs duties before they can be repaid, and other foreign debts would be paid by the central government first. Long positions' expectations were disappointed again, and they rushed to settle, and people were quite panicked. Category C was still stable at the beginning, but the sellers were eager to sell, and the price fell all the way from 2,220 yuan. Although there were several fluctuations in the middle, individual investors were panicked, and large firms in the industry were unable to do anything due to the tight credit. At noon, they all closed at low prices. Category C broke seven barriers in a row and closed at a sell price of 1,600 yuan, a massive drop of 600 yuan compared to last Saturday. Category A and B fell by 270 yuan, Category D fell by 170 yuan, and Category E fell by 280 yuan.

### Yarn Market Calm

The market turned calm yesterday, as the sudden drop in the price of gold softened the minds of the people. 16-count Bright yarn traded at 689,000, mostly by fellow traders. 20-count Blue Phoenix at 760,000, and Special Double Horse at 930,000, supply and sale were available, but buying interest was dampened by the decline in pure gold. Overall, 20-count yarn fell by 120,000 yuan, and the price of 40-count single yarn and 42-count Blue Phoenix thread were still stable, rising slightly compared to the end of last week.

### Spot Cotton Sales Brisk; Price Rises Again Compared to Last Week

Spot cotton trading was very brisk yesterday, and market prices were frequently rising. Purchases by the China Textile Construction Company were still concentrated, mostly raw materials such as 42-count and 32-count fine velvet. The transaction volume of coarse velvet was not large, and the price rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to last Saturday.

### New Woolen Cloth Transactions Limited

The woolen cloth transactions have been scattered and sporadic, wholesale and retail sales are limited. This is because the opening price of the紅盤(good luck) is expensive, the firms purchased a considerable amount last month, and it is still early to determine whether spring sales will be smooth. As a result, the buying group in this street and other buyers are waiting and watching. The situation at the Public Tea Association is far less prosperous than in previous years. The same trade is still following the old practice, closing early before the Lantern Festival.

### Speculative Transactions Contract; Silk Prices Are Weak

Yesterday, the market for rayon maintained the original plate from Saturday. The lowest asking price for 120-count Tianqiao spot goods was 1.75 million yuan, and the final asking price was 1.8 million yuan. Factory sales were sluggish, and there were no transactions in the spot market. The warehouse list traded at 1.17 million yuan in the morning and 1.19 million yuan in the afternoon. The price of 120-count miscellaneous brands was lower, 100,000 yuan shorter than Tianqiao. Factory sales prices were slightly shorter than on Saturday due to the impact of the drop in gold prices. However, intermediate-level another ancestors are searched for because they had a strong base. Holders are unwilling to sell cheaply. The price of silk goods, Dashun Gebi crepe, fell sharply. Compared with Saturday, each code was 200 yuan shorter. Meiya bedding fell by 20,000 yuan per 100 pieces. People's minds are soft, and transactions are slack.

### Tea Prices Increase Step by Step; Taiwan Tea Has Arrived in Shanghai

Taiwan red and green tea, which has been out of stock for a long time, has reportedly arrived in Shanghai in more than 1,000 boxes. The quality is good and will be on the market soon. As for the tea market situation in this city, it is still riding the rising trend of the past week. In addition, the buying interest is strong, and the hoarding mentality of the cargo party is intensifying, resulting in prices rising step by step. For example, the top green jasmine flower has broken through the 300,000 yuan mark per ancestor. Other colors are also tracking upward. Looking at the current situation, actual sales are not decreasing, and the inventory in the market is few and far between, and the demand is far greater than the supply, because the tea production season is still far away. The future looks very optimistic.

### Sugar List Prices Increase Slightly

Yesterday, the Public Association for Sugar continued to list for sale, and prices increased slightly. The list price for both No. 22 medium sand white must be combined with No. 18 medium sand white at 20%, the price were both 48,000 yuan, an increase of 2,000 yuan, raw sand red 55,000 yuan, and green sugar 33,000 yuan, an increase of 3,000 yuan, with a total of more than 7,000 pieces. The opening prices for customers and goods are slightly set, medium sand white 51,200 yuan, with lack of transactions because there were fewer households.

### New Banknotes Arrive in Shanghai: 4,000 Boxes Shipped From the United States

A large number of banknotes arrived in Shanghai, loaded on the British ship "Italy Willow" of辦托司(trusteeship)号(number), a total of four thousand and twenty-one boxes, loaded from New York.

### Price of Level-Priced Rice Increased; Rice Market Looks More Bullish

Yesterday, all goods softened, but rice prices saw a more attractive show of strength. The level-priced rice of the Grain Administration Bureau also increased in price with the market, making people's hearts firmer.粳(Jing) and秈(Xian) rice and白元(Baiyuan) were increased by 3-500 yuan. Yellow beans were 100-plus yuan tired and the bean cakes were also average. Flour came back to a small 100-200 yuan. The oil market has Qingdao raw oil for sale, turning the store’s stomach into inert, raw oil a small 2-3,000 yuan, and soy oil a small 1,000-plus yuan.

### The Coal Market's Rising Trend Gradually Slows; Confiscated Anthracite Coal Expected to Be Released; Shipments from Other Ports Arrive in Steady Streams

Merchants dealing in anthracite coal dust, whose goods were previously confiscated at the McGinlay Road Station, have now received an order from the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Considering their lack of familiarity with the new regulations, they are permitted to truthfully report their goods, which will be released after verification. As a result, the spot market's supply has visibly eased. It is also reported that the Fuel Management Bureau, due to the recent increase in anthracite coal arrivals, will organize a sale at fixed prices, bringing relief to the public. Various households are frequently selling at high prices, and the upward trend is gradually easing. However, anthracite coal lumps are still in short supply, causing their market price to rise. As for bituminous coal, due to low reserves in various other ports, procurement and transportation must be approved by the Fuel Management Bureau and cannot be handled privately, leading to a reduction in arrivals. Although the responsibility for supplying low-priced bituminous coal for civilian use has been divided among different districts, the quantities are meager, and there is no opportunity for turnover purchases. Consequently, sellers' asking prices are becoming increasingly tight, but actual sales are normal, and prices are not rising sharply.

Further news: After the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Fuel Committee regulated and streamlined fuel sources in the city, the situation has gradually improved, with shipments arriving in steady succession. The American vessel *Steel Vendor* recently arrived from Qinhuangdao, carrying 9,600 tons of coal, and is docked at the E-Tai Hing Wharf for unloading. It is also reported that Hongji bituminous coal is expected to arrive in Shanghai within days.

### White Lead Wire Market Lively

White lead wire, also known as "Chongxin" lead wire, comes in both soft and hard varieties. Currently, both types are in demand. Mirror factories are eagerly purchasing sizes 15 and 16 of soft white lead wire, while the spring industry is buying as much as possible of sizes 12 and 13 of hard white lead wire. As a result, the market is quite lively. The current asking price is 55,000 yuan per dan [approximately 50 kilograms].

### British and American Cultural Foundations: Only Existing Funds, No New Income; Progress Hampered During the War

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing] The British Boxer Indemnity Refund Board has now been renamed the "China-Britain Cultural Fund Board," with Minister Zhu Jiahua continuing to serve as chairman and Vice-Minister Hang Liwu as director-general. The Board has no new income and relies solely on existing funds to maintain its operations. Currently, the China Geographical Research Institute, the China Sericulture Research Institute, and the Art Academy, all established in Chongqing, are the Board's supplementary research projects. Once the national government returns to the capital, the Board and its affiliated research institutions will relocate to Nanjing to resume their work.

Similarly, the China-US Educational and Cultural Fund Board has also suffered from a lack of American funds. Although it maintained a Shanghai office in the American Citibank Building on the Bund during the war, progress was limited. The head office in Chongqing, relying on existing funds, provides partial subsidies and awards to academic research in the inland southwestern provinces. A majority of the Board's members, such as Dr. Shi Zhaoji and Dr. Meng Lu, are currently in the United States. (The board is comprised of fifteen members in total). It is anticipated that once the national government returns to the capital, the Chinese and American members will come to China one after another to convene an annual meeting and further discuss the Board's future development.

In the match between Donghua and V Team, V Team led 19-17 in the first half. After the change of ends, Donghua relied on its strength and made every shot count. V Team gradually ran out of steam, and Donghua won the match 38-29.

In the last match, Sakor faced the Blue Team. Sakor's skills were superb, and their central breakthrough method was successful again. Sakor led 39-15 in the first half. After the start of the second half, the Sakor team actually made two points in a row, but this was only a flash in the pan, and then it was Sakor's world again. In the end, Sakor won 54-40 against another strong opponent.

### Old Beyond One's Years

— Xiaoshan

Older people often have a certain expectation of younger people. This expectation is almost invariably "old beyond one's years"!

So-called "old beyond one's years" is not just "precocious," but also "prematurely aged."

To understand worldly affairs and human relationships earlier, to imitate the cunning and treacherousness of seasoned schemers sooner, to grasp the art of advancing and retreating sooner, to learn to be hypocritical and perfunctory sooner.

As a result, you see a society filled with a group of "little old men" who are old before their time! Based on their age, they should be full of vigor, liveliness, innocence, and purity. They should possess some courage and righteousness, and they should "fire off" a few times and show some "childishness"!

But they have conformed. They have already put on the shackles of "old age," they have already crossed "youth" and stepped into the other end of life—"old age." They follow older people in talking old talk, putting on old airs, and acting old. They are already like coal ash that has been burned by a boiler, unable to ignite the fire of life.

Professor Cole gave us a sentence: "If this stage is not mature, don't even think about the next stage developing." Not allowing young cells to reproduce to their capacity is a "dry" life.

We are not opposed to the cultivation that young people should have, the knowledge they should possess, and the breadth of mind they should develop, but these are not to tell us to skip this stage and recite "old age scriptures."

What is "old age"?

Old age is answering "accordingly" to an "etcetera."

Old age is not opening one's mouth, or even opening one's eyes.

Old age is nodding as much as possible!

Old age is expressing "I never eat meat!" if the host brings out tofu.

Old age is wearing earmuffs in the right ear and stuffing cotton in the left ear.

Old age is wearing a patched cotton robe and stuffing gold bars into one's socks.

Old age is saying "ha ha ha" to the sun and calling out to "Heaven" whenever it rains!

Old age is killing one's friend and sending a "condolence gift."

My friends, I would rather you be seen as "childish" than have the "taste of old age." Today, lies and hypocrisy have already occupied every corner of the universe; there is no need for you to enrich their ranks.

"Always preserve your youth, truth, and passion!"

Please remember Goethe's words!

### Explanation of "Party"

— Peng Yao

The word "party" is not a bad word. It seems that Mr. Zhang Shenfu had a bit of a misunderstanding in the Political Consultative Conference regarding the explanation of the word "party."

He said: "The party has nearly harmed China. Chinese people do not like it. There is an ancient saying that a gentleman is social but not partisan, and from the meaning of the word, 'party' is about valuing darkness, which is liking darkness." As soon as these words were spoken, those without parties or factions smiled at each other. As a result, some newspapers said that this was a profound statement. In fact, the meaning of the word is not explained this way. He was completely taking the literal meaning and speaking nonsense, attacking the dark parts of any party is okay, but to discuss a party based on the character itself, he has really committed the mistake of glossing over words!

According to the Shuowen Jiezi [a Chinese dictionary from the Han Dynasty], "party" means "not distinct, from valuing darkness." It means the multitude. Darkness means the common people, the black-haired people. In ancient times, the common people tied black cloth around their heads to distinguish themselves from officials and scholars. Valuing means respecting. Mozi's chapters on "Valuing Agreement" and "Valuing Talent" can attest to this. Valuing darkness should mean respecting the common people, which is a footnote to "the people are the most important" and a symbol of "democracy." The common people are many, how can a party be separated from the people? This is the deep meaning of the ancients in creating the word.

Let us look at another dictionary, the Shiming, which also says, "Five hundred families form a party, the head of the party is also a respected elder in a gathering." They never looked down on the party. Yang Xiong's Fangyan [a collection of regional words and dialects] says: "Party, understanding, philosopher, knowing. The people of Chu call it party, or understanding; the people between Qi and Lai call it philosopher." The common saying now is "to understand, to know," "to understand" is "party," originally an ancient sound, but dialects are different. Since one establishes a party, one should understand the psychology of the people, know the suffering of the people, in order to represent the people's voices, and raise legitimate demands. It is not that one can form a party in a confused way and call oneself the head of a certain party.

"Party" has a meaning of beauty and goodness, recorded in both the Guangyun and Guangya [dictionaries], which is praised by the general public, and there are no words of disparagement or contempt. The reason why there are "gentlemen do not form parties" and other taunts of "cliques" is only because they have the behavior of forming cliques for personal gain or planting parties for private purposes, and only then is there this occasional argument, which is not to be completely denied. This has an explanation in dialectics and logic. How can one call a deer a horse and make something out of nothing?

In the Han Dynasty, the party of confinement, in the Tang Dynasty, Niu (Sengru) Li (Deyu), in the Song Dynasty, the Luoshuo Shuo, and in the Ming Dynasty, the Donglin and non-Donglin, their party members had gentlemen and villains, which cannot be generalized. Confucius was born in an era of monarchical autocracy, holding the policy of "the people can be made to follow, but not made to know," advocating the spirit of "when the state is well-governed, scholars and commoners do not discuss," this kind of view is of course not suitable for today's democratic freedom, and the prevalence of party politics. Criticizing today's political parties and revolutionary parties with the old-fashioned words of "gentlemen do not form parties" is an anachronism and an inappropriate analogy.

Looking at the facts again, Mr. Shao Lizi replied well: "If there was no Tongmenghui [United League], the Qing government could not have been overthrown; if there was no reorganization of the Kuomintang in the thirteenth year of the Republic [1924], the Northern Warlords could not have been overthrown; and if there was no leadership of the Kuomintang in the eight years of resistance against Japan, China today would not know what it would have become. Since the Great War, all countries in the world have suffered, let alone China, which was the first to resist Japan and suffered the most? At present, the country is in distress, we should reflect on ourselves, but to say that it is harmed by the party is absolutely unfair." It is truly an unbreakable famous saying.

We do not hate parties, and we are willing to join parties with political views and actions, engage in bright struggles, and do not want to see meaningless sabotage. A party is light, not darkness. A party is the people are the most important, not the sharing of spoils among a few. This is a natural law, and it is hoped that the gentlemen who run any party will understand it. Separated from the masses, without "valuing darkness," there is no party. Relying solely on opportunities to form a party and blocking justice to call out, that is without the foundation of a party, how can one talk about a party?

### From Land Consolidation to Usage

— Yang Mou

Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau's commencement of land registry consolidation and ownership registration has brought land issues back into public discourse.

Why is land consolidation necessary? How should it be carried out? Is the completion of land consolidation considered the ultimate goal?

The urgency of land consolidation is akin to that of census clarification, and its importance may even surpass it. Without accurate statistics for the entire land area, all production and construction plans become baseless fantasies. Unfortunately, in our "so-so" nation, everything is "so-so," and land registry is a complete mess. Take Shanghai as an example. The land value in Shanghai undoubtedly ranks first in the country, yet its land registry is fragmented. For instance, property owners' certificates include pre-Qing Dynasty square deeds, perpetual leases with foreign firm names (also known as Dao Deeds), land ownership certificates issued by the Land Bureau, small corner remnants of title deeds, partition deeds issued by bank trust company real estate departments, and even some who possess large plots of land without any proof whatsoever. Conversely, there are also many who hold land certificates but whose land has long been used for roads due to road construction. Imagine the state of affairs when so many types of documents originate from various organizations and span long periods! Shanghai is like this; rural areas are even worse. Failure to consolidate land registries has far-reaching implications on the entire national economic policy, hindering accurate estimation of overall productive capacity. In the short term, it easily breeds disputes and conflicts. Relying solely on the memory of the "Bao Zheng" (local security chief) to manage complex land situations according to Chinese customs naturally leads to errors.

The most important step in land consolidation is land surveying. Once the land surveying is completed, and cadastral maps are drawn up, public announcements are made for people to register, identify boundaries, and confirm ownership. From the individual perspective, property rights are guaranteed permanently, and from the collective perspective, the clarification of land registry begins.

Land registry consolidation in Shanghai started early, but it was hindered by the presence of foreign concessions, further complicated by unequal treaties that required recognizing perpetual leases issued by foreign firms. Since the enemy's occupation, the land registry has inevitably fallen into further chaos. This time, the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau's undertaking of land registry consolidation is among the first in recovered urban areas, and its work is undoubtedly crucial and immense.

However, land registry consolidation, while a vital part of land work, is only a part. Land consolidation is merely a means, while the goal of land work is to fully utilize land and achieve the principle of equalizing land ownership in the People's Livelihood. People often mistakenly believe that land registry consolidation marks the end of land administration, but it is merely the first step. For example, land prices in Shanghai naturally rise daily with the city's prosperity, and speculative merchants treat land as a commodity, preferring to see it lie barren, waiting for its value to soar. Those who research soil improvement, suitable agricultural products, or plan other municipal improvements to rationalize land use and increase its value are rare. Once land registry consolidation is completed, the second step can begin: fully utilizing the land and implementing Sun Yat-sen's principle of equal land rights.

Land consolidation is merely a means, while land utilization is our goal. The first step should be as swift as possible, and land utilization should be studied as thoroughly as possible. Because the land issue is related to the entire nation's economic lifeline and every individual's immediate interests, the state must take responsibility for promoting land work, and every citizen has an unavoidable duty to assist!

### Radar for the Blind

— Zhong Mao

The blind will soon be able to use an electrical device that prevents them from colliding with obstacles while walking. The device is a small box that emits a narrow beam of light, and by rotating this beam, the blind person can know the path to take. When the light beam hits telephone poles, fences, houses, or other obstacles, it is immediately reflected onto a lens on the box, then focused onto a photocell, causing a buzzing sound in the earpiece, indicating an obstacle ahead. The blind person can tell the distance between themselves and the obstacle from the length of the buzzing sound.

However, to avoid inaccurate signals caused by sunlight or artificial light, the light beam emitted by the small box, like the radio waves emitted by military radar transmitters, is intermittent, and the photocell is not sensitive to continuous light.

Currently, the device weighs only nine pounds, making it very convenient to carry.

### Reader's Letter Vividly Depicts the Situation, Requesting Police Authorities to Eliminate Three Evils: Pickpockets, Thugs, and Drug Dealers Plaguing the People Deeply. Secret Investigation, Arrest, Strict Punishment, and Thorough Elimination of Evil

Editor: The mysterious darkness of Shanghai is everywhere. Based on what I know, I request you to publish this in your newspaper to urge the wise authorities to eradicate it as soon as possible for the benefit of the people. (1) A large number of pickpockets, reportedly over a hundred, are lurking in Fujian Road, Guangdong Road, and the surrounding alleys. Their leader is said to be dressed in a suit and tie, appearing like a boss or young master, renting rooms to direct his accomplices and dividing the spoils on the spot. If an accomplice is arrested, the leader uses his extensive connections to secure their release, often within a few hours, or at most a day or two. Consequently, the pickpockets act boldly, and the suffering of the victims is imaginable. The people living there dare not speak out for fear of retaliation. (2) Gangsters gather at the wharves along the Huangpu River, threatening merchants and travelers carrying goods onto ships. These merchants and travelers are weak and unable to resist. To avoid immediate losses, they pay protection money and have to say nice things. Although there are public officials at the wharves, they turn a blind eye and deaf ear. The victims have to swallow their anger and have no recourse. (3) During the enemy-puppet regime, a Korean living in the Yude Lane on Old Granary Street in the city sold opium. After the victory, despite strict anti-drug orders, the Korean still lives there and continues to operate, using ignorant food stores and street vendors to sell on his behalf. The flow of "three-rivers-rice" (slang for opium) never stops, and people come and go to buy it without restraint. The above three evils are open secrets currently disrupting Shanghai and poisoning the people. Please urge the police authorities to pay attention, eradicate evil thoroughly, and bring happiness to society! (Reader: Tian Min)
