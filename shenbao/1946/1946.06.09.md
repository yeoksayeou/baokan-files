### Decisions from the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Meeting: Land Tax Collection in Kind Extended for One Year; Chairman's Admonition to Pay Attention to the People's Suffering

[Our Nanjing Office, 8th Dispatch] The meeting to revise the national fiscal revenue and expenditure system continued its review session on the morning of the 8th, discussing the unfinished proposals from the 1st and 3rd groups from yesterday. The issue of continuing to collect taxes in kind was discussed in detail. Many spoke about the reality of rural poverty, and that the Executive Yuan would be unable to maintain [the current system] this time. The third general meeting was convened at 3 PM, presided over by Minister Xu. Chairman Chiang arrived at the meeting at 3:37 PM. Everyone stood at attention to pay their respects. The Chairman walked to the stage, put on his glasses, sat upright for three minutes, and surveyed the surroundings of the venue. He then stood up to give a speech, finishing at 4:05 PM, and then left immediately. The content of the Chairman's admonition specifically explained the extension of the collection [of taxes in kind] for one year. He also hoped that the representatives of each province, after returning to their respective regions, would convey this intention to each county and city, as this one year is truly the most difficult stage. This concerns the national economy and the people's livelihood, and the survival of the nation, so everyone must understand and assist in completing this matter. He then cited three matters as the focal points of the work of each representative in the future: (1) Land measurement; (2) Population census; (3) Reorganization of the Baojia system. After the speech, everyone was deeply moved. The meeting then continued with the report of the review. The proposals of the 1st and 2nd groups, with the exception of the first case and minor modifications to each case, were passed according to the review opinions. The meeting adjourned on the 9th. The general meeting will continue at 10 AM on the morning of the 10th, and may conclude in the afternoon. The review opinion on the tax exemption and requisition portion of the first case was: "The land tax that should be exempted will be reduced and exempted on average over three years. This year's land tax collection fee and requisitioned grain will each be collected at two-thirds of the fixed amount," and was changed to: "The land tax that should be exempted will be reduced and exempted on average over two years. This year's land tax collection in kind and requisitioned grain will each be collected at one-half of the fixed amount." This was then brought up for discussion again due to the Chairman's instructions on this matter. Finally, it was decided to submit it to the Chairman for approval according to the review opinions. Also, tonight, Ministers Yu and Xu jointly hosted a banquet for the attending representatives.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang attended the fiscal revenue and expenditure system meeting at 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 8th and addressed the more than 170 attendees, saying first: This meeting will not only clarify the central and local fiscal revenue and expenditure system, but it can also determine the future direction of the national economy and the people's livelihood, and its mission is extremely important. During the meeting period, everyone gathered their thoughts and wisdom and made many important resolutions. It is hoped that everyone will implement them one by one after returning, and only then can the people's suffering be alleviated, and the nation's finances be restored to normal as soon as possible. This meeting decided to extend the land tax collection in kind for one year. This measure is necessary to complete the reconstruction work. However, local grain bureaus must especially consider the people's suffering when collecting taxes in kind, reduce collection procedures, and strictly prohibit harsh disturbances in order to facilitate the people. Chairman Chiang finally mentioned three matters: land measurement, population census, and property registration, which he considered to be the basic work of nation-building, and he hoped that everyone would work together to complete these three important tasks to lay the foundation for nation-building.

### Joint Meeting Held in Yan'an; Report of Mao Zedong's Visit to Nanjing Unconfirmed; Mo Dehui, et al. Visit Marshall for Talks

[Our Nanjing Office, 8th Dispatch] According to those with reliable sources: After Lu Dingyi returned to Yan'an last night to meet with Mao Zedong, the CCP headquarters in Yan'an held a high-level cadre meeting that lasted until midnight. On the 8th, the CCP leaders in Yan'an continued to hold joint meetings in the morning and afternoon. It is heard that today's meeting, in addition to continuing to discuss the important issues related to ceasefire, road restoration, and reorganization and unification of the military listed in the announcement of the ceasefire by the Chairman of the National Government, also put forward for discussion the ceasefire proposals drafted by the CCP representatives, including Zhou Enlai. Judging from the speeches of the CCP representatives and self-proclaimed "third parties" in the past thirty-six hours, the CCP has clearly focused its attention on the so-called modification of the "five-to-one" ratio in the original military reorganization plan in the Northeast, hoping to further preserve the superior strength of the Northeast Communist Army. Since the CCP has placed the focus of future negotiations on military affairs, its future movements are worthy of attention.

[Our Nanjing Office, 8th Dispatch] Tonight, it is widely rumored here that Zhou Enlai may return to Nanjing tomorrow night, and it is also rumored that Mao Zedong is planning to come to Nanjing to pay respects to Chairman Chiang and to answer Marshall, so as to have further cordial talks with all parties. If the situation does have the possibility of a turn for the better, Mao may stay in Nanjing and personally direct the CCP representatives attending the Military Mediation Tripartite Committee and the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group meeting, so as to avoid delays in returning to [Yan'an] for instructions when major problems occur. After this news came out, observers in Nanjing made the following speculations: (1) The CCP will change its strategy and political strategy, and use a peaceful offensive to win the sympathy of the Chinese people; (2) The CCP will seize this fleeting precious opportunity and use various soft methods to create a very strong peaceful atmosphere, so that the government and the American side will be elated, indulge in reconciliation and be unable to extricate themselves, and make the third party exhaust their efforts, be obsessed with the opportunity, and be complacent, in order to achieve their goal of delaying the current situation. However, as of tonight, it has not been proven that Mao Zedong will accompany Zhou Enlai to Nanjing.

[Our Nanjing Office, 8th Dispatch] It is reported that Liang Shuming, Luo Longji, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, and Huang Yanpei of the Democratic League, and Li Huang, Chen Qitian, and Mo Dehui of the Youth Party, submitted the following opinions to Marshall on the 8th: (1) Extend the ceasefire period; (2) During the ceasefire period, military and political coordination must be considered simultaneously to resolve [the issues].

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, left for Shanghai by car on the evening of the 8th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, social notables Mo Dehui, Democratic League representatives Liang Shuming, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, and Luo Longji, and Youth Party representatives Li Huang and Chen Qitian, went to Haining Road to meet with Marshall. They exchanged views on unity and peace issues for about two hours, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. After the representatives left Marshall, they discussed for a long time at the Youth Party office in Fengyi Village.

### Military Mediation Department Plans for Reorganization and Demobilization; Military Reorganization Meeting to Be Held Tomorrow; Mediation Work in the Northeast Awaits Commencement

[Our Beiping Office, 8th Dispatch] The Executive Headquarters has scheduled a military reorganization meeting for the 10th of this month to discuss four issues, including reorganization and demobilization. If the KMT-CCP problem is completely resolved within half a month of the ceasefire, the military reorganization work of the Executive Headquarters can be quickly launched, and it is hoped that it will start in the Northeast first. Recently, Chairman Chiang telegraphed instructions to the Executive Headquarters, stating that there must be a time limit attached to the military reorganization process, otherwise we will not know when the reorganization will begin. Currently, the second phase of the reorganization of the National Army in the Yangtze River region will be completed by the end of June, and the third phase of the National Army in North China is scheduled to be carried out in July and August. The CCP has not yet proposed the numbers and roster of the troops they intend to retain. The CCP explained that the conflict has not yet stopped, and transportation and communication are difficult, so they cannot submit them. However, they claimed that local reorganization is already underway in some areas. The Zhangjiakou Military Training School, jointly run by the CCP and the US, has already started training more than 100 translators to translate the teaching of the American instructors to the officers and soldiers being trained after the school opens.

[Our Beiping Office, 8th Dispatch] The Executive Headquarters has added a Deputy Commissioner. The government side has internally decided on Cai Wenzhi, and the CCP side had originally decided on Rao Shushi. Since Rao will go to Changchun, there is talk of changing to Luo Ruiqing. (Note: Cai and Luo are both chiefs of staff.) The American side has not yet heard of who will be appointed.

### Yan'an Liberation Daily Publishes a Strong Anti-American Commentary; Nanjing Central Daily Rebuts It Sharply

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] Amidst the propaganda for ceasefire, the Yan'an Broadcasting Station broadcast an editorial from the Liberation Daily on the 5th. First, it stated that the United States should immediately stop fueling the Chinese civil war. It not only wantonly vilified the government but also slandered the Allied nation of the United States. Its intentions are unpredictable and have attracted great attention from Chinese and foreign personages. The main points are recorded below: US President Truman's statement on China policy issued on December 15 last year ended the Hurley policy. Therefore, when US Special Envoy General Marshall came to China in December last year, based on the above-mentioned policy, to promote a ceasefire in China and the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, all work was also trusted and enthusiastically cooperated with by the Chinese people. According to the constraints of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Three Powers, the United States should stop and withdraw any assistance to the Kuomintang government's civil war and dictatorial policies, especially military assistance. Only in this way will Marshall's efforts to stop the Chinese civil war not become a futile decoration.

But the facts are completely the opposite. When the Chinese civil war and reign of terror became more serious day by day, the reactionaries in the US government continued to strengthen their assistance to the Kuomintang government supported by the Chinese reactionaries, especially continuing to provide rampant assistance in military transportation and arms supply. Obviously, the civil wars in North China and the Northeast could only have occurred and intensified after the United States transported troops and arms on behalf of the Kuomintang. Without the military transportation of the United States, it would have been fundamentally impossible for the Chinese reactionaries to carry out large-scale civil wars in the Northeast and North China.

Since the Japanese surrender (that is, in a civil war rather than in the War of Resistance) to the present, the American Navy, Army and Air Force have been stationed in various parts of China day and night, repeatedly stating that they will not withdraw, and repeatedly postponing their withdrawal. Now even the families of the US troops have been transported to China, indicating that the US military has regarded China as their base. They not only help the instigators of the civil war transport troops in China, but also help them guard and repair ports, railways, mines, train them to fight, and use American-supplied bombers, warships, tanks, artillery and other various weapons of murder, and even conduct espionage work. After the end of the War of Resistance against Japan and the beginning of the civil war in China, the United States equipped the instigators of the civil war with 40 American-equipped divisions (the US only equipped 20 divisions during the War of Resistance, and most of these 20 divisions were also used in the civil war, and were not used in the War of Resistance), organized the Navy and Air Force, and supplied them with large quantities of aircraft, ships, rocket launchers, artillery, tanks, gasoline, and all other war materials, even the daily necessities of officers and soldiers. Obviously, without the US military aid, the Chinese reactionaries would not be able to carry out large-scale civil wars.

Under the above circumstances, the Chinese people cannot help but suspect the fact today. Is it the Chinese reactionaries' vicious civil war policy that requires the US's rampant military intervention, or the US's rampant military intervention that requires the Chinese reactionaries' vicious civil war policy? The Chinese people cannot but notice that the US's military intervention cannot be without imperialist purposes. Maybe one day the United States will ask China for military bases and political and economic rights, making China virtually reduced to a protectorate and colony of the United States, and the Chinese reactionaries' act of sacrificing the interests of the country, nation, and the people's lives and property in exchange for US military intervention in order to consolidate their dictatorial position is an act of traitors and national thieves. In any case, the military intervention of the reactionaries in the US government is endangering China's national security and is obviously inconsistent with Truman's declaration not to interfere with China's internal disputes by military intervention and Marshall's efforts to stop the Chinese civil war. Therefore, this erroneous policy of the United States has been criticized and blamed in all aspects in the United States and in China.

The Chinese people are still being slaughtered by foreign weapons after the end of the war against Japan. This is the weapon of the United States. The disaster of the Chinese people today is fundamentally bestowed by the policy of the American reactionaries to create and fuel the Chinese civil war. The military intervention of the United States has turned many solemn words in Truman's statement into untrustworthy words and made the United States' mediation status in the Chinese civil war suspicious.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] Nanjing Central Daily published an editorial today entitled "Arrogant Propaganda War," sharply rebutting the Liberation Daily editorial of the 5th. First, it stated: This editorial broke the agreement to publicize the ceasefire and launched a fierce anti-American movement, vehemently attacking our National Government. We only need to quote one or two sentences from it to see Yan'an's view of the United States and our National Government. After slandering the United States for interfering in China's internal affairs, they pointed out that the current situation in China is "the Chinese reactionaries' vicious civil war policy requires the US's rampant military assistance, and the US's rampant military intervention requires the Chinese reactionaries' vicious civil war policy." They pointed out, "Maybe one day the United States will ask China for military bases and political and economic rights, making China virtually reduced to a protectorate and colony of the United States." They pointed out, "The US's military intervention is endangering China's national security, endangering China's peace and democracy, and endangering Sino-US friendship and world peace." As long as it is a Chinese person who loves China, hearing the Communist Party's such arrogant propaganda war rhetoric, they will definitely be able to judge that the Communist Party is about to launch an ominous anti-American movement and acts of resistance against the government, and they will definitely be able to see that we do not have reason to be overly optimistic about the government's fifteen-day ceasefire for troops in the Northeast in order to urge the Communist Party to fulfill the agreements they previously participated in.

Since the Japanese surrender, the Communist Party has repeatedly launched anti-American movements. This editorial by the Liberation Daily is the most intense literary attack in the past reactionary propaganda wars. We must first explore why the Communist Party wants to be so strongly anti-American. We know that the Communist Party's greatest attempt is to destroy China, the force of stability on the Asian continent, while the United States' world policy is to hope and help China build a unified, strong, democratic, and free country to achieve its mission of securing Asia. Conversely, the Communist Party's creed is "chaos is the capital of revolution." What the Communist Party prays for is Chinese chaos and world unrest. For this reason, it does not hesitate to provoke China's internal strife, and for this reason, it does not hesitate to provoke the Third World War. The Communist Party's goal is the opposite of the goal of China's nation-builders, and also the opposite of the purpose of Sino-US cooperation. Therefore, they have repeatedly launched anti-American movements, and in the near future, there will be even more ominous anti-American movements.

The newspaper then stated: Today, General Marshall is making the final, greatest, and most determined efforts for China's peace, security, democracy, and the rule of law, and the Communist Party is actually launching a propaganda war that directly criticizes General Marshall. None of the parts of this propaganda war text concerning General Marshall are true, but one thing we must point out today is that the strengthening of General Marshall's arbitral power is because the National Government, the only legitimate government of China, believes that if the functions of the military conflict mediation and executive department are not strengthened, they will not be sufficient to complete the mediation responsibilities. Therefore, it hopes that General Marshall will use a firm and impartial attitude to make a more powerful arbitration for China's domestic military conflicts. This is by no means the United States interfering in China's internal affairs. General Marshall's mission has absolutely no flaws that can be criticized.

After the Japanese surrender, the American forces continued to operate in China to end the matters that should have ended on the Chinese battlefield. This mission is correct, legitimate, and worthy of praise from every Chinese person, and the American military's assistance in transporting Chinese government troops into the Northeast is to assist China in restoring its territorial sovereignty in the Northeast. The Northeast issue can only be fundamentally resolved under Chinese sovereignty by providing its resources and markets for the prosperity of the world and mankind with international cooperation and an open-door policy. We firmly believe that the National Government has no intention of adopting a blockade policy in the Northeast and spreading seeds that are harmful to peace and security in the Far East and the world. We believe that the first Chinese person should treat the two great friendly nations of the United States and the Soviet Union equally. Therefore, understanding these two points, we see that the Communist Party's anti-American movement is harmful to China's path to nation-building and to the hope of Sino-US-Soviet cooperation to stabilize the Far East and the world. The Liberation Daily's attack on the National Government is a common occurrence, but we are very surprised that they have put forward the term "national security" this time. We want to ask them whether the actions of their "democratic allied forces" in the Northeast are for national security, and which of their actions in the Northeast is nationalistic. I believe that when they put forward the word "nation," they are ashamed and cowardly in their hearts. Finally, we hope that the Communist Party, for the sake of the foundation of China's nation-building, for the sake of striving for and maintaining peace and security in the Far East and the world, will calmly reflect and fervently become aware, and completely change their strategy of creating chaos and destroying peace.

### Northeast Quiet Yesterday; Bode Seeks Residence in Changchun

[Our Beiping Office, 8th Dispatch] Entering the second day of the ceasefire, an official in charge told reporters this morning that the Northeast was quiet yesterday. The only news of conflicts was all those that occurred before June 7. However, the Military Mediation Department has not yet been able to send a large number of personnel to the Northeast. The government side has not yet decided on the personnel to participate in the Changchun Executive Department Forward Command Post. Although the CCP has decided on Rao Shushi, Rao has not yet left Shenyang for Changchun. The CCP claims that it has not yet received instructions from Yan'an to send additional personnel to the Northeast, so there is no way to prepare. The Northeast mediation work will have to wait until Zhou Enlai returns to Nanjing from Yan'an and reaches an agreement with the government before active preparations can be made. Today is Saturday, and the men and women of the KMT, CCP, and the US sides of the Executive Headquarters had already been on the phone this morning inviting friends to spend this weekend, which is more relaxed and full of hope for peace than in the past few months. [Our Changchun Office, 7th Dispatch] Bode was accompanied by Mayor Shangjianshi Chuandao and others this morning to look for a house in the city. He personally inspected even the toilets, seeking a suitable place for office work. Bode said that Zhou Enlai expressed his joy at his trip.

### Legislative Yuan Questions Financial and Economic Measures; Decides to Form a Nine-Member Joint Committee to Provide Draft Proposals for the Executive Yuan to Adopt

[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] The Legislative Yuan held its 301st regular meeting on the morning of the 8th, with over sixty members present. President Sun chaired the meeting. The morning session was dedicated to questioning the Executive Yuan's financial and economic measures. Executive Yuan Vice President Weng Wenhao, Finance Minister Yu Hongjun, Economic Minister Wang Yunwu, Food Minister Lu Kan, and Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Director Jiang Tingfu were specially dispatched to attend and answer questions. Director Jiang began by reporting on the progress of relief and rehabilitation efforts and then departed. Subsequently, legislators Lou Tongsun, Wei Tingsheng, Dai Xiujun, Sun Jiulu, Jian Guansan, Chen Guyuan, Chen Chunfeng, Cheng Yuanzhen, and Liu Guanxun raised numerous questions regarding current financial, economic, monetary, trade, food, and public education personnel salary issues. Ministers Yu, Xu, and Wang responded separately. In his response, Yu revealed that the treasury's income and expenditure gap for the year was quite significant. He stated that the solution depended on domestic stability and increased tax revenue. Yu stated that there were still technical difficulties in implementing a property tax at present, and the issuance of public bonds also depended on currency stability. Furthermore, Minister Yu also revealed that it was not easy to change the foreign exchange rate easily and that tariff rates were being drafted for revision, with the new rates containing protectionist characteristics. In his report, Minister Xu pointed out that the Department had not received a large amount of enemy and puppet storage in warehouses and acknowledged that there was indeed mold in some warehouses. Minister Wang Yunwu still adhered to his "abacus" principle, reporting to the members that, excluding the Northeast and Taiwan, sales of enemy and puppet properties in various regions had reached 108.1 billion yuan to date, and it was possible that another 230.9 billion yuan would be received this year, totaling approximately 665.6 billion yuan, not too far from the 704.7 billion yuan listed in the national budget revenue. Wang continued, stating that the Resources Committee could have a surplus of 5 billion yuan this year, and the China Textile Industries Corporation might have a surplus of 110 billion yuan, which would be a subsidy to the treasury.

In order to contribute to the Executive Yuan, it was decided to form a nine-member joint committee to conduct investigation and research to draft concrete proposals for adoption. At 2:30 PM, the Yuan continued its meeting and passed eleven cases, including the Capital Police Organization Regulations.

### Guangdong Province Second Trial of Japanese War Criminals; Tanaka Claims Ignorance of Atrocities

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th] Guangdong Province held its first public trial of Japanese war criminals on the 7th. The defendant was former commander of the Japanese 23rd Army and Governor-General of Hong Kong, Tanaka Hisaichi (Lieutenant General). The presiding judge was Major General Liu Yannian, President of the Military Tribunal of the Headquarters, and Professor Xue Siguang, a renowned lawyer from the Law Department of Zhongshan University, was appointed as the defendant's defense counsel. Tanaka was escorted from the detention center to the court at 9:10 AM. Prosecutor Cai Lijin first read the indictment, which stated that the Japanese army had wantonly killed civilians, raped, looted, and committed all kinds of atrocities in Guangdong and Guangxi. As the highest military commander in South China, the defendant failed to implement strict controls beforehand and failed to punish afterwards, thereby violating Article 24 of the Regulations on Punishment of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Tanaka refuted the indictment, stating that he had not treated the people harshly since taking office in March of the 32nd year of the Republic, and the indictment lacked concrete evidence. He claimed that he was completely unaware of the atrocities. Tanaka also stated that he was being tried as a prisoner of war and did not wish to shirk responsibility, only seeking a fair trial according to law. Finally, the judge questioned the witnesses. The trial lasted twelve hours. The audience was crowded in front of the court.

### The Netherlands Cannot Evade Responsibility for the Tanjung Priok Massacre of Overseas Chinese; Director He of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Speaks to Reporters; State of Emergency Declared Throughout Java

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] At 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, He Fengshan, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated at a press conference: the Dutch government, as the country involved in the Tanjung Priok incident in the Dutch East Indies where overseas Chinese were killed, cannot evade its responsibility. Among our overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, there are one million people in areas controlled by the Indonesian authorities. The Indonesian authorities should also protect the safety of our overseas Chinese. Now, not only has protection not been provided, but killings have occurred. If this is not strictly stopped, it will not only arouse the resentment of our 450 million people but will also lose the world's sympathy for the Indonesian revolution. He also reported on our side's negotiations regarding the Dutch East Indies' killing of overseas Chinese. It is understood that our Consul General in Batavia, Jiang Jiadong, requested the Allied Headquarters to send a military rescue team immediately after the incident to rescue them and also lodged a strong protest with Indonesian President Shari, hoping that the Allied authorities could at least provide weapons to the overseas Chinese to enable them to defend themselves. However, this suggestion has not been adopted by the Allied Headquarters.

Suzhou: Warehouse Chief Sells Firearms Privately

Gan Hua-pu, the warehouse chief of the 36th Warehouse of the Ministry of Military Administration stationed in Guangfu Town, was recently instigated by Sun Chao, an official of the town office, to privately sell 25 firearms at a price of 120,000 yuan per piece. Sun Chao sold 15 pieces to Dongzhu Town, and the remaining 10 pieces were purchased by Guangfu Town. This matter was discovered by the acceptance committee of the Ministry of Military Administration, who sent a letter to the Suzhou Military Police Corps at the beginning of the month, requesting assistance in the arrest. After receiving the news, the Military Police Corps dispatched a squad in an armored vehicle on the morning of the 4th of this month to make the arrest. Upon arrival, they apprehended Sun Chao, the official, as well as Gan Hua-pu, the warehouse chief, and two other suspected accomplices. All the firearms were confiscated.

Therefore, the firearms had to be left behind. The military police, fearing an unnecessary conflict, recorded all the serial numbers of the firearms and obtained a receipt from the town office. They arrived in Suzhou at 9 PM and reported the incident to the corps.

Recently, all the committee members felt that the evaluation meetings were empty and meaningless. The valuation and sale of each enemy and puppet industry was decided in advance by the branch office and then submitted to the meeting for a formal approval. The task of the evaluation committee members was actually quite futile. On the 4th of this month, Jin Guo and all the other members of the Evaluation Committee jointly submitted their resignations to the branch office.

Jiangyin: Continued Military Grain Levy and a Request to Substitute Wheat

The county government ordered the procurement of 20,000 *shi* of military grain. County Magistrate Fang immediately convened the district and township chiefs to scrape together 10,000 *shi*. For the remaining 10,000 *shi*, representatives were sent to the province by the County Council to request exemption, but the request was denied. With the transition period between harvests, it is difficult to continue collecting 10,000 *shi*. A telegram was sent to the province, requesting permission to follow Wuxi's example and allow 200 *jin* (斤, a unit of weight, about 500 grams) of wheat to be substituted for one *shi* of rice, in order to alleviate the people's hardship.

Editorial

### Only Thirteen Days Left!

— Isn't the Ceasefire Just a Delaying Tactic?

The ceasefire order in Northeast China, which should have taken effect at noon on June 7th, makes these fifteen days a turning point for defusing the dangerous situation in Chinese politics. In an instant, two days have passed, and today we have only thirteen days left! However, the CCP representatives Zhou Enlai and Lu Dingyi have no authority to negotiate. The day before yesterday, they had to fly to Yan'an for instructions, and it is still unknown whether they can return to Beijing today or tomorrow. Before leaving Beijing, Zhou and Lu told reporters: "Negotiations will inevitably involve political issues in the Northeast and even the whole country, which will require more time." This seems to suggest that the task of negotiation may not necessarily be completed within fifteen days, leaving room for a "delaying" policy in advance. Although the CCP representatives have outwardly tried their best to express their desire to "make the temporary ceasefire a long-term ceasefire," based on our painful past experiences, we still dare not feel too much affection or excessive excitement, because if the negotiating parties or any one party does not have the sincerity to transform hostility into detailed harmony, then the so-called "ceasefire" is very likely to turn into a "delaying tactic." We really need to beware of another "disappointment" after hope!

CCP leaders have recently been saying that they are willing to have an "unconditional ceasefire," but in fact, they have raised particularly many conditions; it is not surprising to have many conditions, as long as they are negotiated and counted, it is better than not raising conditions and not opening negotiations. Now that it is possible to have a ceasefire for fifteen days and reopen the door to negotiations, the people are happy, but the New China News Agency and Liberation Daily in Yan'an did not mention this matter at all in their editorials on the 7th, showing extreme indifference. This is strange. The Liberation Daily not only does not mention the "temporary ceasefire" that the CCP representatives claimed was achieved through "subjective efforts," showing disdain for this matter, but also severely criticizes the United States in the editorial for having "imperialist" ambitions of aggression and interference, demanding that the United States immediately withdraw its troops stationed in China, and even falsely accusing that "the civil war in North China and Northeast China was actually caused by the United States transporting National Army and fire." It also insists that "one day, the United States will ask China for military bases, political and economic privileges, making China virtually a protectorate or colony of the United States." The purpose of this groundless malicious propaganda is unknown. In fact, the CCP representatives firmly opposed the arbitration power of Special Envoy Marshall in the peace negotiations, and then, on the day the Northeast ceasefire order was issued and took effect, the Liberation Daily vigorously attacked the United States, which was mediating in the middle. Even if the intention is not spoken through, discerning people should be able to understand it.

The United States was our ally during the war, which is well known to the world. Currently, the Japanese prisoners and residents in China have not been completely evacuated, and the task of China's receiving territory and sovereignty has not been completed. We can say that the US soldiers' combat mission in China has not been completely ended. The United States' assistance in transporting the National Army, reorganizing the National Army, and sending Japanese prisoners and residents back to their country is also an obligation of assistance that allies in the war of resistance should fulfill according to the agreement. The Chinese people cannot but express heartfelt admiration for the efforts of the US authorities and soldiers to safeguard victory and maintain peace, and at the same time, they all want to fulfill more responsibilities themselves, so as not to fail their allies. But the CCP insists on using "anti-American" rhetoric to incite the Chinese people's "anti-American" emotions, as if China is only allowed to be friends with the Soviet Union and is not allowed to have a second ally, which is extremely strange! The Chinese people, who are able to distinguish between good and bad friends, believe that they must have their own opinions. The CCP, on the one hand, relies on military strength to divide and occupy territory, and on the other hand, coerces negotiations. In the process of negotiation, it often hopes that the United States will act as a fair mediator. But if it does not get its way, it immediately refuses to recognize friends, refuses to allow Marshal Marshall to have arbitration power, and even falsely accuses the United States of wanting to make China a protectorate, thinking that by scolding in this way, American friends will definitely avoid suspicion and leave, and no longer come to dissuade our "civil war." The CCP's actions clearly seem to indicate that it does not expect any satisfactory results from the negotiations. We know that the three issues to be discussed during these fifteen days are: (1) detailed measures for a complete ceasefire in Northeast China; (2) detailed measures for complete restoration of transportation; (3) an agreement on obtaining a solid foundation and promptly implementing national military demobilization and reorganization. May I ask, "If the government and the CCP have differences of opinion on a certain issue, if there is no intermediary arbitrator to make the final decision," how can these negotiations have an ending? And how can it be satisfactory? Isn't this leading back to the old path of "one side insists on demanding, the other side refuses to compromise, and the result is only conflict" that the CCP representatives mentioned? If the CCP still adheres to this mentality and uses the method of opposing Marshal Marshall's arbitration power to deal with the negotiations during the ceasefire, then this fifteen-day ceasefire is very likely to become a "delaying tactic." This is the real intention behind the CCP newspapers' efforts to promote "anti-American" and even "hate-America" sentiments at this time. We only need to pay attention to how the rhetoric of the politicians who echo the CCP's self-proclaimed "democracy" is in the next few days, and we can "think more than half"!

But, in any case, we want to remind our compatriots: After China's victory in the War of Resistance, Outer Mongolia became independent, Lushun and Dalian became "shared by China and the Soviet Union," and the China-Changchun Railway also came under "joint management by China and the Soviet Union." The factories and mines in Northeast China have all been emptied by others. These are all iron facts after the signing of the "Sino-Soviet Alliance and Friendship Treaty"! China's sacrifices have nothing to do with the United States! What has the CCP said about these events? Who is the imperialist? We need to recognize this clearly!

### Provincial Government Agencies' Efforts to Reassure Are Ineffective; Zhejiang Civil Servants Take Mass Leave; Hubei Provincial Government Employees Also Request Re-Adjustment of Salaries

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 8th Dispatch] The Zhejiang public education personnel's movement to demand improved salaries was ineffective despite the reassurances of the heads of various provincial agencies on the evening of the 7th. On the 8th, all the staff of other agencies and schools, except for the Provincial Government Secretariat, did not report to work and took mass leave for one day. It was also decided to formally establish the Zhejiang Public Education Personnel Demand for Improved Salaries Movement Committee at 3 PM on the 10th in the Provincial Government Auditorium. Participants include: Cooperative Supply and Marketing Office, Cooperative Business Management Office, Wuzhan Telegraph General Office, Provincial Transportation Management Office, Department of Construction, Zhejiang University, Department of Health, Provincial Anti-Japanese League, Jianguo Middle School, Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, Provincial Social Affairs Office, Provincial Land Administration Bureau, Department of Civil Affairs, Secretariat, Department of Education, Department of Finance, Zhejiang Branch of the Kuomintang Youth League, and the Municipal Bureau of Education. If the demands cannot be met, it is rumored that they will continue to take mass leave.

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 8th Dispatch] Zhejiang Province spent the whole day yesterday being busy with the issue of adjusting the salaries of Zhejiang provincial civil servants. Lei Fazhang, the Secretary-General of Zhejiang Province, specially summoned the staff of the Secretariat on the 8th for earnest instruction, saying that the central government would definitely have appropriate measures, and analyzed the domestic and international situation for more than two hours. The listeners were very moved. The civil servants here are now waiting for Chairman Shen's reply telegram. The central agencies in Hangzhou City held a meeting yesterday to discuss the adjustment of salaries and resolved: "The urban area of this city is different from the provincial area of Zhejiang, and should be distinguished. Based on Hangzhou's price comparison and cost-of-living index, it should be reported to the central government that Hangzhou should be listed in the same first class as Beijing and Shanghai." All the central agencies in Hangzhou City have jointly requested the Central Executive Yuan.

[Our Newspaper Hankou 8th Dispatch] After the promulgation of the method for adjusting the salaries of civil servants, all the employees of the Hubei Provincial Government felt that the salary grade standard for civil servants here was placed in the fifth grade, with only tens of thousands of yuan to more than ten thousand yuan added per month, which was tantamount to not receiving any actual benefits. They jointly telegraphed President Song and Chairman Wan, who was attending the financial and food meeting in Beijing, stating the cost-of-living index and the actual suffering, and appealed to re-adjust according to the Beijing and Shanghai standards. Miao Peicheng, the Inspector of Hunan and Hubei, also telegraphed the Control Yuan to forward the application to the National Defense Committee, the general idea being the same as above.

### Wuxian Teachers Take Mass Leave

[Our Newspaper Suzhou 8th Dispatch] Currently, the salaries of more than 500 teachers in more than 40 county-level primary and secondary schools in this county consist of a living allowance of 24,000 yuan and a base salary increased by 140 times, and the difference is very large. The county-level teachers believe that although there are differences in name, the hard work is the same, so they sent representatives to the County Education Bureau to request leave on the 7th. Three requests were made: (1) maintain a balance with provincial-level salaries, (2) provide one *shi* of white rice without compensation, and (3) pre-loan two months' salary. As a result, the results were unsatisfactory, so they expressed their intention to take mass leave on the 8th, and the formal documents will be submitted to the Education Bureau on the 10th, and classes will be suspended immediately. The total number of primary and secondary school students in Suzhou is about 16,000. If the situation escalates, the future is deeply worrying and will spread to rural areas.

### Unprecedented Spectacle: London Holds Victory Celebration Yesterday; Grand Parade of Allied Forces from Seventeen Nations; Throngs of People Cheering Wildly

[Our Dispatch] London, 8th - A broadcast from London reports: Twelve million people from all over the British Empire crowded into London to watch today's victory celebration. The grand parade of Allied forces from seventeen nations stretched for miles, filled with high spirits. The audience was wildly cheering, and the enthusiastic atmosphere was unseen since the coronation of the British monarch. The only disappointing thing was that the Soviet Union, Poland, and Yugoslavia did not send troops to participate.

[Reuters, London, 7th] The wounds of postwar London were covered today by bright red and golden flags. The flags were hung after careful arrangement, and the White House, where the government is located, looked like a small mountain made of flower baskets. On the day of the victory in Europe, London buildings were covered with Soviet flags, but today they are gone because the Soviet Union has refused to participate in this grand ceremony. The streets are crowded with people. The railway authorities opened 75 "victory special trains" to transport tourists from all over the country.

Military Parade

A total of 21,000 soldiers, 408 vehicles of various types, and 310 aircraft participated in the parade. The contingent of seventeen Allied countries was led by four American officers and seventy navy, army, and marine corps personnel. Twenty-four American airmen also flew in aircraft to join the Royal Air Force's soaring performance. British non-military personnel, even housewives, also sent representatives to participate in the parade. Fourteen Royal Navy warships also sailed into the Thames, which will be open for several days for people to visit. The King, Queen, and Princess will arrive at the reviewing stand on Mall Street in a royal four-wheeled carriage before 11:30 a.m. to review the victorious troops from various countries. Military and political leaders of the British Commonwealth will arrive in two batches, led by Attlee and Churchill in the same royal carriage. The parade is expected to last until 1 p.m.

Moving Night Scene

Most of the afternoon will be filled with dance parties and concerts. The most moving scene will be the lighting and searchlight performances in the evening. At the same time, firecrackers and fireworks will be set off in front of the Houses of Parliament. There will also be 800 fountains spraying water into the air in the Thames. The Royal Air Force will also ascend into the air under the illumination of 80 searchlights. The celebration ceremony will officially end at midnight.

Sleeping on the Streets

Tonight, people have already gathered near St. James's Park. Most of the spectators, wanting to secure a spot in the front row, have camped out on the streets overnight, bringing record players, radios, and playing cards to pass the long night. The government began preparing for this grand ceremony in January of this year, spending as much as £100,000 on decorations.

### Freedom of the Press

International News Agencies of Various Countries Should Not Be Controlled by the Government

[Central News Agency, London, 7th] Attlee's communications advisor, Williams, gave a speech this morning to the Imperial Press Conference on the issue of freedom of the press, stating: He believes that member states of the United Nations should demand a guarantee of freedom of the press across national borders. Major international news agencies should bear a major responsibility for promoting the free flow of news internationally. Most importantly, these international news agencies should be operated by the most intelligent people with lofty status, and should not be controlled by any government. Former Minister of Information Bracken took the floor and replied: Foreign journalists in Britain enjoy full freedom in their work. He advocated that these journalists' home countries should grant British journalists the same rights and freedoms.

[United Press, Moscow, 7th] Soviet scientist Baklovsky published an article here today stating: Atomic bombs cannot yet be used to deal with large armies or dispersed industrial targets.

### Franco Did Not Send Troops; The Axis Powers Were Greatly Fooled; Records from German Diplomatic Archives

[United Press, Nuremberg, 7th] According to German diplomatic files seized by the United Nations, Hitler and Mussolini, having suffered the pain of defeat in Stalingrad and Tripoli, unanimously believed in 1943 that Franco's failure to keep his promise to attack Gibraltar had caused a serious blow to the Axis powers. To make up for Franco's breach of faith, Hitler attempted to urge him to guarantee that he would resist the landing of Anglo-American forces on the Iberian Peninsula and invade Portugal. Franco's collusion with the Axis Powers during the war is seen in the four-hour meeting between Mussolini and Ribbentrop held at the Venice Palace in Rome on February 25, 1943. After the failure of the 1943 plan to invade Gibraltar, Ribbentrop declared: "Franco, who was deeply trusted by the German and Italian leaders, abandoned Germany and Italy in times of crisis." Mussolini replied: "Franco's policy is nothing more than duplicity." The official German Foreign Ministry memorandum recorded the conversation between the two as follows: "The German Foreign Ministry informed Mussolini of the recently concluded secret treaty. Spain hopes to obtain military supplies from Germany. The German leader, in view of Franco's attitude, only agreed that Spain would prepare to defend with all its strength when the British and Americans landed on the Iberian Peninsula and on the islands of Spain in the Mediterranean or the Atlantic. If the British landed in Portugal, Franco should immediately invade Portugal. The German Foreign Minister asked the Italian Prime Minister to keep this news strictly confidential, so as not to make Franco unhappy after it was made public. In addition, there is another secret treaty with Spain regarding participation in the 'Steel Pact,' which is also kept secret. In general, if the British army lands in Portugal, it will be beneficial to the Axis powers, and Franco will join the Axis side to fight at that time, and the Axis side will be able to obtain a large number of reinforcements. And German divisions will also enter Spain to help defend against the British and American landings. The Italian Prime Minister pointed to Franco's previous attitude, saying that he missed the great opportunity to attack Gibraltar, which caused the failure of the German plan. The German Foreign Minister mentioned that if this incident (Franco's breach of faith) had not occurred, the British and Americans would not have landed in North Africa."

Mussolini, troubled by the failure in Tripolitania and fearing an Allied invasion of the Italian mainland, told Ribbentrop that Spain's participation in the war "should be realized in a favorable period, otherwise Spain's participation in the war would only increase the burden. Ribbentrop told the Italian Prime Minister that Franco would not completely abandon the Axis powers and attack the German army with German weapons in the future, and that this would be tantamount to suicide. The Italian Prime Minister also believed that "the enemy's victory is equal to Franco's doomsday."

There is no reason why Chinese seafarers should not receive the same wages and treatment as seafarers from other countries. I hope the conference will support the demands of the Chinese representatives. The minimum wage for seafarers is the most contentious issue on the conference agenda.

### Stolen Treasures Recovered from German Ancient Palace; US Colonel and Wife Detained

[United Press, Washington, 7th] Regarding the case of the stolen treasures worth US$1.5 million from the Kronberg Palace near Frankfurt, Germany, the Department of the Army announced today that it has placed an army women's auxiliary corps captain and her husband, a colonel, under supervision. This jewelry was hidden in the basement of the ancient palace several years ago. The palace was taken over by the US military authorities and used as a US Army officers' club. About seven months ago, someone dug through the paved concrete and took out the boxes containing the jewelry. The owner of the ancient palace is Countess Hudson of Hesse, granddaughter of Queen Victoria of England, and is 74 years old. According to her report, the Hess family was assured by the US military last year that the jewelry was safe in the hands of the US military. Later, after inquiries from the Hess family, the US military confirmed that the jewelry had been handed over to the military authorities in Frankfurt for safekeeping. When the Duchess of Sophie requested its return two months ago, it was no longer available. It is reported that the stolen jewelry and other treasures, such as ancient Bibles, have been recovered. In addition to those currently detained, there are two others involved in the case, one a serving major and the other a retired sergeant. Miller detailed the course of this mysterious case as follows: In 1944, Germany suffered intense air raids. The Hess royal family was convinced that it was safer to take these family heirlooms out of the bank and hide them in the ancient palace. In October of that year, the Hess family held a meeting, inventoried all the treasures, compiled a catalog, and then packed them, took a general worker, and went to the basement of the palace together. They chose a remote place, first put the treasures in a lead box, added a sturdy wooden box on the outside, and buried it in the cellar. Later, the worker put the key in place, re-paved the ground, and at the same time hid 1,600 bottles of aged wine in the cellar.

The preamble states: This temporary agreement should be signed within a short period of time, and at the same time describes the reasons for the establishment of this agreement, that is, the hostile actions of both sides have long ceased.

Article 4 stipulates that the new agreement does not affect the administrative system of Italian colonies and dependencies in any way.

### Guilt and Merit Cannot Offset Each Other; All Property Confiscated; Li Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment; Defendant Lowered His Head and Said "Good!" Upon Hearing the Verdict! Sun Yunzhang and Lao Yinyu Sentenced to Ten Years and Seven Years Respectively

[Our Newspaper's Report] The sensational Li Ze case in Shanghai was pronounced yesterday afternoon. The audience seats in the First Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court in Tilanqiao were completely filled. By 2:30 PM, the courtroom was packed. At 2:45 PM, Judge Liu, along with Judge Qiu Cao and Prosecutor Dai, took their seats. First, Sun Yunzhang and Lao Yinyu were called to be sentenced. The two traitors colluded with an enemy country and plotted to resist our nation. The former was sentenced to ten years imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for ten years, while the latter was sentenced to seven years imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for seven years. All their property, except for a reasonable amount reserved for the necessary living expenses of their families, was confiscated. Next, Li Ze was brought in, escorted by bailiffs through the crowd into the courtroom. He was wearing a lotus-colored Indian silk long gown and yellow leather shoes. Judge Liu stood up and read out the main text of the judgment: "Li Ze, colluding with an enemy country and plotting to resist our nation, is sentenced to three years imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for three years, and all his property, except for a reasonable amount reserved for his family's living expenses, is confiscated." Everyone held their breath to listen to the verdict. Some had satisfied smiles on their faces, some seemed a little sad, and some had stern faces, expressing disagreement. However, Li Ze's attitude was very calm. He only nodded slightly and softly said one word: "Good!" Then he was escorted back to prison by the bailiffs. The severity of this sentence has been met with varying criticisms from all walks of life. The accusers felt it was too lenient, while some thought it was too harsh. But some also said: "This case was judged very appropriately." The reasoning section of the full text of the judgment is recorded below. (See lower left corner)

### Wang Jingwei's Nephew, Chen Chunpu, Shamelessly Boasted of His Merits and Was Rebuked in Court

[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Chunpu, who followed Wang Jingwei in engaging in "peaceful national salvation," was tried yesterday by the High Court, presided over by the court president. Chen, a native of Xinhui, Guangdong, is 47 years old and a relative of Wang Jingwei. He once held important positions in party and government organs. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Wang Jingwei betrayed the country. Chen, at his instigation, first left Chongqing to organize a puppet government, serving as Wang Jingwei's personal secretary, and successively held positions such as Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan of the puppet government, Deputy Secretary-General of the Political Committee, Minister of Organization of the Central Party Headquarters, Governor of Guangdong Province, concurrently Director of Pacification of the province, Commander of the Security Forces, and member of the National Government of the puppet regime. He willingly allowed himself to be used by the enemy in the hope of achieving his goal of betraying the country for personal glory. The High Prosecutor's Office considered Chen to be Wang Jingwei's confidant, colluding with each other, colluding with the enemy country, plotting to resist our country, and his treacherous acts were extremely obvious. Therefore, he was prosecuted in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. During the interrogation yesterday afternoon, Chen wore a blue silk gown and black cloth shoes. He was thin and tall with slightly white hair, but his spirit was still good. He claimed to have graduated from Sun Yat-sen University in 1927 and was a nephew of "Mrs. Wang." From 1934 onwards, he had been following Wang Jingwei. His departure from Chongqing was because he wanted to send Wang's children to Hong Kong for schooling, and the "Yan telegram" appeared in the newspapers without his prior knowledge. The puppet positions he held were either nominal or for doing practical work. He did not participate in any diplomatic activities, so he could not be held responsible for the "Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty." Then he shamelessly boasted of his merits, saying that during his tenure as the puppet Governor of Guangdong Province, he eradicated opium seedlings, strictly prohibited opium, and also organized charitable activities, which were beneficial to the people. Judge Xiao immediately rebuked him, saying, "How can these petty merits cover up your great faults?" He then adjourned the hearing for another day.

The Shen Guanquan Case Was Also Tried Yesterday

In addition, Judge Yang Ding and Clerk Li Jinzhang interrogated Shen Guanquan (a native of Shanghai, 42 years old), the acting warden of the puppet Shanghai Prison, yesterday afternoon. He had colluded with the "Assistant Warden" Iimura Akira and Miura Masuo, appointed by the enemy's military police, to send more than 1,200 prisoners to the Zhoushan Islands and Sijiao Mountain area to do military engineering work for the enemy, resulting in the deaths of more than eighty people. He also colluded with Xu Quanyuan, the head of the prison's work section, Shen Guanrong (his younger brother), the deputy head, and Zhang Xumei, etc., to sell 44 bundles of gray felt and white paper and other goods for their own personal gain. Shen sophistically defended himself in court, pushing all responsibility onto the Japanese. As for the private sale of materials, he claimed it was for office expenses. In addition, the cases of the Russian Valimaski, and Wen Shisong, Zhao Xilin, Zhu Chizi, etc., were interrogated yesterday and all were adjourned for another day.

Wang Yongkang and Others Scheduled for Sentencing

[Another Report] The case of "gambling den boss" Wang Yongkang and Yuan Jufan, Zhu Duanlin, the puppet Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Chief, was concluded yesterday afternoon, and the sentencing is scheduled for 2 PM on the 15th of this month. The case of Zhang Qipin, suspected of being a traitor, will be sentenced at 9:30 AM on the 14th.

### Principles Decided for the Repatriation of German Nationals

The issue of repatriating German nationals has been brewing for some time without a clear resolution. The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously sent a special commissioner to Beijing for instructions, who returned to Shanghai the night before last to report. It is understood that there are three principles: (1) The list of repatriated persons previously determined by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seems to need to be reconsidered. (2) The date for the repatriation of German nationals, originally scheduled for the 15th of this month, has now been ordered to be extended to the end of June, giving German nationals more opportunity to decide whether to stay or leave. (3) In the future, for those designated German nationals who are to be repatriated, if their parents (who are not on the repatriation list) wish to return to their home country with their children at the same time because they are old and have no one to care for them, they can apply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the relevant authorities will consider it to find a perfect solution. Regarding the repatriation of German nationals, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not want to express more opinions, while most German nationals hope to stay in China.

Another Report: The first batch of more than 900 German nationals will be repatriated soon. Each person can take 250 pounds of luggage, 32 pounds of carry-on items, and 1,000 marks, equivalent to 100 US dollars. In addition, 50 US dollars will be used as expenses on the ship.

### A Multitude of Vehicles Outside Song Park to Reverently Worship the Martyrs at the Tomb of Song Jiaoren; Presidents Yu and Tan of the Two Academies Recalled Past Events Vividly; He Was the First Person to Shed Blood for the Constitution

(Our Newspaper's Report) Song Park in Zhabei, which has been desolate for nine years, suddenly saw a multitude of vehicles yesterday morning. At 9:00 AM sharp, President Yu of the Control Yuan and Vice President Tan of the Legislative Yuan, along with Mr. Shen Gongzhan, Feng Youzhen, Cheng Cangbo from the city's press, Director Gan Zukang of the Municipal Works Bureau, Supervisor Yan Zhuang and more than 30 others, reverently worshiped the revolutionary martyrs. The press elders were responsible for the management of the ceremony, which ended around noon.

Weeds and Desolation

Yesterday morning, after the participants arrived, they first inspected the park. Weeds were everywhere and it was extremely desolate. Only the statue of Martyr Song was still intact. The inscription on the stele in front of the statue was written in cursive script by Zhang Taiyan: "Fisherman." "Fisherman" was Martyr Song's courtesy name. The inscription on the back of the stele was written by Yu Youren and calligraphed by Kang Baozhong. The text read: "The world mourns Mr.'s death, the world knows Mr.'s deeds, so why should I record them? To write the truth? The truth slays people! To write falsehoods? Falsehoods are condemned by heaven! Alas, the tears of the nine springs, the blood of the world, the pen of an old friend, the iron of the traitors. Engrave it on the empty mountains, entrust it to honest historians, inscribe it on our hearts, and attest it to heaven and earth!" Song's spirit can be passed down, and President Yu's grief and indignation on that day can be imagined.

Recalling Past Events

Then they went to the front of Song's tomb, where Presidents Yu and Tan and the Journalists Association presented wreaths, performed the most respectful salute, and stood silently for a long time, before moving to pay respects at the tomb of Song's wife, Madame Fang. After the ceremony, Presidents Yu and Tan took a short rest on the walkway in front of the tomb, and the scorching sun made them sweat profusely. President Yu then recounted Song's past deeds, taking short breaks from time to time due to a slight asthma. Mr. Tan said: During the Nanjing government in the first year of the Republic, the people of the country wanted peace and unity after the overthrow of the Manchus. So, they improvised and gave the presidency to Xiangcheng (Yuan Shikai). For the sake of solidifying the foundation of the Republic, Song formulated a constitution, wanting to use the constitution as a guarantee for the Republic. At that time, our party recognized democratic politics as the foundation of governing the country, without any doubt. Unexpectedly, today some people are still demanding democracy, which shows that they do not understand the spirit of our party and can be considered an insult to our party. If Song Yu Fu (Song Jiaoren) were alive today, he would have been able to lay the foundation for the country, such as education and transportation, within the first three years of the Republic. Unexpectedly, he was resented by Yuan Shikai, who assassinated him by despicable means, and he died with unfulfilled ambitions, which caused grief to the entire country. Song was the first person to shed blood for the constitution. Therefore, Premier Sun Yat-sen's eulogy said: "Who is not an old survivor in protecting civil rights?" "He was the first person to shed blood for the constitution!" During the constitutional protection movement in the seventh year of the Republic, Yu Yuan's uprising in Sanyuan was also based on "law" as the foundation of the Republic.

Seeking Benevolence and Obtaining Benevolence

President Yu Gang stood up and said: On the day of Song's assassination, Chen Qimei, Huang Xing, and Yu Min himself were all present. When the gunshot rang, they thought Mr. Chen Qimei had been sniped, but later they saw it was Mr. Song, and they helped him into the railway hospital. But it was too late, there was no one in the hospital, and soon it was dawn. So they helped Martyr Song up to the third floor, but the blood flow was too great and his condition worsened, and he eventually died. At that time, the murderer, Wu Shiying, Ying Guixin, Zhao Bingjun, and Hong Shuzu had all passed away. But Hong actually escaped after the incident, and was later sued in Qingdao by a German, which was obtained by Mr. Song Jiaoren's son Zhenlv (who is now also deceased), and was eventually escorted to Beijing and executed by hanging. Song's descendants now only have Zhenlv's daughter.

### Huge Embezzlement Case at the Bank of China; Principal Culprit Not Yet Captured; Ministry of Finance Thoroughly Investigates Chongqing Bank

[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Yuancheng, the main culprit in the huge embezzlement case at the Central Bank, was previously reported to have been arrested in Ningbo. According to a second telegram received last night by the Huangpu Branch Bureau, which is handling the case, from the Sixth District Commissioner's Office in Zhenhai, the person captured earlier was actually Chen Yuancheng's brother, Chen Yuanjun, not Chen Yuancheng himself. Therefore, the main culprit in this huge embezzlement case is still at large. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to the case involving the Chongqing Bank's gold bullion mortgage and has formally ordered a thorough investigation.

### On the Eve of the Production Conference; Industrial Circles Exchange Views; Hoping to Obtain a Plan to Find Solutions

### Four Junior Staff Members of the China Trade Bank; Illegally Established a Company and Failed in Speculation; Lost 500 Million Yuan; Poor Turnover, Indiscriminate Issuance of Bad Checks; Friend Ning Exposed the Failure, Three Arrested

[Our Newspaper's Report] Four staff members of the China Trade Bank at No. 93 Guangdong Road, Sichuan Road, Qiu Xinran, Yu Zhengping, Zhang Mengjun, and Hu Muqing, took advantage of the location and telephone number of the China Trade Bank to illegally establish Jian Yuan Company two months ago, specializing in various speculative businesses, deceiving general customers. They ultimately failed in speculation, losing up to 500 million yuan in one month. Many outsiders were unaware and were foolishly deceived. It was not until the day before yesterday that Wei Junxian, manager of You Ning Company, first exposed the crime. Wei received a check for 20 million yuan from Jian Yuan Company, and the check was returned. The drawers all avoided and refused to be seen. Therefore, he reported the crime of issuing bad checks to the Huangpu Police Bureau, and the whole case was exposed. After receiving the report, the bureau immediately dispatched Criminal Division Chief Zhou Guanghui, Inspector Yao Hongzhang, police officers Han Zhichen, and Zhao Jiake to investigate separately. They first arrested Qiu Xinran at No. 12, Lane 77, Guizhou Road, and then arrested the two criminals Yu Zhengping and Hu Muqing at the Dadong Hotel No. 502 and the Garden Hotel No. 349. Only Zhang Mengjun was at large. They confessed to illegally establishing a company, failing in speculation, losing 500 million yuan, and issuing bad checks due to poor turnover. It was confirmed that Qiu Xinran's father is currently employed at the Bank of China, and his grandfather was the director of the cashier department. His uncle, Shao Jiamei, is the director of the cashier department of the China Trade Bank. Police officers confiscated a diamond ring, three watches, and 3,500 shares of May Asia stocks, with a total value of 30 million yuan, from Shao Jiamei's residence. This large-scale fraud case of illegally establishing a company and defrauding 500 million yuan was solved in just 30 hours thanks to the efforts of the police officers. However, the number of people scammed is definitely not just Wei Junxian alone, so the bureau is still investigating and summoning other victims to the case for joint handling.

### Assassination: Young Woman Living Alone Found Dead in Her Room

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Huang, a young woman from Guangdong, aged 27, lived alone in a garret room on the third floor of No. 10 Pu Bai Fang, Chong Qing Nan Lu. Her husband, Chen Zhenyuan, was a silversmith. They had a son, just one year old. Chen left Shanghai for Guangdong about twenty days ago, leaving only the mother and son in Shanghai. Around 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, Chen was found stabbed to death in her room, her body lying across the floor. The knife wound in her throat was very deep, and there were also wounds on both temples. The discovery was made by the second landlord, who reported it to the Lujiawan Police Substation. After police investigation, two suicide notes were found on the table, generally stating that she was forced to take this drastic measure due to economic hardship. The body was then transported to Tongren Fuyuantang. During the coroner's examination, her cousin, Huang Bingzhong (who works at the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company), arrived and stated that although his cousin was not wealthy, she was reasonably well-off and would never commit suicide due to financial problems. He suspected there might be hidden circumstances and that she was assassinated. Subsequent forensic evidence confirmed that the woman's throat had been stabbed, followed by knife wounds to both temples. A rigorous search is now underway to apprehend the culprit and bring them to justice.

### Jiang He Ship Runs Aground and Sinks: Passengers and Crew Are All Safe

The accident occurred in the Laoshu Tu river section, 48 li from Yichang. The bottom of the ship was punctured, and it immediately began to sink.

### Future Transportation: Increased Motor Vehicles Will Overwhelm Rickshaws

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to a responsible person from the Municipal Government's Public Utilities Bureau, the current traffic chaos is due to narrow roads and the fact that there are more rickshaws than motor vehicles. Regarding ways to improve the situation, it is not intended to impose passive restrictions on rickshaws, but to focus on active remedies. It is reported that someone has applied to the Municipal Government to manufacture special motorized tricycles, but this will require expert evaluation before a decision is made. Furthermore, Xiang Sheng Motor Company is currently applying to the Municipal Government to use "Cheng Che" (i.e., small, automatically timed taxis that can be hailed anywhere along the route). If such vehicles can be supplied in large quantities, rickshaws will naturally be eliminated.

### Radio Station: "The Setting Sun Is Infinitely Beautiful, Only It's Near Dusk"

[Report from Our Newspaper] Rumors are circulating that the first batch of over thirty radio stations in this city will be ordered to cease operations. When a reporter inquired about this matter with Mr. Zhang Chengxu, an engineer at the Telecommunications Bureau, he said that he had not yet received any instructions from the Ministry of Communications regarding this matter, so he could not confirm the rumors. He stated that according to the Ministry of Communications' regulations on the management of radio stations, only ten broadcast stations should be established in this city. Therefore, the current number of stations far exceeds the regulations, and a reduction is inevitable. However, the exact number of stations to be reduced will be determined by the Ministry of Communications.

### Grounds for Judgment in the Li Ze Case

(Grounds) The defendant Li Ze, in the pseudo-Nanjing government's pseudo-National Commercial Control General Association, initially served as a preparatory committee member, and later as a director. He not only repeatedly confessed to this without denial, but there are also records in the submitted "New China Handbook" and "Continental Yearbook" that can be verified. During his term in the pseudo-position, he attended several joint meetings of pseudo-directors and supervisors. In addition to discussing association affairs, he also discussed and resolved plans for controlling materials, which were issued to various subordinate control committees for execution. This has also not been denied by him. Furthermore, the retrieval of Tang Shoumin's traitor case files and the minutes of the pseudo-National Commercial Control General Association's joint meetings of directors and supervisors can be used as evidence, making the facts extremely clear. The defendant's defenses were nothing more than: (1) Crime is judged by action, and title is not action. The defendant only held the title of an ordinary director of the pseudo-National Commercial Control General Association, but had no act of conspiring with the enemy or resisting this country. According to Interpretation No. 3101 of the Judicial Yuan, a mere title is not sufficient to convict a person. (2) The pseudo-Commercial Control Association adopted a system of centralized power in the chairman, and the control work of each department was borne by the respective control committees. The defendant was neither the chairman nor a managing director, nor a member of any control committee, but only one of the ordinary directors. All matters discussed by the board of directors were only minor personnel issues, not involving the actual control of materials. (3) The defendant's appointment as a director of the pseudo-Commercial Control Association was at the instigation of the pseudo-regime. Prior consent was not required, and subsequent refusal was impossible. If he were to leave his post, the company would inevitably be destroyed and the personnel would be killed. Therefore, he silently endured the disgrace in order to preserve the life and property of the company. The pseudo-Commercial Control Association was not created by the defendant alone, and the directorship was not monopolized by him. If the defendant were to be prosecuted because of denunciation, while other directors were spared because no one questioned them, the injustice of the world would surely exceed this.

Regarding the first point of defense above:

It is found that the wartime economic policy outline promulgated by the pseudo-Nanjing government first revealed that the National Government (referring to the pseudo-regime) formulated the wartime economic policy outline in order to ensure the needs of the front during the war (excerpt omitted). Section A, Item 5, states that all existing economic institutions that are not suitable for the wartime economic system should be adjusted. Also, the provisional regulations of the pseudo-National Commercial Control General Association state that the purpose of the National Commercial Control General Association is to assist the government (referring to the pseudo-government) in implementing national policies and to handle the procurement of controlled materials and military supplies under the order of the Ministry of Industry and other competent departments. Furthermore, the "Joint Declaration Between China and Japan" signed by the enemy and the pseudo-regime states that the two countries will fully cooperate in military, political, and economic affairs with unwavering determination and conviction. Therefore, the establishment of the pseudo-National Commercial Control General Association was mainly aimed at supplying the enemy's military needs, making it a clear economic organization that conspired with the enemy. The defendant's participation in this enemy-conspiring organization clearly showed a connection in intent. The resolutions of the joint meetings of the association's directors and supervisors were the expression of the general intention of all directors and supervisors. Upon examining their content, they were all beneficial to the enemy and the pseudo-regime and detrimental to this country. Since the defendant repeatedly attended and participated in the voting on the proposals, he was naturally acting against this country. This is in line with the condition of having criminal acts, as stated in Interpretation No. 3101 of the Judicial Yuan. How can he use this to evade responsibility for his crimes?

Regarding the defendant's second point of defense:

This court has reviewed the minutes of the joint meetings of directors and supervisors of the pseudo-National Commercial Control General Association. The resolutions of each meeting contain detailed records of the selection of personnel, plans, evaluation, procurement, and movement of controlled materials ("as seen in the meeting minutes of March 16, April 16, May 19, June 16, and October 20, in the resolutions column"). They were not merely minor personnel matters. Although the defendant was not the chairman or managing director of the pseudo-association, he participated in the resolutions in his capacity as a director and was therefore responsible for a portion of the criminal work and should bear corresponding responsibility. Whether the position he held was of a major importance is a matter of sentencing, not related to the establishment of the crime.

Regarding the defendant's third point of defense:

It is found that the defendant's appointment as a director of the pseudo-Commercial Control Association was by designation, without coercion or violence. The defendant had the freedom to choose whether to accept or decline. It is unreasonable to say that the integrity of one manager could endanger the lives of the company's employees. As for the claim that he submitted to the pseudo-regime to protect the company's assets, the protection of assets is not a sufficient reason to be exempt from the crime of submission to the pseudo-regime. Moreover, at that time in Shanghai, there were many large stores that continued to operate without collaborating with the enemy. The claim that he submitted to the pseudo-regime in order to protect assets is clearly a pretext. Even if the defendant's initial submission to the pseudo-regime was due to coercion, he continued to hold the pseudo-position for two years. There were opportunities to hide in the interim. Why did he not leave at all? The so-called impossibility of refusal is nothing more than sophistry.

Regarding the defendant's fourth point of defense:

Those who commit a crime together each bear their own criminal responsibility and cannot seek exemption from prosecution on the grounds that other accomplices have not yet been denounced. Moreover, there are already many cases in which accomplices have been successively denounced and tried, so this cannot be used as an excuse to evade guilt. In summary, the defendant served as a director of the pseudo-National Commercial Control General Association and participated in the voting on proposals for the control of materials. These proposals were then transferred to various pseudo-control committees for separate implementation. This constituted an act that was beneficial to the enemy and detrimental to this country, constituting the crime of conspiring with the enemy to plot resistance against this country. However, it is found that his appointment as a director of the pseudo-Commercial Control Association was due to his existing commercial status, which is different from those who voluntarily submitted to the pseudo-regime. He also responded to the instigation of the central government's personnel and donated a large sum of money (to prepare for the Allied forces' landing) and raised funds to support the loyal and patriotic army in the Pudong district, as evidenced by a letter from the Shanghai office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Commission. It is understandable that his heart was not entirely malicious. Also, the pseudo-position he held was not a principal position.

Therefore, he is sentenced according to the scope of the statutory penalty in Article 2, Paragraph 6 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, after considering the circumstances. All of his property will be confiscated, except for a reasonable amount to cover the necessary living expenses of his family. As for the allegation in the indictment that the defendant delivered Stinton iron pipes from the New New Company to the enemy army, which were transported away by military trucks, according to his defense, the sale of these pipes was arranged by Jin Zongcheng, the chairman of the company. He introduced Chuan Jihe, the factory manager of the Senda Iron Factory on Yongnian Street in this city, who contacted the defendant and agreed to purchase them. From September 18 to 20, 1944, Senda Iron Factory borrowed a charcoal truck from Rongfeng Yarn Factory, driven by driver Chen Hongen, to transport the pipes from New New Company. Huang Zhenguang, the company's general affairs director, was present at the scene, and He Jialiang, the head of the inventory department, weighed the pipes. Fei Wanzhi, an employee of Senda Iron Factory, supervised the weighing. The total weight was 369 zu 70 and a half jin, and the price was 2,070,348 pseudo-currency, which was paid in three installments. Two of the installments were immediate allocation slips issued by the Shanghai Industrial Bank of the pseudo-Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve, each with a face value of 250,000 pseudo-currency. Another installment was a similar allocation slip issued by the same bank, with a face value of 625,000 pseudo-currency. The last installment was an immediate promissory note issued by the Anfu Exchange Office, with a face value of 100 pseudo-currency. All of these were deposited into the New Da Bank account of New New Company. Because the payment exceeded the price of the goods by 54,652 pseudo-currency, New New Company issued a check for this amount on New Da Bank and returned it to Senda Iron Factory, which deposited it into Shanghai Enterprise Bank. The check was then endorsed by this bank and collected from New Da Bank through the pseudo-bank clearing house, and the payment was still made by this bank from the New New Company's account.

The defendant's claims are not without basis.

Furthermore, regarding the indictment's claim that there was a restriction on the movement of metals at that time, the defendant presented counter-evidence: (1) advertisements published in newspapers at that time openly soliciting the sale of ironware, (2) account books and receipts from Senda Iron Factory simultaneously purchasing pig iron from other businesses, (3) a letter from the pseudo-Commercial Control Association to the pseudo-Shanghai court, to prove that ironware was still movable within the city at that time. As for the accusers Han Wucheng, Shu Yueqiao, Ye Qiubin, and Yao Zhuoba, although they all claimed to have witnessed the pipes being transported away by enemy troops in trucks, these were all empty attacks and they did not provide any factual evidence sufficient to overturn the various counter-evidences presented by the defendant. Therefore, it is not appropriate to hastily punish him for the crime of supplying military raw materials and should be dismissed from consideration. Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Procedure Regulations, the preceding paragraph of Article 291 and Article 292 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1, Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, Paragraph 2 of the same article, Article 3, Article 8, Paragraph 1, Article 9, Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases, the preceding paragraph of Article 3, Paragraph 1 and Article 66 of the Criminal Law, the preceding paragraph of Article 37, Paragraph 2, judgment is hereby rendered as in the main text. This case was executed by Prosecutor Dai Rongduo in court on June 8, 1946, the Criminal Court of the Shanghai High Court, Presiding Judge Liu Yugui, Judges Cao Jun, Qiu Huanying.

### Jiangsu Educational Alumni Association Petitions for Promotion of Social Education

[Our City News] The Jiangsu Educational Alumni Association, recognizing the importance of promoting social education, has specifically expressed its opinions and submitted a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Council for review, requesting the Provincial Government to earnestly implement it. The full text is as follows: (omitted above) Social education in our Jiangsu province has historically been renowned for its longevity and its effectiveness has consistently surpassed other provinces. Since the post-war recovery, with the active planning of the Department of Education, the original institutions have gradually been restored. However, due to financial constraints, many projects still cannot be launched. The provincial and county social education organizations are either still in the planning stages of restoration, or their funding is excessively limited, with a vast disparity between the reality and the ideal. Now, on the occasion of this esteemed council holding a general meeting, we specifically present the following opinions: (1) Broadly raise social education funds from a long-term perspective, (2) actively cultivate social education professionals, (3) prioritize enriching the content of already restored provincial-level social education institutions, (4) establish a timetable for the restoration of county and city social education organizations, and a standard for the allocation of county and city education funds, ordering the relevant county and city administrative education departments to earnestly comply. After your esteemed council reviews and approves this, we request that it be forwarded to the Provincial Government, ordering the Departments of Education and Finance to earnestly proceed, in order to promote social education.

### Five-Year Plan for Educational Films, Educational Film Studio to Move to Beijing, Central Educational Film Library Planned, Using Films to Teach Primary and Secondary Schools

[Our Nanjing Special Dispatch] In order to actively promote educational films, the Ministry of Education established an educational film studio in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War, appointing Li Qingsong as director to oversee its operations. During the post-war recovery, the Ministry of Education planned to move the film studio to Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing, leveraging the scenic area and large crowds to implement social education. Negotiations with the municipal government have been ongoing for a long time, but have not yet been resolved. We recently spoke with Director Li Qingsong and learned:

Studio Location

The municipal government explained that the Xuanwu Lake area has a mausoleum management office that has been operating there for a long time, making it difficult to immediately relocate. It is now proposed to use the land and buildings of the Luyun Flower Garden in Dingjiaqiao for the educational film studio and negotiations are underway.

Film Production

Since 1942, forty-eight educational films have been produced, with seventeen copies brought to Beijing. The educational films currently screened weekly in primary and secondary schools in Beijing and Tianjin include materials from this studio.

Original Plan

Previously, there was a five-year plan to establish a Central Educational Film Library, collecting films from various European and American countries for selection and research. Those relating to natural sciences would be utilized directly, while those relating to social sciences would be adapted and produced. The plan aimed to coordinate with all the teaching materials needed within the primary and secondary school curriculum, hoping to complete 1,500 films within five years for use in teaching, supplementing universal education, and alleviating the shortage of teaching staff.

Agricultural Education Films

Currently, the studio is also working closely with agricultural education films, as the Farmers Bank has a plan to promote rural agricultural education films, which is already being prepared. The committee in charge of guiding educational films is chaired by individuals such as Chen Lifu, Zhang Daofan, and Pan Gongzhan. Educational films for both urban and rural areas are advancing in parallel, supplementing school education and promoting social education equally. Director Li is awaiting an opportunity to fly to Chongqing to prepare for the relocation of the studio to Beijing. (One)

He would convey the students' opinions to the Ministry of Education for review. Regarding the previous announcement by the Ministry of Personnel that graduates from schools in the recovered areas should be treated as employees in terms of employment, he had also suggested that the Ministry rescind the order, and it had been approved and would be announced publicly.

### Primary School Curriculum Research Forum

The Ministry of Education held a conference on revising primary school curriculum standards in Shanghai last month.

### Calling for Justice for My Deceased Son

Your newspaper's editorial on the 8th stated: "A child around ten years old has to study more than ten subjects, plus extracurricular activities. How can a child with a fragile body support it? How can a Chinese child with a particularly weak body digest it?" This realistic comment triggered my tragic memories. I had a good seven-year-old child named Wang Yu Ru, who entered the first grade of primary school in the autumn thirteen years ago. That primary school was run very well (according to my foolish thoughts at the time), with complete subjects, a full ten courses. Yu Ru studied very hard, and I was very happy with him and strongly encouraged him (according to my foolish methods at the time). But in the winter of the second year, my obedient Yu Ru died of pulmonary tuberculosis. At that time, I did not blame the school for rigidly teaching, nor did I blame myself for blindly encouraging him; I only blamed the child for having a fatal illness. It was not until now, when your newspaper revealed it, that I realized it was the fault of us parents! The fault of the school teachers! The fault of the experts who revised the curriculum standards! The fault of the government authorities who promulgated the educational system! Now, with an empty lap, recalling it, I have unspeakable regret. Otherwise, Yu Ru would still be here, already a promising young man in his twenties. But... I can't help but cry and can't continue writing. (A parent without children, Lu Lin, 35, 6, 8.)

Regarding the association's request to increase education funding, reform the education system, and stabilize the lives of teachers, he expressed that he could accept all the principles. He stated that when he was the mayor of Chongqing, he increased education funding from 6.7% of the city's municipal budget to 24%. The education funding of this city will definitely increase, subsidies will be issued in kind, and monthly salaries may also be paid once every half month. All matters related to the welfare of public educators, within the scope of possibility, will be done to the best of his ability, only hoping that the educators will temporarily endure and overcome the difficulties together.

Victory is still 80-90% certain against the West Alliance today.

On the West Alliance side, this time, through the contact of Qu Yaokang, Kolarasa, etc., famous players have been gathered into one team, forming a strong and substantial military lineup. Shanghai's first-class Western athletes, such as Xu Erz, Oliveira, Hanni Bo, Roberts Tov, Fafan Xiao, Mai Qidang, Pantson, etc., have all been recruited. Kostantin will personally serve as the captain, and Tiefuni will serve as the left forward in both the first and second halves. The team's defense and forward lines are considered to be strong.

### After Consecutive Declines, Retail Sales Gradually Increase, Rice Prices Rebound Yesterday

Yesterday, after consecutive sharp declines in the rice market, many transporters suffered losses, the source of supply was slightly reduced, and retailers took advantage to stock up. Medium and low-grade japonica and indica rice both rebounded by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. High-grade rice also became strong, and "White Yuan" stabilized. Flour sales became more active, rising by over 1,000 yuan. Soybean sales were normal, increasing slightly by 500 to 600 yuan. Bean cake rose slightly by 100 to 200 yuan, bran rose by 300 to 400 yuan, "Yuan" wheat and wheat remained stable. Raw peanuts fell back by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. New broad beans were selling quickly. Due to abundant supply, the oil market was firm early but weak in the afternoon, increasing slightly by several hundred to one thousand yuan. Yesterday, according to the rice market news, the total amount of rice arriving in the city was over 7,000 shi. The types and quantities are as follows: White japonica 2,376 shi, thin rice 1,163 shi, early rice 617 shi, "Sheep" indica 446 shi, "Du" indica 116 shi, "Wu" indica 2,191 shi, and White Yuan 143 shi.

### Caustic Soda Suddenly Rises by 300,000, Potassium Acid Tartrate Arrival Scarce

The price of caustic soda in this city has suddenly risen from over 400,000 to 750,000 yuan per barrel after the United States and the Philippines banned exports. According to industry insiders, based on yesterday's bidding situation, there is still the possibility of further increases.

According to a certain raw material import company in this city: Recently, American raw materials arriving at the port include potassium acid tartrate, white wax, petroleum jelly, bleaching powder, and bleaching powder concentrate, sodium sulfide, etc., but the quantity is very small, so the market prices of the above items have not seen any significant decline.

### Rubber Market Prices Gradually Rise, Local Demand Exceeds 1,000 Tons Per Month

Since London reported that industrial production representatives from the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands would be discussing rubber prices in England, Shanghai rubber industry insiders believe that foreign rubber prices will rise. Those holding inventory are unwilling to sell, leading to local rubber market prices rising by more than 40% recently. However, the selling prices in Southeast Asia, where rubber production is higher, are indeed lower than the cost of production, and prices must be raised to maintain profitability. Recently, the rubber market price in Singapore is US$0.21 per pound. The region has abundant production, and the American synthetic rubber industry is developed, with large production volume, so there should be no problem with the world's rubber supply. However, future prices must also be raised above cost. As for China's rubber demand, judging from the more than 40 large and small rubber factories in Shanghai, the total monthly demand is about 1,000 tons. It is also very easy to transport from Singapore to Shanghai. If transportation is smooth, Shanghai prices may be difficult to rise further.

### Direct Tax Bureau Controls Reorganization of Business Tax for Businesses, Sends Letters to Industry Associations to Inform Members

The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau recently notified various industry associations, stating, "To prevent individual units liable for business profit tax from concealing their reporting during reorganization, transfer, or closing, the Bureau has specifically created control measures for business reorganization, transfer, and liquidation. These measures are attached for strict compliance." The measures are as follows:

Matters for Industry Associations to Note

(1) Each industry association shall submit a membership roster to allow for comparison with new membership rosters. For those whose responsible person has changed or whose membership has been canceled, the reasons for the change or cancellation shall be verified. (2) When members of each industry association report liquidation, closing, or reorganization, regardless of whether the license number is changed, in addition to notifying the member to report to the nearest district office, the association should also report it to the Bureau as a special case to ensure strict control. (3) Each industry association shall immediately notify its members that transferees may not assume businesses that have been liquidated or closed without paying taxes. If they have already assumed the business, the transferee shall be liable for recovery of the owed taxes. (4) Each industry association shall report the number of members added or decreased each month to the Bureau, clearly stating the license number, address, responsible person, and capital amount of the members added or decreased.

Matters for District Offices to Note

(1) When the district offices conduct a census of businesses, they shall first carefully investigate the date of establishment of the business and the connection of all account books. If a transfer occurred after September 9, Year 34, the current owner should be ordered to report it and recover the various taxes owed by the seller. (2) If the census personnel find that a business has been liquidated, is being liquidated, or has been assumed, but the business has not joined any industry association, they should be ordered to provide a guarantor for review and submit the guarantee to the Bureau for approval. (3) When investigating businesses opened in Year 35, census personnel should carefully inquire about the original location and the license name and responsible person in Year 34, and order the responsible person of the newly opened business to urge reporting. (4) The district offices should carefully verify the basis for each business's increased capital to investigate whether it is an actual investment of funds. If it is the appreciation of assets converted into capital, the liquidation profit tax should be reported and paid first. (5) The district offices shall fill out and submit a business unit change investigation form weekly for each business reorganized, transferred, closed, increased capital after September 34, and for each business opened in Year 35.

### Jinshan Branches See New High Price

Jinshan yuan branches are in short supply, and many have been out of stock for days. Now, a few Nanshi companies have shipped some in, and buyers are rushing to purchase them, resulting in a tight market. The market suddenly rose by about 30% yesterday, reaching an unprecedented high price.

### Over Fifty Pieces of Lake Silk Shipped from Shanghai to England Yesterday

[Our Correspondent] The Taikoo Lan Yantze Company's "Pisienne" left Shanghai for Europe today, carrying over fifty pieces of Lake silk and two hundred boxes of fur, bound for Liverpool. In addition, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Yanguan" sailed to Shantou and Amoy today, carrying 1,590 pieces of cotton yarn, 99 pieces of piece goods, 270 pieces of tobacco, and 1,300 pieces of bean cake to Shantou; and 210 pieces of cotton yarn, 330 pieces of piece goods, 7,100 bags of wheat bran, over 1,000 bags of soybeans, and 600 pieces of bean cake to Amoy.

Another report says that the Huangxing wheel returned to Shanghai from Qingdao yesterday, carrying 759 tons of coal.

### Timber Business is Difficult to Operate, Freight Costs are Too High, Foreign Goods are Dumped

The timber business in Shanghai was booming during the war due to blocked transportation in various places and urgent needs, so prices rose daily. After the victory, transportation gradually recovered, and timber from domestic production areas such as Wenzhou and Fuzhou began to be shipped to Shanghai. The source of timber from the United States and Canada is also gradually abundant, but the cost of transporting round logs from the producing area to Shanghai requires seven times the freight cost, and flat logs require twice the cost. The flat log business is affected by foreign goods and has not improved. Round logs are still profitable, but currently, high transportation costs and lack of ships are the two major obstacles to timber arriving in Shanghai.

### Chinese Medicine Sales are Sporadic, Guangdong Goods Continue to Trend Downward

Inventories of Chinese medicine and Guangdong goods were originally low, but recently, large quantities have arrived, and although there are sales, they are sporadic. Under the imbalance of supply and demand, prices continue to trend downward.

### Economic Briefs

It is rumored that the "E" bonds of the Unified Government Bond will be redeemed on the 10th of this month at the Bank Association Club at 59 Hong Kong Road.

More than 200 Shanghai industry associations have been reorganized and consolidated so far. Those that have not been organized are limited to forming organizations before the 23rd of this month. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has also decided to convene the ninth membership meeting this month, so the election of directors and supervisors, if the association has not been organized at that time, will not be allowed to attend.

The preparatory office of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce held its first expanded preparatory meeting in Beijing on the 5th of last month. It is reported that the conference is expected to be established next month.

The China Textile Machinery Construction Company's business is difficult to launch because the work of taking over factories has not been completed. According to the general manager of the company, Huang Boqiao, the reasons for the difficulty include six points: (1) Factory buildings and equipment do not meet needs. (2) The work and skills of the original workers are far from ideal. (3) Machines are old and difficult to meet manufacturing goals. (4) Raw materials are lacking. (5) Prices are fluctuating, and costs cannot be calculated. (6) Power is insufficient.

### Pig Commission is Less Than Three Point Five Percent, Only About One Point Six Percent

The pig industry in this city will reduce the commission to 3.5% per hundred [yuan], and some people have formally proposed it. This newspaper has briefly recorded it. According to a letter from the Fresh Pig Industry Association, the actual commission is only about 1.6%. The original letter is as follows: Your newspaper's economic news column published the news "Pig Commission Reduction," stating that each pig farm has agreed that the commission includes strapping feet, shearing hair, weighing, and handling, all at 3.5%. After consulting with the member firms of this Association about self-established pig farms, the highest fee in the past was 2% and the lowest was 1%. In the past, in order to unify the fees, a meeting was convened with the persons in charge of each pig farm and it was decided to change to calculating by head, and reduce the collection to 1,000 yuan of stack fees per head. Other fees: grasping each head 500 yuan, warehousing each head 500 yuan, totaling Legal Currency 2,000 yuan, equivalent to about 1.6% based on the market price. Other shearing hair, weighing, etc., have never been charged, so there is no need to arrive immediately. Please check and correct.

### Coal Production is Increasing, But Supply Still Falls Short of Demand

(Tianjin, 6th) The Kailuan Coal Mine in North China has been actively increasing production since it was taken over. The monthly output of the mine since December 34 is as follows: December 34 was 281,000 tons, January of this year was 291,000 tons, February was 300,300 tons, March was 320,100 tons, April was reduced to 283,900 tons due to a strike by miners, and May was approximately 330,000 tons. The total monthly demand in various regions is estimated to be 150,000 tons in Qingdao, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and the Yangtze River basin, and 245,000 tons in North China, for a total of 395,000 tons. Comparing this with the mine's production and sales volume in May, the difference is only more than 60,000 tons.

### Wool Fabrics Maintain the Status Quo

Wool fabrics, due to the lack of production and inventory, are able to maintain the current situation, even during the summer off-season. Spot transactions are always based on opportunity. People want to sell but cannot sell, and they want to buy but cannot buy. Actual sales are successively decreasing, and dismantling interest is eating into capital, far from what it used to be. In view of the fact that Huichang Zhicheng and other firms went bankrupt one after another after eating interest on purchases, drawing a lesson from the past, the industry is much more cautious in accepting checks and bills of exchange. There were some inquiries from Henan and Changsha yesterday, and small-amount purchases led to a trend of renewed improvement in limited fine wool fabrics.

### Domestic Sales of Tea Remain Strong

Qimen black tea and uncolored green tea were most popular in the United States before the war. Recently, although South America has repeatedly inquired, they fear the price is too high, so shipments have been rare. As for various domestic sales varieties, demand from customers remains urgent. In addition, as more and more stores are being added in the street, transactions are extremely active. In terms of price, those holding goods intend to raise them, resuming old habits. However, in the midst of the sharp drop in rice prices these days, there is no reason to raise prices, and the result is a firm situation.

### Medium-Grained White Sugar Sales Are Brisk

Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market was firm. Although the China Grain and Oil Company has weekly releases of medium-grained white sugar, the market price eased, and demand revived. With supply and demand matching, the price tightened again. The company's spot goods in mid-market were 71,000 to 71,500 yuan in the morning, and the company's warehouse receipt was 70,500 to 71,000 yuan. In the afternoon, spot goods were 72,000 yuan, and warehouse receipts were 71,500 to 71,000 yuan, an increase of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The price of goods sold by merchants was 75,000 yuan for ordinary yellow powder, 70,500 to 68,000 yuan for Xinghua red, 60,000 yuan for the "Ti Zhuang" green, and 71,000 yuan for Huanggang red. A total of 400 to 500 pieces were traded.

### Small Radio

Fits in the Palm of Your Hand

Ten and a Half Inches Long, Six Inches High

British Information Office, London, August 8th: Britain is manufacturing a new type of small wireless radio, ten and a half inches long, six inches wide, and six inches high, which fits in the palm of your hand. This new radio is called the "Planet" radio, and the colors are very detailed and eye-catching. The first batch of samples will be black and ivory, and various colors of radios will be manufactured successively. The sound reception will be exceptionally clear, truly a complete wireless radio. In addition, shortwave radios will be supplied to overseas markets.

### Bulls and Bears Waiting to Take Action, Chinese and Foreign Stocks are Mediocre

The general trend of Chinese stocks is gradually stabilizing. With bulls and bears waiting to take action, the process is mostly sideways. Popular and unpopular stocks are all mediocre. Yongsheng Yarn needs to exchange receipts soon, and there is a rumor of stopping trading. Although there has been no formal announcement by the large brokers, buyers have clearly turned to American Asia. The high price of Yongsheng Yarn is 5,950 yuan, American Asia is 4,380 yuan, Jingfu is 325 yuan, Xinguang is 318 yuan, and Qinxing is 245 yuan. The low price of Yongsheng Yarn is 5,780 yuan, American Asia is 4,200 yuan, Jingfu is 305 yuan, Xinguang is 300 yuan, and Qinxing is 230 yuan. As a result, popular stocks, large and small, rose slightly compared to the previous close. Unpopular small stocks were quite stable yesterday because they had risen too much. Medium-sized stocks continued to rise slightly. Foreign stocks were also mediocre. Jardine Matheson opened around 12,200 yuan, and there was profit-taking, falling slightly to 11,600 yuan. The financial sector recovered slightly, allowing it to maintain. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson, Wheelock Marden, and Asia Steel fell by half a percent, Jardine Matheson and Jardine Brewery fell slightly, Union Insurance was flat, and Paper Industries rose slightly.

### Shanghai Canned Food Industry Asks to Take Over Taiwan Canned Food Factory

The Shanghai Canned Food Industry Association held its second board of directors meeting yesterday, resolving to send a telegram to the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office of Agriculture and Forestry, requesting permission to take over the Taiwan Canned Food Factory to facilitate the development of the national canned food industry. They plan to use a cooperative approach to establish close ties with the office, using the factory bases, assets, and machinery of the Taiwan factories and members' investments as working capital to start work. However, relying on Japanese technical personnel is not a long-term solution, and they plan to send the technical staff of the Shanghai Association's factories one after another. As for the promotion and sales of manufactured goods, the Shanghai industry will be fully responsible, and all factory administration will be supervised and guided by the Office of Agriculture and Forestry.

### Twenty-Nine Days in Changchun (13)

— Special Correspondent, Shao Shenzhi of this Newspaper

We cannot believe that the conclusion of three years of recovery is an academic conclusion, but believe that it is a political propaganda conclusion. That is to say, this is a statement made without investigation.

Our conversation quickly turned in another direction. The dishes we ate today were the best Chinese dishes I had ever tasted since arriving in Changchun. When talking about the destruction of the Shenyang Arsenal, Peng Zhen particularly expressed his gratification. The Shenyang Arsenal is naturally a military industry, so the issue is particularly clear, and Peng Zhen also had a clear answer. He said:

"This destruction is good, otherwise the Kuomintang would have had more capital for civil war."

### March of the Banquet Conversation

In truth, this logic could also be applied to other industrial losses, but the question of whether it constitutes a "matter of debate" remains unaddressed.

We will always remember this banquet. On the fourth, we suddenly felt the atmosphere of the Four Powers shift. Wheeler, as a result, considered going to Harbin to take a look.

This issue was raised when Zhou Baozhong treated us to dinner, but his response was: Harbin is Harbin's affair, and he cannot decide, but he can raise it with the Northeast Bureau. When Kai Feng came on the third, we discussed it again. He strongly agreed and said that a special train could be arranged immediately. Later, because an airplane came to pick us up unexpectedly, we abandoned our plans to go to Harbin on the evening of the fourth.

We all felt that Kai Feng was a person who had suffered hardship. He was thin and pale, with gaps in his teeth. He spoke softly, wearing a gray Zhongshan suit, a scarf, and a gray cloth army cap, looking like a low-level civil servant in Chongqing, haggard and malnourished from the pressures of life. However, his eyes were very spirited. He now holds an important position in the Northeast Bureau; he is one of the committee members. When he first met us, he looked nervous and focused, which was very incongruous with our "carefree and casual" appearance. He had worked at the Yan'an Liberation Daily and the Chongqing Xinhua Daily, writing his conclusions. The journalist friends he knew were also friends we knew. When asked if he had written any articles recently, he replied, "I haven't written anything in five years."

He was one of the hosts at the banquet that day, but he spoke the least. Wei Zhi interviewed him for news, asking about the land distribution situation and what was happening with the priced land acquisition near Fushun.

He gave an example, saying:

"For example, near Meihekou (the location of the Democratic Allied Army headquarters), there is a village with 300 households. This area has cultivated land that was seized by the Japanese. After the Japanese left, the villagers' assembly decided how to divide it. After calculating, each adult could be allocated one 'tian' of land (in the Northeast, the amount of land one person with two horses can cultivate in a day, approximately six mu). They would gain ownership of this land and could then sell or lease it, but with the condition that rent must be reduced by 25%. Currently, there is a problem with cultivated land in the Northeast. Many paddy fields left by the Japanese are not known how to cultivate by Northeasterners. They do not want these paddy fields, even though the production yield is three times higher than dry land." He continued, "There are no regulations for priced land acquisition in land distribution. If mining land is currently not being exploited, it cannot be allowed to lie fallow and can be distributed, but it will be reclaimed when exploitation begins. The priced land acquisition issue is likely due to problems with lower-level implementation."

He then added, "The Northeast Bureau is in Changchun for the same reason. Changchun is an important place, and we must do it well and make fewer mistakes."

Their personnel have a stock phrase: "We completely accept your criticism." Once this sentence is uttered, the other party has no choice but to shut their mouth, and any serious questioning dissipates into thin air.

As mentioned above, Lü Zhengcao announced that the Northeast Army currently under their command has a full 100,000 men. Take Zhang Xueshi as an example. When he came out of the pass (Shanhaiguan), he only had a little over 2,000 people.

According to Lü Zhengcao, almost all of the cadres in the Northeast Army under their command are Northeasterners, and almost all are young people who fled and cannot return to their hometowns. Their homes are under the iron heel of the Japanese puppets. They want to go home and "fight their way back home." They hate the Japanese devils, and the flames of blood debt are burning in their hearts. Therefore, once they set foot on their vast native land, many young people who longed to avenge their national and personal grievances followed the banner of the old Northeast Army to "fight their way back home" and joined their ranks to disarm the Japanese devils.

Lü Zhengcao is about forty years old, thin and with a gentle demeanor, not looking like a soldier. He is from Haicheng, Liaoning, and speaks with a Haicheng accent. He is currently the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army and Commander-in-Chief of the West Manchuria Military Region. He is a graduate of the Shenyang Military Academy and a good classmate of Zhao Jiaqi, Wan Yi, and Chen Jiazhen, the commander of the government's city defense in Changchun who was wounded this time. He still remembers the story of Wan Yi placing second and Zhao Jiaqi placing fourth in their class.

We didn't know the name Lü Zhengcao very well. At the time of the Xi'an Incident, he was a regimental commander under Liu Duoji, and perhaps it was this regiment that had the closest relationship with the Communist army at the time. Perhaps it was at this time that he converted to the Communist Party. We didn't have time to ask him these questions, but he made it very clear to us that he himself is a member of the Communist Party and a member of the Central Committee of the CCP.

He knows that the people of the Northeast have suffered too much and cannot have another civil war, so he also opposes the civil war. He is full of talk of peace and democracy, saying, "If the Northeast does not have peace for a day and democracy for a moment, then China will not have a moment of tranquility."

Therefore, he said, "The Northeast Army in the Northeast will absolutely fight against the anti-peace and anti-democracy front."

The focus of our conversation was concentrated on national affairs, so the atmosphere became depressing. We shifted the focus of the conversation to Zhang Xueliang.

Lü said, "Zhang Hanqing is my old superior. I once served as his staff officer and adjutant. We have always disapproved of his past romantic life." However, Lü believes that in the Xi'an Incident, Zhang Xueliang acted entirely for the country and the nation, forgetting his personal interests. He does not harbor a trace of selfishness. If he is released now and if he still holds the same spirit as before, I will naturally respect him and respect Hanqing's personality. Speaking of this, he suddenly analyzed the reasons why Chen Jiazhen did not surrender.

He said that he and Chen Jiazhen are not only classmates but also fellow townsmen, both living on the same street in Haicheng. After graduating from school, they were both old subordinates of Zhang Xueliang's Northeast Army. During the War of Resistance, Chen Jiazhen spent his entire career as a staff member in Chongqing, and he never had much success. So now that he has become the city defense commander, he is eager to do something for himself and pave a way for his future. Unexpectedly, he failed completely this time, and he ultimately became disabled.

We didn't know about Chen Jiazhen's injury. We wanted to visit him, but we had no freedom at all, so we eagerly shifted the topic back to Chen Jiazhen.

Lü said, "The day after I arrived here, I went to the hospital to support and visit Jiazhen. We hadn't seen each other for almost ten years. The first words I used to comfort Jiazhen were to tell him that his old home in Haicheng is still very safe. He was shot in the thigh, with the bullet hitting the thigh bone. He didn't get to the hospital until six days after he was injured. His thigh was swollen, as thick as the opening of a washbasin. The Japanese doctor said he might be disabled."

We were silent for a long time and couldn't say anything. We were indeed saddened. Chen Jiazhen was originally a typical honest and loyal soldier. Although his performance this time was relatively weak, it was definitely not something he could have reversed on his own. We deeply regretted that it is not a simple thing for the country to cultivate a general. In the end, being disabled in this kind of situation, we really didn't know what to say.

Lü also felt some regret that his classmate was fighting his classmate.

Finally, Lippmann told a story about the American Civil War. He said, "Our Civil War was fundamentally a civil war, and classmates from West Point would turn against each other and fight. But peace will eventually come."

Lü Zhengcao raised his glass to him and said, "Let's drink to the peace we long for!"

### Meeting Zhang Xueshi

Zhang Xueshi's sister in Shanghai had asked Lippmann to visit her fourth brother when he went to the Northeast. Before Lippmann left Shanghai, she entrusted him with a letter to Zhang Xueshi.

When the Communist army occupied Changchun, Lippmann inquired about Zhang Xueshi's whereabouts. People inside the pass considered it a "mystery" whether Zhang Xueshi actually existed and about his mysterious whereabouts.

On the 22nd, just as we were going to Zhou Baozhong's late-night banquet at the Yamato Hotel, Lippmann continued to inquire about Zhang Xueshi's news. He learned from Zhou Baozhong that Zhang Xueshi was in Benxi. He was overjoyed and wanted to go to Benxi to meet him immediately. But then he thought about his freedom being in the hands of the hosts on the other side, so he had no choice but to give the short letter written on the small card in his pocket to Zhou Baozhong to pass on to Zhang Xueshi.

On May 4th, the day when Peng Zhen, Lü Zhengcao, Zhou Baozhong, Kai Feng, and others from the Northeast Bureau treated us to dinner, Shi Xun saw the news in the Northeast Daily that "Northeast University President Zhang Xueshi Arrives in Changchun to Hold Opening Ceremony" and immediately told Lippmann. He was overjoyed and said, "I really want to see this young marshal's brother."

So after dinner, Lü Zhengcao, Lippmann, and Shi Xun sat around a small square table in the lounge. Our first question was, "Is it true that Zhang Xueshi has arrived?"

"Yes, he originally planned to attend this reception for you journalist gentlemen tonight, but he is too busy with Northeast University matters, so he couldn't come," Lü replied.

Lippmann explained his eagerness to meet Zhang Xueshi, and Lü Zhengcao promised to find him to talk with us tomorrow.

On the morning of the 5th, Lü Zhengcao sent an adjutant to bring a car, and also asked Zhou Baozhong's secretary Liu Ke to accompany us. Liu said that Zhang Xueshi was waiting for us at Lü Zhengcao's home.

It was a morning when the first rain had not stopped, and the fine spring rain on the Northeast's desert-like Taiyuan Road was a very welcome thing. We had been parched for so many days, so seeing the spring rain, we were naturally very happy and didn't have the same feeling of annoyance with the spring rain as the people of Jiangnan.

We all waited in the reception room. In less than three minutes, Lü Zhengcao led Zhang Xueshi downstairs. Zhang Xueshi stood in the middle of us, wearing a neatly pressed military uniform and yellow riding boots. His thin figure made him look very handsome. His appearance, with a Northern University vibe, resembled Zhang Xueliang when he was young. He was not as casually dressed as the average Communist soldier.

He told us that he is now thirty-two years old. At the time of the Xi'an Incident, he was in the tenth class of the Nanjing Central Military Academy. He was able to use foreign languages freely and spoke reasonably well when talking with several American colleagues. We were surprised by his English skills. He said that he was a graduate of Huimen Middle School in Beijing.

After the July 7th Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident), he joined the Eighth Route Army and fought with the Japanese devils in North China and Central China for seven or eight years. He said, "I want to avenge this national shame and personal feud." He also admitted that when he returned to the Northeast last September, he had only a little over 2,000 men under his command. He told us that more than half of his cadres were from the old Northeast Army.

When we mentioned Zhang Xueliang, he first asked, "You gentlemen all came from inside the pass, but I wonder if my elder brother is still well? I haven't seen him for nine years." His facial expression was very concerned when he said this.

Lippmann replied, "I wanted to visit him last year, but the Chinese government didn't allow me to go. But I heard indirectly that he has gained a lot of weight while in revolution and has also read a lot of books." Zhang Xueshi didn't say anything, leaned his head on the back of the sofa, and stared straight at the ceiling."

After a while, he asked, "Have you heard news of my elder brother being released?"

We told him that we sometimes saw this kind of news in the newspapers, but we didn't know if it was true. Then he said:

"After the Xi'an Incident, Song Ziwen guaranteed that he would go to Nanjing once and then let him return immediately. I went to see my elder brother at the time, and he told me that he did the Xi'an Incident entirely for the country and the nation, not for himself. So now he should be released."

We then asked him, "If he is released now, would you still follow him and take the same political views?"

"If my elder brother remains unchanged, continues with the style of the Xi'an Incident, and continues to walk the path of democracy, I will naturally support him. However, I deeply understand his character, and he will not change."

After that, he said that his troops are all near Benxi and that he recently returned to Changchun from Benxi. He has 25,000 men under him. He also told us that he is married and has two children.

As we were about to leave, Lippmann asked him if he had any letters to take to his sister. He thought for a moment and said with a smile:

"Ask her how she is. Please tell her that I am most concerned about my elder brother."

Zhang Xueshi is a young soldier. The Communist side says that he is the democratically elected chairman of Liaoning Province and also the president of Northeast University, but he has never admitted that he is a Communist Party member. He refused to express an opinion on this issue. He said that he had been to Yan'an once in 1938 and stayed for a few months. After that, he was with Lü Zhengcao on the front lines of North China. (To be continued)

### Anhui Province's Top Traitor, Wang Shan-cheng, Sentenced to Death; Mother, Wife, and Daughters Commit Group Suicide

— Wuhu Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 3rd [of the month] Correspondent Bai Yuwen

The brothers Li Lexin and Li Leqi from Chaoxian County and the brothers Wang Zidong and Wang Shancheng from Wuhu, all top traitors of Anhui province, were either gangsters or unscrupulous businessmen in the past and had no concept of the nation or state. After Wuhu fell [to the Japanese], these people colluded with the Japanese enemy to control materials, led Japanese troops to various counties to collect military grain, opened banks, disrupted the financial system, and collected piles of timber. Later, a flash flood destroyed the Lishe Bridge in Wuhu, killing and injuring more than a hundred boatmen and pedestrians, but no one dared to question [the brothers]. They traveled with Japanese soldiers as escorts, and the warehouses and houses set up by the Li brothers extended from Chaoxian to Wuhu, Nanjing, Suzhou, Nantong, and Shanghai, their power and influence being blatant and causing widespread resentment. After the recovery, except for Wang Shancheng, who was arrested, the others all had great connections and secretly escaped. The confiscated property only accounted for a very small portion. The Li brothers have gradually had their family members come forward to rent some of the houses to powerful people. Those responsible seem to have no time to investigate.

The arrest and sentencing to death of the traitor Wang Shancheng was met with popular acclaim. After he was sentenced to death, in addition to his son Wang Yongxue and shop staff going to Beijing to request a retrial, his elderly mother, wife, and daughters, out of terror, ingested opium together yesterday and attempted a group suicide. Fortunately, they were discovered early and most were rescued. Only his third daughter is still in critical condition due to ingesting too much poison. A collective suicide of an entire family of traitors is unprecedented since the start of the anti-traitor work. This is specially recorded for the readers of this newspaper.

### Answering Readers: Medicine and Hygiene

(1) Du Zhijie asks: I am thirty-four years old and have always been weak. A lump suddenly appeared behind my anus last month. It is slightly painful when pressed, and slightly enlarged during bowel movements, but not noticeably painful. The doctor said it is an anal fistula, and there is still little pus after the operation, making it difficult to heal. He also said that it is related to lung disease. I am extremely anxious. How should I treat it? Please advise.

[Answer from Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi] According to your letter, I fear it is a tuberculous fistula-in-ano.

### Where are the Remains of Martyred Patriots Stored?

Editor: Qian Yishi was a native of Xianning County, Hubei Province. He was orphaned and poor in his youth, but he was intelligent, had great ambitions, and was proficient in classical Chinese. He also excelled in English, French, Russian, and Japanese. He was renowned in Wuhan's education circles. After coming to Shanghai, he served as a professor at various universities for many years and was the chief editor of the New China Magazine published by the Zhonghua Book Company. During the August 13th [Shanghai] War of Resistance, he served as a major general advisor under General Zhang Fawu, where he assisted in defending Pudong. As a result, he overworked himself and fell ill at the Nanxiang Field Hospital and died. At that time, his family had retreated to Hubei. Fortunately, with the help of friends, the body was transferred to Shanghai for embalming. Now, after nine years, I don't know where the remains are stored. Mr. Qian's family has sent a letter asking me to investigate, but I don't know where to start. Please grant me a corner of your newspaper to disclose this information. If any of Qian's friends during his lifetime know the location of the remains, please send a letter to No. 331 Jinling East Road or call 82043 so that I can inform Qian's family. I would be most grateful. Respectfully yours, Li Xingchu

### Taiwan Black Market

— Air Mail Report, May 28th, Evening News

Taiwan is our paradise, the Switzerland of the East. Our government authorities, especially the chief administrator of Taiwan, if they do a good job, there is already a good foundation there, which makes things twice as easy and achieves quick results.

Current Status of the Taiwan Dollar

Why is Taiwan not using the legal tender? This is what most people in the country cannot understand.

In our chaotic country, it is absolutely impossible to get politics completely on track in a short time. The most obvious thing about all the measures in Taiwan is that the currency value is very stable. With a stable currency value, the lives of the Taiwanese people are also stable. Compared to the Shanghai merchants stirring up trouble and causing the citizens to always be worried about the "crazy" soaring prices, it is much better here. The exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the legal tender is set at one to thirty. If it were one to one, smart Shanghai businessmen would have already moved all the resources here in entire ships. Do you think the Taiwanese people could still live? Now, merchants cannot profit. They no longer think of "going to Taiwan." Chen Yi saw through the terrible nature and ever-changing tricks of Shanghai merchants. In order to protect the Taiwanese people, he had to first adopt a closed-door policy, implementing measures to raise the value of the Taiwan dollar to resist merchants taking advantage of opportunities, making huge profits, and plunging the Taiwanese people into deep water. Because merchants could not get rich, everyone complained and spread rumors to slander Chen. Because the reaction of prices after the war is unavoidable, but the limit of the reaction has a great impact on people's livelihood, adapting to local conditions is a necessary need. Currently, the official price of the Taiwan dollar is one to thirty, but the black market is only around twenty-two yuan. Recently, the exchange rate between the customs gold unit and the Taiwan dollar has risen from 80% to 93%, which means that the black market value of the Taiwan dollar has fallen to around 22 legal tender. Conversely, the legal tender has an external value of eight out of thirty, unlike the price increases in Shanghai, which always devalue the legal tender. I ask you: Is there a situation in the country where the black market price is lower than the official price? This is a miracle, and it is also the greatest success of Taiwan's economic policy.

Rampant Thieves

What people hate most now when going to Taiwan is that there are too many thieves, and it is impossible to guard against them. This is another point of dissatisfaction with the administrative authorities. The authorities also feel very regretful and are studying countermeasures. If you think back to the Taiwan of the past, how could it be possible to achieve "doors left open at night"? The reasons are: (1) Guiding the local petty thieves to do evil and develop outwards, going to various parts of our country to become vagrants. (2) Driving the petty thieves to concentrate on isolated islands, unable to gain a foothold in Taiwan. (3) Kicking the thieves on the street when they were caught (the most contemptuous punishment for the kicked) and sentencing them to imprisonment. After a theft occurred, the first thing was to catch the previously convicted thief and interrogate them again, so being a thief would suffer for life. Therefore, no one dared to be a thief. And (4) the police are all in plain clothes, very responsible for patrolling the streets. When there are no police on the road, the police come when something happens. Thieves who stole things were often caught. Anyone who found a thief would bravely report them. We feel that the fourth point is the most important, and it can be a good example for domestic police affairs. The spirit of mutual assistance among the people should also be cultivated. Now, a large number of vagrants have been repatriated to Taiwan. After the Japanese left, no one supervised the large number of exiled people on the isolated islands, and they sneaked back.

Fearsome Drought

In terms of the cityscape, Taiwan is very "gaunt." Like other places, it almost all suffers from this anemia. The lack of materials and the decline in purchasing power are all factors that cannot restore prosperity for a while. But Taiwan has products and resources, especially rice, which can be harvested three times a year. Currently, rice is expensive and there is some panic. In Tainan, Kaohsiung, and other places, there has been no rain for several months, and there are signs of drought. When this reporter first came to Taipei in early May, it was sunny and hot every day with little rain, and the river water was very shallow. I am really worried about the Taiwanese people and the authorities. If there is a drought, how will the Taiwanese people suffer, and how will the authorities have a hard time recovering. Fortunately, it has been raining every day these past few days. Heaven can be beautiful, and in two months, the newborn Taiwan will not only be able to relieve the food panic, but the authorities will also be able to concentrate on reorganization work.

### The Voice of the Exiled Group (2)

Editor: My heart, which has been suffering all day, has made me issue a roar of hot blood that I can no longer tolerate. In fact, it may just be a moan on the edge of life. The meaning of writing this letter is only to hope that the general gentlemen living in luxury and those evil villains who build their happiness on the suffering of others can still think for a moment that in one corner of the "Big Four Powers," the "Magnificent China," there lives a group of people, and I hope that those who transfer political documents will see how the people of northern Jiangsu are struggling.

Let me start with myself. I am from Jingjiang, northern Jiangsu, a first-year student at XX National University. From the perspective of northern Jiangsu, I am able to study, which is enough to satisfy me. However, how heartbreaking are the wanderers after the victory!

My hometown is bankrupt, and even the ambition to study cannot be realized. Because northern Jiangsu is a different environment! Even if you study behind closed doors, it is not difficult to lose your life. Helplessly, I have to wander. Now, I am a university student, but in terms of food, I don't know where the meal money will come from tomorrow. There is no way to borrow money, and I am treated with disdain. Should I go back? I am catching up with the high tide of "killing the three assets." Should I drop out of school? Unless I sleep on the street. I don't know why the government doesn't simply take back northern Hebei. If you say you are following some false faith and meaningless negotiations, then why is Sipin Street fighting so fiercely? Isn't the Northeast part of China? Aren't the communists and the national army fighting in the Northeast? Then why not unify the military and administration, tax collection, and currency system? Since the victory in September, you collect donations, he collects public grain, money from the countryside cannot be used in the city, money from the city cannot be used in the countryside, there are conflicts in the east, and killings in the west. By the time the gentlemen stop fighting, the people will have already died! Especially infuriating is the talk about relief, relief! I have been wandering to this day, and I have not seen any relief given to the youth of northern Jiangsu. When there is really no way, I may have to go back to my hometown to engage in revolution, although it will harm a part of my compatriots even more, at least I will not starve to death in a foreign land.

Let me talk about several of my fellow students from northern Jiangsu. Their parents, brothers, and sisters either live in Yangzhou or Zhenjiang. In the past, they all had a beautiful name, "farming and reading family." They lived a leisurely and harmonious life in the green wilderness and in the villages surrounded by streams. But now, in the so-called "liberated" world, they are regarded as bloodsucking capitalists and expelled by the revolutionaries. In fact, only heaven knows about the capitalist class in the Chinese countryside. However, in terms of justice, the lives of ordinary tenants are indeed bitter enough. Land redistribution is something that must be implemented in China. But what about now that it is "liberated"? Only even more suffering is given to the ordinary tenants. In addition to the public grain and miscellaneous taxes at each level, the "military enlistment movement," which still exists after the victory, has ruined many pitiful lives. "Who has no parents? Who has no wife?" They are just using the simple thinking of low-level people, giving them the capital to gamble for power and wealth. It is really pitiful! And the result? It is called revolution, but in fact, it has taken the lives of the landlords and even more severely taken the lives of many ignorant and loyal farmers! I don't need to say much about the situation in northern Jiangsu now. I dare not make a definitive judgment on the situation in northern Jiangsu. Just based on my ten days of rural life during my vacation, when I went back, because the KMT-CPC negotiations had not yet been completed, the countryside was still peaceful. At that time, I personally saw many farmers eating aster grass (the Shanghai people call it alfalfa). They had no resentment, they had no suffering, only a kind of perseverance of our national character. They did not leave hatred to anyone. They were like a group of weak and masterless lambs, or like an old ox whipped to work. They do not know for personal survival, they engage in mass production all day long. Great administrative officials, how can you be worthy of such docile and pitiful people? They are ignorant, and they have no tongue. They swallow their bitter tears in secret, they drink their own blood! But their blood is about to be sucked dry!

Editor, I have spent most of my night writing this letter. The outside of the window is so dark, as if the light has been devoured by something. Fortunately, I will not be able to do my homework tonight. However, I seem to have a lot of things to say that are stuck in my throat and I can't spit out. Just this little thing, if the teacher can put it in front of the readers and let the gentlemen know, I will be very grateful. A declining youth from northern Jiangsu at Fudan University.

### Liu Shi's Fish Exhibition

— Shao Fu

Reading ten thousand books and traveling ten thousand miles, a varied and colorful life is a necessary condition for a writer and an artist.

Liu Shi, a young Chinese painter, with the Anti-Japanese War as a dividing line, has undergone a great leap in his emotions, especially in his artistic depth. Even though he has not yet produced works that reflect or represent this great era in his painting work during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, if he had stayed in the occupied areas, even if he did not make offerings to the enemy puppets, could he have understood the meaning of these eight years? Could he have breathed the moving atmosphere of the tens of millions of people in the motherland resisting the war?

For the past eight years, his days have been spent entirely on the battlefield. He rushed to various battlefields as a political worker. If we talk about understanding war, understanding the lives of soldiers, and understanding the countryside, he will not be less than anyone.

From the 7th to the 13th, he held a week-long exhibition at the Ningbo Fellow Association. It is said that all the works are fish. Among Chinese painters, Mr. Wang Yating is known for his fish. Liu Shi is naturally a rising star, but why does he specialize in painting fish? Perhaps Zhuangzi's "Free and Easy Wandering" is the result of our pursuit of this question.

In the spring of 1934, I saw Liu Shi's exhibition at Sanshodo in Kanda Ward, Tokyo. At that time, all his works were oil paintings. It has been twelve years since then. I think his exhibition this time will definitely surprise me.

### The Existence or Non-Existence of the Defense Corps

— Shen Zhensheng

I remember that at the previous meeting of the Municipal Council, a councilor raised questions about the defense corps. The meaning was, "There are military and police forces everywhere in this city, which is enough to maintain law and order. Why waste money and resources to support this group of defense corps that disturbs the people?" Recently, there has been news that the defense corps will be reorganized into security police, and it is also rumored that the defense corps, except for permanent members, will be disbanded. Because the organization of the defense corps has a very close relationship with local security, I have to take the position of the people to discuss whether the organization of the defense corps has any value in existing.

The urban area of ​​Shanghai is convenient for transportation, and the military and police forces are everywhere. The layout of the security network is already quite tight. In the event of disturbances, the military and police can quickly arrive at the scene to maintain order. The councilor expressed dissatisfaction with the organization of another defense corps based on the situation in the urban area, which is not without reason. However, the situation in the suburbs of this city cannot be compared with that in the urban area.

The suburbs of this city have vast land and scattered population. Therefore, the garrison of the military and police has to be limited to some larger towns. However, the hideouts of bandits and bandit cases are often in remote rural areas. Therefore, the military and police in the suburbs have the difficulty of maintaining law and order in taking care of one thing and losing sight of another.

The order in the suburbs of this city is very quiet during the day, and the military and police personnel have almost no work. When it is late at night, the bandits will suddenly attack. Because of the inconvenient transportation and other reasons in the suburbs, the military and police feel that it is beyond their reach to maintain law and order.

The above are all obvious facts. Therefore, there are many reasons for organizing a defense corps in the suburbs of this city to take on the responsibility of assisting in maintaining law and order. As far as I know, several points can be listed again.

The towns and villages in the suburbs vary in size. The outskirts of the towns are the villages. If the security of the villages is guaranteed, the towns can rest easy. Therefore, if a defense corps is organized in the villages, it will be of great help to the overall local security. This is reason one why the Houwei Corps is necessary.

Today, when local autonomy is being implemented, local citizens should take responsibility and fulfill all local autonomous obligations. The defense corps can also be said to be a kind of autonomous work. This is reason two why the defense corps is necessary.

In the event of international military aggression, in order to enable the country to resist foreign aggression, we must pay attention to the military education of the people. The defense corps is also a kind of military education. This is reason three why the defense corps is necessary.

Most of the members of the defense corps are enthusiastic local youths who care about their hometowns and are willing to give up some precious time to serve the local area. Because the members have a sense of local identity, they often do not hesitate to risk their lives in the event of bandit incidents and are able to fulfill their responsibilities. This is reason four why the defense corps is necessary.

Based on the above four reasons, the status of the suburban defense corps is much more important than that of the military and police. Since the establishment of the defense corps, bandits have gradually disappeared, which cannot be said to be not due to the efforts of the defense corps. If there are still shortcomings in the system of the defense corps, it should be gradually improved.

### Harm Ala to Death, Cry to Death

— Jiang Zhongyi

After reading Mr. De Ping's "Look at Your Poverty," I couldn't help but associate it with the Jai Alai and the racecourse.

The Western name of Jai Alai is HAI-A-LAI, which, according to common sense, means "harm Ala"! Although this kind of gambling has been banned, it does not seem wise to set up an "atomic dance hall" on the original site!

As for the Western name of the racecourse, RACE COURSE, the transliteration should be "Lai Si - Ku Si" (Come to Death - Cry to Death)! Here, we sincerely hope that the authorities will realize the plan to rebuild the racecourse into a park as soon as possible, so that a "tearful" place can be turned into a paradise that provides fresh air for the citizens!

### The Art of Advertising

— Yang Mou

Open the newspaper, and it is full of advertisements; the walls on the road are full of advertisements; on the screen, there are also advertisements; even in your house, sometimes there are green-clothed messengers who send a few advertising letters.

The art of advertising, in a word, is to be attractive and touch your heart.

The medium of advertising can, of course, allow the good to win and the bad to lose, so that good products can be promoted and outdated products can be reduced. However, because too much attention is paid to the promotion of advertising, the improvement of the essence is sometimes neglected, and advertising becomes exaggerated. The line between advertising and deception is as difficult to distinguish as the line between accurate reporting and distorted propaganda. Discerning people naturally understand.

When a new product is launched, people are afraid that others will not know about it, so they desperately post advertisements. When there is a big sale, people are also afraid that others will not know about it, so they desperately post advertisements. The types of advertisements are becoming more and more numerous, and the competition is becoming more and more intense. Sometimes, they wear a solemn and inviolable declaration; sometimes, they wear a humorous joke to attract your curiosity. Sometimes, they use low prices to attract you, such as, "American suits for 5,000 yuan." In fact, when you go there, the so-called 5,000 yuan suits are just broken and dirty clothes thrown in the corner of the room. Sometimes, they use high-quality goods to attract you, such as, "Genuine American DDT." In fact, who knows what kind of medicine is sold in the gourd?

If all the advertisements are fictional lies, then the designer of this advertisement must be the most clumsy guy. Advertising must not lose its truth, but it must also attract people. That is a clever technique. I remember that there used to be a toothpaste whose advertisement was "Has a Su Su sound." People tried it, and it was indeed true, but whether this toothpaste is good or not, whether it is worth it or not, it is up to the user to fill in the answer. This is a good way.

Self-praising acknowledgments, boasting, and introductions, in addition to deceiving people from the countryside, I am afraid that they will not have any effect at all! Who can be fooled by this kind of self-cleverness?

If you say that advertising has no use at all, then of course no one will believe this sentence. But saying that advertising is absolutely reliable is not necessarily true. The main thing is the quality of the essence; the surprising victory on the advertisement can achieve complete success, but it can never make up for your deficiencies.

### Changing Hearts

— Zuo Zhi

The so-called "people's hearts are not as good as in ancient times" is not necessarily the view of the stubborn faction. These days, people's "hearts" are indeed getting farther and farther away from the "ancient way." Although they are full of "benevolence, righteousness, and morality," they are secretly doing things that are "men stealing and women prostituting." What is hung up is the "sheep's head," but what is sold is "dog meat." It is said that people have received gold bars, foreign houses, and cars in addition to receiving "public property." When they came, their hands were empty, and when they left, they returned full of loads. These people fully exposed their "black hearts" and "cruel hearts."

Recently, Soviet scientist Dr. Xinni Han experimented with "heart transplant surgery," and it is said that he has achieved preliminary success. He removed the diseased heart of a frog and transplanted a healthy heart into it. The frog lived as usual, just like before. Xin also did experiments on cats, dogs, and rabbits, and the results were also satisfactory. Therefore, it is quite possible to replace the diseased heart of a human being with a healthy heart. After this matter is successful, the "heart disease" that poses a great threat to human life will no longer be a concern. In this way, a large part of mankind is indeed "saved."

However, I think that the "black hearts" and "cruel hearts" of the world's jackals and cunning dogs who seize and plunder should be "changed" first. I think that only in this way will mankind be truly "saved."

### Don't Abuse Vitamins - Too Much is as Bad as Too Little

— Yang Yongzhang

In recent years, the Chinese people's knowledge of vitamins has gradually become richer, especially those wealthy people who live in big cities, who pay more attention to vitamins, thinking that all health and happiness seem to be buried in vitamins. Smart businessmen are, after all, good at making money. They understand the principles of economics and can cater to the wrong psychology of many people, so vitamin pills and injections have emerged at the right time. People are blindly abusing vitamins with their eyes closed. They simply do not understand the nature and efficacy of vitamins (of course, referring to the simplest ones), and only know how to blindly take pills and injections.

I do not deny the value of vitamins. Take vitamin A, for example. It can indeed help development, increase nutrition, and prevent xerophthalmia, night blindness, and other infectious diseases. Lack of vitamin A can cause the above-mentioned diseases, and children are also prone to rashes, scarlet fever, and other diseases due to reduced resistance. Human cells atrophy and die due to vitamin deficiency, and many neurodegenerative diseases are also related to vitamin A.

The amount of vitamin A required by the human body per day is about 4,000-8,000 international units, but we do not need to take pure vitamins separately (when we are not sick) because we have already obtained sufficient amounts in meat, fish, and vegetables. The liver in the body can indeed store a large amount of vitamin A, but there are certain limits. Too much vitamin cannot be stored in the body. After being absorbed by the digestive organs, it must be excreted from the body in the urine through the kidneys. This is of no benefit to the body.

Vitamin A is like this, and so are other vitamins such as A, B, C, D, E, F, I... etc. We must never abuse vitamins and neglect other self-cultivation. Many people swallow vitamin pills and injections, and then do not take good care of their bodies, thinking that vitamins can "eliminate all diseases" and "prolong life." This is harmful to vitamins.

Medical advances have confirmed that "hypervitaminosis" is as harmful to the body as deficiency. This is as terrible as poisoning by other drugs. For example, vitamin D, everyone knows that lack of it can cause rickets, but taking large amounts can lead to joint stiffness, vascular hardening, and kidney stones, which can be life-threatening.

I hope that everyone can use vitamins reasonably, neither "insufficient" nor "excessive," and absolutely not abuse vitamins. Many advertisements are often far from the actual effects in medicine, because pharmaceutical businessmen exaggerate and spread rumors for the sake of many people's wrong psychology. Some products do not meet the standards in terms of "quality" and "quantity," which really damages the reputation and belief in vitamins.

Finally, please read the title a few more times, otherwise I am afraid I will have to write another article "Don't be afraid to use vitamins."

### A Small Appeal

— Yi Ying

On the base of walls near government offices, one often finds phrases like "No urination allowed, violators will be arrested." However, those who need to urinate seem to specifically seek out these places to relieve themselves; this unwittingly creates the effect of "Here lies three hundred taels of silver."

I recall that in the past, during the time when the areas were called concessions, each police station was required to dispatch several so-called "Hong Kong cars" daily to patrol the streets, and when they encountered someone "urinating anywhere," they would impolitely invite you to experience the flavor of a jail cell for four hours, or fine you one silver dollar. However, now that the concessions have been reclaimed and municipal affairs are being managed by ourselves, the issue of "urinating anywhere" has never been addressed by the health authorities.

As reported in the newspapers: Cases of epidemic cholera have repeatedly been discovered in this city. A group of doctors and nurses from public hospitals are forcefully injecting passersby with preventative shots at major intersections. I believe this is merely a superficial solution. The only thorough and fundamental cure is to prevent the generation of cholera bacteria. This leads me to believe that the first thing that needs to be done is to immediately "prohibit urination in public places"!

News Snippets

### Feng Yuxiang's New Poem: "Apology to the Water"

General Feng Yuxiang, who is about to go abroad to study hydraulic engineering, wrote a "new poem" titled "Apology to the Water" on the banks of the Jialing River before his departure. The original text is as follows: "The rolling Yangtze River flows eastward day and night, its uses are boundless, but we do not use it fully. Buoyancy can carry ships, but there are no ships sailing on the river; seven hundred *li* a day, but only one boat can be seen. Lateral force can irrigate, but there is no water in the fields; relying on heaven for food, we have bad harvests every year. Torque can generate electricity, but no dams have been built; few people live along the river, and production is backward. None of the three forces are used, are we ignorant of the water? In this new world, we must catch up."

The Ping Municipality publicly burned smoking paraphernalia confiscated during a crackdown on opium on June 3rd at Dongda University. The opium pipes that were burned were all extremely valuable, including several recently seized from a private residence that were used by the late Empress Dowager Cixi. These items were all engraved with the Empress Dowager's inscription: "Grasping the universe, viewing the sun and moon."

It is rumored in Nanjing that the line "Holding a steel knife, ninety-nine, killing the Hu people before stopping" from the Shao Bing Song (Cookie Song Prophecy) is being used to create an illustration: Ninety-nine is one less than one hundred, "hundred" minus one becomes "white," so when Bai Lexi arrives in the Northeast, Siping Street and Changchun will be recovered.

Before General Dai Li's accident, it is said that a very ominous sign occurred: the roof of "Shu Lou," the Chongqing office building of his bureau, was swept away by a gust of wind.

After Xu Enzeng was released, he peacefully entered the production industry, running a farm in Xiangdong and a Sino-American machinery factory in Nanjing, both on a large scale. His wife, Ms. Gu Xia, is also very enthusiastic about this, running her own weaving factory. Husband runs the farm, wife weaves, no longer concerning themselves with other people's affairs.

Gleanings of Trifles

### Overturning the Arrogance of the "Toilet Lords" - Over Ten Thousand Yuan Per Night Soil Bucket

— Wuling Ren

There is talk that the British Tramways will extend service hours to 11 PM. Upon hearing this news, I not only do not feel excited, but rather feel more sentimental, because if I am "going to commit offenses" for pleasure, then after 8 o'clock at night, I must hurriedly take the tram to the newspaper office. Even if the tram service hours are extended, it still does not allow me to "cuddle" at home for a moment longer.

The health authorities stipulate that the average household should pay 1,000 yuan per month for the removal of ordinary night soil buckets, and 3,000 yuan per month if washing is also required. If there is an overcharge, it can be reported to the sanitation department for strict handling. In reality, as far as I know, the price for each night soil bucket to be emptied and washed is mostly already around 10,000 yuan. However, to avoid trouble, which family would be willing to come forward and report it? Thus, the burden on residents increases daily, and the arrogance of the "night soil lords" grows more and more rampant. This is the same as the difficulty the authorities have in getting citizens to report those who are selling gold bars for houses; citizens only seek to have a place to live, and if the price of the gold bars is within their reach, they are unwilling to report it. The Chinese lack a bold spirit, lack a spirit of sacrifice, and are constantly appeasing. This is extremely dangerous; historically, many events of losing rights and humiliating the nation have been brought about by "appeasement."

Dancing has been banned in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Qingdao, and the ban is rigorously enforced. But when the news arrived, Chongqing, the mountain city, not only maintained the status quo for all dance halls, but organizations such as the Sino-American Cultural Association also increased the number of open-air dance halls, and business is booming. Upon hearing this, Wuling Ren felt injustice on behalf of the dance girls in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places. Only now, after seeing the report that the Chongqing municipal authorities are also discussing a ban on dancing, am I finally relieved.

The Tianjin News reported that Mayor Zhang Tingyu, upon receiving reports that personnel from various bureaus and offices under his jurisdiction had unauthorizedly occupied enemy property and even had relatives and friends occupy it under their names, renting out a portion for profit, was very angry and has dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate and is determined to severely punish them. Shanghai has not had similar news appear in the newspapers in the past, but hopefully it will not happen in the future either.

Feeling on the Dragon Boat Festival

The great rivers and mountains, the sentimental past, the departing person can feel sorrow everywhere. Green calamus and red pomegranates, enchantingly another Dragon Boat Festival. War fires are everywhere, the return path is cut off, drifting in exile, suffering alone in a foreign land. Hateful and grand, a hundred feelings before me, the future is uncertain.

For eight years, I endured bitterness and hardship, hoping for the golden crow to mend the sky, and the land to return to its former glory. All kinds of leisure and hope should follow the fleeting waters of the sea. Who would have expected more turbulent times, endless storms, and only desolation. Reason wants to return, yet it's a world away, waters and mountains are distant.

### General Review of Shanghai Spoken Drama (1)

— Guan Yu

Since arriving in Shanghai, I have seen almost ten spoken dramas. The performances vary greatly in quality. In some, the director's success surpasses that of the actors, while in others, the actors' skills surpass the director's. And there are even some where the script overshadows everything, making the director and actors lose all their brilliance. I would like to make a general review of these ten spoken dramas.

1.  "Begonia"

I have only seen this play twice. The first time, I went to see Shi Hui's performance out of admiration. Since I was just going to appreciate an actor's acting skills, I was very satisfied and left the theater after watching the play. The second time I went to see it, I was very surprised. Because I realized that the director of "Begonia" did not seriously take on his responsibility; perhaps the director adopted a laissez-faire system. As a result, the actors' capture of the character's image and the development of their acting skills were quite inconsistent. The biggest contrast was between Ding Shan, who played Ji Zhaoxiong, and Shi Hui, who played Begonia. Their acting styles did not follow the same path but were opposite to each other. Ding Shan's portrayal of Ji Zhaoxiong was entirely external, exaggerating his movements, expressions, and gestures, even emphasizing them. For example, in the second scene of the second act, he pointed to the door in the interior and said to Luo Xiangqi, "Begonia is in this room." When he spoke, he struck a bow-like pose, pointing at the door with his finger and looking at Luo Xiangqi on the right, for half a minute. This stage picture seemed very unrealistic! There were several scenes like this with unnatural "poses."

Shi Hui's portrayal of Begonia in the fourth and fifth acts was the most touching. Because he faithfully created a character. He was able to convey to the audience the shift in emotions and the change of thoughts in a moment with subtle pauses. He did not have any special movements or gestures, but he had a wealth of inner emotions. Because he knew that only inner emotions could deeply touch the audience's heartstrings. At the same time, he was able to meticulously use his own conditions to create a perfect image, and use this image—a slightly hunched body, walking slowly, a low and resonant and heavy voice containing a lot of suffering—to touch every audience's memories of his youth. His approach was entirely based on inner feelings. So he was able to perform it so vividly! So real! It can be said that he has a good cultivation and a deep observation of life, so he can always control his emotions and reproduce a real character on the stage.

The director did not unify the acting skills of the actors in this play. Therefore, he did not make the performance of this play complete. It's a pity!

2.  "Hard Work"

The actors' acting skills in this play were much more uniform. Their starting point for dealing with the characters was exactly the same, and all that was left was the difference in the actors' own acting skills. In this play, the most flawless performance was by Zhang Fa of the She Qi Society. He did not have any special actions or gestures that would make the audience like him to show off his skills, but he acted very plainly until the end. But he was able to reveal a perfect character. These are things that a low-level actor cannot understand. The director's responsibility in this play cannot be said to be small, but he did not achieve the highest goal. He just made the play active on the stage. Therefore, the performance of this play felt quite plain.

Especially, the theme of this play was overshadowed by the love scenes, giving it a sense of being secondary.

3.  "Jin Xiaoyu"

Its theme is to expose the extravagance, corruption, and cruelty of the old warlords and corrupt bureaucrats. The director made this play very complete on the stage.

Among the actors, Danny and Shi Hui's acting skills were the most perfect. Danny played the red-light district singer Jin Xiaoyu. She made Jin Xiaoyu's character more obvious, and made Jin Xiaoyu's sincere love for Fan Yongli more undisguised. In the last act, when Wang Shiyi forced her and forcibly touched her hair several times, she was obedient on the surface, but she harbored a strong resistance in her heart. Finally, after Fan Yongli was shot and carried in, she thought he had fainted, but when she poured wine for him, she realized he was really dead! Danny was able to express the emotions in these two scenes very clearly; making the former show the anger hidden inside and obedience on the outside, while also trying to take the opportunity to stab the other party to death. And the latter's panic after killing Wang Shiyi, the joy when she saw Fan Yongli being carried in, and wanting to escape quickly. Once she discovered that the other party was dead, she was completely disheartened and sacrificed herself for love; these emotional expressions were fully introduced to the audience without any reservation. Such a well-cultivated actress has not been found in Shanghai's stage until now! However, her external appearance and voice could not help her reach the perfect realm, which is a pity!

Shi Hui played the old warlord Wang Shiyi in this play, and he was able to express the obsequiousness to those above him and the yelling orders to those below him, and the threats and inducements to the revolutionary patriots. Cui Chaoming, who played Fan Yongli, was also able to portray a character who sacrificed himself for righteousness.

The allocation of actors, the characters they played, and the starting point of their acting skills were very uniform in this play. The director's handling of the play was also very appropriate. For example, when the seventh wife came in during the second act, until she went in to drink, the director clearly let her sit on the chair by the round table. On her right were the three wives, and on her left were the older men, making the whole audience pay attention to her alone. At the same time, the stage surface also had levels and was very beautiful.

Among the three performances of the Hard Work Theater Troupe, the artistic level of "Jin Xiaoyu" was the highest! No matter which part of the script, director, actors, or set design you look at, it can surpass the artistic level of the previous two performances! At the same time, it is more complete and better than the previous two performances. Because theatrical art is a comprehensive art, the most valuable thing is the completeness of the performance, the cooperation of various departments, and the unity of acting skills, which should be determined by whether the director is responsible or not. Because the director is responsible for guiding the actors' movements. The director is a mirror in the actors' acting skills, and should tell the actors the results of the reflection, so that the actors know where their problems are, and then start to modify them, so that their acting skills have the same starting point. If the actors can embrace the attitude that "life is short, but art is eternal" and seriously complete a work of art without adding any small gimmicks, then this performance will definitely be complete! It will definitely be successful!

### Answering Questions About Han Lan'gen's Role in the Play

— Wu Yonggang

The Jing and Wei rivers flow separately. Clear and turbid are distinct, like different utensils, fragrance and stench are different. Those who are loyal are praised, and those who are treacherous are demoted. This is the heavenly principle and righteous path for maintaining the national spirit. Although Yonggang is not smart, he also understands this principle. Therefore, when writing the script for "The House of Loyalty and Righteousness" in the newspaper, he was very critical of the loyal and treacherous residents who stayed on the isolated island during the past eight years, and especially attacked the traitors in the play who colluded with the enemy and puppets, amassed wealth through hoarding, and shamelessly touted themselves as underground workers after the victory, so as to make the audience gain a clear impression, knowing that loyalty and treachery must be distinguished, the loyal should be followed, and the treacherous should be hated. This was Yonggang's original intention when writing. Yonggang has never been one to flatter or show off. Recently, because he used Han Lan'gen to play the role of a "New Shen Bao" news vendor who acted as a tiger's pawn during the occupied period, newspapers have criticized him, and friends have questioned him. Yonggang, in addition to feeling ashamed, will tell the motives and process of that time one by one:

During the occupied period in Shanghai, residents were forced to subscribe to newspapers, such as the "New Shen Bao" and other puppet newspapers. Shanghai residents have personally suffered this. After Yonggang returned to Shanghai, his family also mentioned it. Therefore, he immediately adopted it into the plot, describing a patriotic resident who was beaten almost to death by a Japanese ruffian with a badge of the enemy reporting department for refusing to read the puppet newspaper. At that time, the residents dared to be angry but did not dare to resist. When the enemy announced its surrender, the news vendor was captured by the residents. Some believed that the traitor should be punished by the government. The residents felt that the government might not have time to care about such clowns, so they retaliated tooth for tooth and punished him severely. Yonggang felt that Han Lan'gen's clownish face was quite similar to this kind of character, so he used him to play this role.

Inviting Han Lan'gen to play this role was Yonggang's personal decision and did not accept any orders or instructions from anyone. Therefore, Yonggang should be personally responsible for this matter.

If it is said that the initial motive was to use Han Lan'gen's low-level gimmick to cater to the audience's low-level tastes, then Yonggang does not belittle himself, and dares to say that "The House of Loyalty and Righteousness" has its own value, and it is not necessary to seek to increase the film's business value with low-level tastes.

If it is said that Yonggang, due to his personal relationship with Han Lan'gen, intentionally protects him and seeks to get away with it, then ask what kind of character the role in the play is, and what kind of impression it will produce on the audience. Furthermore, even if Yonggang has this intention, will the public's right to report and restrain it be lost because of it? Yonggang, though foolish, is not so clumsy as to take such a great risk. If it comes to personal relationships, why would Yonggang favor Han Lan'gen alone, and fall into disloyalty and unrighteousness?

Before the film started shooting, Yonggang, for the sake of gathering ideas, planned to invite advanced figures from the Shanghai press and cultural circles to test the film after it was completed, so that there would be nothing inappropriate before it was released to the audience. Now, I would like to reiterate the previous proposal. I believe that all of you will not hesitate to offer your valuable opinions at that time. If you all believe that this plot has a bad influence on the audience, then Yonggang will not hesitate to cut it out and pay the price.

Yonggang can admit that this matter was not carefully considered beforehand. If there is any intention to seek personal gain, please file a report, and Yonggang is willing to be charged with aiding the enemy. Knowing me and condemning me, there will be public opinion.

Newspapers have criticized me, and friends have questioned me, all for the sake of protecting the poor domestic film industry. Therefore, in addition to feeling ashamed, I would like to express my sincere gratitude.

Film Criticism

### The Servant Girl

— Zhu Xi

The smoothness of the shots is entirely due to the director's rich experience, and the interweaving of the fish-eating scene may require modification for the screenwriter.

Deanna Durbin is a starlet from Hollywood's pre-war period who is undergoing transformation. She not only maintains her leading status, but she also makes more films each year than most stars. Her youth, beauty, and singing ability play a big role in this. She is the opposite of Shirley Temple.

"The Servant Girl" is one of her successful films. Her acting has improved a lot, and most of the credit goes to the director. It is said that after the success of this film, she has another film with Franchot Tone, "Because of You," which has already been filmed. It is a colored film, and Deanna's first colored film is a double attraction.

Let's talk about the script of this film.

"The Servant Girl" is a comedic play of changing identities, containing the theme that "class can only exist under normal circumstances." When the male lead Franchot is not allowed to enter the "Gentlemen's Tea Party," he can only anxiously impersonate his cousin who is a maid, which explains the theme very clearly. At the same time, in this scene, we also feel that although a person is usually a "Gentleman," in another role, they are all "Masters." Dressed in formal attire, they are still served by others. The disparity in class can only be distinguished during work hours. By the time of entertainment after work, everyone should be equal. This way of writing the theme is the most difficult and the most valuable, because it does not shout slogans, preach, or teach the audience. It contains a profound meaning in the midst of laughter, and the audience only realizes that this theme exists after recalling it after watching the play.

The construction of the story is a series of misunderstandings. In the beginning, Deanna mistakenly identifies a salesperson as the great composer Franchot in the car. Then, she mistakenly believes that her brother Parker is a millionaire, and each time gives her money is 1,000 yuan (the explanation is also very good, Parker says that his 1,000 yuan came from gambling on horse racing). Later, Franchot mistakenly believes that she is a new servant. Bubble mistakenly takes an elevator one floor higher and meets Deanna. Deanna sings, and Franchot mistakenly believes that it is a radio broadcast. Finally, the whole play ends with a misunderstanding of the love between Deanna and Franchot.

These few misunderstandings are well placed and have the ability to stimulate the development of the play. After watching the play, these few misunderstanding scenes are also the easiest for you to remember. The entire story of the play is based on this chain of "misunderstandings." Originally, "misunderstanding" is also a very good method in the constituent factors of drama, especially in comedy, slightly deviating from logic is not a big deal.

It is only that the love misunderstanding created by Parker before Franchot at the end seems to use too much weight compared to the previous ones, which is not very consistent with the whole play, and affects Parker's personality a lot. If you want the story to develop like this, it seems that a process is missing before this misunderstanding.

Among the character descriptions, Parker is the most unsuccessful. The first half and the second half seem like two different people. According to the transformation equation of his personality, it seems that he is still missing a little "small person feeling." After watching this film, it seems that Parker Aubryn is not as good as our Shi Hui.

The male and female leads are successful. For example, in the scene where the two first meet, Deanna is lying under the piano using an electric mop, and the squeaking sound stings Franchot's ears. He is a musician, and is particularly sensitive to sound. This is a delicate depiction.

Also, those five men who pursue Deanna, the screenwriters have also put in a lot of effort for the word "five." In the first scene on the street, five people seem no different from four or six people. The second time in the kitchen is also the same. It seems that five people is the most. If you press the doorbell again, it's simply annoying. However, in the end, when Deanna reports Bubble when she is singing, the five people line up to pass the message, which fully shows that five people are not too many and not too few. It's more exciting than four people and more economical than six people, so I express my full support for this "five."

In the entire script production, in addition to the fact that Parker's personality is not clear as mentioned above, there is still a point that seems to be worth discussing:

A maid is inserted in the play who loves to eat fish. All those who love to eat fish are her best friends. It's wonderful, wonderful, and even more wonderful that her master Franchot doesn't eat fish. This is a very good and novel dramatic material, but in the end, Franchot didn't make full use of this dramatic material in the scene at the "Gentlemen's Association," which is a pity.

The original procedure in the play is as follows:

(1) Franchot is successively rejected by Parker and the theater troupe owner from participating in the tea party, and the waiter wants to wave him away.

(2) He begs bitterly, recognizing his maid as his cousin.

(3) The maid agrees, he is happy, and dances with her.

(4) He says to the maid, from now on he will eat the fish she cooks.

(5) The maid laughs.

In these five points, I think the foreshadowing of "loving to eat fish the most and hating to eat fish the most" in the previous section is not used well enough or exaggerated enough. Drama needs some exaggeration, especially according to the previous development of the play. I suggest changing it as follows:

(1) The original method is retained.

(2) Same as before.

(3) The waiter leads Franchot to the maid, who is eating her fish greedily.

(4) The maid agrees, Franchot is overjoyed, sits down, and the waiter asks him what he wants to eat. He says, "Fish!"

(5) The maid laughs, and they both laugh.

As for dancing, it can still be used, embedded between (3) or placed after (5). If you want to shoot a special shot of Franchot eating fish, you can, and it's better than just saying one sentence now.

### A Discourse on Stage Technology: The Feeling of Color

— Wenquan

1. The Reception and Feeling of Color by the Human Eye

The structure of the human eye is generally like a camera, with extremely delicate organization. The retina, which receives color, originally belonged to a part of the brain, but later, due to development, gradually moved away from the center. The thickness of this membrane is only as thin as a piece of paper, and under a high-powered microscope, it can be divided into ten layers. The ninth layer contains parallel cylindrical and conical cells, which are extremely important for the reception of color by the human eye. The ends of the cylindrical cells are fibers that reach the seventh layer. The conical cells are even thinner and longer, also reaching the seventh layer, but their number is smaller, only about a quarter of that of the cylindrical cells. The distribution on the retinal surface is such that the layer becomes gradually thinner in the fovea, the central depression of the macula, with only conical cells remaining. Outside the macula, the number of cylindrical cells gradually increases again. According to Mark Liss's research, conical cells are capable of both sensing light and color, while cylindrical cells can only distinguish between the brightness and darkness of light. People who suffer from night blindness usually have abnormalities in their cylindrical cells. Those with night vision in the dark must have structurally different cylindrical cells.

The human eye's sensitivity to light does not result solely from the stimulation of light on the two kinds of membranes. A feeling occurs only when this stimulation reaches the nerve center. These two nerves, in addition to the basic colors of red, yellow, and blue, transmit the color. After receiving the color, the light and dark nerves then inform the hue. This information is transferred to the nerve center, and then the brain knows the color. Therefore, even without external light stimulation, as long as the cells are stimulated and the message is transmitted to the center, one can perceive light and color. Thus, in a dark room, if one cuts the nerves with a knife or passes an electric current, one seems to see flashes of electricity and brilliant green light. Furthermore, even when a person closes their eyes, although there is no external stimulus, internal blood flow, breathing, or stimuli from mental thoughts and fantasies can also cause the eyes to see something.

The color sense and health of the nerves can be demonstrated by example. If a person's eye is struck by a fist, the light and dark nerves will immediately be injured, and the three color-receiving nerves will be disturbed by the impact. Thus, the person will feel a dark haze, and golden sparks will fly before their eyes. These golden sparks will contain fine dots of red, green, and yellow. Furthermore, if a person stares at the sun for a long time, the light and dark nerves and the color-receiving nerves will be fatigued by the intense sunlight. When the person turns to a dark place, they will initially feel a dark haze and golden sparks flying. After a short rest, the red color-receiving nerves will recover, and a red light will appear before their eyes. Later, the green color-receiving nerves will recover, and a green light will appear before their eyes. After that, the yellow color-receiving nerves will recover, and a yellow light will appear before their eyes. From these two examples, it can be seen that cylindrical cells are weaker than conical cells, and that among the three color-receiving nerves, the yellow one is the weakest. Therefore, colorblind people are often blind to yellow, with green being the next most common, and red being the least common.

Colors, due to their different brightness, different hues, different natures, and various historical, cultural, and religious associations, can evoke different emotions in the human eye. These different emotions are the very life of color's existence on the stage. A stage designer who lacks this grasp and knowledge, no matter how clever, is bound to fail.

2. The Warmth and Coolness of Colors

The feeling of warmth and coolness in colors does not differentiate between light and dyes. This knowledge for a designer is as fundamental as knowing the alphabet is for a learner of English. With this basic understanding, one can proceed appropriately and avoid errors. Generally, red, orange, and yellow, which are at the upper part of the light spectrum, are warm colors, while blue and indigo, which are at the lower part of the light spectrum, are cool colors. Green, the intermediate color between yellow and indigo, and purple, the intermediate color between red and indigo, are neutral colors. The feeling of warmth and coolness for each color is described in detail below:

1. Red: The warmest of the warm colors; it can evoke feelings of passion, joy, annoyance, and confinement.

2. Yellow: A warm color; it can evoke feelings of warmth, happiness, brightness, joyfulness, solemnity, nobility, and gentleness, and gives people a sense of spaciousness.

3. Blue: The coolest of the cool colors; it can give people a sense of solemnity, gloom, hardness, and confinement.

4. Indigo: A cool color; it can give people a sense of depth, loneliness, and vastness.

5. Green: A neutral color; it can give people a sense of pleasure, leisure, and new life.

6. Purple: A neutral color; it can give people a sense of warmth, splendor, and beauty.

7. White: A cool color; it can evoke feelings of purity, simplicity, winter cold, and expansiveness.

8. Black: A cool color; it can evoke feelings of mystery, terror, despair, sorrow, confinement, infinity, and night.

9. Gray: A cool color; it can evoke feelings of desolation, gloom, coldness, sorrow, worry, quietness, and solemnity. (To be continued)

### Cheng Yanqiu to Return to the Stage Soon

— Feng Chang

We recently heard that Cheng Yanqiu will perform "Spring Boudoir Dream" again. It is said that he will also co-star with Mei Lanfang and Ma Lianliang in "The Fourth and Fifth in the Cave" and "Wang Baochuan." We also heard that he will perform several commercial shows at the China Grand Theatre. Rumors are rumors, and facts are facts. Of course, these upcoming shows need to be performed to be confirmed. However, before the performance, this is good news for our theater fans.

Some people say that if Cheng Yanqiu officially takes the stage, won't he be competing with Mei Lanfang? I say that competition may occur, but it won't be fierce. Because Mei Lanfang has his audience, and the only connection with Cheng Yanqiu is a small part of it. Moreover, Cheng Yanqiu will take the stage after Mei Lanfang's term is up. Even if there is a chance of them meeting, Mei Lanfang's performances will only be occasional benefit performances, so this competition will not be exciting.

As for the competition with Ma Lianliang, that may very well happen, but this time he is likely to have the upper hand because his performing location will probably be China Grand Theatre, while Ma Lianliang's will be Tianchan Theatre. The voices of the old singers inevitably change. Mei Lanfang is a clear example of this. Although Cheng Yanqiu will have a similar situation, he is in a slightly better position because he can sing more Cheng-style tunes. In his performance of "Spring Boudoir Dream," there is often a sudden drop in voice, almost silent, before abruptly turning into a high pitch. While beautifully called "high and low inflections," it is, in fact, a painstaking effort to conceal his age!

Film and Theater News

1. "The New Official Takes Office" to be Staged Soon

"The New Official Takes Office" was previously titled "The Devil's Den" and "Demons Dancing." The story depicts an empty city after our army withdrew, to which the enemy sent a large number of traitors to govern. These traitors include rogues, butchers, old-fashioned teachers, and servants from Japanese homes. Everyone is vying to be the bureau chief and magistrate, like a pack of dogs fighting over a bone. On the other hand, the guerrillas are active, and finally, they attack the city, killing all the traitors.

Now, this play is directed by Tao Jin, starring Zhang Shouping, Zong You, Fang Bo, and others, and is scheduled to be staged at the Lyceum Theatre on the tenth. This play portrays the shameless and obsequious behavior of the traitors to the enemy. It was once banned, but now it can be performed in Shanghai, which is truly a feast for the eyes of the people of Shanghai.

2. "Dream of the Red Chamber" to be Staged on the Ninth

Zhu Tong's "Dream of the Red Chamber" will be staged at the Hua Da Theatre on the ninth. The play depicts the section of "Dream of the Red Chamber" about Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu, which is entirely a story of private affairs between children. It is directed by Wu Zuguang, and the actors are all female. The costumes and decorations are all antique and have a unique charm.

3. Gallery of Hollywood Beauties

When Australian beauty expert Mrs. Robi Stan visited the film capital, she individually interviewed the actresses and carefully observed and studied them. As a result, she believes that the ten most beautiful women in Hollywood are: (1) Joan Gardner, (2) Claudette Colbert, (3) Norma Shearer, (4) Loretta Young, (5) Hedy Lamarr, (6) Barbara Stanwyck, (7) Irene Dunne, (8) Sweet Pandale, (9) Carole Lombard, (10) Dorothy Lamour. Since Carole Lombard has passed away, no one can make a follow up opinion. Mrs. Robi's beauty standards are extremely strict and do not solely focus on appearance. Character, posture, and speech all play extremely important roles, just as General MacArthur is recognized as the most beautiful man in America.

4. The Stage Becomes a Battlefield

The "Loyal Family" of the China Electric Factory is nearing completion. In a scene where the enemy and puppets chase patriotic heroes, director Wu Yonggang, in order to achieve realism, used live ammunition for the machine guns. For a moment, it felt like facing a major enemy. Although photographic techniques were used to avoid danger, the actors were sweating profusely during the performance. After the scene was shot, a part of the factory wall had a memorable trace.

### On Social Organization (Continued)

— Fu Tongxian

Based on this analysis, we know that society is an organic entity that transcends the individual. This organic entity has only one common goal: a complete organization under unified leadership. The individual cells and organ departments within it are not simply the same. Each part assumes various different tasks separately, but they cooperate with each other to complete the same goal. Based on this principle, we can know that it is possible to organize a "United Nations" from the many existing countries, because we consider the welfare of all mankind above each country, and seek a common goal shared by all mankind. To complete this goal, each country may as well divide the labor. However, the reason why this "United Nations" cannot be produced now is because each country only takes care of its own interests and does not consider the welfare of the entire human race. Every country has its own goals, and the completion of each goal inevitably destroys the goals of other countries. The result is still war. When there is a lack of common goals between countries, the so-called "United Nations" is merely an external appearance, and at most is only a tool or smokescreen used by certain countries to achieve their own goals. Similarly, if there is no real common goal between several political parties and they forcibly unite the main figures of several parties in a mechanical way to form a government, such a government will also only have an external appearance, and at most can only enable certain factions to achieve their own goals. In other words, if each political party only represents the interests of a certain group of people and the union of each party does not have the interests of the entire nation and country as a common goal, the unified government they jointly organize is only seemingly united but in fact disunited, and can never achieve the goal of making the entire country bright and happy. If we want the various parties to achieve organic and close cooperation, so that each can do their best to organize a sound government, then they must give up the welfare of their own party or individual, and above the goals of the various parties, seek a grand goal of seeking the welfare of the entire nation and even the entire human race. This is a prerequisite.

Since society is a super-personal organic organization, what is the position of the individual in society? We said earlier that the individual is a necessary condition for society, and society is organized and succeeded by many individuals. In other words, the individual is the organizational factor of society. Now let us ask further whether the individual has freedom in the social organization? Many young people are shouting loudly, "We want freedom! We want thorough freedom! We want absolute freedom!" But we say that the individual does not have thorough freedom in social organization, let alone absolute freedom. Because although society is organized and succeeded by individuals, individuals are instead dominated by this organization. The reason is very simple. For example, a school is organized and succeeded by many teachers, students, and school workers, but the behavior of these teachers, students, school workers, and even the principal is controlled by various regulations in the school organization, and no one can act freely. For example, the principal has to go to the office every day, teachers have to teach according to the prescribed schedule, and students cannot attend or leave class at will. Everything is in compliance with the prescribed order. Whoever violates this order may lose his qualifications as an organizational factor in this organization, and he will suffer the exclusion or punishment of this order. For example, several people form a company together, but they cannot move freely within the company alone. But does this mean that the individual has no freedom in society at all? No! It is not without freedom. Everyone has his own will under the social and universal will, but this free will is in line with the universal will. In simple terms, the behavior of the individual is only free when it is in accordance with the social order. But is this social order consistent inside and outside, and unchanged from ancient times to the present? No! Social order in the existing world varies from time to time and from place to place. There is not just one society in this world, but many societies. Even in today's China, we are not yet a complete order, nor are we a unified country, because we can still experience several different social orders. There is freedom under this social order, and it is illegal under that social order. This proves that the social order that represents the welfare of the entire nation in China has not yet stabilized, and the people have not yet figured out how to cooperate with this social order to seek greater freedom. According to our imagination, this new social order should be a democratic China after the implementation of constitutional government.

How does this new social order arise? We can also say that this is the free development of individual will in the old social order. That is to say, in the old social order, a few seers and sages felt that life was unreasonable, and they saw a new order that could better represent the public welfare. So they rose up in revolution to realize a new social order. Then the activities of the individual are constrained under this new order. For example, Sun Yat-sen felt the oppression of autocracy and the unreasonableness of the old etiquette, so he wanted to establish a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. The progress of this work has not yet been completed. This new social order needs more people to work hard, and this pioneering work and individual efforts are the expression of individual free will. Therefore, we can conclude that under a certain society, the individual only has the freedom to act in accordance with this social order, otherwise, the freedom of the individual is to overthrow this society and organize a new order. However, this revolutionary freedom is also conditional. First, the revolutionary pioneers must be able to see the trend of greater development clearly; second, they must grasp the real needs of the times. The success of the revolution is built on the welfare of the entire nation and even the entire human race, and not on the emotions of a few people, let alone on the interests of a certain party or faction.

### Tamsui

— Shi Wanmei

——Dedicated to a friend——

I seem to have seen you before, in a dewy childhood, under a trellis with small purple flowers, we once frolicked together; but why? It wasn't until that autumn, when the northern geese flew south across the long sky, that you held my hand and said, "Why bother to have known each other before we met?" I nodded slightly, smiled, and said nothing, seeming to acknowledge that what you said was right; in the faint autumn sunshine, the bamboo fence was covered with red trumpet creeper flowers, and I wondered why they weren't purple?

That day's sun, even if it wasn't more brilliant than any other, was at least the most pleasing, in my memory. But I never told you this, when we sat by the stove and talked on cold, rainy winter evenings, when we scrambled to eat the cherries in the blue glass bowl on warm spring nights; during the plum rain season, when we strolled amidst the intermittent rain and sunshine, I didn't mention it, didn't mention it.

Why? Perhaps you understand better than I: "We are both too old. If we were children, or girls in middle school, we would never want to casually alienate a friend we liked. Sometimes, people are stingy with giving affection, often more so than with visible material..." You frankly admitted that you often wrote letters but didn't send them. So we are all afraid of being called "unrequited love"! Ah! I don't know, since when? Has indifference become prouder than warmth, alienation stronger than intimacy? How absurd, and how unreasonable.

I remember once, in a letter to you, I wrote the sentence, "I hate myself." Three days later, your reply came, no longer the usual few words, telegraphic brevity. This time, on pale lotus-colored stationery, you reprinted a passage from the diary of the English writer Katherine Mansfield: "A year ago we sat together by the fireplace, she and I, hand in hand, cheek to cheek, not talking, sometimes whispering. The room was dark, the firelight faint, and the sound of the rain outside was very loud. Her frail body was clothed in long black, and a string of amethyst beads was around her neck. Gradually, we felt very cold, so I dragged a blanket from the bed and draped it over us, smiling and saying, 'We are like children on a desert island.' She pulled up a corner of the rough blanket with one hand, and placed the other hand on my hand. We talked about fame, how we longed for it, how we should strive for it. We talked about our plans. I found a blank piece of paper, and we wrote a vow together, resolving to become famous within a year. We signed it, sealed it, and threw it into the fire, offering it to God. The flames blazed for a moment, and then quickly turned into a pile of ashes. Soon she fell asleep, and I covered her completely with the blanket, and gave her a pillow as well. So the long, cold night dragged on. I looked at her, my mind filled with thoughts and desires, but I couldn't fall asleep. Today, in another corner of the world, I am suffering, and she, without a doubt, has already bought a hat in the February market." I was moved to tears; tears flowed down my face. After the passage, there were your own words: "...From now on, I don't know on what day, I am worried that we will unexpectedly compete for a hat in some big market..." I told you, "If one day it really happens as you predict, then I will definitely give you that hat. I have long lost the confidence and courage to compete for hats, especially with you. Even for this letter, I will sacrifice the hat to you." We have had such back-and-forth daydreams, perhaps committing childish mistakes, but they were all sincere. How many sincere words in the world are not dreams, madness, or foolishness? Since we like to say them, and don't hate to hear them, why not just write them down?

I remember someone once said to me, "I used to have the pride of a solitary person, but now I only have the sorrow of a solitary person." What a foolish statement! Because the pride of a solitary person is only his sorrow, and his sorrow is also the pride of a solitary person. Are we proud? No, because we have no sorrow. In this vast sea of people, we still have many friends, and also one or two confidants. You said, "...In the twilight, in the misty rain of dusk, under the starry night, you are most likely to be remembered, because you belong to this world..." Isn't that right? When the scenes of warbling spring, wild geese at night, candlelight, and flute music, all the earth-shattering scenes are forgotten, all the stories of shared songs and tears are forgotten, only you, only you, the most distant yet closest friend, a sigh, as if hundreds of years ago? Or as if in a moment? A half-smile, in front of me, and also on the horizon? It is reality in romance, meaning in unconsciousness, it is the abolition of time, space, and environment... But, at the glittering banquets with fragrant clothes and swaying shadows, I have never thought of you, and you may not remember me either!?

Someone said, "One's life is friendship," so what is our friendship? A friendship of shared life and death is like an epic tragedy, a friend with whom one can talk and laugh and who has compatible languages is like a strong wine, because they are "a thousand cups too few"; but what about us? What is this vague, half-deep, half-shallow, distant yet close connection? It won't be dust? But it's definitely not a rose in the heart; it's a bit like a lightly sketched Chinese landscape painting. So I remembered a sentence: "The friendship between gentlemen is as light as water." I am not a gentleman, but I have boldly borrowed it; Tamsui, in the cup of life, may not be precious, but it is indispensable. Would you like to drink with me? I will use purple tulip flowers to replace the cup of life, and gently pour it and offer it to you.

### On Liu Shi's Paintings

— Shi Chongpeng

Su Dongpo once said, "To judge painting by likeness is to be seen as a neighbor to children." This view, which emphasizes spirituality while neglecting form, refers to the paintings of literati with a highly developed culture, and not all paintings should be criticized according to this standard. After all, painting is a form of pictorial art. The expression of spirituality and the vividness of charm are both entrusted to the image. That's why Xie He's Six Canons mentioned "Qi Yun Sheng Dong" (Spiritual Consonance, Life-Movement) and "Ying Wu Xiang Xing" (Structural Method, Bone-Strength) together. Zhang Zhao said, "Learn from creation outwardly, obtain the source of the heart inwardly." "Learn from creation" means faithfully depicting and seeking its image. "Obtain the source of the heart" means seeking the expression of spirituality within the image. Ni Yunlin's "Writing the untrammeled spirit in my breast" merely reinforces the importance of spirituality. After all, the image has an important place in painting.

The success of depicting the image to the fullest is achieved by using the combination of points, lines, and surfaces – what the Six Canons call "bone method using the brush." Whether it is landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, fish, or insects, they are all indispensable. Points, lines, and surfaces must not only be light and smooth, but also be profound and vigorous. Only then can various images be depicted with unparalleled fidelity and perfection. Seeking likeness through realistic depiction, and seeking wonder through brush and ink techniques, Han Gan of the Tang Dynasty once said to Emperor Xuanzong when painting horses, "Of the hundreds of thousands of imperial horses, all are my teachers." He could paint all kinds of shapes such as saddled horses, leaning, grazing, startled, stopped, running, and rising, in thousands of variations, as if they were alive. This is an example of reaching the realm of charm through realistic depiction.

Professor Liu Shi of the Art Academy is a talented artist who started with sculpture and devoted himself to Western painting. During the Anti-Japanese War, he endured hardships in the Great Rear Area and spent his artistic life amidst the smoke of gunpowder. In a difficult environment, he transformed his artistic style, using brush and rice paper to observe and experience real objects, depicting the beautiful postures of aquatic animals. Similar to Han Gan's painting of horses, he drew inspiration from the hundreds of thousands of imperial horses, successfully becoming a rare fish painter in the history of painting, vividly expressing the dynamic movements of various fish such as goldfish and carp on the canvas. He even transparently transferred the most fluid "water" into the painting, giving people the feeling of being on the banks of the Hao River. The maturity of this technique fully demonstrates his skill in the brushwork of points, lines, and surfaces. At the same time, it can also prove that he has advanced from the stage of "learning from creation" outwardly through the image to the stage of "obtaining the source of the heart" inwardly through the spirit!

Long Serial

### Two Birds on the Same Branch (49)

— Zhao Qingge

Because Boss Liao, although he has a good heart, has a bad temper! Boss Liao has the temper of a Sichuanese: a small annoyance is met with scolding; a big annoyance is met with beating. The Madam is fierce, but she is somewhat fearful of Boss Liao. Moving her mouth or hands, she is no match for Boss Liao, so her belly is full of grievances, which she can only vent on others. With Liao Dong not at home, it is the turn of the shop's assistants to be unlucky. From the pharmacist to the apprentices, each person inevitably gets nagged at by the Madam for some reason every day. Understanding the Madam's psychology, no one takes it to heart. In the Madam's eyes, these people are not even as good as pigs. She remembers that when she was in her maiden home, raising a pig only required feeding it, and after it was slaughtered, she could earn a large sum of money. But these people, not only do they have to be fed, but they also have to be paid wages, and she doesn't see any use for them? So, whenever she is upset, she shouts, "You group of things that are not even as good as pigs, you all deserve to be killed!" But the assistants would answer her, "We shouldn't be killed, Madam! Isn't that right? You haven't fattened us up! Look, whoever is fat, deserves to be killed!" The Madam suffered a loss! Knowing that they were mocking her for being fat and deserving to be killed; she was left like "a mute eating coptis chinensis" (unable to express her bitterness) and didn't utter another word! Her belly swelled up even more like a drum.

Boss Liao and Master Mo were originally close. Master Mo often went to "Huichuntang" to buy ginseng when he was alive, and was considered an old patron of "Huichuntang." Therefore, Boss Liao was particularly polite to Master Mo, and always charged him lower prices than others. Moreover, when Master Mo sometimes didn't have money, Boss Liao would just write it down as a debt. Later, when Master Mo fell ill, Madam Mo didn't pay the medical expenses, so Mo Sheng had to settle the account at "Huichuntang." It wasn't until Master Mo died that Madam Mo paid off the debt. This time, Bao Ling's coming to work at "Huichuntang" was also a coincidence. Bao Ling was looking for a job everywhere, and one day he heard Liao Dong say that their store needed a bookkeeper. Upon hearing this news, Bao Ling hurried to find Boss Liao in person, telling him that he could take on this position. Boss Liao initially didn't believe him, but seeing Bao Ling's repeated requests, he seriously agreed. They agreed on a salary of food and lodging, plus ten strings of cash for spending money. In his heart, he couldn't help but sigh, "I never thought that the descendants of imperial relatives would now be working as bookkeepers in a medicinal herb store."

After Bao Ling moved to "Huichuntang," he worked diligently and cautiously, and dealt with people carefully. During the day, he sat behind a small narrow table at the store counter all day long, recording every item of income and expenditure. Whenever he had a spare moment, he would study tirelessly. In the evening, he would summarize the accounts, and then hand them over to Boss Liao for review. After the amounts were checked, the day's work was considered to have come to an end. In addition, he helped Liao Dong with his studies. He taught Liao Dong all the books he had read, which benefited Liao Dong a lot, so Liao Dong respected him as a teacher! And he also felt great comfort, because this reduced his loneliness and the monotony of his work. In this family, apart from Liao Dong, he was willing to approach, others all caused him disgust! But he was not satisfied with Liao Dong's personality. He felt that Liao Dong was too young to be sentimental, which was not right! And he was as melancholy as a girl, keeping his grievances to himself, and often covering his face and crying! His small, sunken eyes were always red. This inevitably affected his health! He was thin, with a sallow complexion, and his brow never seemed to relax. The impression he gave was that he was melancholic and sickly! Therefore, Bao Ling often advised this young friend. He wanted to use his own strength and decisiveness to encourage Liao Dong and change him! His situation was no better than Liao Dong's, and he was confident that he had been through it all. He would teach Liao Dong to stand up first.

### Story on the Hillside

— Zhang Fengyu

This is a small hillside, behind a small town about a hundred li away from Chongqing. From it, one can see the Jialing River making a large bend and flowing slowly; one can also see the bamboo forests across the river, like a handful of grass, and the toy-like houses next to the bamboo forests, lightly placed on the delicate, brown land that resembles the skin of a maiden on the banks of the Nile.

Don't underestimate this hillside. As a silent witness, it also knows some – albeit small – stories!

It is spring, the season when rape flowers are planted on this hillside, and these rape flowers have already turned yellow; it is morning, the time when the clear wind carries the music and breath of spring. White gulls are flying over the river, snow-white gulls, so bright they are dazzling. Sunlight strikes their backs, as if about to burst into a long string of bright, silvery laughter. Spring scatters its captivating charm over everything. The rape flowers are bent over by their own weight, and in each of their golden flower hearts, musical spirits are soundly asleep, trembling slightly, waiting for the bees to fly over and wake them.

At this time, a tall and thin young man, wearing a long black cloak, slowly walks up the hillside. Except for his face and feet, his whole body is wrapped in this cloak, and because of the cloak's straight and mournful folds, he looks like a bird with its wings clipped. He stands still, casting his long and dark shadow on the hillside.

He stands there like a stone statue, with the background changing again and again: the light blue sky of the morning, the deep blue sky of noon, the sky of evening adorned with red clouds… only then does he slowly walk down the hillside.

Day after day... the spring breeze caresses his short, obviously newly grown hair, summer clouds set off his tall figure, autumn rain wets his black cloak, until the hillside is already planted with buckwheat, and this buckwheat has already sprinkled its pink little flowers all over the hillside.

On the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival in August, he stood there as usual, with his back to the road he came up, facing the river.

The autumn sky is high, and the clouds are light. The crimson setting sun is the center of all colors, and the autumn clouds change with it into countless brilliant colors. The river is also painted with a thick stroke of golden red, trembling in the evening wind along with the river's undulations. Gradually, the setting sun goes down, and the red clouds cool into a melancholy purple, sinking down, sinking down, sinking into the mountain peaks, sinking into the river. Behind the clouds, a little white something appears. That is the moon, but it is still distant and magical, like a drifting dream.

It should be – that young man – going back down the mountain, but he is still standing there, not moving.

The moon comes closer step by step, becoming clearer. The clouds have gradually faded, and the evening stars have opened their bright eyes. The blue of the night replaces the purple of the twilight. The cold current of moonlight pours down on the mountain peaks, pours down on the river, pours down on the buckwheat flowers; the mountain peaks are covered with frost, the river shimmers with silver, and the buckwheat flowers are like a blanket of white snow. The man immersed in this pale blue cold current shivers.

The young man turns around – how pale his face is in the moonlight – wanting to go back the way he came up. Suddenly, he stops, takes a step back, and encounters a young girl coming up from that road.

The young girl also stops. Her beautiful lips tremble, as if saying something. Finally, her voice is heard clearly – although very low:

"...You...it's you...I finally found you...three years...three years...except for leaving a letter saying you went to the front to cut down the enemy, there was no other information...how coincidental...I have you again...I will never lose you a second time...embrace me!"

He retreats in horror.

"Embrace me...come...embrace me...why are you retreating? Why are you avoiding me? Unwilling...?"

He retreats in even greater horror.

"Embrace me! With your hands...with your strong hands that often embraced me so tightly that my body ached...your hands that often took my black hair and made it into your black jade ring; with your hands that often held up my cherry lips, making them into your cup of youth..."

He trembles, wanting to say a reply, but using all his strength, he can only lower his head and use his teeth to bite off the tie of the cloak in front of his neck.

Then, the long black cloak falls down.

She retreats in horror, then kneels down at his feet, saying in an almost inaudible voice:

"What! You have lost..."

"Yes...yes..." he replies, struggling to squeeze out a few words from his throat as if someone were choking him: "I offered them...for the country."

Before the Mid-Autumn Festival of the following year, I happened to come to this small town; that night, I happened to fall asleep on this hillside while watching the moon. The evening breeze painted my eyelids with gentle fingers, ten thousand strands of starlight combed my hair, and the moon played a serenade on her transparent blue violin to lull me to sleep; on the hillside and on the river, a thin stream of light smoke blurred the real world. I fell asleep and had a dream, hearing a small grass next to my ear, in the sigh of the river, telling me the story above.

### The Maker of Happiness

— Tang Ke

It was a gloomy day with drizzling rain.

At that muddy, dirty street corner, I met you, a newspaper seller who couldn't see the face of the world himself, yet showed the world's appearance to those with clear vision.

I don't know if you live for yourself or for others?

Ah! You, who don't avoid the wind and rain, rely on the bamboo cane that replaces your vision all day long, gently touching the ground along the way, you walk all over the streets and alleys... calling out:

"Newspapers for sale..."

Who says you are running around like this just to prolong your own life? You are guiding those bright-eyed blind people to approach the truth and see the shining light; you are not lingering through your remaining life, but rather delivering spiritual food to the vast majority of humanity!

People accept the spiritual nourishment you provide and grow stronger; but you are withering away in the wind and rain! Who are you doing it for?

I worry that your haggard body, like dry firewood, will soon be eroded by the wind and rain and finally rest underground!

This world is indeed as filthy as the street you are walking on, not worth your remembrance, but when you close your eyes in the afterlife, do you know how many people with eyes but unable to see the world's appearance are still left in the world! Ah! Can you bear to leave them quietly? Moreover, you are healing this sin-filled world, like a healthy person?

It was another gloomy day with drizzling rain.

On that street where I might meet you every day, I no longer see your footprints or hear your voice. Could it be that you really嫌 this world is too dirty and偷 sneakily left the world?

Standing in this dark and stormy atmosphere, facing a world as filthy as a garbage can, without you, the blind newspaper seller who carries the cross of human suffering, I feel my whole body trembling, and my heart is filled with endless melancholy! Why does the world only allow people who harm others to exist?... I can't bear to think anymore.

Ah! You, the deliverer of spiritual food, I bless you, may your soul be comforted. But this unsubstantial support is as empty as a piece of white paper, without generating the slightest strength!

Comparing myself to you when you were alive, I feel my own fragility. How many bright-eyed people can work as tirelessly and brave the wind and rain as you do, running around to create happiness for humanity?

Even though your pupils have lost their vitality, you are still like a sighted person; because you know that being able to create happiness for others is the only way to truly achieve happiness for yourself!

But in the end, you created happiness for others and disappeared into the dark and stormy weather!

Ah...

Night of June 4th
