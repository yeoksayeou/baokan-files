[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Sun Yat-sen's new proposals regarding the current situation have been approved by the Chairman. Both Marshall and Stuart expressed satisfaction, stating, "Very good, we only hope the Communist Party will come, then the problem can be solved." The government is also eagerly hoping that the Communist Party will pull back from the brink. Lei Chen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), who went to Shanghai last night, will return to Nanjing on the morning of the 16th. Whether there has been progress will be revealed at that time. Marshall and Stuart met twice on the 15th, in the morning and afternoon, reportedly discussing the new proposals for a long time. Although the government has not formally delivered these proposals in writing to the US side, the Communist Party, and the Democratic League, Fu Jingbo learned the details when he visited the Chairman on the afternoon of the 14th and has passed them on to Marshall and Stuart.

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] PCC Secretary-General Lei Chen arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 8 a.m. yesterday. This reporter visited him at his residence and inquired about the purpose of his visit. Lei stated: After Sun Zhe-sheng returned to Nanjing from Shanghai, he synthesized the opinions of the "third party" in Shanghai regarding the overall peace situation and presented new proposals to the government. This visit to Shanghai is to exchange opinions on these proposals with figures of the third party. Lei also stated that the government has always held the greatest enthusiasm for peace. As long as the CCP can participate in peace talks, the situation can be resolved smoothly. As for the military action in Zhangjiakou, it was entirely out of necessity and has no impact on the overall peace situation. When asked by the reporter about the content of Sun's new proposals, Lei stated that it was not yet time to disclose them. When the reporter asked if the government had any opinions on Sun's new proposals, Lei stated that the Chairman had not expressed anything on the new proposals that Sun had brought back, but according to his personal observation, if Mr. Zhou Enlai could return to Nanjing for discussions in the near future, the problem would be easily solved. According to the reporter's inquiries, Lei Chen, after arriving in Shanghai, held separate talks yesterday morning at Fan Yuan on Haig Road and No. 8 Difeng Lane on Ditilu Road with the Democratic League and the Youth Party, the content of which is not known. According to the opinion of a certain political observer, the government's desire for peace remains very firm. If the CCP also has peace in mind, the situation may improve in the near future. However, the military has not stopped, and the possibility of change is still very high, so people from all sides working for peace must seize the time.

Furthermore, PCC representative Mo Dehui came to Shanghai on the night train the day before yesterday, reportedly also related to the peace talks.

[Further News] Lei Chen and Mo Dehui have completed their missions in Shanghai and returned to Nanjing on the night train last night.

### If Zhou Enlai Returns to Nanjing for Discussions, a Ceasefire Agreement Can Be Reached Immediately: Sun Yat-sen's Interview with American Reporters

[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] Legislative Yuan President Sun Yat-sen stated in an exclusive interview with a United Press reporter today: "If the Communist Party is wise, it should accept the government's new plan." He pointed out that the Communist Party has lost its military advantage, and what third-party leaders (including the Communist Party) can do now is to come to Nanjing to participate in the Three-Person and Five-Person Committees, as well as the PCC Comprehensive Task Force and the Constitution Drafting Review Committee, as the government has agreed to. Sun stated: "There is still time to discuss and draft a satisfactory agreement. The most pressing issue now is to stop the conflict. Once this problem is resolved, all other problems will automatically be resolved." He believes that if Zhou Enlai returns to Nanjing to participate in the Three-Person Committee, a ceasefire agreement can be reached. Sun continued: "The most important issue afterward will be the Constitution," and stated that if third-party leaders participate in the PCC Constitution Drafting Review Committee and complete the technical details, the government will agree to the current PCC draft constitution as the official draft in the National Assembly.

### Expected Good Response from the Third Party

He expects a good response from the third party in Shanghai to the government's proposals, as these proposals are actually based on their suggestions. He explained that the only difference between the government's new plan and the third party's suggestion is that the third party hopes for an immediate ceasefire order, while the government must wait for the Communist Party to agree to stop fighting and for Zhou Enlai to be willing to come to Nanjing to participate in the Three-Person Committee to seek an agreement before issuing it. When asked if the government is prepared to make further concessions, he said: "If the minority parties return to Nanjing to participate in the negotiations, the government is at least willing to take a compromise to satisfy their wishes." But he does not believe that the Communist Party's demand to restore the state of January 13 in China proper and the state of June 7 in the Northeast can be accepted, "because what has been done cannot be restored to its original state," and said that the Communist Party is realistic. When asked what the government's next step would be if the new plan is rejected, and whether the government will carry out political reorganization alone, Sun replied:

### If Minority Parties Do Not Come, Government Will Reorganize on Its Own

"If the minority parties do not come, we cannot force them." He adjusted to the government "roughly" will implement the reorganization alone. He compared the situation in China with the situation in India, and said: When Wavell invited the Congress Party and the Muslim League to organize the government, the Muslim League initially refused, but when the government was formed, the Muslim League personnel changed their attitude. When asked if the government agrees to grant the Communist Party and the Democratic League a veto in the National Government Committee, even if they occupy fourteen seats on the committee, he said: "The veto issue can be discussed, but this issue is complicated by different interpretations from all parties. If thirteen votes can constitute a veto, then the Communist Party has no reason to insist on fourteen seats." But he emphasized that "the veto cannot be of a general nature, but should be limited to certain issues and certain situations, otherwise if the minority party can overturn everything advocated by the majority party, it will create a minority party hegemony, and as a result, there will be no democracy, and the government will not be able to work."

### National Assembly List: May Be Announced Today

[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] Today's newspaper. The names of the representatives of the National Assembly may be announced tomorrow, including 150 representatives from border provinces and women's groups, and 165 local representatives.

### Reason for Failure to Agree: Mutual Suspicion

When asked if the United Government can satisfactorily develop its effectiveness once it is established, he said: "This depends on whether everyone abides by general rules, accepts reasonable suggestions, and places the interests of the country above the interests of the party. In fact, only in this way can the United Government be a government that unites for the country rather than a government with divergent opinions." Sun explained that the reason why the government and the Communist Party's demands are quite similar (i.e., maintaining the PCC and the ceasefire agreement) but have failed to reach an agreement is that: "The basic reason is mutual distrust and suspicion, as well as different interpretations of the terms of the agreement."

Chen also said that the two armies in eastern Chahar joined forces at noon on the 14th. The Communist Army in Shacheng, Xin'an, Huailai, and Yanqing, except for a part that fled to the northwest and the mountains of the Northeast, built fortifications in the Fan Shanpu area southwest of Huailai. Yesterday, the air force reconnaissance found a big fire in Zhuolu City, and the Communist Army will retreat.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] It is reported that Zhuolu in southern Chahar was recovered by the National Army yesterday.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] In the section from Chayu Fort to Juluo Fort on the Ping-Sui Road in western Chahar, the Communist Army has not completely withdrawn. According to reports from the front yesterday afternoon, the Communist Army is building fortifications in Juluo Fort, attempting to resist. The war in that area is very fierce. Before the fall of Zhangjiakou, the Communist Army in that area had divided its troops to help, but before they arrived, Zhangjiakou had fallen, so they returned to their original positions to resist and cover the retreat.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 15th] The Communist Army and its staff and families who were defeated from Zhangjiakou have continued to transfer through Yangyuan, Weixian, Yanggao, and Guangling to Fuping, Laiyuan, and other places in recent days.

### Zhu Shouguang Talks About the Situation in Shanxi Province

The Communist Army's Ambition to Seize Territory Has Not Been Extinguished

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Zhu Shouguang, Chief of Staff of the Second War Zone, recently flew to Beijing from Ping to visit the military authorities and requested instructions on the restoration work in the Datong area. On the 15th, he spoke to reporters about the situation in Shanxi Province, saying: The Communist Army's offensive in Shanxi this autumn coincided with the autumn harvest season. They attacked cities and seized land, looting food. In order to preserve some strategic strongholds and protect the people, the National Army had no choice but to make choices, so the Communist Army became rampant and attempted to take Datong first, then attack Taiyuan, in order to encompass Shanxi and open its "People's Congress of the Liberated Areas." However, the National Army had already seen through their treachery, and their conspiracies did not succeed. They were defeated in Jiuyishan and again in Jining. The siege of Datong was lifted, Zhangyuan was easily taken, and the situation in Jin-Cha has greatly changed. However, the current situation in Shanxi Province should not be taken lightly. Although the strength of the distant Communist Army has decreased, their arrogance is still strong. Recently, they besieged Baoding, Shimen, and once again attacked Fushan, Gucun, and the periphery of Datong. At the same time, one side retreated from Zhangyuan and occupied the Taihang Mountain area, and the other side strengthened its forces in Shangdang to coordinate with the Pinghan front. They also secretly crossed the Sanggan River to the town of Sanjiao in the west of Zhongyang from northern Shaanxi, which shows that the Communist Army's ambition to expand the civil war and seize Jin-Ji has not been extinguished. Shanxi is the back of North China, and Shangdang and Taihang have been military strategic areas since ancient times. In addition to stating the war situation to the authorities on this trip, I will also request instructions on protecting the people and pacifying the local areas. The people of Shanxi have suffered under the ravages of the Japanese puppets and the Communist Party for eight years, and they all hope that the government can put them at ease as soon as possible.

### Major Battle Expected in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Line: National Army Advances in a Fan Shape; Communist Army Fleeing from Chahar to Hebei Suffers a Crushing Blow

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] After the war in Chahar came to an end, the next major battlefield will be the northern section of the Pinghan Line. The National Army has advanced in a fan shape. The National Army on the Huailai front passed Zhuolu yesterday and advanced towards the Pinghan Line. A considerable number of National Army troops in Yangcun between Ping and Tianjin are also advancing towards the triangular area of Ping-Jin-Bao. The National Army on the Pinghan front is holding its troops in place. Gaobeidian was captured by the Communist Army at 7 p.m. yesterday, and now Zhuoxian and Caohe are completely controlled by the Communist Army.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 15th] More than 3,000 Communist troops from the 32nd, 37th, and 39th regiments of the 13th Brigade, defeated from Datong, fled through Zhangjiakou, Huailai, and Laishui to the Songlin shop, Yidou shop and other areas west of the Pinghan Line. The National Army has been fiercely suppressing them in recent days, and the Communist Army has suffered heavy losses. They are now collapsing towards Guanlizhuang, Beizicun, Yulin cun, and other areas. [Another telegram] In the northern section of the Pinghan Road, because the Communist Army destroyed several sections of the railway south of Zhuoxian to Gaobeidian a few days ago, the southbound trains from Ping once only went to Zhuoxian.

### Clearing of Gaomi Area

Jiaodong Communist Army Extracts Gold

### Some Pocket-Shaped Communist Areas May Be Cleared Out Early

[United Press, This Port News] The loss of Zhangjiakou is nothing less than a fatal blow to the CCP's military prestige. The so-called "liberated areas" of China, except for the Northeast, have now shrunk to insignificant pocket-shaped areas, which seem likely to be cleared out soon. There are currently three main pocket-shaped areas: one is the area around Yan'an, which is believed to be defended by the CCP's elite troops personally commanded by Zhu De. The second most important area is between the Pinghan Road and the Jinpu Railway in northern Henan. The third area is the National Army fighting along the canal, which is in danger of being cut into three sections. A large Communist area above Hankou in Central China has been largely eliminated by the National Army. Regardless of the strength of the Communist Army defending Yan'an, the area where the Communist Army is most concentrated is clearly in the Northeast, where land routes almost connecting Yan'an are completely cut off. Some speculate that once the CCP organizes its own government, it may make the Northeast its capital, while activating underground organizations throughout China, which may be directed by Yan'an before the loss of Yan'an. The largest city occupied by the CCP in the Northeast is Harbin, and it is believed that the CCP will defend the city to the last moment.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Wang Shijing, an economic traitor from North China, superintendent of the Finance Department of the puppet Political Committee, and manager of the puppet United Reserve Bank, was sentenced by the Capital High Court at 12:00 noon on the 15th. The verdict reads as follows: "Wang Shijing conspired with the enemy to resist this country, and is sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life. All of his property, except for what is necessary for the living expenses of his family, will be confiscated." Wang abused the puppet banknotes and collected resources to support the enemy while holding a puppet position. Because the handover after the enemy surrendered was relatively clear and he handed over five tons of gold and silver, he was spared death. However, his face changed suddenly when he heard the verdict, as if he was not satisfied.

### Bao Jianqing Flees to the Northeast

Hebei High Court Requests Arrest and Return

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] After Bao Jianqing, president of the puppet Peking University, was acquitted on July 15, he was reported again by Fu Sinian and others, and new evidence was presented.

### Wang Yitang Signs a Reasoned Statement for Re-Appeal

His Defense Attorney Wrote a Funeral Elegy in Advance

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] When Wang Yitang's defense lawyer, Wang Zanxi, went to the First Prison yesterday afternoon to ask Wang to sign a reasoned statement for applying for a re-appeal, Wang held the lawyer's left hand and said sadly: "You have done the right thing. I have no regrets about my death," and greatly thanked you, but this matter is too big." Wang Lawyer returned home and wrote a funeral elegy for Wang. The text reads: "He was a close friend of my late father. He talked about scriptures and relied on Buddha in his old age. He treated me like family. There is nothing else to hate, but I regret that you have died too late." The upper line says "to Uncle Yitang", and the lower line says "from your foolish nephew Wang Zanxi". Lawyer Wang knew that Wang would die, and from this, one can also see that the Wang and Wang families are very close. Therefore, it is a matter of fact that Wang accused He Chengjun of being a traitor and wrote an elegy before his death.

### Those Who Served as Jia Chiefs Under the Enemy Should Not Be Allowed to Serve as Senators

Comments from a Certain Counselor of the Judicial Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The people in the capital are also paying close attention to the question of whether those who served as baojia chiefs during the enemy-puppet period should be allowed to serve as senators, because the city of Beijing is also busy electing senators these days. On the 15th, the reporter visited a certain counselor of the Judicial Yuan and inquired about the legal point of view on this matter. According to him, in my personal opinion, those who served as puppet baojia chiefs, regardless of whether they had "relied on the power of the enemy-puppet to infringe on others," should not be allowed to serve as senators, because the baojia chiefs were autonomous personnel, and those who truly implemented the enemy-puppet decrees were this group of people.

### British Commercial Delegation Arrives in Capital: Bowers Outlines Mission to China; Study Bilateral Needs and Seek to Develop Trade

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] A British commercial delegation of twelve people arrived in the capital at 10:40 AM on the 15th, flying from Shanghai on two large British air transport planes. Welcoming them at the airport were Li Jun, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Cheng Luo, Director of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; Gu Yuzhen, Director of the Institute; Zheng Ruogu, Counselor of the Ministry of Social Affairs; Chen Zuping, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government; British Ambassador Steven, Counselor Hua Linzhe, and several military attachés from the army, navy, and air force. Bowers, the head of the delegation, arrived on the first plane and shook hands with the welcomers upon disembarking. The entire delegation then arrived on the second plane, and after a group photo, they were driven to their residence to rest. Mr. Bowers and his party appeared to be in high spirits and expressed satisfaction with the Nanjing climate. After a brief rest, the delegation held a press conference at the British Embassy at 11:45 AM, accompanied by British Ambassador Steven. Delegation leader Bowers reported on the mission, stating that the delegation was commissioned by the government with the aim of examining China's current economic situation to facilitate greater Sino-British trade. China has suffered the longest from war and has the deepest experience of pain. During the war, China's efforts to cope with the economic crisis have been successful, and it should continue these efforts in future nation-building. The delegation's scope of investigation covers transportation, textiles, electricity, international trade, and other departments, hoping to find the crux of the problems. Speaking of the prospects for Sino-British trade, Bowers said that current trade between the two countries is limited in quantity due to the circumstances, but it has gradually increased through mutual efforts. The potential for the Chinese market is great, and there is plenty of room for involvement. He believes that once the situation stabilizes, a new China can be built, and Britain is very willing to assist China's revival with materials, because after the war, Britain is making every effort to increase exports, hoping to export materials. One of the purposes of this visit to China is to study what China needs, while Britain also needs China's grain and raw materials. Trade should be long-term and reciprocal. He also said that there are no plans to meet with Communist Party members.

### Bowers Answers Reporter Questions: Loan Negotiations Not Within Scope of Mission; Chinese Market Will Absolutely Not Be Monopolized by the United States

The following is a record of Bowers's answers to reporters' questions: (Question) Is your country prepared to discuss loan issues with the Chinese government to develop Chinese industry during your visit to China, and what is the limit? (Answer) Our delegation's visit to China is limited to examining industry and commerce and developing trade between the two countries. The matter of loans is not within the scope of our mission.

(Question) When British private capital invests in China in the future, what will be the amount, and what industries will it focus on? (Answer) The amount of British private investment in Chinese industry and commerce will depend entirely on the stability of China's political situation. As for which industries to invest in, a decision can only be made after investigation.

(Question) After the end of the Asian war, it is expected that Chinese commerce will soon be monopolized by the United States. What is your country's opinion on this? (Answer) Britain naturally welcomes American aid to China, especially since China's industry and commerce have been severely damaged after eight years of war. The Chinese market is vast, and there are many opportunities, so it will absolutely not be monopolized by the United States. China needs a large amount of materials to rebuild its country after the war. The amount of materials needed for the five-year economic plan is enormous. The main purpose of this delegation's visit to China is to investigate China's urgent needs in industry and commerce.

(Question) China may raise import taxes to protect its nascent industries and save foreign exchange. What is your opinion on this, Sir? (Answer) I have no opinion on this. This question is unrelated to our mission.

(Question) What plans are Britain considering or have already implemented to protect Britain's large shipping and industrial investments in China? Is it currently considering selling various shipping companies or nationalizing them in order to compete with Chinese shipping? (Answer) I am unwilling to answer the former question because it is not within the scope of our delegation's mission, but if British commercial interests are infringed upon in the future, the British government will negotiate through its representatives. As for the latter, the fundamental purpose of shipping in China and Britain is not competition but to exchange materials and develop trade. Britain will assist China and will not compete with China. The materials China needs can be exported by Britain, and the materials Britain needs can be transported from China to Britain.

(Question) What is the extent of the recovery of Sino-British trade after the war? (Answer) This question cannot be answered. There are too many numbers required. This information can be provided in the future.

(Question) What are Britain's needs from China, and what are China's needs from Britain? (Answer) This can only be determined after investigation.

(Question) Regarding coastal shipping, has Britain negotiated with the Chinese government for permission for British mail ships and merchant ships to sail upstream on the Yangtze River to Hankou and other ports? (Answer) This issue has already been handled by the British government, which has sent a specialist, Milburn, to contact the Chinese government.

(Question) How will the Sino-British commercial treaty be negotiated? (Answer) This issue is also not within the scope of our delegation's mission and cannot be answered. This matter is the responsibility of the British Ambassador. From what I have heard, negotiations on the Sino-American commercial treaty are nearing completion, and the Sino-American commercial treaty may be signed before the Sino-British commercial treaty.

Bowers then spoke about the British production increase campaign, saying that Britain's current policy is to reduce its own supply, regardless of domestic sacrifices, and maximize the export of goods. For example, British goods that can be bought in the Shanghai market are nowhere to be found in the British market. Due to years of war, Britain has completely lost its intangible assets overseas. In order to survive, the British Empire must increase its export trade by more than 30% compared to before the war. This situation is most beneficial to countries such as China and India. However, Britain's overseas market is vast, and in terms of current exports, demand still exceeds supply. The maximum supply to China and other countries can only be achieved after Britain restores its pre-war production capacity.

### Experimenting with New Military Service Law: Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing as Demonstration Areas; Military Service Bureau Has Signed a Request to the Authorities for Implementation Starting New Year's Day

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Since the National Government announced the new Military Service Law on the Double Tenth Festival, the Military Service Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense has been actively planning its implementation. However, due to different situations in various regions, it is inevitable that there will be some difficulties in the universal implementation of the new law. In order to test the effectiveness of the new law's implementation, the bureau has signed a request to the authorities to first designate the three special municipalities of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing as demonstration areas for conscription under the new Military Service Law, and will establish divisions and regimental districts according to the size of the population. Implementation will begin on New Year's Day next year. The mayors and police chiefs of each city will serve as the supervisors of the demonstration conscription, and the detailed measures are being drafted.

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 15th] The Yunnan Military District has received an order from the Ministry of National Defense that the quota for the first phase of conscription in Yunnan Province is 12,800 people. In addition, the Kunyi Regimental District was officially handed over to the Yunnan Eastern District Regimental District on the 15th.

### International Emergency Food Council Resolves to Increase China's Allocation; Rice Donated by Overseas Chinese in Siam Not Included

[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] The International Emergency Food Council today passed a resolution to increase rice supplies to meet China's allocation needs. This proposal was put forward by our representative Chen Zhimai. Mr. Chen requested that the council first study the price agreements signed by Britain and Siam and request an increase in rice prices or export incentives to increase Siam's export volume. It is understood that Siamese rice merchants have stopped their export trade because the actual price of rice is too low. In his proposal, Chen also called for attention to the interrelationship between exported wheat and rice, as Brazil originally intended to export a large amount of rice, but because Argentina did not want to sell wheat to Brazil, Brazil also prohibited the export of its rice. Chen told a Central News Agency reporter that if the council can take effective measures on this proposal, the supplies exported from these two countries alone would be enough to cover our country's allocation of 280,000 tons. The council has also resolved that rice donated by overseas Chinese in Siam to their motherland will not be included in the allocation. Rice donated by overseas Chinese to their motherland has hitherto been included in the allocation, so today's resolution has actually increased our allocation, as some rice that has already reached our country is now recognized as a gift from our overseas Chinese.

### Handling of Factories in Northeast China: A Trusteeship Approach to Be Adopted; Plan to Entrust a Portion to Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Figures

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 14th] News of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Inspection Group's upcoming visit to the Northeast has been met with excitement and deep expectations. There are 717 factories in Liaoning Province alone, which are now being taken over by the Production Administration Bureau. The Production Administration Bureau has dispatched four groups of personnel to carry out the takeover. In addition, factories in Fushun, Sipingjie, Changchun, Jilin, Liaobei, and other places are still awaiting takeover. The handling work has just begun, and everything requires sufficient funds and manpower to recover. The relevant authorities in the Northeast plan to adopt a similar trusteeship approach, entrusting a portion of the factories to Shanghai industrial and commercial figures with a strong interest. Research and discussion are currently underway so that a proposal can be presented after the inspection group arrives. According to Director Wang of the Production Administration Bureau, the Northeast produces soybeans, of which the people themselves only use 60%, and if the remaining 40% can be exported, it can greatly enrich the people's livelihood, thereby creating a strong purchasing power among the people of the Northeast. Furthermore, Northeast industry and commerce can be unaffected by foreign goods, and raw materials are abundant and inexpensive, all of which are favorable conditions for establishing factories and doing business in the Northeast.

### Most of the Machinery from Fushun Coal Mine Carried Away by Soviets

Current Daily Coal Production Only 4,000 Tons

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 14th] The Fushun Coal Mine is a world-renowned deposit. According to Director Cheng Zongyang, in the past three years, the enemy only knew how to produce coal for military use and did not seek to improve it. In addition, the Soviet side carried away most of the machinery, making production extremely difficult. Currently, it can produce about 4,000 tons of coal per day. The biggest difficulties at present are electricity, materials engineering, and workers smuggling, and solutions are being sought.

### Construction of Liao River Dikes: Surveying Work Begins

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 14th] The Liao River in the Northeast has little water conservancy and much flooding. During the puppet Manchukuo period, labor was conscripted to build dikes, but the water was not used for irrigation. Except for the rice paddies in Panshan in the southern part of the Liao River, which were largely successful, flooding has not been completely eliminated, and farmers suffer miserably. The current General Office and other agencies have decided to use a budget of one billion yuan to build or improve dikes. Surveying work has begun, and construction can begin in April next year. In the future, the completion of the project will greatly benefit the people.

### Explosion Tragedy at Hankou Oxygen Manufacturing Plant: Burning for More Than Ten Hours, More Than Twenty People Killed or Injured; Factory Director Song Suichang Also Dies from Severe Injuries

### Jiangxi's Wartime Losses

More Than 500,000 Casualties, Property Losses of More Than 10,000 Billion

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 15th] During the Anti-Japanese War, Japanese troops harassed and bombed 78 of the 84 counties and cities in Jiangxi Province, and the losses were staggering.

### Important War Criminals from the Northeast: Escorted to Shanghai in Batches; Zou Renzhi Talks About His Trip to the Northeast

[Our City News] Zou Renzhi, Major General and Leader of the Northeast Supervisory Group of the War Criminals Handling Committee, returned to Shanghai from Beiping a few days ago. Representatives from all parties participating in the group, including Deng Liangshi and Sun Jiejun from the Ministry of National Defense, Bi Naiqian from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and Zhang Xiliang from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. According to Zou and the representatives, the people of the Northeast have suffered 14 years of enslavement education by the Japanese, and even in ordinary language, they often use "Concord Language" (that is, Chinese with Japanese grammar), which is heartbreaking to see. The people have survived the disaster, but social order has not yet been achieved, and the people are either plagued by war or impoverished by making a living, and have no surplus energy to report war criminals. At the same time, the central government's various laws and regulations related to the handling of war criminals were promulgated at different times, and various agencies also enforced them inconsistently due to time and geographical reasons, which greatly affected the work of handling war criminals. After the group went to the Northeast to implement supervision, it established a War Criminal Investigation Committee to handle the matter. Taking Shenyang as an example, there were originally only 96 Japanese war criminals, but now the number has increased to 206. However, with the increasing number of war criminals in the Northeast, the agencies managing war criminals should be expanded. Some of the important Japanese criminals who have been captured have been escorted to Shanghai in batches. The group plans to go to Nanjing tonight to report on their work.

### The Closing of the Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference

The Paris Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference closed at 2:00 PM yesterday. Since its opening on July 28th of this year, it has lasted exactly two months and eighteen days, making it arguably the longest international conference in history. During the conference, the representatives of various countries, due to differences of opinion and conflicts of interest regarding post-war European issues, engaged in countless debates. Many representatives argued until they were hoarse, unable to stop, causing repeated disturbances and causing the world to worry about the future of the Paris Peace Conference. However, the people of the world, without exception, yearn for peace, especially in European countries, which urgently demand a return to normalcy as soon as possible. They have an attitude of only allowing success and not failure for the political and diplomatic efforts of various countries towards peace. Under these objective conditions, the Paris Peace Conference finally passed the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, awaiting only the final decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers before they could be signed and established. Therefore, the passage of five draft peace treaties by the Paris Peace Conference, in any case, cannot but be regarded as the initial success of the twenty-one nation representatives in creating world peace.

Recalling the beginning of the Peace Conference, the differences of opinion among the countries almost reached their peak. The representatives of each country spoke from their own national positions, each with their own theories and claims, making it difficult to have any hope of compromise. In particular, the attitudes of some national representatives almost completely lacked the demeanor of diplomats: during debates, they would argue until their faces turned red; when attacking others, the wording used was close to abuse. So-called diplomatic language and international etiquette were rarely seen in the Peace Conference. Therefore, in the early stages of the Peace Conference, the world believed that it would be difficult to reduce the differences of opinion among the countries to the lowest possible limit in the draft peace treaties. At the same time, observing the situation of the Peace Conference, it was clear at a glance that there were two opposing groups: one was the Slavic group, and the other was the Anglo-American group. Although China and France were extremely willing to act as bridges between these two groups, mediating between the two sides to achieve a compromise, they were still unable to eliminate the existence of the groups; especially some small countries, either cheered and waved flags at the conference, willingly becoming the echo chambers of the big countries, or spent their time outside the conference indulging in pleasure, not asking about the affairs of the conference, leaving it to a few powerful countries to manipulate. Therefore, this Paris Peace Conference still could not escape the style of power politics; all decisions were in the hands of a few powerful countries.

Later, although many subcommittees were established to carry out work separately, they still could not be promoted, and progress was slow. Any subcommittee meeting inevitably ended in a tongue-lashing, resulting in nothing. And the days and months passed easily, week after week, causing the representatives of various countries to feel tired of the meetings, and the United Nations General Assembly was scheduled to meet on October 23, which was approaching in an instant. Since it could not be postponed again, the Paris Peace Conference had to close on October 15. Therefore, it was decided to intensify efforts and limit the work of each subcommittee to end on October 4. Only in this way could substantial progress be made. However, for some important issues, the method of avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial was adopted, and the matter was left unfinished. On the 8th of this month, the peace treaty with Italy was passed, and the peace treaties with Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria were also passed one after another. On the 14th, the peace treaty with Finland was also passed, finally allowing the Peace Conference to achieve satisfactory results. Barely satisfactory, it can be regarded as a consolation at present.

Today, the world has realized the difficulty of creating world peace, which is even more difficult than winning a war. Taking European peace as an example, since the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany in May last year, the European war can be regarded as over; however, until October 15 this year, only five draft peace treaties have been completed, and it is still necessary to wait for the final decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, which shows the slow progress of peace work. Moreover, the core of the European problem lies not in Italy, the Balkans, or Finland, but in the German problem. At present, Germany is still under the joint control of the four powers of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. How to restore Germany to normal as soon as possible, so that it can become one of the peace-loving countries in the international community, is the most urgent problem to be solved at present. What's more, the iron curtain of Europe is heavy, and the situation of confrontation between Eastern and Western Europe has long been brewing, and it has become even more blatant recently. However, at the meeting of the four foreign ministers the day before yesterday, when discussing the German problem, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov still insisted that it would be better to discuss the German problem in Europe than in New York, and US Secretary of State Byrnes also expressed his agreement in principle. According to this, only after the closing of the United Nations General Assembly can the four foreign ministers return to Europe to discuss the German problem, which will be in mid-December or late December.

From this, it can be seen that the completion of five draft peace treaties in this conference is an initial success in the direction of peace; however, the creation of peace is not easy, and this initial success is also enough to encourage the political and diplomatic figures dedicated to peace to begin their more difficult and heavier work, the peace treaties with Germany and Japan, so that the post-war world can enter a new era of peace and democracy as soon as possible.

### Central Bank Business Conference

The Third Session of the Central Bank's Executive Council opened in the capital on the 11th; this is the first Executive Council meeting since the Second Session held in the wartime capital seven years ago. The Executive Council meeting seven years ago was held during the difficult stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the frenzy of Japanese warlords was continuing to rise; now, the holding of the Third Executive Council meeting is when the Japanese invaders have surrendered and final victory has arrived. The seven years between the Second and Third Executive Council meetings is a historically significant stage; and in these seven years, the Central Bank, under the successive leadership of former Presidents Kong and Yu and the current President Bei, has made considerable achievements in the implementation of our country's financial policies; although our country's current financial crisis is deepening day by day, how the Central Bank cooperated in the completion of the War of Resistance during the War of Resistance period is well known and worthy of praise. Now that victory has arrived, the convening of the Executive Council meeting at this time, reviewing the past and planning for the future, will, it is deeply believed, make a great contribution to the consolidation of post-war finance and the future of our country's economic recovery.

At the opening of the Central Bank Business Conference, Chairman Chiang, in the midst of his busy schedule, issued a special instruction, with some encouragement, which shows the Chairman's concern for this Central Bank Business Conference. In this instruction of the Chairman, we see such phrases: "In the future, financial measures should be coordinated internationally and meet the needs of the economy domestically. This is the greatest responsibility of our Central Bank, and it is also the most arduous task at present." Indeed, the greatest responsibility of the Central Bank at present is nothing more than how to obtain international coordination and meet the needs of the economy domestically. Regarding obtaining international coordination, since the establishment of the International Monetary Agreement and the International Bank, financial business has become increasingly internationalized, and our country is currently in a situation of inflation. How to strengthen our country's finance and consolidate our country's monetary system requires international coordination. As for meeting the needs of the economy domestically, it concerns the nature of the institution and the issue of the application of the institution.

In terms of the nature of the institution, under the call for "banking specialization," the Central Bank should especially become the bank of banks. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, and with the development during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the position of the Central Bank has become far more important than before the war. To adapt to this new environment, the government is preparing to amend the Central Bank Law to determine the new position of the Central Bank. Making the Central Bank the bank of banks is almost a unanimous demand of the country, so how to make it the bank of banks is especially a concern of the people. From a negative perspective, since the position of the Central Bank is higher than that of general banks, it should not engage in the business of general banks, especially the business of general commercial banks, such as remittance and discounting. From a positive perspective, the powers of the Central Bank should be expanded so that it can bear the mission of becoming the bank of banks. Judging from the powers conferred on the Central Bank by the draft amendment to the Central Bank Law, it seems that in addition to making it the bank of banks, it is also intended to make it the sole issuing bank, and on the other hand, it also wants to give it the performance of a "financial department." If the institution of the Central Bank is reorganized according to the plan of this amendment, although the powers of the Central Bank will be expanded, the national financial system will inevitably suffer adverse consequences. Therefore, we advocate that the powers of the Central Bank should indeed be expanded so that it becomes the bank of banks, but the national financial system must also be respected.

First, we believe that making the Central Bank directly subordinate to the National Government, and its president being a specially appointed official, seems to create a situation of opposition to the Ministry of Finance, which is in charge of finance. Since the state has established the Ministry of Finance to manage the state's finances, it seems more reasonable for the Central Bank to be subordinate to the Ministry of Finance and subject to the supervision and control of the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance is the department in charge of banks, and it also has a Currency Department to manage finance. If the financial policies set by the Ministry of Finance do not receive the support of the Central Bank, it will inevitably form a stalemate, making the Central Bank a de facto Ministry of Finance. Therefore, for the sake of the national system, the powers of the Central Bank should indeed be expanded so that it becomes the bank of banks, but its position should be under the Ministry of Finance, subject to the supervision and control of the Ministry of Finance.

Second, the Central Bank's becoming the bank of banks does not lie in seizing the powers that should belong to the Ministry of Finance, but in assisting the Ministry of Finance in the execution of these powers. Making the Central Bank the sole issuing bank should be supported in principle; but this does not mean that the Central Bank has the power to decide on the monetary system and freely issue currency. The power over the monetary system and currency management belongs to the Ministry of Finance and not to the Central Bank; the latter is only executing the decisions made by the Ministry of Finance regarding the monetary system and currency management.

As for the application of operations, since the Central Bank has the task of the bank of banks, at a time when the industry is declining and the people's livelihood is uneasy, it should especially "meet the needs of the economy domestically" to revitalize finance, that is, to quickly open up rediscounting and re-discounting. At present, industrial and commercial production enterprises need loans. Due to currency depreciation and increased costs, the demand for funds is huge. The loans and disbursements of commercial banks cannot meet the actual needs of industrial and commercial production, which affects construction. The Central Bank should fulfill its mission and handle re-mortgaging and re-discounting so that industrial and commercial production enterprises can be adjusted and become more active. There are many other aspects of business improvement; This Central Bank Business Conference brings together the heads of the bank in various places to study in detail; after the closing of the conference, there will be improvements, which goes without saying.

The case of postponing the collection of accumulated grain will be replied to by letter. The land declaration and land registration are not real enough to be the standard for collecting field tax. The Qingtu County reported that the public announcement has not been completed, and the results will not be used to collect field tax this year. The other counties will review and correct the results to remedy the situation. For all regulations on accumulated grain, before the regulations issued by the Ministry arrive in the province, the original methods established by this province will continue to apply, and the accumulated grain will be cleared up within a time limit. The case of handling processed surplus rice can be handled. The case of allocating and purchasing flat-priced rice to the employees of each newspaper must be submitted to the Central Government for instructions. Regarding land administration, the case of adjusting the ownership of field bottom and field surface can be notified to all counties for compliance. In addition, the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly Standing Committee held its first meeting and discussed 21 cases, including the initiation of a province-wide donation for the 60th birthday of the Head of State, the establishment of a city in Wenzhou, and the opening of Hangzhou City with no prohibition on social tea and dance.

[Report from Hangzhou, this newspaper] Zhejiang suffered heavy losses during the war, and the aftermath of the war is full of scars. This summer, floods, droughts, insects and other disasters have occurred from time to time. Now, as the winter season is approaching, the Provincial Government is actively planning projects related to transportation, water conservancy, and the construction of houses and sea embankments, as well as handling a large amount of urgent relief to tide over the difficulties. The Provincial Government has telegraphed the disaster situation to the Ministry of Social Affairs of the Executive Yuan and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration General Administration for approval to allocate a large amount of materials. Viewing the severity of the disaster situation in Zhejiang Province, the Deputy Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration China Branch, Billy Fan, and the Director of the Branch, Samson, came to Hangzhou a few days ago to investigate and inspect the general situation of the Zhejiang and Fujian Branch of the Executive General Office.

### The Capture of the Big Bandit Li Defu; Approved for Execution by Shooting in Suzhou

[Report from Wuxi, this newspaper, 15th] Li Defu, the famous bandit leader of Taihu Lake, and three cadres, including Hou Mingqing and Luo Ying, have been captured by the Suzhou authorities. County Magistrate Lu of Wuxian County specially sent Secretary Luo to Wuxi today to ask for instructions from the Wuxi Command Post. Chief of Staff Mao approved the execution of the three bandits on the spot, investigated and commended those who contributed, and strictly ordered the investigation and arrest of the remaining bandits. In addition, the Wuxi County Government executed two bandits, Xia Youfang and Xu Xingsheng, who robbed the Zhuji Temple today.

[Report from Suzhou, this newspaper, 15th] Since Li Defu, the bandit leader who entrenched himself in the four counties of Su, Kun, Qing, and Jiang, was captured and transferred to the Suzhou County Government, County Magistrate Lu has attached great importance to the issue of Li's disposal. He has telegraphed the Capital Garrison Headquarters, the Provincial Government, the Provincial Security Command, the First Pacification Area Command, the Wuxi Command Post, the Yangcheng Area Command, and other agencies for instructions and waiting for orders to handle the case. However, the Provisional County Council and other civil opinion organs of this county believe that Li has roamed the counties of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, committing adultery, killing, looting, and doing everything, and the people have suffered greatly. They have sent telegrams to Commander-in-Chief Tang, Li Mo'an, Wang Maogong, Chen Daqing, Ma Shigong, and other military and political leaders, requesting that Li be punished according to the law to satisfy the people.

[Report from Suzhou, this newspaper, 14th] The "New Fourth Army" Li Defu's department, which had been roaming the border of Su, Kun, and Yu, was completely destroyed on the 13th in Caitian Village, Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province. Li himself was captured alive by Liao Zongfu, the district chief of the 11th District of our Suzhou. He was escorted to the county at about 10:00 am on the 14th. When reporters heard the news and went to visit him, they saw that Li was about thirty years old, short and fat, wearing gray casual clothes and flat running shoes, in extreme embarrassment. Now, this once rampant grass bandit king has been put in prison with thirteen pounds of heavy shackles, and he will be transferred to the military for interrogation soon. In this battle, one Czech light machine gun, two submachine guns, and twelve rifles were captured, and five hostages, including Sun Dechang, the mayor of Yangxiangjing Town, Kun County, who were kidnapped by Li, were rescued. County Magistrate Lu Jianhua of Suzhou awarded District Chief Liao a bonus of 500,000 yuan to reward the officers and soldiers of the self-defense force who contributed. The reporter was given a detailed account of the battle by District Chief Liao, which is recorded as follows: On the 12th, information was received that Li led more than 200 troops to entrench themselves in Qianwangbang, Xiutang Township, 11th District. Liao immediately led the self-defense force to encircle and suppress them. The two sides came into contact for five hours from 3:00 pm. Li could not retreat. At 6:00 am on the 13th, Liao and the self-defense force of Lumu Town, Kun County, joined forces and advanced in the direction of Zhejiang. Li's troops were left with only dozens of people. Until Caitian Village, which is close to Jiashan, Li ran out of ammunition and was captured alive.

[Report from Suzhou, this newspaper, 15th] In order to cooperate with the development of the cleanup work in the Taihu Lake area and to promote its rapid completion, County Magistrate Lu Jianhua of this county has decided to take Party Secretary Jin Yungong, a part of the security brigade, and the police brigade force, to patrol the villages and districts under the jurisdiction of the county in the Taihu Lake cleanup area at 9:00 am on the 16th, including Mudu, Guangfu, East Dongting Mountain, and West Dongting Mountain. However, the destination is the remote rural areas of the four districts, or the remote townships and towns where government orders and force cannot often reach. The task is to comfort the elders and convey the government's intentions in order to recover and rectify the people's hearts. At the same time, establishing a correct Baojia system and organizing the household registration are also the main tasks. Reporter Chen Lu County Magistrate stated that this trip has been scheduled with Wuxi County Magistrate Xu to meet on the border, and then lead teams to patrol separately. The motive is, in addition to assisting the cleanup work, to take into account that some remote villages have often never had the footprints of government officials in thirty or forty years. This is the crux of the alienation between officials and the people, and it is also the way to lose the people's hearts because the people's difficulties have no way to vent. The county magistrate, as a pro-democracy official, should strive to eliminate this malpractice.

[Report from Changshu] The cleanup work in the Meili and Tangshi districts of Dongxiang in this county has been carried out for only two weeks, and all the lurking bandits will be eliminated. The newly appointed district chiefs, Lu Xinbin and Quan Yangqing, will rush to their posts to take over the affairs. The staff of the Meili district who were on duty have returned to the city one after another. It is reported that the important members of the internal organization of the bandits are team leaders Zhu Kun, Tao Lian, Qian Ruigen (Shang Xiang), tax collector Ren Husheng, person in charge of the garrison Cao Haoxiang, communication station chief Chu Weiwen, and economic cadre Xue Haozhou, all of whom have been arrested and sent to the county headquarters for interrogation. According to the report, 124 bandits were captured in this cleanup (including 117 who surrendered and reformed), of which 25, including Zhu Baokang and Lu Yongnian, were sent to the county, and the rest were ordered to be managed by the township Bao and listened to the verification.

### Dog-Headed Tiger; Vicious Beast in Wenling; Devouring Humans and Livestock

[Report from Wenling, this newspaper] The dog-headed tiger is a scourge in the four villages of this county. In the summer of last year, it was even more rampant. The number of children and women who were devoured and injured was as many as four or five hundred. Afterwards, due to strict precautions, its momentum was slightly suppressed. Unexpectedly, dog-headed tigers have been found in various villages recently, and shepherds and pigs and sheep are often devoured. At about 3:00 am on the 3rd of this month, three or four dog-headed tigers were also found on Xin Street, North Gate, howling and looking for food, and they devoured several pigs and sheep in a farmer's house in a mountain pond in Beishan.

### Qingpu Rice Prices Soar; Reaching 75,000

[Report from Qingpu, this newspaper] This county produces a lot of late rice, and the harvest is relatively late. There is a lack of food on the road. Rice merchants are using their usual tricks. The rice market has soared in recent days, breaking the 70,000 mark and creating a new record of 75,000 yuan in Jiangsu Province, and there is also a black market, which is rumored to have 80,000, which is shocking. The rise in the rice market naturally stimulates other prices. The current black market price of pork has exceeded 3,000 yuan, and other wages such as mud and water work, carpentry, tailoring, and hairdressing have also risen accordingly.

### More Than 100 Tons of Flour; Zhengyangguan Holds Urgent Relief

[Report from Zhengyangguan, this newspaper] The Anhui Relief Branch allocated 140 tons of flour to handle urgent relief in this city. In addition to the 12 tons allocated for the construction of streets and other expenses, the distribution began on the 11th. Those who suffered severe disasters received 22 catties for large households and 11 catties for small households. Those who were directly affected by the disaster received 18 catties for large households and 9 catties for small households. Those who were indirectly affected by the disaster received 12 catties for large households and 6 catties for small households. A total of 10,561 people and 4,057 households were relieved.

### Shan County Clears Up the Remaining Communists; More Than 600 People Surrender

[Report from Xuzhou, this newspaper] After Shan County, Lunan, was recovered by the National Army, the county government sent police stations and self-defense forces to various villages to clear up the remaining local Communist troops. From October 2nd to 8th, more than 1,000 Communist rifles and more than 10 light machine guns were captured successively, and more than 600 Communist troops surrendered.

### Suzhou Flour Price Controls Difficult; Black Market Forms, Manufacturers Lament

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Wang Maogong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, recently came to Suzhou to suppress food prices for the sake of the people's livelihood. In addition to assessing prices for rice and other major food items, Mr. Wang stipulated a price limit of 16,000 yuan per bag for flour. Later, when traveling to Wujiang, Kunshan, Taicang, and Changshu counties before returning to Suzhou, he summoned local leaders such as Special Commissioner Xu and County Magistrate Lu to instruct them to closely monitor the implementation of price controls on rice and flour. However, since the price controls on flour were implemented a week ago, all flour mills have consistently cited high costs and inability to bear losses, and have ceased deliveries. This has led to a depletion of supplies at various flour shops, causing panic in the market. Because factories cannot deliver goods at the controlled prices, retail prices are trending towards a black market. To meet the urgent needs of the market, the only condition factories impose for delivering goods is that flour shops exchange wheat for flour, thereby avoiding the blame for not complying with price controls. However, the wheat price calculated for exchange is equivalent to 18,400 yuan per bag of flour. Therefore, flour shops must sell at 18,900 yuan, including handling and other expenses, which not only violates price controls but also increases daily, defying government orders. County Magistrate Lu summoned various manufacturers on the 14th to demand that they comply with the price controls and lower prices by a deadline. However, manufacturers still cited high costs and excessive losses, and jointly submitted a document detailing their plight, requesting it to be forwarded to Chairman Wang to modify the price control measures. The document first laments that of the original sixteen flour mills, thirteen, including Yuhua, have closed down, declared liquidation, or collapsed due to the impact of the economic downturn and the exploitation of high-interest loans since the spring. The remaining three, including Taihe, are barely managing to persevere despite the difficulties. However, the transport and re-export of wheat to Shanghai has not stopped, causing the abnormal phenomenon of expensive wheat and cheap flour. Business misfortune is worsening daily. It then explains the current wheat price and manufacturing costs, calculating the losses incurred by selling at the controlled prices. It also comments that Shanghai flour mills can sell flour at the controlled prices because the government allocates them foreign wheat. Since Suzhou has no allocation of foreign wheat and is affected by the transport and re-export of wheat to Shanghai, it requests a modification of the price control measures, so that 2/10 of each factory's daily output can be sold at the controlled price, while the remaining 8/10 must be sold at cost. In this way, the government's orders, the people's livelihood, and the factories' survival can all be taken care of. It is said that after receiving the submission, County Magistrate Lu has ordered the mills to strive to maintain price controls and may consider allocating foreign wheat.

### ### The Tiger of Southern Zhejiang Discussed; Public Trial of Traitor Kun Scheduled; Shen Honglie States That He Will Never Forgive Lightly

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 15th] Tan Kun, the "Tiger of Southern Zhejiang," was originally a salt policeman. After Shaoxing fell in the 30th year of the Republic, he gathered bandits in the Ma'an area of Shaoxing, colluded with the enemy, and served as the head of the puppet autonomous association and the puppet Southern Coast Area Self-Defense Column Commander. He committed adultery, looting, murder, arson, and all kinds of evil deeds, causing the people to hate him to the bone. This traitor was also fickle. After defecting last year, he coveted the profits of the salt fields and clashed with Zhang Changming's troops, resulting in the washing away of Southern Coast Area. Zhou Xinmin, the district chief of Shaoxing County, was shot and killed at the Sleeping Lion Nunnery in Ma'an because he knew Tan Kun had committed many crimes. His henchman, Song Shizhang, was the main accomplice. Song was arrested in Shaoxing on December 1st of last year. Tan Kun was also arrested in Hangzhou after being secretly reported by Zhou Xinmin's wife. His accomplices have been identified and sentenced to life imprisonment. Tan Kun has also been transferred to the provincial capital by the Security Command. The trial is scheduled to begin on the 25th of this month. Zhou's wife has also come to Hangzhou to appeal to the press, demanding that he be executed. It is said that Chairman Shen Honglie has told people from all walks of life in Shaoxing that Tan Kun's crime is similar to that of traitor Tian Xiushan and will never be forgiven lightly.

### ### Wanted: Zhang Qiliu, Secretary-General of the Puppet National Government's Civil Service Department

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 15th] The Jiangsu Higher Court issued an order on the 15th to all subordinate county courts and notified the county governments to arrest Zhang Qiliu, Secretary-General of the puppet National Government's Civil Service Department, so that he can be brought to justice.

### ### Petty Thieves Spread Tear Gas; Patrons of Jinshan Cafe Weep Copiously

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The security of Suzhou's city temples has been repeatedly disturbed. After the four major theaters, including Beiming and Kaiming, received threatening letters, an explosion occurred at the Daguangming Cinema on the afternoon of the 12th, fortunately without causing any damage. Unexpectedly, at around 9 p.m. on the night of the 13th, unidentified individuals secretly released tear gas ingredients in the Jinshan Cafe outside the Guarmen gate. At the time, the cafe was packed with guests, singing and reveling. Suddenly, all the patrons and singers in the room wept copiously. Order was thrown into chaos as people fled in panic. The person in charge of the Jinshan Cafe reported to the City Defense Command. A thorough investigation is underway.

### ### Received Materials in Shangqiu All Stolen and Sold; Large-Scale Hospital Disappears; Members of the Investigation Team Feel Indignant and Heartbroken

[Our Kaifeng Dispatch, 14th] Wang Pingzheng, a member of the Lu-Yu Area Investigation Team, recently returned to Bian from Shangqiu, Yushi. The reporter first visited Mr. Wang at the Inspectorate of Henan and Shandong and talked for four hours. Mr. Wang was very saddened by the reception work in Shangqiu, and his indignation was evident in his words. According to what he told the reporter: Before the restoration, Shangqiu was a place where the enemy amassed large quantities of materials, and industry and commerce were extremely developed. There were 22 foreign firms alone, and more than 50 banks, warehouses, cooperatives, etc. The salt, lacquer, pig bristles, tung oil, cloth, electrical materials, etc. stored there were countless. After the enemy surrendered, Kong Tianjing led a group of officers and soldiers from the Linquan Command Headquarters to Shangqiu on August 20th of last year, and took control of all the remaining materials. They were all transported to Jieshou by cars and carts over a period of more than a month and sold. When the local special office was ordered to take over, only empty houses and broken furniture remained! In terms of military supplies, most were taken over by the First and Fifth War Zones. The First War Zone received 5 million catties of wheat from the enemy's food commune. Most heartbreaking was the shocking case of corruption in the reception of the Shangqiu enemy patient treatment center by the Kaifeng District Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Military Affairs. The scale of the center and the equipment were not only unprecedented in North China but might even surpass the current Central Hospital. The center covered an area of 500 acres and could accommodate 3,000 patients. There were more than 1,500 steel wire beds, 24 of the latest large microscopes, X-rays, sun lamps, air conditioning, running water, and electricity, everything was available. After the restoration, the Kaifeng District Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Military Affairs sent Yang Zhen, a major staff member of the second reception group, to take over. Apart from the barracks, which were later handed over to the Military Property Management Office of the Ministry of Military Affairs, all the medical equipment, steel wire beds, etc. were secretly transported to Zhengzhou. Zhou, who was in charge of the office, also packed 30 large wooden boxes with the most valuable medicines, secretly transported them to Zhengzhou, and embezzled them for himself. The office has not yet reported to the ministry. Now, the 67th Rear Hospital of the Logistics Department cannot find housing in Shangqiu, so they were informed by the locals that the barracks of the Armored Corps Training Headquarters is the patient treatment center. The 68th Rear Hospital has been approved by the Ministry of National Defense to take over, and the Ministry of National Defense is conducting a thorough investigation. According to Mr. Wang: The case has been submitted by the team as a special case for strict handling.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th] Lu Mengbin, manager of the Xinxiang Xinxing Yarn Factory, seized 150 acres of people's land, and concealed 3,000 bags of enemy and puppet materials, 800 bags of cotton yarn, etc. After the Yu-Lu Investigation Team confirmed the facts, Lu has been detained by the provincial government.

### ### Strange Thief Robs Cars; Specializes in Kidnapping Female Passengers

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Robbery cases have been emerging one after another on the roads in Suzhou for the past two months. They occur every two or three days, and travelers are increasingly apprehensive. Although Chairman Wang has telegraphed the military police and district chiefs in charge of security in this county, ordering them to solve the cases within a deadline, no clues have been obtained, and solving the cases is even more difficult. As a result, the bandits have become even more rampant. At around 7 a.m. on the 13th, a Suzhou-Xun Automobile Company car carrying seven passengers was traveling to Nanxun, when two bandits, one wearing a yellow uniform and the other in plain clothes, jumped onto the car near the Xingxiu Bridge outside Panmen, near the city walls. When the car reached Baodai Bridge, they ordered the car to stop and kidnapped three of the female passengers. The company reported the incident to the military and police authorities, who are currently searching in separate directions.

### ### Bridge on Suzhou-Wuxi Highway Collapses; Truck Overturns and Falls into Water

[Our Wuxi Dispatch] The Suzhou-Wuxi Highway in the Zhouxin and Nanqiao towns of this county has not been repaired and reinforced since it was destroyed in the war. The bridge is corroded and cannot bear heavy loads. At 11:30 a.m. on the 13th, a large truck from the Shanghai Hemeng Company, loaded with a large number of pomelos, oranges, bananas, and salted fish, and carrying 14 passengers, was speeding towards this county when the bridge suddenly collapsed in the middle near the 6th milestone on the highway. The entire truck overturned into the river. Fortunately, the river was shallow, and nearby villagers rushed to the rescue, preventing a tragic loss of life. Only one passenger, Wang Yasheng, was injured in the chest, and two pregnant women were more seriously injured. A large number of fruits floated all over the river.

### ### Changshu Hupu and Fushan Listed as Civil Aviation Ports

[Our Changshu Dispatch] For the convenience of civil aviation, the First District Pacification Command has designated the ports of Hupu and Fushan in this county as ports for air traffic. The county government has implemented the order and strengthened local forces to maintain security.

### ### Zhejiang Province Civil Servant Screening and General Inspection

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] In Zhejiang Province, in addition to most of the provincial civil servants being sent for review and screening according to law, there are still some who have not been sent for review. It has recently been reported that the Fujian-Zhejiang Screening Office will conduct a general inspection in this province. The Personnel Department of the Provincial Government has discussed and agreed to start the general inspection after preparation.

### ### Looking at the Cloud of War from the Ruins of Yin; Eastern-Bound Troops Head Toward the Communist Core in Daming; By Our Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

[Our Anyang Dispatch, 14th] The Nationalist army of Li Xianzhou in Anyang has begun to advance towards the Zhang River. The battle is taking place in Huilong town, 70 li due east. The military denied to reporters rumors that the Nationalist army had crossed the Zhang River northwards. The threat of the Communist army to Anyang cannot be said to be completely lifted, and reporters were advised not to go to the suburbs to prevent frequent accidents. The reporter arrived in this city, the northernmost front line of the Nationalist army in Henan, on the evening of the 12th. In the past few months, the Nationalist army, in order to cope with the Communist army's attacks and consolidate the position of Anyang, has been constantly engaged with it in the surrounding 200 li area. On both sides of the Anyang Lake, they have always adopted an absolute defensive posture. Hearing dense gunfire in the city at night is still a frequent occurrence. The Eastern-Bound troops are heading towards the Communist core in Daming, and the military has stated that they may be deployed there. The people of northern Henan and southern Hebei are fierce, and the four self-defense columns of the local organization have considerable strength. They frequently enter and exit the Communist area and have been quite successful on the border of Hebei and Henan. Rumors of the recovery of Cixian and Handan mostly originate from this. The north bank of the Zhang River is still the Communist army's passage from the Taihang Mountains to southern Hebei and western Shandong. After the discovery of oracle bones in Xiaotun, the Yin Ruins in Anyang became famous in the world of academia. Xiaotun is located in the northwest of the city. Mr. Dong Zuobin lived here for several years. It was heard this spring that Yin bronzes were unearthed. After the lessons of eight years of war, the people have mostly voluntarily sent the unearthed antiquities from various places to the local government for preservation. Anyang originally had an Antiquities Management Committee, and the 4 tons of antiquities it contained were transported to Nanyang during the War of Resistance against Japan. They have now all been moved back and, according to reports, nothing has been lost. The famous Liuhe Man Coal Mine is located 90 li northwest of the city. Before the war, it produced 6,000 tons of anthracite daily. It is now in the hands of the Communist army. According to visitors: the mine's machinery and caves have been damaged beyond repair. There are 13 coal mines with machinery and equipment in northern Henan, including Jiaozuo, with a total daily coal production of 15,000 tons. Other scattered manual mines are not included. However, northern Henan has become a "coal-free and light-free area". Fifteen exiled county governments along the Zhang River are gathered in Anyang, and there are more than 110 other agencies. Because refugees flock there, the population of this small city has jumped from 50,000 to 150,000. The autumn wind is rustling, and the clouds are connected in all directions. I really don't know when I can return home.

Rice Merchants Request Cancellation of Export Tax

Qing County is a rice-producing area. More than 1,000 piculs are exported to Shanghai every day. Since April of this year, the First District Office has been levying an export tax of 2 sheng of rice per picul on rice merchants. It was found that the government had long issued an order to cancel the export tax on rice, and there is no such rice tax in neighboring counties. Inquiring of the district office, they said it was to subsidize local undertakings. The county government is now borrowing food from the tenants for subsidies. It is reasonable to cancel this kind of rice export tax as soon as possible, but in fact it has not been implemented, and the tax is increasing rather than decreasing. Merchants and the people really cannot bear the burden. Please ask the relevant authorities to cancel the excessive tax as soon as possible to avoid losses to merchants (A rice merchant in Qingpu). I am a student, and I have seen many younger brothers and sisters lose their education because they cannot enter public schools and cannot afford the high tuition fees of private schools. Now, as a student, I would like to contribute some opinions to everyone. Recently, schools in various places have been experiencing "overcrowding", especially in Shanghai, where thousands of people apply but only a few dozen are admitted. This is a very serious problem. Education is the link between national politics and economy, and the second generation is the future master of the country. Groups of students are rejected at the door. They cannot get education and resent and get angry, or even laze around and do negative and illegal things. This is very dangerous for the future of the country. The reasons are nothing more than three points:

(1) Since the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan, the general level of knowledge of people has not improved. On the contrary, it has decreased due to wartime displacement and abandonment of books. However, the desire for knowledge is much more urgent than before.

(2) Educational and cultural institutions in various places have been destroyed by the enemy puppets, and the number of schools has generally decreased.

(3) A large part of the farmers in small towns and villages have been swept into the cities by the tide of the times. To seek a proper solution, there is only a palliative method. The country is still in a chaotic period, education work cannot be smoothly promoted, schools cannot be established immediately, and teachers are also in short supply. Moreover, it is impossible not to let many people study. The palliative method is to change the school system -- using the two-part system and the three-term system together.

The two-part system changes class time to two shifts, morning and afternoon, teaching in separate shifts, with earlier mornings and longer afternoons. The three-term system is three terms a year, with shorter winter and summer vacations. It has four advantages:

(1) The two-part system can double the number of students enrolled.

(2) The three-term system can also increase the number of students enrolled because the period of study is shortened. For example, a middle school originally requires six years, but now it can be completed in four years. The remaining two years can be used to teach more students.

(3) Teachers have a difficult life. More teaching can increase income, and teachers' lives may be stabilized and improved.

(4) At the beginning of the country's victory and construction, there is a great need for talent. Shortening the duration of students' studies can also allow them to serve the country and society earlier. However, the above method also has shortcomings, such as:

(1) The curriculum must also be thoroughly reformed. In a short half-day, time is already very tight. Schools only teach academic subjects, and technical subjects are studied by students themselves outside of class. For example, art, music, calligraphy, etc. in middle schools are all canceled. If you are interested, you can study them outside of class. Half a day is enough time.

(2) Although teachers' income is slightly higher, they are overworked and mentally exhausted. The only solution is to set up more specialized teacher training institutes, where teachers with similar interests specialize in one subject, so that the workload is not too burdensome and students benefit more.

It seems that talking about this issue now is "outdated", but time flies, and the winter vacation is about to begin. For the sake of the future of the entire country and nation, we cannot ignore the importance of education. I am a student with limited wisdom and knowledge. My humble opinions may not be appropriate. I hope that people with knowledge will not hesitate to correct me. It would be fortunate for me, and fortunate for the country. (Li Wenxue)

The Swindle of a Night School Principal

I am a poor child who has dropped out of school because my family is poor and I have no money to go to a private school. I have to stay at home. One day, I went to the road to play and saw an advertisement for enrollment in a (compulsory night school for knowledge). (Class time is 6:00 PM-9:00 PM) Report address (in 557 Changde Road, also falsely named (Student Union) School starts on September 9th. I immediately signed up and paid a deposit of 10,000 yuan, and they gave me a receipt. There were more than 400 classmates. After a few days, the principal (Shen Shouyan) escaped and disappeared. There were no classes and no one could find him. Until now, there is no news. I think, isn't this 10,000 yuan my father's sweat and blood? I hope that the authorities will read about this very sad thing and help me catch this swindler principal and punish him. This is a great merit! (Lu Jinfang, a poor child who has dropped out of school)

Please Consider the Principles for Establishing Night Schools

I read in your newspaper on September 27th a news item entitled "The Issue of Establishing Night Schools in Higher Vocational Schools." One of the principles decided by the Ministry of Education is: "Higher vocational schools may establish night schools, but these are not formal schools, but schools of a supplementary nature." I believe that this move has a great impact on the future of vocational youth and is tantamount to closing the door for vocational youth to study. At a time when living is difficult and the number of people who have dropped out of school and are unemployed is large, it seems necessary for the Ministry of Education to consider it. (Qinghao)

### Guo Taiqi Serves as Chairman of the Final Conference; Peace Conference Held Closing Ceremony Yesterday; South Country Representatives Dissatisfied with the Italian Peace Treaty and Refused to Participate; Four Foreign Ministers Gave Speeches Encouraging Each Other to Strive for Peace

[Our Report] London, 15th, Broadcast: After two months of discussion, the Paris Peace Conference finally held its last meeting at 3 p.m. today (Greenwich Mean Time, 11 p.m. Shanghai Time). In this final act, the Yugoslav representative put on a surprising performance, announcing that the South Country could not accept the treaty with Italy passed by the majority of the conference and decided to withdraw from the conference. This episode was unexpected by the representatives, and the action taken was the same as that taken by Soviet representative Gromyko in the Security Council. The American representative was the first to arrive, followed by the Soviet and British representatives, and Bidault was the last. The chairman was Guo Taiqi, the Chinese representative. Guo gave a closing speech, praising the achievements of the conference and saying that peace is indivisible. He hoped that all countries would eliminate prejudices and work for peace. Guo then officially read a letter from Yugoslavia, stating the reasons for the South Country representatives' withdrawal. At this point, Bernes took the floor and said that countries should not only know each other, but also recognize their respective responsibilities, eliminate prejudices, and work together for peace.

Those who hoard essential foods for profit are now ready to emerge; however, the truly hateful ones are those selfish people who encourage retailers to break price controls in order to gain political benefits. Wages and prices are closely related, so wage controls will also be terminated concurrently. This move does not mean the end of the entire price control policy. Some price controls, such as rent, will continue to be managed for a long time; other parts of basic raw materials and scarce daily necessities will also continue to be managed, pending a major increase in production.

### Pork and the U.S. Congressional Election

— Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing

The Congressional election in early November is just around the corner. The biggest topic for election competition is not major policies for governing the country, whether domestic or foreign, but the current severe "meat shortage" issue. The Wallace incident also caused a stir in the United States, but the Wallace incident is not the main target affecting the election. The newsreel of Wallace's resignation is being shown throughout the United States. Half of the audience warmly applauded Wallace, and half applauded Byrnes; when President Truman's photo was shown, a few clapped, and a few booed. This is a microcosm of public opinion in a part of American society, and also a microcosm of the political awareness of Americans. But these are not enough to influence the election. Americans, accustomed to material life, bluntly say: They are very "indifferent" to politics. The Republican Party, which has been silent for many years, saw this point clearly. Therefore, it does not use the Wallace incident and the "differentiation" of the Democratic Party as an excuse to attack the Democratic Party. Republican campaigners tell the people every day: "Don't you have pork and beef to eat? Elect the Republican Party and the Republican Party will give you food!" The New York Times' Sunday supplement satirically quipped: "Unexpectedly, the meat shortage issue has become the current political bomb." In fact, the United States has plenty of pigs, cattle, and livestock. Like us foreign reporters in New York, we go to restaurants every day and there are plenty of meat dishes. It seemed that only one day, I ordered a "pork chop" and the waiter said no, and I never encountered a meat shortage again. Those who have truly experienced "not knowing the taste of meat for three months" are housewives who emphasize "economy." What they want is cheap, official-price pork, which is disappointing nine out of ten times. The American black market is everywhere. Compared with the sophisticated American-style politics, it is truly worlds apart. Why is the black market full of it? Because there is the OPA—the U.S. Office of Price Administration. The more restrictions the Price Control Bureau imposes, the more active the black market becomes. American public opinion attacks on the Price Control Bureau are daily and lengthy; however, the OPA once planned to abolish, and finally remained. Columbia students once distributed leaflets and launched student movements to retain the OPA. The family members of government employees in Washington once demonstrated in front of the Capitol, opposing the abolition of the OPA. They said: The OPA system is a "benevolent policy" left by President Roosevelt. Now that American inflation is so severe, once the OPA is abolished, entrepreneurs will get rich, and public employees will suffer even more! However, from whatever perspective, the existence of the OPA today more or less hinders production. Republican Congressman Rogers said in Congress the day before yesterday: "Please ask the President to think of emergency measures to abolish the OPA; once prices are allowed to float, production will be enthusiastic; according to the law of supply and demand, the more production, the lower the prices will fall." He also said: The meat shortage problem is easy to solve, the key lies in the President's determination. A spokesman for the Price Control Bureau said at a press conference: "The blind Republican congressmen are talking nonsense all day long. What do they know about economics?" He said, based on the statistics of experts from the Department of Agriculture, that the meat shortage problem can be completely eliminated within two months, and by the beginning of next year, the meat supply will be excessive. The day after he made his statement, more than eighty butchers in New York jointly wrote to the President, explaining the difficulties of their closure; specifically criticizing the fallacies of the experts from the Department of Agriculture. Their letter said: "If the government's current regulatory policies are not changed, then not only will the meat shortage not be solved in two months, but it will be permanently out of balance in two years." The New York Daily News, the newspaper with the largest circulation in the United States, has photos, pictures, and comments attacking the OPA almost every day. They published many photos of closed butcher shops, and also published many housewives with "empty" vegetable baskets. The situation in Chicago is also the same. Ninety percent of the butcher shops have already closed; 15,000 employees and workers in slaughterhouses and butcher shops are now unemployed. In any case, such a phenomenon of imbalance is ultimately a major crisis for the Democratic government in the election. The Truman government has convened several cabinet meetings to discuss resisting this "bomb" for congressional elections. Army generals support the current government. The Department of Defense first "takes the lead" and announced that the amount of meat purchased by officers and soldiers across the country belonging to the department will be reduced by 3 million pounds per week, so that the general public will have more opportunities to buy pork. Secretary of Agriculture Anderson is always optimistic, and he confidently announced to the outside world: Although the meat shortage problem is serious, the situation is improving. He cited the "Federal Slaughtering Company" as an example, saying that in the third week of September, the Federal Slaughtering Company slaughtered a total of 78,000 pigs, an increase of more than 13,000 heads compared with the third week of August; by analogy, the pre-war state will be fully restored within two months. New York Times reporter Houston sent a dispatch from Washington to New York saying; Anderson's optimistic tone "cannot be proved within two months." Truman himself is quite caught in a dilemma. His melancholy and hesitation in domestic affairs have the same point as his helplessness in diplomacy. He said: The OPA cannot be abolished at present, but how to remedy the malpractices of price controls, he has never said a reason. The press has many unspeakable feelings about the Truman government. The New York World-Telegram drew a cartoon of Truman sleeping soundly, the sunlight outside the window has already entered the room, but the president is still lying in bed, with the words next to him: "Mr. Truman, wake up! Your country is facing danger!" The day after Wallace was expelled from the cabinet, word came from Washington: OPA Director Porter was said to be about to become Secretary of Commerce, and many commentators who were usually dissatisfied with the OPA were shocked. Later, Harriman was announced as the successor to the Secretary of Commerce. The New York Daily News said: "Oh my God! Luckily it wasn't this guy!" The Telegraph and the Daily News are both newspapers close to the Democratic Party. Roosevelt, a great man of the Democratic Party, is still praised by the American people today; however, the "benevolent policies" left by Roosevelt in domestic and foreign affairs have now reached a crossroads. Should we continue to move forward? Or should we take this opportunity to turn around? Truman felt that it was difficult to choose between the two. The American people are now thinking: Should they take this opportunity to change their tastes, which they are tired of eating! (September 29th, New York Shipping News.)

### The End of Graft and Dereliction of Duty by Officials Accepting Takeovers; Jiang Gongmei Executed by Firing Squad; Original Sentence of Five and a Half Years of Imprisonment Changed to Death by Order; Whole Year from Arrest to Execution; Six Suicide Notes Claiming to Be Patriots

[Our Correspondent] Jiang Gongmei, the former captain of the Shanghai Gendarmerie, was reported for crimes such as corruption, dereliction of duty, and embezzlement. The Songhu Garrison Command sent personnel to arrest him in the late evening of October 14 last year. He has been transferred and escorted lightly over the past year. He was transferred to Nanjing, Chongqing, and finally ordered to be sent to the Songhu Garrison Command for trial. After a joint trial by the Military Law Department, he was sentenced to five years and six months of imprisonment, and was sent to Shanghai Prison for detention. The department received a telegram from the Ministry of National Defense (No. 01994) the day before yesterday, which read: "Defendant Jiang Gongmei should be changed to the death penalty, and deprived of public rights for life. You must follow the order and report the date of execution along with photos for record." So, at 11:00 AM yesterday morning, Jiang was taken back from Shanghai Prison to the Garrison Command Detention Center. At that time, the American criminal was wearing a yellow suit shirt, a wool vest, blue cloth overalls, gray socks, and black leather slippers, and his face was haggard. Seeing the strict precautions, he knew that there was little hope of survival. So, after arriving at the detention center, he asked for paper and pen and wrote six suicide notes, which were sent to his parents, wife, etc. At 2:30 PM, the soldiers of the Special Service Company took him out again. Director Xu read out the charges and told him that he would be executed immediately. If he had any last words, they could be conveyed. Jiang acted calmly and only said, "I am a patriot. I am not a soldier. After my death, please ask the news media to collect more information about me." He was immediately bound, and a sign was inserted on his back with the words "Ordered to Execute the Corrupt Official Jiang Gongmei". He was escorted to the Song Park execution ground and executed immediately. Two shots were fired, both entering from the back and exiting from the chest and abdomen. He fell to the ground and died. The body was collected by Pushan Villa. When the body was collected, the rope was untied by the coolie and roughly put into a thin coffin. It is found that the American criminal is 32 years old and from Xuzhou. (The picture shows the American criminal after the execution.)

### Case Files of the Grain Loan Case Transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office Today

[Our Correspondent] The sensational grain loan fraud case has been transferred to the judicial authorities for trial by order of Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek]. The Songhu Garrison Command followed the order and transferred all the criminals, together with the case files, to the District Prosecutor's Office today.

### Municipal Council; Police Affairs Committee Subcommittee Meeting; Fang Zhichao and Liu Xuehai Attend to Report on Narcotics Control

[Our Correspondent] The Police Affairs Committee of the Municipal Council held its second subcommittee meeting at the Council in Fuming Village at 3:00 PM yesterday. Eighteen members of the group attended, with Hou Jiyuan as chairman. Police Bureau Director Fang Zhichao and Liu Xuehai, Special Commissioner for Narcotics Control in Jiangsu and Shanghai Area of the Ministry of Interior, attended to report.

Director Fang first reported on the training of volunteer police in the city. He also said that in accordance with the mayor's instructions, the number of volunteer police should be expanded to 10,000, and recruitment is currently planned. Director Fang continued to describe the narcotics control situation in the city, saying: After the central decree was approved on January 12 this year, the narcotics control work was carried out in three phases: (1) From January to March was the period for registration and self-renewal. By the end of March, a total of 6,060 addicts had been registered. (2) April to June was the period for ordering abstinence. Those who still did not abstain by the end of June would be investigated. (3) July 1 was the testing period, divided into two parts: those who were literate and those who were illiterate were tested by the Narcotics Testing Institute, and those who were toxic and non-toxic were tested by the Health Testing Institute. However, due to limited funds, the Municipal Government allocated more than 17.8 million [yuan] to the Testing Institute, plus a total testing income of more than 21 million [yuan]. As a result, addicts had to provide their own clothes, and various abuses such as smuggling occurred.

### Many Difficulties in Registration and Testing

There are two registration methods: regional testing and comprehensive testing, with age as the order, with the youngest tested first. Most smokers are 35 years old, the youngest is 19 years old, and the oldest is 76 years old. However, many difficulties arise during testing, such as changes in the address of the registrant, making it impossible to reach them, and there are also many false registrations, because during the enemy puppet period, people went to register and could be allocated opium, so even now some people still go to register with this delusion. In addition, there are substitutions for testing. As a result, of the more than 2,000 people who should be tested, only more than 1,000 have been reached so far. And addicts often do not spend money differently, and abuses abound, so it is hoped that the amount of reporting will be increased.

### Three Principles of Opium Suppression

Commissioner Liu stated: My mission is to supervise and assess local opium suppression efforts. The central government's opium suppression policy adheres to three principles: diligent education, strict punishment, and conservation. Opium suppression is a prerequisite for nation-building. While Shanghai's opium suppression efforts have achieved good results, they are still insufficient. Pre-war surveys in Shanghai, registered with the Ministry of Interior, showed over 40,000 opium addicts when the population was only three million. During the eight years of resistance against Japan, the enemy implemented a policy of poisoning, so the current number is at least higher than before. Therefore, I appeal to the citizens of Shanghai to jointly assist the government in eradicating opium. The Shanghai Municipal Council should lead and promote this work. Municipal councils in Beiping and Tianjin have all organized anti-drug groups, and it is hoped that Shanghai will have a similar organization. Otherwise, we hope to mobilize this work as much as possible. Afterwards, various council members offered opinions to Director Fang. Director Fang supplemented the report, stating that the police bureau has been working hard on the final opium suppression efforts, strictly investigating drug traffickers, and strengthening export investigations. It was reported that foreign ships sailing from Shanghai to Manila were also found to be carrying opium, morphine, and other drugs. Other measures being taken include summoning lower-level detectives to conduct investigations and using police dogs for sniffing.

### Five Measures Passed for Opium and Drug Suppression Work

Finally, the conference discussed a proposal submitted for deliberation, the subject of which was to request the municipal government to strengthen opium and drug suppression work, and to destroy the seized drugs monthly by burning them to prevent malfeasance. The resolution passed five measures: (1) Thoroughly investigate the source and destination of drugs, preventing military and police protection and bribery. (2) Drugs seized by all levels of agencies, regardless of the quantity, should be publicly announced monthly for their use, and burned publicly in a centralized manner to avoid long-term corruption and demonstrate integrity. (3) In addition to citizens voluntarily reporting crimes, all bureaus and police officers should be strictly ordered to enforce inspections. (4) Informants must be rewarded with bonuses, which should be designated by the municipal government. (5) The standards for reporting crimes should be relaxed, and false accusers must be punished in turn. The meeting adjourned at six o'clock.

### Gang Fight Over Pier: Assault Charges Withdrawn; Nine Defendants Tried Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] The Third Criminal Court of the District Court heard a gang fight case yesterday afternoon. The luggage and cargo handling at the Dada Pier in this city was originally contracted by foreman Zhang Changsong. In March of this year, another foreman, Zhang Jinding, also submitted an application to the authorities, intending to operate at the Dada Pier. The pier workers have deep-seated prejudices and absolutely do not allow outsiders to join. Knowing that it would not be easy to enter the workplace, Zhang Jinding invited Inspector Wang Renxun of the 8th Brigade of the Traffic Police on April 1, leading officers Zhou Yuan, Zhang Bin, Zhang Tianxi, Li Lyun, Xu Yongmei, Liang Guoneng of the 1st Battalion and 2nd Company, armed with live ammunition, and gathered dozens of laborers including Bao Adang, to attack at 9:00 AM, intending to seize the pier by force. Zhang Changsong had also received the news earlier and gathered dozens of his subordinates to stand guard. The two sides clashed, leading to a gang fight with wooden sticks and iron rulers. Wang Renxun and others even opened fire, and nearby military police rushed to suppress the situation and disarmed the traffic police Wang Renxun and others. Ten laborers including Wang Acai, Zhu Shunshi, Li Ruchun, Yang Chun, and Yan Shengmei, as well as passersby Tao Fojiu and Tang Hanlin, were injured on the spot. Twenty-six laborers from both sides who participated in the fight and the masterminds Zhang Jinding and Zhang Changsong were all arrested on the spot and handed over to the Garrison Headquarters by the police station. Because the traffic police were not active soldiers, they were all transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office, where the prosecutor charged them with attempted murder, assault, and disturbing order. During the trial yesterday, all seven traffic police officers denied intentionally participating in the gang fight, claiming that they were chasing a deserter and accidentally got caught in the fight. All twenty-six defendants also appeared in court. With the consent of both parties, the assault charges were withdrawn; the trial for the seven traffic police officers and two foremen on the charge of disturbing order is scheduled for sentencing on the morning of the 19th.

### Miss Panda Gracefully Arrives in Shanghai; Long Journey Leaves Her Weary; Far From Her Home, She is Melancholy and Unhappy; Transfers to Flight to the United States the Day After Tomorrow

Miss Panda, who will be traveling to the United States on the 18th, arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight at 3:30 PM yesterday. Section Chief Zhang Pengren of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education is escorting her. From Chengdu to Chongqing to Shanghai, Miss Panda, who has been confined to a wooden cage, is weary from the long air flight, and her countenance appears quite haggard. Miss Panda is less than one year old and was recently captured in Wenchuan. Her mother was shot dead. Since leaving her home of lush bamboo forests, she has been melancholy and unhappy, silently hanging her head all day long. She has also been suffering from a minor illness in recent days. She was given several injections and medication before coming to Shanghai. Her right leg was unfortunately injured by a hunter and is being treated. This panda has fur that is half black and half white, with black circles around her eyes, a slightly pointed mouth, narrow eyes, and long, fluffy fur. She weighs over fifty pounds and is over three feet tall when standing. She is extremely shy around people. This is the eighth panda to be captured. The pandas previously gifted to the United States by our government unfortunately died young. Now, this rare treasure is once again being gifted to the United States. The American side has sent a medical officer, Sidney, to accompany her along the way to the United States. The Bronn Zoo in New York has been specially designated as Miss Panda's boudoir, and Dr. Dwyre has been assigned to take care of her daily life. Dr. Dwyre has already researched everything about pandas. Apart from fresh bamboo shoots, pandas do not eat other food. The American side has prepared everything according to the needs of the panda. This small animal, whose "value has increased tenfold after ascending the dragon gate," is scheduled to fly to the United States on the 18th aboard a transport plane from Far East Air Transport. After arriving in Shanghai, she will be staying at the Hongkou Slaughterhouse. Her transportation fee from Chongqing to Shanghai amounts to 60,936,000 yuan, which is more expensive than a passenger ticket.

### Leader of the First Comfort Mission for Wounded Soldiers, Deng Wenyi, Receives Reporters; Explains Various Points of Comfort, Conscription, Reorganization, and Compensation

[Our Newspaper] The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense and the First Comfort Mission for Wounded Soldiers hosted reporters yesterday at the New Life Club. General Deng Wenyi, Director of the Bureau and Leader of the First Mission, reported on the work of the News Bureau, the situation of wounded and sick officers and soldiers, comfort efforts, conscription, demobilized officers and soldiers, and compensation for the wounded and dead.

### Establishment of the News Bureau

General Deng stated: The News Bureau has been established for three months, and there are three main areas of responsibility: (1) All reports and educational affairs related to the military; (2) Military legislation and liaison; (3) Establishing relationships with society. Deng said that the bureau has been tasked with collecting, organizing, and analyzing national and even global public opinion on military affairs in our country, and then submitting it to various officials for reference as soon as possible, and printing it into booklets for distribution to middle and upper-level military officers across the country. At the same time, it is responsible for releasing various military-related information. The bureau's agencies include: (1) The Military News Agency, which was established on Double Ten Day and will establish a branch in Shanghai no later than next month; (2) The Youth Military Publishing House—which will continue to publish various military publications.

### Organization of Four Missions for Separate Comfort

Regarding the issue of comforting wounded soldiers, during the eight years of resistance against Japan, the casualties among national army officers and soldiers were extremely heavy. There were still 100,000 wounded at the time of victory. As of last month, there were still 70,000. The Chairman expressed deep concern and has conducted three or more comfort activities. Recently, the Ministry of National Defense has established four comfort missions to conduct comfort activities and to inspect hospital facilities and the living conditions of wounded soldiers. The first mission is responsible for Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Fujian, Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Southern Shandong, and the Jiaoji area; the second mission is responsible for Wuhan, Zhengzhou, and Xi'an; the third mission is responsible for Hebei and Shanxi; the fourth mission is responsible for Northeast China. They began departing since Double Ten Day.

General Deng personally leads the first mission and has been in Shanghai for three days, inspecting three wounded soldier hospitals and one branch hospital in the city, accommodating approximately 2,000 wounded and sick officers and soldiers, with officers accounting for approximately 5%. Generally speaking, the living conditions are still good. He brought some comfort money and comfort goods, each person receiving a small bag of rations, a set of cotton shirts and trousers, a pair of shoes and socks, a towel, and several booklets. In addition, they each received comfort money ranging from 5,000 to 50,000 yuan. He deeply hopes that the public can also be encouraged to act bravely and generously contribute to comfort the heroic soldiers.

### Regarding Reorganization

The National Army has been reduced from fifty-nine armies to fifty-nine divisions, and 160,000 officers have been demobilized. They have either retired or been reorganized into the reserves. Due to the failure to implement the military reorganization plan and the ceasefire agreement, they have not been able to change their professions. It is hoped that a solution can be found in three to six months. These veterans have survived hundreds of battles, and it is hoped that society can give them sympathy and comfort.

### Conscription Aspect

The Military Service Law has now been passed and has been implemented since Double Ten Day. The conscription system is the foundation of a nation. Any country must establish a military service system before it can form an army. In the past, due to insufficient preparation, there may have been malpractices in conscription. Efforts should be made to improve this in the future, striving to obtain one to two million well-trained soldiers within a year and a half. However, conscription must strive for fairness, and the treatment and clothing of new recruits must also be improved.

### Compensation Paid for Fallen Soldiers

As for the wounded and dead soldiers, the statistics during the eight years of resistance against Japan are not accurate, but it is estimated that there are 3 million people. However, the Ministry of National Defense only has records for less than 500,000 people. Most of them already have families, and the living conditions of orphans and widows are the responsibility of those who have not died. The Ministry of National Defense's Compensation Office has recently registered only 50,000 people, perhaps due to the relatively complicated registration procedures. Therefore, it has now been improved. As long as it is proven that they have indeed died, compensation will be paid. The family can receive hundreds of thousands of yuan per year, as well as rice and grain subsidies. Anyone related to fallen soldiers should fulfill their responsibility to rescue the dying and heal the wounded, publicize it widely, and report to the Ministry of National Defense to console the heroic souls in the afterlife. If this matter can be properly resolved, then in the event of national crisis, it can inspire future generations, which is of great importance, and the media should publicize it widely.

### National Unification Is the Beginning of Peace

After Director Deng finished speaking, someone in the audience requested Deng to express his opinion on the overall situation in his capacity as spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense. Deng modestly stated that he was originally a military reporter and would like to make an observation from the standpoint of a reporter. He then stated: The National Army truly hopes for national unification at an early date and does not want to see war again. However, since the publication of the military reorganization plan in January, the Communist Party has consistently failed to understand the government's painstaking efforts to resolve the situation politically, which is regrettable. After the second ceasefire order was issued on June 7, the National Army was in a position of being beaten passively. In the recent two or three months, the Communist Army's mobilization order was issued, and "cleansing" and "struggle" were carried out everywhere, and the people have suffered greatly, which is intolerable. Therefore, the National Army launched a counterattack to save the people from fire and water, because transportation could not be restored, and the people could not survive. However, "fighting leads to understanding," and the Communist Army should now know the strength of the National Army today. However, the National Army only seeks the nationalization of the army, and if the military reorganization plan can be implemented, the National Army has no intention of fighting. The country must be unified before there can be peace. I firmly believe that if the military service law can be implemented and transportation can be restored, then military conflict may also stop.

### The Concubine of Wang Qiusheng of Dachang Was Shot to Death by Her Paramour in the Middle of the Night

[Our Newspaper] Wang Qiusheng, a well-known figure in Dachang Township, was killed and beheaded during the War of Resistance Against Japan. His concubine, Si Jindi (a local, 24 years old), was restless. This spring, she had an affair with a soldier surnamed Liu stationed in a certain team in Dachang and began living with him. They opened the Shuanglongchun Restaurant in the western market of the town. Last month, they hired Wang Hua, an 18-year-old girl, as a hostess. The three lived together in the store. On the third day of this month, for unknown reasons, Si Jindi was suddenly shot in the left lower abdomen, which pierced her back. Liu used a car to rush her to the Shanghai Municipal Fifth Hospital for treatment. Because the shooting occurred in the middle of the night, the neighbors were all fast asleep and did not know the situation. She died in the hospital on the 13th due to her injuries. Her father, Si Jintao, took the body back for burial and reported the situation to the police station for investigation. Liu had already fled. The military and police authorities are currently searching for him.

He wanted to return to Minhou and asked to borrow 70,000 to 80,000 yuan for travel expenses. Squadron leader Yang suspected that Lin's words were inconsistent and questioned him in detail.

### ### Pu Yi's Sister-in-Law, Saga Hiro, Captured After Fleeing from Tonghua to Linjiang: Imperial Dreams Shattered, Priceless Treasures Lost, Bitterly Recounts the Past

The Northeast Supervisory Group of the War Crimes Processing Commission was ordered to go to the Northeast to supervise the repatriation of Japanese prisoners and the processing of war criminals. On September 16 of this year, Wu Boxiang, a member of the group, arrested Saga Hirohime (37 years old), the Japanese wife of Pu Jie, brother of the puppet emperor Pu Yi, and her seven-year-old daughter at the Japanese concentration camp in Jinzhou. They were transferred to Shanghai via Ping and will be escorted to the capital for prosecution in the coming days. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Saga yesterday morning. This descendant of the royal family, now a prisoner, recounted the past with shame and grief.

Pu Yi, the puppet emperor of Manchuria, and his brother Pu Jie, as well as the second, third, and fifth princesses (meaning Manchu sisters), shared the same mother. There were also the sixth and seventh princesses, born to another mother, who currently reside in Peiping with Pu Yi's father, Prince Chun. Pu Yi and others resided in Changchun, which was called the "New Capital." Previously, because Empress Qiuhong (Japanese) of Pu Yi had no offspring, the Japanese wanted to repeat the history of Korea in the puppet state of Manchuria. Therefore, they pressured Pu Yi to promulgate the Imperial Succession Law on March 1, 1937. On April 3 of the same year, with Honjo Shigeru, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army and chief culprit of the September 18 Incident, as matchmaker, Saga Hiro, daughter of Marquis Saga Saneto of Japan, was married to Pu Jie. The intention was to have Pu Jie's son inherit the puppet throne of Manchuria in the future. However, two daughters were born after the marriage. The elder daughter, Guisheng, is currently in Tokyo. The younger daughter, *Sheng*, is the one who was arrested this time. Fortunately, with the victory of the War of Resistance, the Japanese conspiracy dissolved into nothing. It is said that Saga speaks fluent Mandarin, but she did not use Mandarin when interviewed by the reporter. Yesterday, Saga wore a black cheongsam, a green wool short jacket, and yellow leather shoes. Her hair was styled in the modern fashion of contemporary women. If not for her thick legs, one would not suspect her of being a Japanese woman at first glance. Her maid also wore a blue cheongsam. However, Saga's face was thin and her expression was rather haggard, revealing a hint of reluctance, as she did not forget her status as a "princess."

The Experience of Being Captured

According to Saga, on August 10, the day after Japan's surrender, Pu Yi led his brother Pu Jie, the empress, concubines, and palace attendants to Tonghua to seek refuge. Pu Yi and his brother Pu Jie planned to fly to Japan. However, because the plane in Tonghua was small and did not have much fuel, they took a plane to Shenyang, preparing to change planes to go to Japan. However, when changing planes in Shenyang, they were captured by the Soviet army. At this time, Saga and Empress Qiuhong heard the news and left Tonghua for Linjiang in the east, attempting to go to Japan via Korea. Before long, the Communist army captured Linjiang, and Saga and others were arrested. Several boxes of rare treasures that Pu Yi and others were carrying were all looted by the Communist army. At this point, Saga boasted about the many royal treasures. According to her, most of the treasures in the palace were left in Changchun and taken away by the Soviet army. Those carried by Pu Yi were all rare items. She firmly believed that each type of treasure was the only one of its kind in the world. However, when the Communist army looted them, her servants hid a small amount of money in their pillows, so they were spared. But two weeks later, the Communist army came twice, and even the small amount of money hidden in the pillows was swept away. At the same time, Pu Yi's Empress Qiuhong was imprisoned in an iron cage by the Communist army, subjected to ridicule and abuse. In addition, Qiuhong had always had a hibiscus addiction. The "generation of empresses" suffered humiliation and soon died. The palace attendants who accompanied them fled one after another. Saga and her daughter, along with the second, third, and fifth princesses, were taken to Harbin.

Skilled in Disguise

After arriving in Harbin, Saga disguised herself as a Japanese resident, changed her name to Hamaguchi, and hired Kumamoto Masakimi as a servant, living in seclusion. A month ago, after Li Lisan of the Communist side went to Changchun to exchange views on the repatriation of Japanese residents, Saga and her daughter were mixed in among them, attempting to return to Japan. The general Japanese prisoners along the way knew that they were members of the royal family and did their best to cover them up. Although the Northeast Supervisory Group of the War Crimes Processing Commission had Saga's wedding photos, they were unable to identify her due to her skillful disguise. Finally, they learned of her whereabouts in a certain room in the Jinzhou concentration camp, so they led troops to the area. Although they were hidden by senior Japanese prisoner officials, they finally discovered the truth and arrested them. After Saga was taken to Peiping, she requested to visit her father-in-law at Prince Chun's residence. After being granted permission, she was accompanied by Wu Boxiang, a member of the group. After being taken to Shanghai, she wrote the words "I am the sister-in-law of Emperor Pu Yi" to demand improved meals because she was dissatisfied with the food.

### All Unapproved Radio Stations Must Immediately Cease Broadcasting

All public broadcasting stations in this city were previously convened for a meeting by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. It was resolved that all radio stations should, before October 15, follow the procedures for applying for a public radio station and submit their applications to the competent authorities for approval by the Ministry of Communications (i.e., obtain an order from the Ministry of Communications approving the establishment). If the approval order from the Ministry of Communications has not been received by the deadline, it will be considered as having no legal basis and should automatically cease broadcasting from this date. Otherwise, the Telecommunications Bureau will immediately cooperate with the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to enforce the cessation of broadcasting. It is now verified that the deadline has passed, and it is heard that the Telecommunications Bureau is handling the execution procedures with the relevant authorities.

### Municipal Government's Materials Receiving Office to Close at the End of This Month

According to Xie Haoling, director of the Municipal Government's Materials Receiving and Management Office, the office's operations are scheduled to end at the end of this month. After the closure, all unfinished business will be transferred to the Bureau for the Management of Enemy and Puppet Assets. After the office closes, Xie will devote himself to his position as Secretary-General of the Port Affairs Committee.

### National Products Exhibition Opens Yesterday Morning: Promoting Production and Advocating Simplicity

[This newspaper's report] The National Products Exhibition Market, sponsored by the Shanghai Branch of the China Production Promotion Association and supported by four organizations, including the National Products Factory Federation, the Machine-Made Factory Federation, the Shanghai Branch of the National Industry Association, and the Patriotic Products Association, held its opening ceremony at 444 Nanjing West Road at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. At the entrance of the venue, dozens of large and small national flags were hung, adorned with red, white, and blue bunting. The walls were decorated with strings of colorful small light bulbs and the words "Using National Products is Most Glorious," as well as a large oil painting of Chairman Chiang. Mayor Wu personally attended the opening ceremony on time yesterday morning, and Mrs. Mao Shengdong cut the ribbon. The ceremony was held in the tea room of the market, with approximately 300 attendees, including Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Shui Xiangyun, Wang Xiaolai, Xie Haoling, and Zhang Xiaosong.

Chairman Mao Qingxiang was absent due to illness and was replaced by Zhang Zilian, who briefly stated: "The Production Promotion Association was established during the War of Resistance, with the purpose of promoting production and developing China's economy. Using national products is the glory of the nation. We hope that the Chinese people will use more national products in the future to promote production." Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, saying: "I have three hopes for the national products market: (1) Investors must improve technology, implement scientific management, and strive for excellence in their products. (2) Workers should endure hardship and work hard, strengthen work efficiency, and cooperate closely with investors. (3) I hope that national products exhibitions can penetrate the countryside so that the masses in the interior can adopt them, and then the future of national products will be limitless." Fang Zhi, director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, said that what China needs most at present is to solve the people's livelihood problems. He hoped that people in the industrial and commercial sectors would work hard to develop industry, overthrow bureaucratic capitalism, and prevent industrial development from being affected by unexpected blows. They should also find ways to guide idle capital to engage in production and construction. Hu Boxiang, a representative of the manufacturers, delivered a reply, encouraging his colleagues not to be selfish and self-serving, but to take the entire nation as their premise and work together as one. Finally, Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, reiterating the slogan of "promoting national products" before the War of Resistance, and said that China is an agricultural country. National products are all agricultural products, and promoting national products is to support agriculture. China has always admired simplicity. National products are all simple, and we should not be attracted by "beauty." We should advocate simplicity and avoid "beauty." The opening ceremony was completed in music at 11:00 a.m.

The Land Administration Bureau specially convened the second session of the Standard Land Value Appraisal Committee the day before yesterday, and decided that the land value tax to be levied this year should be based on the land value determined by the first session of the Standard Land Value Appraisal Committee of the city on January 25 of this year (i.e., the land value declared by each business owner when applying for registration) as the standard, in order to adapt to the facts and facilitate implementation. The Land Administration Bureau is now compiling the land value register based on this resolution, so that it can be levied as scheduled.

### Vanishing Vessel of the Administrative Yuan's Water Transport Team: Iraqi Marine Engineer Suspected and Accused

[This newspaper's report] A small steamship named Wanquan, belonging to the Water Transport Brigade of the Shanghai Branch of the Administrative Yuan, suddenly disappeared on September 15 of this year. After investigation by the brigade in various aspects, it was learned that Li Weisan, an Iraqi marine engineer on the ship, was highly suspected. Dong Wennuofu, the legal representative of the brigade, filed a lawsuit with the court. Yesterday morning, the court held a hearing on the case. Witnesses Lin Agou and Lu Asan both testified that the defendant had indeed stolen the ship. The defendant claimed: Agou and Asan have a grudge against the defendant, and I did not steal the ship. The court adjourned the hearing and postponed the trial. The defendant was released on bail.

### The O'Hara Agency Espionage Case: Italian Radio Operator Testifies in Court, Confesses to Intercepting Aircraft Intelligence Within Chinese Territory

[This newspaper's report] The person who testified in court yesterday in the O'Hara Agency espionage case was an Italian named Montovani. This person was one of the radio operators hired by the O'Hara Agency around the time of Germany's surrender.

Montovani said: After Germany's surrender, the O'Hara Agency continued to hire Italian radio operators and used Goebbels-style propaganda methods to express concern for Italy and induce them to continue working. Before May 8, 1945, his job was to record broadcasts from foreign radio stations and intercept communications from China Airlines regarding the movements of aircraft within Chinese territory. In addition, he searched for British and American underground radio stations in Annam. When the news of Germany's surrender came, he immediately left the agency and worked as a waiter at a hotel. But in June 1945, Laski, one of the defendants, came to him and said that there was work to do, instructing him to visit O'Hara, the person in charge, at the agency on Xiaoshadu Road.

O'Hara explained to him that the agency had restarted its operations and strongly emphasized the Germans' concern for Italy and persuaded him to continue working.

After that, three other Italians joined the O'Hara Agency with him, but their work was limited to receiving TASS news reports. At that time, the monthly salary was 400,000 yuan in puppet currency.

After Montovani's testimony, Colonel Bao Ding, the defendant's lawyer, stood up and said that the salaries of these Italian radio operators were paid by Japanese officials, and they also received flour rations from the Japanese authorities, so they could not have been hired by the O'Hara Agency. However, Prosecutor Dewey presented a rebuttal, which was the confession of Kengo, an accountant of the former Japanese military department in Shanghai, proving that he had paid money to the O'Hara Agency through a Japanese liaison officer, and that the amount paid after Germany's surrender had increased.

### Letters

To the editor: I am writing to inform you that the news item in the local news section on page 5 of the second section of your newspaper on October 15 regarding the Yu Ying warehouse robbery on a rainy night, in which a member of the water police was said to have obtained stolen goods and three colleagues were also detained, is not consistent with the facts. According to this sub-bureau's file number 10610, police officer Ju Shixian asked for leave but left without permission and went to work at the Hongkou Daye Printing Factory.

### Tax Evasion: A Few Tricks in the Entertainment, Wine, and Food Industry

This is old news from the enemy-puppet era, but it is impossible to guarantee that it does not still exist today.

[Special Feature by This Newspaper] This is not the exposure of corruption where someone has been caught red-handed with stolen goods. I have collected some information from various sources, simply to illustrate that although Shanghai has a huge amount of tax revenue, not every penny goes to the municipal treasury. What I am describing here is old news – old news that everyone notices but no one mentions. The reason I am not saying anything new is because I do not have sufficient evidence and am afraid of legal liability.

During the period when Shanghai was under occupation, tax evasion became a very common phenomenon. What I want to talk about here are theaters, dance halls, cafes, and restaurants. Because these places have a large number of consumers every day, a large amount of tax revenue every day, and also a large amount of leakage.

Old-Style Restaurants

The puppet Finance Bureau had the most trouble with the taxes of old-style restaurants. They had no accounting system. They used a trust-based ledger, simply making a simple entry in the ledger when something was sold. Besides that, there was nothing else. The puppet Finance Bureau had no authority to tell them to hire an accountant. If they recorded less in the ledger, the leakage of taxes would be remarkably considerable. For example, when a regular customer finished eating and the waiter brought the bill, he would always smile and flatter the guest, saying, "I didn't write the tax on for you," so that the guest would generously use that tax as an extra tip. If that customer had a gun, he would definitely say aggressively, "Damn it, do I need to pay taxes too?" Naturally, the cost of this shouting was tax exemption. But the boss would not take the exempt tax out of his own pocket. The way to make up for it was, of course, to record less in the ledger. Since the ledger could record less by one entry, less by two entries, less by three entries, all the way to countless entries, what did it matter? But too much greed was still dangerous. When the whole room was full of people and the smell of alcohol, the sudden arrival of the tax inspector would reveal many loopholes. If the bill for that room exceeded the total income of any day in the ledger, it would be enough to show that the past business reports were completely unreliable. As a result, fines and suspensions followed. I remember that the fine was so large once that even selling the restaurant would not be enough to cover it. Naturally, that restaurant had to close.

Cafes

Cafe managers, in order to prevent embezzlement by employees, mostly established very strict accounting systems. All kinds of ledgers and receipts were available. This undoubtedly gave the tax inspectors a lot of convenience. But they still used their ingenuity to find ways to evade taxes. Although those triplicate receipts with page numbers made them feel hampered, they did not give up this unexpected gain. One cafe, constrained by the triplicate sales receipts with printed page numbers, specially hired a female employee to write out separately printed triplicate receipts every day, just like the official ones. These had the date, the name of the item, and the price. The manager instructed her to write more things below the tax-free price limit, such as a cup of black tea or a cup of coffee. She kept writing until the projected daily total revenue was reached. In addition, this female employee had to do some of the simplest purchasing, sales, and expense accounts. Throughout her office hours, this female employee occupied the accounting room alone. The other accountants worked in rented rooms outside. When the tax inspectors came, this female employee would deal with them. If they asked, "Why is the account so simple?" the answer was, "Business is bad, and we have few people." When they asked more carefully, she would say, "The accountant has gone out, and I don't know much about it." In this way, the tax inspectors would match up the figures slightly, stamp a "Checked" seal on the ledger, and leave. As for the cafe, its daily income from tax evasion far exceeded its operating profits. But the second time, when two other tax inspectors arrived, they caught the loophole. It turned out that the manager was too greedy. He thought that since the tax inspectors had already come, he did not need to be too serious about writing fake sales invoices. He meant that too much paper would be wasted. He said, "The tax inspectors get a headache when they see a large pile of triplicate receipts. Who would look at each one carefully?" The tax inspectors questioned the small number of business units. Then he went to the cashier's counter and looked at the bills for the day. What had been made in half a day had already exceeded the total amount of previous days by a lot. On closer inspection, he found that the page numbers were far apart. The female employee explained, "Business is particularly good today... I just grabbed the bills and used them randomly, and didn't pay attention to the page numbers at all." After the tax inspectors left, the manager immediately went to the puppet Finance Bureau to find someone to smooth things over. Although he was punished later, the punishment was very light. This "smoothing over" obviously played a role.

Theaters

Among the theaters, Peking opera theaters evaded taxes the most severely. At first, the puppet Finance Bureau was careless. They sold the tickets and then took them back before the show ended. At the end of the month, they simply reported a little to the puppet Finance Bureau. Secondly, the manager pocketed all the donation collected from the complimentary tickets. Later, because the tax revenue was low, the puppet Finance Bureau changed the method. The tickets for each row of seats were bound into a book. The tickets had to be stamped at the puppet Finance Bureau; tearing off the ticket was considered selling it; the ticket had to be torn into three sections. When paying the tax, the ticket stubs had to be brought. This method was indeed very strict, and it was also implemented very strictly. People often went to the theater to inspect the taxes. This made the managers feel very panicked, so they sent a representative secretly to the puppet Finance Bureau to make connections. The purpose, of course, was to smooth things over. Although people still came to the theaters to inspect the taxes later, the managers were no longer worried. It is said that this "connection" was very broad, including those who stamped and counted ticket stubs.

Generally speaking, people always hate taxes. However, managers were an exception. They were supporters of taxes for the following reasons: (1) evading a portion of the taxes, (2) completely embezzling the complimentary ticket tax, and (3) delaying payment for three months, using this as capital for high-interest loans.

But for some reason, a very large Peking opera theater was found to have evaded taxes and was punished.

Dance Halls

The organization of dance halls was chaotic, and the managers took advantage of this to make a fortune by evading taxes on a large scale. The tea bill was a small amount, so it didn't matter much. The dance ticket was a large amount, so they used tricks.

The trick was very simple. After the dance guests bought dance tickets for the dancers, they would go to the accounting room to exchange them for cash, and then the accounting room would resell those dance tickets. But after several strict inspections, they also established a "connection" with the puppet Finance Bureau.

Another type of tax evasion that could never be solved was when some regular dance guests, in order to ingratiate themselves with their favorites, directly handed cash to the dancers. This not only evaded the tax but also avoided exploitation by the boss.

What is said above is only a small part of the various types of tax evasion. I am not saying that these phenomena still exist now, but I cannot guarantee that they do not exist.

### Reader Replies: Medicine and Hygiene

(1) New Lung Treatment Drug

Lu Liangmin and Wang Mingfeng ask: We read in your esteemed newspaper about the China Enterprise Company selling the American lung disease specific drug, Streptomycin. A friend of ours has suffered from lung disease for many years and has not responded to various treatments. We wonder if this drug is effective for this disease? We have two questions and request your answer: (1) Are major hospitals and doctors in Shanghai already using this drug clinically? (2) Can this drug truly cure tuberculosis?

[Dr. Zhang Zhongming's Answer] Streptomycin is similar to penicillin and is a type of antitoxin produced by bacterial culture. Animal experiments have shown that it can effectively kill tuberculosis bacteria. However, its absolute effectiveness on human tuberculosis has not yet been documented. This drug is already available on the American market, but there is no stock in Shanghai, and major hospitals and doctors have not yet used it clinically. Therefore, I cannot determine its effectiveness.

(2) Postpartum Weakness

Wang Yiwen asks: After I stopped breastfeeding last August, I suffered from irregular menstruation and very little menstrual flow. Recently, I have often felt numbness in my hands and feet, and I have many restless dreams at night. However, my body has become fatter than before. Although I have consulted both Chinese and Western doctors, I have not seen any improvement. The cost of medical treatment is very high, and I cannot afford it. I don't know what disease I have. Please advise on treatment methods.

[Dr. Zhang Zhongming's Answer] Your condition requires a gynecological examination to determine the cause. Injections of ovarian preparations may be effective.

(3) Left Leg Cramps

Zhang Honglun asks: I am 21 years old and still healthy. I had meningitis as a child, and now my right leg is slightly lame. However, my movements are normal and not inconvenient. I was previously injured in a car accident and my left leg has healed. However, since the injury to my left leg healed, it has often twitched when I am asleep (for more than three years), but I am not aware of it. It stops when I wake up, and the twitching is very frequent. Is there any way to treat it? (1) Is it related to meningitis? (2) Is electrotherapy effective?

[Dr. Zhang Zhongming's Answer] The involuntary movement of your left leg is caused by nerve stimulation. Vitamin B1 and phosphate preparations should be injected. It may be related to meningitis. Electrotherapy can also be tried.

### Beneficiaries of Emergency Relief Fund: Poor Child with Broken Leg, Apprentice with Appendicitis, Out of Danger After Emergency Treatment

Chen Fumei, a 6-year-old girl from Ningbo, comes from a poor family who make a living by rowing boats. They live at No. 12 Xiaoben Lane, Gongping Road. On the 11th of this month, she was knocked down by a bicycle and broke her leg. She was found lying on the roadside by a neighbor and taken to Gongji Hospital for treatment. After the Baojia chief and hospital staff investigated and confirmed the facts, they approved the issuance of a subsidy, and she was cured.

Shen Tianbao, a new apprentice at the Dahua Silk Weaving and Printing Factory at No. 66 Tianbao Lane, Ningbo Road, is from Jiujiang, Jiangxi. He had only been an apprentice for four days when he suddenly suffered from acute appendicitis. Because he came from a poor family and his parents were deceased, neighbors collected 150,000 yuan to send him to Gongji Hospital. After investigation, he was found to be unable to continue paying for medical expenses, and a request for a subsidy was approved, and he has recovered.

### Wu, Concurrent Chairman of the Textile Control Committee, Takes Office This Morning; Deadline for Southbound Sales Applications is Tomorrow Afternoon

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu of this city, who also serves as the Chairman of the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, is scheduled to go to the Committee's office on Jiangxi Road this morning to formally assume his duties, but no ceremony will be held. The former Concurrent Chairman, Shu Yunzhang, remains a member of the Committee. In addition, Lin Fengbao, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, has been appointed as a member. All other Deputy Chairmen, Li Shengbo, and committee members remain unchanged. There have been no reports of any internal personnel changes. However, the internal staff has been busy rushing to complete the handover procedures in recent days.

Furthermore, since the Committee began accepting applications from various cotton cloth manufacturers for the registration of cotton cloth sales to the south on the 11th, 410 transport operators and 178 manufacturers had gone to the Committee to obtain application forms for registration as of yesterday. According to Mr. Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Department of the Committee, the deadline for obtaining application forms for registration will be 5:00 PM tomorrow (the 17th). Manufacturers who have obtained application forms for registration are requested to submit the completed application forms to the Committee before the 20th for collation and review. Applications submitted after this deadline will be reviewed next month. After the new Chairman takes office, investigators will be dispatched to conduct a detailed review based on the submitted application forms for registration. It is hoped that this review work will be completed before the 25th, so that the qualifications of the manufacturers can be verified and applications for the sale of cotton cloth to the south can be accepted.

Also, according to the "Provisional Administrative Measures for the Export of Cotton Cloth to South China" and the "Simplified Rules for the Examination and Approval of Applications for the Export of Cotton Cloth to South China," the sale of cotton cloth to the south in this city requires the selling manufacturer to apply for quota allocation and export permits from the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. After obtaining the export permit, the goods must be declared to customs within ten days, otherwise the permit will be void. The Jianghai Customs Office formally issued a notice to merchants yesterday.

### Securities Exchange Adds After-Hours Trading Today; Settlement Time Changed to 4 PM the Next Afternoon; Brokers Who Have Not Paid for Substitute Goods Will Be Barred From the Trading Floor

In order to promote the trading of Chinese stocks onto the right track, the Securities Exchange has decided, after a meeting of the Board of Directors, to add after-hours trading starting today (the 16th). Yesterday, a formal announcement was issued to all brokers and agents, and the business hours were adjusted to 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM in the morning and 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Collective reconciliation will be held at 5:00 PM in the afternoon. As for the settlement time, it has been changed to calculate the transactions of the afternoon of the same day and the morning of the next day together, and settlement procedures will be carried out at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. It is also learned that the deadline for brokers to pay the 30 million yuan substitute guarantee deposit was yesterday, and there will be no extension. Securities Exchange authorities will order all brokers who have not paid the substitute guarantee deposit to stop trading on the floor starting today. The gradual expansion of over-the-counter trading not only affects market trading but is also inconsistent with the law. The Supervision Office and the Securities Exchange authorities both regret this and are jointly drafting measures to resolutely ban it. According to a person in charge of the Securities Exchange, these measures will be announced in the short term and will severely crack down on over-the-counter trading.

### Floating Longs Rush to Sell Off; Market Conditions Remain Difficult to Boost

Yesterday's market trading was sparse and difficult to boost. The trading floor was entirely supported by retail investors. The market rose slightly at the opening, and there were buyers, stabilizing the situation and rising slightly. After 10:45 AM, the atmosphere improved slightly, and the two major hot stocks and Sino-American Silk Textile Factory rose. The firm trend lasted for half an hour, but eventually collapsed and retreated. The floating longs were too aggressive at the start of the morning, and then gradually became sellers. In addition, there were sales from the northern capital, and the situation completely changed. The shorts then exerted their power, and there was a miserable decline near noon. As a result, the closing prices of Yong'an Textile, Mei Ya Silk Factory, and Jingfu Company all fell slightly. Xinguang Company rose slightly, while Qinxing Company remained unchanged. Tongyi, Sino-American Silk Textile Factory, Zhongfang, Rongfeng, Innerwear Company, Lilian Match, and Wuhe all fell slightly. Datong, Xinya, and Huafeng Cement rose slightly. Jinglun Silk Industry remained flat. The total turnover was 8.37 million shares. Over-the-counter stocks continued to fall. Foreign stocks were affected by the stock market near noon, and the two major hot stocks remained depressed. The process was peaceful due to the small number of transactions. As a result, Yisha, British United, and Wheelock fell slightly compared to the previous close. The rest remained stable.

### Bond Market Sentiment Is Low

The bond market was affected by the overall trend, and sentiment was uninterested. The new longs were watching. The Unified C bond opened at 2030 yuan and rose slightly to 2120 yuan. Then, retail investors gradually closed out their positions, and the stock market fueled the selling pressure, causing the price to fall below 1900 yuan before stabilizing. As a result, it closed 150 yuan lower than the previous close. A and B also fell 120 yuan, and D and E each fell 50 yuan.

### High-Grade Aged Tea Is Popular; New Ningbo Black Tea Has Not Yet Reached an Agreement

Green teas such as Chunzhen, Zhenmei, and Zhenmei, which are sold to Africa, have not been easy to sell this year due to their surprisingly high prices. Although aged teas have been exported, low-grade goods are not welcome. Therefore, recently, various companies have focused on high-grade aged goods. Unfortunately, due to scarcity and lack of supply, the number of transactions has not been sustained. Under the circumstances of too many monks and not enough porridge, prices have frequently risen. As a result, the price per dan has increased by about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

Other high-grade black teas, such as Yingzhuang, are also highly sought after, and the market is showing a promising outlook. As for the domestic sales of black and green teas, stores in this street are still adding to their stock, but customers from various regions are still stagnant. However, sentiment remains stable. It has been found that the first batch of new Ningzhou black tea shipped to Shanghai by Zhongxin Chang Tea House is still under negotiation and has not yet opened for trading.

### Twenty-Three Flour Merchants Exceeded Price Limits; Social Bureau Orders Written Guarantees

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, twenty-three flour merchants exceeded the price limits significantly at their retail outlets. The Social Bureau summoned the responsible persons of each store to the Bureau for questioning, examined their accounts, investigated the source and destination of the goods, and ordered them to provide written guarantees.

### Overcoat Wool Is Selling Well

Overcoat wool has been selling extremely well recently. Both high-grade and low-grade goods are selling well. Ordinary goods priced at 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per yard are in the greatest demand. Water-marked wool priced at over 100,000 to 200,000 yuan is selling more actively on this street. Low-grade goods, such as Tibetan gray wool priced at 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, are selling more actively in Nanjing and Hangzhou. Standard market prices are all trending upwards, both openly and secretly, due to various environmental factors and the depletion of inventory.

### Promote Overseas Remittances; Price to be Settled After Remittance Arrives; Remittances to Hong Kong Can Be Paid in Hong Kong Dollars

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Bank of China has been planning to launch a scheme for exchanging original currency in order to promote overseas remittances. It has been learned that this scheme was implemented after the Double Tenth Festival. This method is slightly different from the old exchange method. That is, the amount of national currency does not need to be converted at the time of remittance, but the national currency will be settled according to the official exchange rate at the time when the remittance arrives at the paying bank at the destination. However, remittances to the Bank of China branch in Hong Kong are allowed to be settled in Hong Kong dollars. This method has recently been implemented in New York (including Canada and the United States mainland) and London (including the United Kingdom mainland). Other regions such as Southeast Asia, Cuba, and Australia have more complex currency conversions and will be implemented gradually.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, overseas remittances have been pouring in from all over the world. The Bank of China, which is responsible for handling overseas remittances, is also actively seeking to reform the system in accordance with the actual situation, so as to ensure that the remittances can be sent quickly and safely. The Bank's overseas branches that have resumed operations include those in Yangon, Hanoi, Haiphong, Singapore, Penang, and Kuala Lumpur. Due to the situation in the Dutch East Indies, it has not been possible to establish branches immediately. A plan is currently being developed to restore the Batang institution first. Institutions in Surabaya and Medan will be restored when local conditions permit. In addition, Saigon is also preparing to establish a branch. In order to reduce the difficulty of transliteration and save on electricity costs, the Bank has launched an overseas Chinese telegraphic transfer registration service. As of now, 120,000 households have registered, which is convenient for overseas Chinese. (Yu)

### Silk Weaving Factory Registration Has Been Completed; Rayon Will Be Distributed Soon; Silk Weaving Factories in Other Areas Can Also Be Allocated Appropriately; Speculators Deliberately Raise the Price of Semi-Gloss Goods

[Our Newspaper's Report] The registration of silk weaving factories to purchase rayon registration cards from the Central Trust Bureau was completed yesterday. However, the allocation method is subject to final approval, and it is currently difficult to determine whether it can be allocated this week. It is said that due to procedural issues, it may not be implemented until next week. Currently, representatives from other areas such as Hangzhou have come to Shanghai to request registration. The Central Trust Bureau has agreed that they can be allocated appropriately. Yesterday, representatives from other areas hosted a banquet for local industry peers at the New Capital Hotel to strengthen communication. Yesterday, the market price of rayon rose again. 120-count rayon from Tianqiao with gloss was priced at 4.45 million yuan, an increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Semi-gloss and other types of rayon even rose by 300,000 yuan. It is rumored that the goods to be allocated by the Central Trust Bureau are all goods with gloss. Therefore, those who have the goods regard them as rare goods and deliberately raise the price. Factory operators were unmoved, and prices remained flat. Silk goods were also very idle, and the market was unchanged. Transactions were very light.

### Side Observations on Foreign Exchange; Official Measures Fail to Reassure; People Expect the Issuance Volume of Legal Tender

[Reuters Nanjing, 14th] One week after the announcement of foreign exchange price limits, the open foreign exchange market in Nanjing remains quite volatile. In recent days, the non-official exchange rate of the US dollar has become more active, indicating that some of the measures recently taken by the authorities have failed to reassure the public. Although the daily foreign exchange transactions in the capital are not very large, roadside transactions have seen a new high price of 4,050 yuan of legal tender per US dollar. On the one hand, this may indicate that the national economy has failed to stabilize, but it is also a logical result of the price limits. The announcement of foreign exchange price limits has eliminated some foreign exchange traders, but in fact it has also created an artificial shortage of foreign exchange on the open market. Neutral observers point out that the government's delay in announcing the amount of banknotes issued has prevented the public from immediately fully trusting the current currency. An atmosphere of tense expectation still exists. The speed at which black market prices fall is often like wildfire. For example, this morning, there was a sudden sell-off of US dollars from all sides to prevent price declines, because, according to past experience, this situation can occur within a few hours. In addition, the domestic political and military situation also has some influence on the fluctuation of foreign exchange prices.

### Gold Prices Were Stable; US Dollar Black Market Was Small

Yesterday, the price of gold was stable. It opened at 2.19 million in the morning and was very peaceful after the opening. It once fell slightly from 2.195 million, and the floating longs closed out their positions slightly, falling to 2.18 million before easing. It hovered around 2.19 million. After 10:00 AM, the central bank allocated 18 bars at a price of 2.19 million. After entering, it gradually changed from stable to slightly stable. Customer sales were still active. Near noon, it rose back to 2.213 million. At noon, it hovered around 2.21 million. In the afternoon, the price for day-after-tomorrow transactions rose to 2.22 million before leveling off. As a result, it closed 16,000 higher than the previous close. The prices of gold ornaments, silver ingots, and silver dollars were flat. The underground dismantling of silver was tight after being flat. Underground interest rates ranged from 15% to 18%.

Foreign currency was calm and little changed. The asking price for US dollars in the black market was 4,200 yuan to 4,300 yuan, with few transactions, slightly cheaper than the previous close. Hong Kong dollars continued to rise due to the continued rise in the price of telegraphic transfers to Hong Kong. As a result, it closed 10 yuan lower than the previous close. The exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars was initially around 900 yuan, but was raised to 900 yuan to 920 yuan due to the stimulus of the gold market. The exchange rate for Indian rupees was 1110 yuan to 1130 yuan, the exchange rate for British pounds was 14500 to 14700 yuan, and the exchange rate for US dollars remained flat. Transactions were only slightly more active for Hong Kong dollars, and there was little activity for the rest.

### Medium Sugar Squeezed Up

### Ranked Second in the World: Brazil's Cotton Exports Surge, Peru and Mexico Increase, India and Egypt Decline

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The Department of Agriculture recently issued a report stating that in the year ending July 31st, Brazil's cotton industry had replaced India and Egypt in the global export market, giving the Western Hemisphere a dominant position as a supplier to the world's textile industry. Although the United States remains the largest exporter, maintaining its pre-war level of 3,678,000 bales, Brazil's export trade among Latin American countries has seen a sharp increase, with exports of 1,471,000 bales, reaching second place in one fell swoop. The report stated that total global export trade is estimated at 9,038,000 bales, most of which are supplied by countries in the Western Hemisphere (especially Latin America). India, frequently facing poor harvests and with continuously increasing domestic consumption, has an export volume that is only one-tenth of its pre-war average. Egypt intends to rebuild its extensive pre-war European trade, but faces many obstacles and setbacks. India's export volume for the year ending July 31st is estimated at only 820,000 bales, a drop of one million bales compared to the pre-war average. Egypt's export volume is also said to have fallen from around 1,600,000 bales per year before the war to 860,000 bales. Peru's cotton exports have surged from 309,000 bales in 1939 to 440,000 bales, and Mexico's exports have also increased tenfold compared to the pre-war total of 26,000 bales. The report further stated that the Soviet Union, which only occasionally appeared in the export market before the war, has now become an important supplier to Eastern European countries. Although the Soviet Union's export figures are not available, sporadic reports from Eastern European countries indicate that the Soviet Union exported 50,000 bales of cotton to Hungary, Poland, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria (possibly including Denmark) in the same year. The United Kingdom, a major cotton importing country, obtained most of its supply from its imperial possessions, amounting to 1,892,000 bales, of which 523,000 bales from Brazil topped all other countries. The United States supplied the United Kingdom with only 293,000 bales, but shipped 700,000 bales to China and 365,000 bales to Japan. According to the Department, the US cotton shipped to Japan is only part of the 890,000 bale delivery process by December 31st of this year.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Secretary-General of the Academia Sinica, who arrived here, said on the 14th: The doctoral degree award case to be discussed by the Academia Sinica Council is not proposed by the Ministry of Education, but referred by the Executive Yuan's routine meeting. It is heard that the government attaches great importance to this matter because of its importance, so it was referred to the Council for serious discussion.

The meeting will last for five days, opening on the 20th of this month, and a preparatory meeting will be held on the evening of the 15th to discuss the agenda.

This authority on history, before his departure, unusually discussed the current situation, saying: "Looking at history from the perspective of a historian, there have been countless chaotic situations, even worse than today. If the current domestic party struggle is based on national interests and can lay down arms at the same time, that is the necessary path to achieve prosperity and democracy." Chen hopes that some "good people will unite the good people in the country to form a good people's party and promote good people's politics." Chen regrets that there are too many bad people in the world and too few good people, so he believes that this is just an ideal. Chen gave an example, saying: "Buddhism advocates releasing life, but if not a single living creature is killed, the world may be filled with flies and rats. Also, if everyone imitates monks and nuns and 'leaves home,' the human race will become extinct, so the people of the country should not be pessimistic about the current transitional situation."

Later, the Giants repeatedly caught up, giving it their all, and narrowed the gap to 25 to 15 in the first half, with Zhenglun still in the lead. In the second half, the Giants were once at 23 to 27, but Zhenglun had plenty of stamina and continued to lead after Zhang Gensheng was substituted out and Liu Zhengjun entered the game. Although the Giants desperately counterattacked, Zhenglun's defense was tight. Until the end of the game, Zhenglun won 40 to 28, adding another masterpiece after defeating the Shan team.

### The Liberation of the Liberated Areas

— Huaiyin Dispatch on the 5th, Special Correspondent Kang Zhou

On the desolate streets of Huaiyin, I walked like a hunter. My eyes swept over every house, every ruin, and every resident's face. I hoped to find a trace to prove the Communist Party's propaganda of the "liberated areas" and their "splendid" achievements. In the past week, I have traveled to many places, such as Suqian, Siyang, Huaiyin, and Huaian. These were previously the so-called "liberated areas" of the Communist Party and have been repeatedly liberated by the National Army. I stepped into these once "mysterious" areas even before the refugees eagerly awaiting their return home. What I came into contact with was the exposed truth of the "liberated areas" and the people living in that atmosphere. I saw a lot, heard even more, but I am sorry to say that the materials I obtained are the scars hidden beneath the beautiful cloak that the Communist Party deeply conceals.

Along the way, I didn't see a single person who looked truly human. What I saw seemed like a group of prisoners who had just been released from prison after years of confinement: disheveled hair, ashen faces, and emaciated bodies, standing in the wind as if they were about to fall over. What they wore on their bodies, if you could call it clothes, would be more accurately described as strips or patches of cloth. Only the women's trousers were patched up completely, while most of the children were naked from the waist down, or even completely naked, like pieces of charcoal. Only one thing shone in their malnourished eyes—when they leaned against the broken doors, set up dusty incense tables, and welcomed the entering National Army.

That day, the National Army arrived. A naked child stuck a red paper strip on the incense candles, wrote the words "Welcome the Central Army," and walked in front of the procession.

An old woman with white hair carried a pot of tea, walked over, and said tremblingly, "Squad leader, you've worked hard, have a cup!"

Almost all the people after the disaster shed tears. They said, "If you hadn't come for another year, we would have starved to death completely!"

### In-depth Interviews with the People: Their Hearts Sing Laments

Quietly, after conducting in-depth interviews, everyone poured out their laments to me. This is truly a painful memory!

Last August, Japan surrendered, and the National Army had transportation difficulties. The Communist Party took the opportunity to invade and occupy most of North China. Northern Jiangsu has fertile land and has not suffered from natural disasters for many years. Those who were fortunate enough not to be bankrupted under the ravages of the enemy puppets were swept away by the storm-like "struggle" of the Communist Party. Thus, the rich struggled against the poor, and the poor struggled until they were destitute. What about the destitute? They were forced to charge into battle.

Last winter, a total of tens of thousands of people died from hunger and cold.

The signboard that the Communist Party puts up is "the people," which is a ridiculous and pleasing term. In fact, the Communist Party only has party members, not people. And the foolish party members are merely tools for the party leaders to achieve their selfish desires. Their struggle is said to have a purpose, which is "the poor turning over." The landlords' fields are seized through struggle, and the meritorious personnel who participated in the struggle each get two or three mu of land. You become the master, and the landlord becomes a pauper and flees. That's considered "the poor turning over." But the Communist Party has various forms of subtle levies on the one year's harvest of the land you've been allocated, so 80% is extorted by the party that "turned you over." Watching the "party officials" eat rice and white flour while you eat buckwheat and sorghum is "turning over"! What's most capable of fooling people is the "labor model" and "battle hero" that the Communist Party praises. If working like an ox or horse increases the capital for ambitious people to start more rebellions, then being called a "labor model" is something to cry about; if engaging in crazy actions to seize cities and land throws the entire country into greater unrest, then being called a "battle hero" is something to weep for!

The Communist Party attacks bureaucratic capital with all its might, but all the businesses in the "liberated areas" are completely party-run. The people have no freedom to do business. A rickshaw puller said humorously, "Only this bowl of rice of ours hasn't been snatched away by them." From grain to daily necessities, nothing is spared from the Communist Party's control. A legitimate merchant cannot even think about having a livelihood unless they join the Communist Party or collude with Communist Party members. As a result, the people's wealth is completely plundered. The people have no food for the next day, and they don't know what tomorrow will bring.

Occasionally, a family may have a chance to eat meat. They eat it in secret, and the neighbors don't even know about it; but the Communist Party's secret agents smell the "scent of meat" as if they appear out of nowhere, and they come to visit you "friendly"ly. They know that their extorting efforts are very thorough, and there is no way to eat meat without a special source, so they become suspicious of you and make you the target of struggle. This kind of "scent-smelling" organization is indeed one of the wonders of the 20th century. The Communist Party members themselves enjoy a very luxurious life. Although their slogans are always "the working masses" and "enduring hardship and hard work," who doesn't like to enjoy life? Having so much land at their disposal, why not enjoy it? Li Yimang, the chairman of the Suwan Border Region Government, had his mansion at No. 4 Anle Lane in Huaiyin, and I made a special trip to visit it. The houses in Huaiyin are all old-fashioned, but Li's mansion has a Western touch in its Eastern sentiment. According to the neighbors, the interior furnishings are very exquisite, with walls full of bookshelves, Russian carpets, Western-style furniture, many sofas, and countless decorations and collectibles. Someone saw him moving his belongings with dozens of large carts before and after the retreat. When I went, I could still see some of the paintings, calligraphy, and furniture that had not been moved away, including two rather valuable beds. One was made of ebony and fine rattan, with marble embedded in the bed frame, and the other was probably for summer use, with the entire bed made of glass except for the wooden frame. There was also a foreign porcelain bathtub, which was nothing special, but it was the only one in Huaiyin. It is conceivable that Li knew how to enjoy life.

In order to consolidate their rule, they had to further indoctrinate the people. They started to work on children, and all the teaching materials were a set of ideological training. For adults, in addition to using terrorist means and arbitrarily accusing anyone they didn't like of being a "national special agent" and killing them, they held meetings almost every day, regardless of whether you had something to do or not. In the meetings, they made grand pronouncements, and the purpose was to correct your "central brain."

This meeting style also had a purpose, which was the application of their so-called "democratic" method. If a plan was to be implemented, in order to respect "democracy" and pass "public opinion," they would gather everyone together and ask, "Do you agree or disagree?" The frightened masses would express their agreement under the leadership of certain people, and thus "democracy" would be realized.

In terms of women, they also had several organizations, such as the Women's Federation and the Sisters' Team. The Communist Party vigorously promoted "women's liberation" and "improving women's status," and they certainly did achieve that. However, it is inconceivable on what kind of position women were elevated. The common people definitely told me: when "battle heroes" return from the front, when "labor models" become famous overnight, and when they need to be comforted, the Women's Federation and Sisters' Team must send people to give the most "gentle" comfort, which is listed as one of the main tasks of these organizations and is considered a great honor. In short, the list is endless. The "liberated areas" have been turned upside down, and there is no peace.

Speculators who joined their organization through threats and inducements, once they entered, they made it impossible for you not to follow them wholeheartedly. They asked you to commit crimes, to kill people, so that it was impossible to gain a foothold in this place without relying on their power.

### The People Stretch Their Necks, Looking to the Central Government

Good people cried secretly every night. A 59-year-old woman could not bear the oppression and bullying and said with a sigh, "Why hasn't the Central Army come yet?"

Ears were everywhere, and a Communist Party secret agent came over and said, "Do you want the Central Army to come?"

The woman couldn't bear it and retorted, "Let's see how long you can be tyrannical!"

As a result, the woman was hanged on a tree. The people below asked her, "Have you seen the Central Army?" She endured the pain and said, "No." So, she was hanged even higher. She couldn't bear it anymore and shouted, "I see it!" The rope was cut, and the woman fell and died.

Such tragic "looking to the Central Government" events have happened several times. Violence and terror policies cannot last long. The National Army came and truly liberated the "liberated areas." That woman was not disappointed, even though she could not see it; but isn't the new atmosphere in the recovered areas today exactly what she had hoped for?

### A Sudden Transformation, Vigorous Vitality

After scrubbing the dark walls, new and stimulating slogans were posted; the most difficult people gradually entered the city with a smile; the shops slowly opened their doors, although there were not many goods on display, they still looked like shops; in the early morning, the clear bugle calls rang through the silent land, warhorses neighed loudly, and the sound of turning wheels mixed with the sound of slaughtering pigs... Huaiyin City had a vigorous vitality.

Recently, Huaiyin can be regarded as a representative of the recovered areas in northern Jiangsu, having undergone a sudden transformation, which should be said to have restored its free appearance. People no longer have to attend those damned "small group meetings." You can handle your life however you like, and no one will interfere with you. The new order that the Communist Party tried to establish for a year disappeared completely in an instant. The Political Department of the Garrison Command wrote in large letters on the walls: "Respect the customs and habits of the citizens of all cities!" People felt infinite comfort when they saw it.

The number of disputes is not as high as imagined. Those who received land they were not entitled to handed it over without saying any nonsense. The counterfeit currency was invalidated and discarded more readily than a piece of waste paper. The common people suffered losses, but they still endured it. When they started accepting the counterfeit currency, they thought that one day it would be abolished. The Communist Party's extorting techniques were certainly superb, but the common people still had a few silver dollars stored in their cellars, more or less. Before the Communist Army retreated, they also bought some cheap goods that the Communist Army could not take away in the chaos. When the National Army came, those with goods took them out to exchange for legal tender, and those without goods used their labor to earn a living. At first, they did not know the value of legal tender, and a catty of pork only sold for 80 yuan. It was too cheap, and most of the buyers were National Army soldiers—they felt bad and gave a little more. Later transactions were priced according to silver dollars. If a product was worth one silver dollar, it would be given 1,500 yuan in legal tender. In this way, chaos was temporarily avoided, but as the number of people increased day by day and the source of supplies was lacking, prices could not help but rise.

### Guanyin Temple, Under the Oil Lamp: The Magistrate of Huaiyin County Buries His Head in Official Business

Since the recovery, the most burdensome work has been done by the county government, and the most pitiful situation has been the county government's. The old site of the Huaiyin County Government was destroyed and is now located in a Guanyin Temple. At night, under the oil lamp, the exhausted county magistrate buried his head in official business. Anyone with a little background wants the county government to find a way to do this and that. But the county government, from exile to entry, only brought a few people, without a single item of supplies.

It is true that political coordination does not match military coordination. But think about the local government, manpower, material resources, and financial resources, which one is not difficult?

Manpower: The county government does not have capable cadres; there are not so many porters for military service. In addition to those who had already fled, the young people in the recovered areas were temporarily pulled away by the Communist Party, leaving behind only the old and the young, the disabled and the sick. How can a few young people meet the required numbers?

Material resources: The Communist Party has already taken away the material resources that could be taken, and the whereabouts of those that have not been taken in various districts are unknown. The materials received by the reception committee jointly formed by the Party, Government, Military, and Corps Room (Central Investigation and Statistics Office) are only a small minority. How to deal with it? We still have to wait for instructions from above. And for military needs, building bridges and constructing fortifications requires materials, where can they be found? Difficulty upon difficulty?

Financial resources: The Jiangsu Provincial Government issued 15 million yuan of reconstruction funds to the exiled county government. All expenses related to reconstruction preparation and reconstruction facilities from exile to entry are all covered by this figure. The recovered areas are full of devastation and everything is waiting to be done. How many things can 15 million yuan do? After the recovery, local expenses must be raised by themselves. The provincial government issues a temporary subsidy of 1 million yuan per month, which must be returned in the future. The locality is dilapidated, and the people are survivors of a disaster. The source of revenue is clearly zero. I admire the work spirit of the administrative staff in the recovered areas: they only eat, they can't get paid, they are exhausted all day long, they are scolded, and they may even be beaten, but they are not discouraged at all.

Relief is being handled separately by the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference, the Su-Ning Branch of the General Administration of Relief and Rehabilitation, and the Ministry of Social Affairs. Almost the entire recovered area is in urgent need of relief. What needs to be relieved is not only the problem of food, but also after the war, epidemics are prevalent, and there is no medicine; the cold winter is approaching, and the victims lack cotton clothes, and quite a few houses have been damaged, making the living situation a problem...

Saving the people from fire and water requires a process. The living problems of the people in the recovered areas have not yet been improved, but they say well: "We already have hope!" Not letting their hopes be dashed is something that the administrative authorities must be vigilant about again and again!

Brick masonry engineering for sand dams suitable for slow-flowing rivers (Special Correspondent Jiang Muyunqi)

### Taiwan Provincial Highway and Water Conservancy Projects

— Northern Airlines News from September 22nd, special correspondent Jiang Muyun

Taiwan, an island composed of two-thirds mountainous terrain, is clearly geographically different from mainland China. People often mistakenly overestimate Taiwan. In reality, the island's scenery is a mix of Southeast Asian and Japanese styles. However, its general infrastructure has a relatively good foundation.

Currently, Taiwan's public construction projects are primarily focused on the Housing and Construction Bureau under the Civil Affairs Department, which centers its work on building large-scale housing. The Public Works Bureau under the Industry and Mining Department is dedicated to highway construction and levee repairs. The Relief Administration has built hundreds of residences for ordinary people in Hengchun, the southernmost part of the island that was most severely bombed, but these are temporary relief housing to alleviate the housing shortage.

Island Highways: 17,000 Kilometers

During their initial 24 years of rule in Taiwan, the Japanese invested considerable capital, with transportation and water conservancy as key priorities. However, some projects were halted during the war, while others were damaged by it. The current task is to continue those that were suspended and to rebuild those that were destroyed. This is a difficult but necessary undertaking.

The total area of Taiwan is 35,973 square kilometers. It has over 900 kilometers of railway lines and more than 17,000 kilometers of highways, including 1,031 kilometers of provincial roads. Of these, 10 percent, or 99.30 kilometers, are paved with high-quality asphalt. County roads total 2,500 kilometers, with 15 percent, or 386 kilometers, paved with concrete or asphalt, and the remaining 85 percent with gravel. Township roads total 13,000 kilometers and are only lightly paved with gravel, with some sections passable only by pedestrians and oxcarts.

Provincial roads, also known as the round-the-island highway, are a true asset to the province, accounting for over 80-100 percent of its economic value. The entire line is not yet open to traffic. The Zhuoshui River Bridge, approximately two kilometers long with 32 piers, had its piers completed in 1940. The Public Works Bureau plans to change the original steel beam design to a reinforced concrete cantilever design in the near future, which, according to the bureau's estimates, will save 50-100 percent of the construction cost compared to the original design.

The only transportation line connecting east and west, the Pingtung-Taitung line, is 173 kilometers long, with 64 kilometers currently open to traffic. Construction on the Zhiben River Bridge, within the 109-kilometer section, began in February of this year at a cost of NT$22 million and is expected to be completed by mid-October, after which traffic can pass.

Japanese Engineering: Now Abandoned

The line across the Central Mountain Range from Taitung Hualien Port to Taichung is 173 kilometers long. The Japanese completed only ten kilometers in six years. The most difficult 60-kilometer section, which includes a 3,148-meter-long tunnel, would cost NT$90 million to complete. The bureau plans to abandon it, as the detour around the southern end of the line adds only 33 kilometers.

Director Fei, who previously served in the Southwest Highway Administration, said that in coordination with Taiwan's economic construction plan, they must complete the concrete paving of the western trunk line, a total of 350 kilometers, within one year, and build seventeen large bridges within three years. At the same time, they need to improve the most dangerous coastal highway, the roadbed from Suao to Hualien Port. He further explained that the highway projects built by the Japanese here were not durable in order to save money and could not withstand typhoon attacks. He gave a simple example, saying that on the side of the road built in the mountains, the Japanese only built a wall on the hillside, while we (Fei referring to himself) need to build retaining walls. A type of Japanese engineering method has been clearly abandoned.

Low Transportation Capacity: Highway Bureau Puzzled

In Taiwan, most of the highways built by the Japanese run parallel to the railways. They were primarily used for military purposes in the past, but now their value is apparent, as Taiwan's railway equipment is entirely dependent on Japan. Currently, there is no way to replenish it. After the reduction in transportation capacity, even transporting coal to the port requires trucks and highways. Highway Bureau Director Hua, who manages transportation agencies and improves transportation efficiency, frankly explained the current difficulties to reporters after inspecting the island for a week. There are twenty passenger transport companies and seven freight companies in the province, with private shares accounting for 58-100 percent of each. Of the 2,145 passenger and freight vehicles he inspected at twenty-three companies, only 542 were actually operational. With fewer vehicles and a vast area, transportation capacity is insufficient, and the operating route has been reduced from 4,358 kilometers to 42-100, 1,859 kilometers. The Highway Bureau recently purchased twenty-four new vehicles at a price of US$1,910 per vehicle, but the cost of manufacturing the bodies is NT$200,000 per vehicle, an unbearable burden. With no way to increase revenue, they can only consider collecting road maintenance fees. This is an innovation on the island, but it has been agreed to by all companies. Deputy Director Qian interestingly provided reporters with a cost breakdown calculated on the principle of one vehicle per kilometer. According to their estimates, the cost is: gasoline 6.20, oil 0.80, tires 7.50, depreciation 1.80, grease 0.29, driver and administrative expenses 2.00, management fee 3.00, other 0.86, totaling 27.5 yuan. Averaging twenty people per vehicle, each person should pay 1.05 yuan, totaling 21 yuan. According to current regulations, they are already losing 6.5 yuan. However, under the policy set by the government, it is not allowed to increase the burden on the people.

River Engineering: Special Consideration Needed

In addition to highways, the most important public works project is water conservancy. Repairing levees is the most important task facing the bureau. Although the rivers in the province do not have the danger of the "Taiwan Strait," they are extremely turbulent due to their unique terrain and geology, whether they are rapid or slow-flowing. Taiwan's average annual rainfall is 2,500 millimeters, making it the second rainiest region in the world, and the concentration of rainfall is even more astonishing. The destructive power during heavy rains is unimaginable. The general characteristics of the rivers are steep longitudinal slopes, extremely high flood flows, and extremely low dry season flows, with a large amount of sediment and gravel, resulting in unpredictable changes in the river course. These conditions require careful consideration of river construction methods.

In the forty-five years from 1900 to 1942, the Japanese completed a total of 470,000 meters of levees for Taiwan's river projects. The water management plans for the province's twenty-nine main rivers were completed in 1933. In the years before the retrocession, the war affected construction, leaving the province's rivers in a state of neglect, resulting in various disasters. At that time, the dikes, revetments, and drainage projects damaged by disasters in the major rivers were approximately 35,000 meters long. After the handover, the government spent NT$14 million on disaster repair projects last year, repairing 3,895 meters of dikes and revetments, but this project accounted for only one-tenth of the urgently needed repairs. Director Fei said that if they want to restore the original state before 1941, it will take at least six years!

Stone Embankment Project: Three Methods Adopted

The bureau has adopted these three methods for river construction in the province:

(1) For rapid rivers, use stone embankment projects with rubble masonry and wire mesh gabion revetments. Collect cobblestones from the riverbed and weave them into wire mesh gabions on site. Although this is relatively simple, it has flexibility and is very effective for revetments in rapid rivers. However, it is not suitable for the most rapid rivers and sometimes requires the use of iron bars. The Touqian River and Wu River both use this type of project.

(2) For slow-flowing rivers with some cobblestones and fine sand in the riverbed soil, use brick masonry slopes, connecting the bricks through two holes each to form a whole. The Zengwen River and the lower reaches of the Tamsui River both use this method.

(3) For secondary rapid rivers, use permeable dam projects with frames, using reinforced concrete columns or old railroad tracks. The Yilan Zhuoshui River and the central section of the Wu River both use this method.

Small TVA: Regaining Popular Support

Director Fei specifically mentioned the Agongdian Dam project in Tainan, which is under construction. He dissected eight photos and pieced together the current construction progress. This water management project employs over a thousand workers, machines, and electricity. Construction began in April of this year, with 40 percent completed each year and is scheduled for completion in 1948. The value of this dam is that it can prevent 80,000 mu of farmland from being impacted by floods and can irrigate 90,000 mu of farmland. He said this is Taiwan's small TVA.

The Public Works Bureau has eight engineering teams distributed throughout the province. These hard-working technical personnel are not afraid of the heat and humidity or the epidemic, working for the province's transportation and water conservancy. In the remote mountains and coasts, in the torrents and sandy streams, they are truly the vanguard and protectors of the people. When asked about the hardships and joys, Director Fei said that Taiwan is much better than the wind and dew conditions in the southwest. He can still take a truck along the highway for a second island-wide inspection. He can reach any town or city in a short journey! Moreover, because water conservancy is related to people's lives, he can more closely experience the warmth of the people's sentiments beside the constructed dikes. This has a decisive significance in regaining lost popular support.

### Chinese Art Exhibition in Paris

— Hangzhou News, October 2nd, Wang Ren reporting from Paris

In recent years, the lives of Chinese people overseas have been filled with opportunities, and their prosperity has been increasing day by day. Paris is the center of the world of art, and our talented compatriots who reside there can blend Eastern and Western civilizations, creating a harmonious fusion.

The "Exhibition of Works by Members of the Chinese Fine Arts Society in France," which began on October 1st and will end on the 20th, is hosted by the Fine Arts Society at No. 7 Villa Brune, 14th District, South Paris, and is supported by Dr. Qian Jieping, the ambassador to France.

Among the paintings on display, the works of Ms. Pan Yuliang, who has been teaching at the Central University for nine years, are the most numerous and appropriate, with as many as thirty-five pieces. Hua Tianyou's realistic line drawings are the most innovative, Liao Xinxue's landscapes, flowers, and animals, and Dr. Zhou Lin, the secretary-general of the society's still life realism, best demonstrate the inherent spirit of Chinese painting. Ms. Jiang Luxi's works depicting the new green branches and soft branches of the city walls and houses best showcase the characteristics of Parisian city beauty. Li Fengbai's paintings of military officers, wounded soldiers, red powder, and white bones on a hill, as well as the Famine Relief Map, are shocking and thought-provoking, highlighting the harm caused by war. In addition, Jian Shenshan, who lives in Pigeon Forest outside Paris, and Zhang Ziyu, also known as Shengfu, are both masters of figure sketching, as is Fang Yong, the publisher of the Overseas Chinese Times, who excels in landscape painting. Among the sculptures on display, Hua Tianyou's seventeen works, which encompass a wide range of styles, are the most touching. Yan Dehui's woodcut sketches from Yongjia, Zhejiang, are also very outstanding. Other works by Liao Xinxue, Zeng Ke, Ju Qingding, and Hui Chaoming are all worth appreciating.

At this peaceful gathering, the new autumn is as warm as summer, and visitors flock here to feast their eyes. The reputation of the society's members will inevitably grow with time, and their beautiful future can be expected.

### Visiting Tanggu New Port

— Shenyang Airlines News, September 24th, Zhao Zhan, our correspondent in Shenyang

Speaking of the Tanggu New Port project, the foundation was laid by the Japanese by plundering our people's wealth. It took five years, and the project is half completed. In 1937, the Japanese suggested jointly building the port with Song Zheyuan. With the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy urgently needed the large quantities of coal, iron, and salt produced in North China, so they actively worked to build the port in an attempt to increase shipping capacity. In June 1939, they formally established an organization to oversee the matter. Construction began in October 1940. The original plan was very large, and after completion, it would be able to handle 30 million tons of goods per year. Later, due to the difficulty of the work, it was changed to a plan to handle 1.5 million tons per year. By the time the enemy surrendered in September 1945, the first wharf and the second wharf had been completed. The New Port project is very grand. I have one thought about this: the enemy plundered our people's wealth and was still able to accomplish something (of course, it was to strengthen their plunder efficiency). We ourselves cannot achieve results with the money from the people. It is really embarrassing. Since the enemy has already laid the foundation, if we cannot complete it smoothly according to the plan, we will truly be unpromising wastrels.

When the enemy surrendered, they destroyed part of it, and all the electrical equipment was destroyed. It is said that the design drawings and important documents were burned for a whole day. We ourselves destroyed part of it, that is, there was no management at all for a period of time. However, the ignorant people, greedy for profit, stole the military lines and demolished the houses. It may have been done by the military. A naughty child would also smash the porcelain insulators on the utility poles to see what secrets were inside. When the Ministry of Communications officially took over, it was already in a state of disrepair. As the reporter saw, the original materials had turned into piles of scrap iron and piles of rotten wood. Just the reorganization work alone required considerable manpower and financial resources, which could have been saved, but were ultimately wasted.

Construction Starts in October
First Complete the Large Sluice Gate

Construction can officially start in early October. The first step is to complete a large sluice gate, of which the Japanese have already built eight-tenths. After the sluice gate is completed, it will be much easier for ships to navigate into the Hai River, without having to bypass the long breakwater that protects the port from silt. The lowest water level of the sluice gate channel is five meters, the highest is eight meters, and at high tide it is nine meters. Ships of 3,000 tons can pass without obstruction. It is expected to be completed soon, and ships can be sent to test navigation before the freezing season this year. The new port construction plan has only recently been finalized and has not yet been announced. It is somewhat different from the original Japanese plan. The tonnage capacity is in line with the original Japanese plan, at over 8 million tons per year. The budget for this year is 770,000 yuan, and for next year it is 4 million yuan.

Two Large Breakwaters to Deal with Silt and Waves

The general model of the New Port is to build two large breakwaters, one to prevent siltation from the Yongding River and one to prevent wind and waves from the sea, both over 1,000 meters long. Four berthing wharves are built in the middle. Next is the sluice gate connecting the port to the Hai River, with two gates, as well as warehouses and urban areas. The first and second wharves were originally built by the Japanese, but the current channel is silted up and needs to be re-dredged. The third and fourth wharves only have a portion of the land leveled. The Japanese originally had a large-scale, well-equipped substation, but unfortunately it was completely destroyed and cannot be used. There are two coal loading machines on the second wharf that have become useless. The reporter saw that the military occupied the first wharf, with small landing craft arranged like sardines. American soldiers were sitting in Jeeps reading interesting novels. Five dredgers can start working after a little repair. More than twenty Japanese technicians have been requisitioned to serve us. The former Japanese directors and deputy directors Yamada Saburo and Hinoki Chisato are retained as technical consultants. Recently, Yamada and port consultant Xu Yanmou went to Tokyo to negotiate with Japan to export the machines and equipment used to build the port that were manufactured in Tokyo before. This negotiation was originally settled by our delegation's military attache, General Zhu Shiming, with the MacArthur headquarters.

Built in Three Years, More Advantageous Than Shanghai

Mr. Tian Shuji, the deputy chief engineer of the port construction office, said: From a technical point of view, a northern seaport is easier to build than Tanggu New Port. From an economic value point of view, Tanggu New Port is far superior to a northern seaport, because the two major commercial ports of Tianjin and Beiping are behind it. In the future, when the railways are restored and new lines are built, transportation will be accessible in all directions. The situation is indeed like this. A northern seaport is a natural deep-water port, while Tanggu New Port is artificially excavated. It is the largest port in North China for the flow of goods. In another three years, when the New Port is completed, with a cargo capacity of 8 million tons per year, plus Tianjin's 6 million tons, it will be more advantageous than Shanghai. Tianjin's position in North China can compete with Shanghai in Central China.

Hang Currency Like Waste Paper (Special Correspondent Hangzhou Zhou Reporting)

### Fashionably Dressed Women: Actually Human Traffickers; Headquarters in Macau; Using Domestic Servants as Clues for Abduction; Hong Kong Airlines News, July 7th, Special Correspondent Ling Fang; A Child of Seven or Eight Years Old Worth One Million Dollars Each: Transformed into Adopted Children of Overseas Chinese in Taishan and Kaiping Counties

From the perspective of human trafficking, Hong Kong is a famous "piglet port." Before the war, hundreds of thousands of laborers were sold as "piglets" every year and transported to British or Dutch-owned islands in Southeast Asia to work in land reclamation or mines. After the war, this overseas market was temporarily unable to recover, so the business eyes of human traffickers turned to another direction, and they actually discovered a "New World."

Recently, some families in Hong Kong have suddenly announced that their children are missing. The parents searched everywhere, but to no avail—it turned out that the children had been abducted. It is said that those who engage in human trafficking are very well-organized. They contact customers in the "market" for "goods" on the one hand, and send people to Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhou to try to lure away children who "meet the conditions" on the other. According to the reporter's investigation: a child of seven or eight years old, smart and with correct facial features, regardless of gender, initially costs 700,000 to 800,000 national currency each, and has recently increased to more than one million.

The human trafficking organizations are said to have their headquarters in Macau, and most of the workers are women. They are fashionably dressed, seemingly from wealthy families, in order to disguise themselves from others. They cunningly use ordinary domestic servants as clues for abducting children. Children abducted in Guangdong and Hong Kong must first be transported to Macau and then sent to the "market" nearby.

The formation of that "New World" in the human market is a sad story:

Most of the abducted children are sold to overseas Chinese families in Taishan and Kaiping Counties in Guangdong (commonly known as Siyi). According to guests who recently came to Hong Kong from Siyi, Siyi has suffered a sharp decline in population in recent years due to the Japanese invasion and two famines, reaching a terrifying level. Siyi is the hometown of overseas Chinese in the Americas. After the war, remittances from overseas Chinese flowed smoothly, and large numbers of overseas Chinese returned home. After leaving their hometowns for ten years, most of them found their homes destroyed and their families dead or scattered, as if they were living in another world. Even if their fields were fortunately preserved, they felt lonely and could not bear the desolation. In order to comfort their lonely feelings in old age, they had a tradition of buying adopted children in the past, and now it is even more urgent. Human traffickers have seen the needs of general overseas Chinese and the market is booming.

Overseas Chinese have a lot of money, and some are eager to revitalize their families by buying sons and marrying daughters-in-law. Therefore, sixteen or seventeen-year-old girls have also become targets of abductors. There are many who are ignorant and fall into their trap.

The threat faced by children in Hong Kong and Guangzhou from abductors is much greater than the "skinning chickens" of children in Shanghai! Should the families who have lost their children blame those inhumane abductors, or those elderly overseas Chinese who return home with grief?

### The U.S. and Soviet Union in Korea: The Competition Intensifies

— Special Translation from Our Editorial Department — Translation by Zuoxi from the Saturday Evening Post

The most dangerous line for the United States is the 38th parallel, which bisects Korea. The Soviets attach great importance to this line, while we Americans seem to disregard it. Undoubtedly, this line is drawn between two mutually suspicious nations, where a small misunderstanding could ignite a war. Although this line is far from our Pacific coast, American military leaders consider it crucial to our security, but the general American public has yet to realize its significance.

Before the war, no single sufficiently powerful nation in the Far East could fully control the region. Although Japan was ambitious, it had to consider the Soviet Union, and China still possessed significant self-defense capabilities. After Japan's defeat, the balance of power in the Far East was entirely lost, and the United Nations showed no signs of developing any new force to replace it. This vacuum was filled by new forces from opposite directions: American power came from the sea, with the advantages and disadvantages of maritime transportation; Soviet power came from land, with the advantage of contiguity and the disadvantage of remoteness. These two powers converged in Korea. This 38th parallel is not merely a convenient demarcation line between two allied nations; it is a border between two countries with fundamentally opposing policies.

Inability to Compromise

Korea is the only country where the U.S. and the Soviet Union stand in direct opposition. Many believed that without the involvement of the British or French, our relations with the Soviet Union might be better, but this hope has been greatly disappointed. Korea has become a testing ground for post-war U.S.-Soviet relations, and the conclusion that can be drawn is exceedingly bleak. The U.S. has so far been unable to reach a compromise with the Soviet Union to protect our interests. Korea is also an excellent example of Soviet negotiating tactics and the activity of the fifth column.

To understand the positions of the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Korea, look at the map of Northeast Asia, and you will see that Korea juts out in front of Northeast and North China. Although the Soviet Union has withdrawn from the southern and central parts of Northeast China, allowing the Nationalists and Communists to engage in civil war there, it has not relaxed its grip on the Liaodong Peninsula in southern Northeast China, which is not far from Korea and is the location of Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian (Dairen). Northeast Korea borders Soviet Siberia, and if good roads were built there, it would take only two hours to drive by car from Vladivostok to this area. Assuming the Soviet Union occupies all of Korea's airfields, they could control Northeast China, North China, and the Chinese coastal areas north of Shanghai. They could exert pressure on Japan, regardless of the American occupation forces stationed there. On the other hand, the American influence in southern Korea can also put pressure on Dalian, Vladivostok, and even further places. This is the geographical shape of Korea in the minds of the Soviets, and it explains most of their activities in this region.

The Soviet doctrine is that revolution and civil war are inevitable in capitalist countries, and similarly, war between capitalist countries and the Soviet Union is also inevitable. Currently, the most powerful capitalist country is, of course, the United States, and the Soviet Union believes that war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is bound to happen sooner or later. The Soviet Union's plan in Korea stems from both a geographical concept and this belief.

On our American side, the strategic need is just as clear as it is for the Soviet Union. In the past, we suffered enough from having a powerful, hostile naval power controlling the coast of East Asia. But it does the United States no good to eliminate Japanese control and threats only to replace them with Soviet control and threats. Once Korea falls into Soviet hands, and Soviet influence penetrates North and Central China, a powerful Russian empire will soon emerge, stretching from the far northern coast all the way to the Yangtze River, and it could develop into a military base for future operations against the United States. Therefore, we must maintain America's line in Korea. Although we are willing to make concessions or compromises, we are unwilling to accept the Soviet demand to rule Korea.

Soviet Garrison

The headquarters of the Soviet garrison is located in Pyongyang, the second largest city in Korea. It has good railway lines connecting to the ports on the east coast, from which there is direct sea access to Vladivostok. There is already direct land transportation.

The number of Soviet troops stationed in northern Korea ranges from 220,000 to 250,000, which is much larger than the total number of American occupation forces stationed in both Japan and Korea. Compared to the troops led by Lieutenant General Hodge, whose headquarters are in Seoul, it is like comparing a great wizard to a small one. The Soviet garrison is not only large in number but also consists of elite troops. On both sides of the line, the U.S. stations a squad, while the Soviet Union stations a company or a battalion. The U.S. squad is led by an inexperienced corporal, while the Soviet company is led by a well-trained captain. Everywhere, it shows that the Soviet Union intends to gain a military advantage. The Soviet troops stationed in Korea do not believe that their mission is to maintain order in Korea but to continue fighting against fascism and tyranny. They believe that the American garrison is the only obstacle preventing them from completing this mission.

The contrasting policies of the U.S. and Soviet garrisons are most evident near the line. This dead zone prevents the Korean economy and political life from returning to normal. This artificial obstacle was unexpected even by the Japanese. Previously, residents, vehicles, and goods could move freely, but now all legitimate activities are hindered. The U.S. side's patrols are more lenient, but the Soviet side's defenses are very strict. Probably the only Koreans who can freely pass through the line are those who have obtained permission from the Soviet side.

The Soviet garrison is stationed right on the line, while the U.S. side deliberately retreats in some places to avoid a direct confrontation. The Soviet troops are sometimes very friendly and amiable, but sometimes they become very serious and suspicious. The U.S. military can never grasp their true attitude.

The Soviet Union implements a police state system in northern Korea. Korean men between the ages of seventeen and sixty must carry a citizen's card. Korean people who wish to obtain this citizen's card must first swear allegiance to the Soviet military commander and the Moscow resolutions concerning Korea, otherwise they are treated as criminals. Korean people without a police pass cannot move freely even in northern Korea. Large portraits of Stalin, Lenin, Marx, etc., are displayed in every town, along with various propaganda materials, making people think of this place as a subdivision of the Soviet Union.

Implementing Communism

In northern Korea, all political parties except the Communist Party are prohibited from operating, and Koreans there are not allowed to listen to radio broadcasts from the American occupation zone. All industry and commerce are monopolized by the Soviets. Land exceeding twelve and a half acres is confiscated and distributed to Koreans who do not have land. This land distribution method allows the Soviets to gain the support of the newly created class of small landowners.

The Soviet Union not only implements communism in northern Korea but also deliberately tries to extend communist influence into southern Korea. When the time is right, the Soviet Union will suggest that the U.S. and Soviet garrisons withdraw from Korea simultaneously. After the U.S. military withdraws from Korea, the Korean Communist Party can become very active, and the Korean troops who have received communist training can seize important institutions on the pretext of creating trouble. In a short period of time, the Communist Party can completely control the Korean government and the Korean peninsula, while the Soviet Union will be behind the scenes, promoting its political and military plans.

However, according to recent reports, infighting has broken out within the Communist Party in southern Korea, and disturbances have also occurred in northern Korea. Presumably, the resentment of the residents of northern Korea towards the Communist Party is an undeniable fact. Although the Soviet authorities have a large army stationed there, they cannot help but feel uneasy. On the other hand, the American troops stationed in southern Korea have not had any friction with the Korean people there so far.

But although the Soviet Union's relationship with the Korean people is not as good as ours, their position is still more advantageous than ours. As this situation evolves, it is difficult for us to imagine that the Soviet Union will not achieve final victory.

The 38th parallel in Korea, where the U.S. and Soviet occupation zones are divided. The round house belongs to the U.S. military, and the wooden house belongs to the Soviet military.

### "Alaska" and "Aleutian Islands"

— Zuoqi

According to a United Press report from Pearl Harbor on October 3rd: Admiral Towers, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, told reporters that the U.S. Navy plans to build permanent naval bases in the Aleutian Islands and Alaska to prevent unexpected attacks from abroad due to the recent tense international situation.

Alaska is located in the northwest corner of North America, bordering Canada to the east, and separated from Soviet Siberia by the Bering Strait to the west. This land originally belonged to Russia, and in 1867, the United States purchased it from Russia for $7.2 million, thus becoming American territory. Alaska is bordered by the Pacific and Arctic Oceans to the north and south. The northern coast is straight, but the Pacific coast and the Bering coast have deep bays and numerous islands. The Alaska Peninsula extends southwest, and the Aleutian Islands form a long, continuous strip, which is the first line of Arctic defense for the United States today.

The total length of railways in Alaska is over 1,400 kilometers. Sled dogs can also be used to increase transportation convenience.

Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands is an important U.S. naval base, known as the "Singapore of the North Pacific."

### The Gulf Between the U.S. and Soviet Union

— Chu Yukun

The Two Countries Part Ways and Prepare Separately

The international situation this week still presents a picture of external relaxation and internal tension. Although politicians, diplomats, and even military leaders continue to say things like "war will not break out again," the level of preparedness in various countries is still increasing, especially between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Since the new Secretary of Commerce, Harriman, was sworn into office, the U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union has clearly abandoned the path of the late President Roosevelt. He said: "Marshal Stalin and other Soviet leaders deeply believe that capitalism and communism cannot coexist in the same world, so they are doing everything in their power to obstruct the efforts of Britain and the United States to resolve world political problems. Although the late President Roosevelt also believed that the U.S. and Soviet systems were different, he believed that peaceful coexistence was possible. If Roosevelt were still alive today, he would be implementing the policies adopted by President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes."

On the Soviet side, Victor Kravchenko, author of "I Chose Freedom," published an article in "World News" claiming that Stalin not only believes that the world is threatened by a "new war" but is also doing everything possible to prepare for this new war. At the same time, Reuters correspondent Tang Guo, who was stationed in Moscow, reported on the situation of Soviet military reforms after returning home: (1) Reorganizing the army, strengthening its mobility and independence, and studying the effectiveness of atomic energy. (2) Expanding the navy and air force. It is said that the Soviet Union has the latest bombers and fighters; naval bases are also being expanded; (3) The Soviet army is thoroughly politicized and discipline is improved, with absolute obedience as the slogan. The purpose of Soviet military reform is to adapt to modern warfare. Therefore, in the situation where the U.S. and Soviet Union are parting ways and preparing for war separately, all peace talks are nothing more than an irony to the current situation.

The Paris Peace Conference Concludes as Scheduled

Although the opinions of the representatives of various countries in the Paris Peace Conference are still very divided, with no hope of reaching a consensus, especially on some important issues, the Slavic bloc and the Anglo-American bloc are still diametrically opposed. However, the Paris Peace Conference is scheduled to end on the 15th of this month and cannot be delayed any longer. The conference has been going on for more than two months, and the representatives of various countries have become tired of playing in Paris. They have long been bored with holding meetings and discussions, and all hope that the conference will end soon so that they can go to New York to change the air. Therefore, the draft treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland did not encounter any major difficulties and were passed by the plenary session of the conference. The chairman of the last conference was originally scheduled to be Guo Taiqi, head of the Chinese delegation, but the French delegation requested that France preside over it in order to fulfill its obligations as the host country, and China happily accepted.

The Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference opened on July 28th and ended on October 15th. It lasted for a full two months and eighteen days, making it the longest peace conference in human history. Although it passed the draft treaties with the five nations, it did not reach any solutions to important world political problems. This makes us unable to help but acknowledge the difficulty of creating world peace.

The Straits Issue: U.S. and Britain Agree

Regarding the issue of the Turkish Straits, the Soviet Union has twice sent notes to the Turkish government, requesting that the Soviet Union and Turkey jointly defend the Dardanelles Strait. What is the attitude of Britain and the United States? It is often a matter of concern to the world. Although the United States opposes the Soviet-Turkish joint defense of the Straits, it is also willing to consider the Soviet Union's legitimate rights in the Straits area. U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, notified the Soviet Union on the 9th, reiterating that the United States, as a country concerned with the Turkish Straits, should participate in any revision of the Montreux Convention. He also said that the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union had unanimously agreed at the Potsdam Conference that the status of the Straits needed to be revised, but the method of revision should be in accordance with the provisions of the Montreux Convention. The United States could not agree with the Soviet Union's claim that the status of the Straits was only related to Turkey and the Black Sea countries. Turkey still bears the heavy responsibility of defending the Straits alone. In the future, if the Straits are directly or indirectly threatened, Turkey can appeal to the United Nations Security Council.

Since the attitude of Britain and the United States is so clear, Turkey can have nothing to fear. As for the Soviet Union's reaction, it depends on what kind of diplomatic offensive it will launch against Turkey.

French Vote: Ballot on the Charter

Since its liberation, the French political system has still been in the nature of a provisional government. The French head of state, Bidault, is still called the provisional president and prime minister. Although the National Constituent Assembly drafted a draft constitution between April and May of this year, it was put to a referendum on May 5th of this year, but it was rejected. The National Constituent Assembly's previous efforts were in vain. Another general election was held to redraft the constitution. The leaders of France's three major parties (i.e., the Catholic Progressive Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party) have done everything possible to compromise, in order to complete the most democratic constitution in the shortest possible time and end the provisional government as soon as possible.

This referendum on the draft constitution was originally not a problem at all, but General de Gaulle gave two speeches before the referendum, expressing his opposition to this draft constitution, inevitably causing some of the voters, especially the members of the Catholic Progressive Party, to be influenced by him and change their votes to against. Therefore, the majority obtained by the French draft constitution was really not much, which is enough to illustrate the complexity of French domestic affairs. The problems in the future are still just beginning. October 15th

### Communism Attacks the Japanese, Secretly Plotting to Overthrow the Conservative Cabinet

The Japanese occupation apparatus is entirely controlled by the United States. Because the U.S. prevents the Soviet Union from using the occupation apparatus to promote its policies, the Soviet side has now begun to adopt roundabout methods to make the Japanese people lean towards communism. The propaganda news broadcast by many radio stations in Siberia aims to encourage the Japanese to oppose the government of the conservative parties and to make the Japanese public lose confidence in the occupation headquarters.

The Soviet Union's current goal is to overthrow the current conservative cabinet that governs Japan. Ultimately, it hopes that Japan will become a pro-communist and pro-Soviet country. The Soviet side believes that the United States is establishing an anti-communist and reactionary government in Japan and suspects that the United States intends to turn Japan into its forward base.

The United States is firmly opposed to communism in Japan and advocates cultivating a conservative regime that is friendly to Western countries. A democratic constitution is being implemented, and during the occupation period, the Japanese people will receive training in democratic politics.

The occupation authorities are governing the country with a conservative cabinet. The Allied Headquarters hopes that this cabinet will continue to perform its duties until the new constitution is passed in parliament.

For this reason, the Allied Headquarters' policy of opposing radical activities is becoming more and more stringent. MacArthur personally issued a warning prohibiting mass demonstrations against the cabinet. The Japanese government has been granted permission to restrict the activities of the Japanese labor unions, because most of these groups have socialist leanings.

The Soviet broadcasts, on the one hand, advocate overthrowing the current cabinet, and on the other hand, urge the opposition forces in Japan to unite. Soviet broadcasters who speak Japanese fluently refer to Prime Minister Yoshida and his cabinet as reactionaries. The voices from Siberia advise Japanese supporters of democracy to organize a democratic front and fight to expel "these war criminals."

Overthrowing the Japanese cabinet at this time could increase the strength of the opposition parties. Currently, Japan lacks food, has five million unemployed, rampant inflation, and a shortage of housing. No government can overcome these difficulties. But this economic situation will naturally arouse public dissatisfaction with the ruling government, so the forces that oppose the two conservative parties that support the Yoshida cabinet are growing.

### Unemployment Increases, Anti-Government Sentiment Grows

A public opinion survey conducted by Japanese newspapers believes that if an election were held now, the strength of the opposition parties would increase greatly, especially the Social Democratic Party, because the party has the support of labor. Currently, the Social Democratic Party occupies one-fifth of the seats in parliament. If it gains more in the election, it can form a government with the Communist Party and independents who occupy a majority in parliament.

The purpose of Soviet propaganda is to overthrow the Yoshida cabinet and force Japan to hold elections in the hope that non-conservative parties can rise to prominence as a result.

Soviet broadcasters attack the basic policies of the Occupation Headquarters with harsh words. They say that the new Japanese constitution supported by MacArthur's headquarters is a deceptive document, the purpose of which is nothing more than to retain the emperor, in which it despises the rights of ordinary people, making the cabinet and parliament obey the emperor. In fact, it is not much different from the previous constitution.

The Soviet Union believes that the Japanese emperor is a war criminal and opposes Japan maintaining the imperial system, even making him a powerless symbol, because he is the center that led the Japanese people to carry out world hegemony.

### Japanese Express Confidence in MacArthur

— Nan, translated from World Weekly

According to the Soviet side, Japan's land reform is being obstructed by the Occupation Headquarters. Officials of MacArthur's headquarters are protecting Japanese reactionaries and preventing the redistribution of land.

MacArthur himself is also the target of Soviet attacks, saying that he is infringing on the authority of the Far Eastern Commission and failing to cooperate with the Allied Council for Japan. The Far Eastern Commission, representing eleven countries, is responsible for determining basic policies towards Japan. And the mission of the Allied Council for Japan is to provide advice to the Supreme Commander of the Occupation Forces. Soviet broadcasters said that the American occupation authorities have failed to cooperate harmoniously with these two commissions and are therefore intentionally or unintentionally helping Japanese war leaders to escape the fulfillment of the surrender terms.

But Soviet propaganda is not necessarily going to achieve its goal, although it may have some impact on the future overthrow of the Japanese cabinet.

Generally speaking, the Japanese seem to be quite satisfied with MacArthur's occupation work, because everything has not been as severe as they had imagined at the time of surrender. For a year, MacArthur has enjoyed a good reputation among the Japanese public and his position is very stable. Most Japanese are still afraid of communism and especially oppose the Communist Party's advocacy of overthrowing the Japanese imperial system.

The U.S. State Department is determined to prevent the Japanese occupation work from being divided as in *country name removed due to policy violation* and *country name removed due to policy violation*. Therefore, the U.S. government will continue to give MacArthur full support.

The foundation of the Japanese occupation apparatus is very solid, and foreign propaganda cannot shake it.

### Ouyang Xiu and Zhu Shuzhen's "Sheng Zha Zi" Case

— Sun Yuehan

Ouyang Xiu was a great writer of the Northern Song Dynasty, and Zhu Shuzhen was a female poet of the Southern Song Dynasty. Both of them left behind collections of poetry and lyrics after their deaths. Moreover, both of their collections contain a "Sheng Zha Zi" lyric. That "Sheng Zha Zi" lyric is: "Last year on the Lantern Festival, the flower market's lanterns were like paintings. The moon rose above the willow branches, after dusk fell. This year on the Lantern Festival, the moon and lanterns are as before; but I do not see the person from last year, and tears wet my spring sleeves"! Because both of their poetry collections coincidentally contain this lyric, readers have countless doubts when they read it. After much debate and evidence from many researchers and literary critics, it is still impossible to distinguish the true from the false, and no one can tell which is which; at most, it is a case of this being one right and that being another, without sufficient reason. Fortunately, Chinese literati have always liked to be sloppy and stick to tradition, thinking that it is better to leave things vague than to solve them. Thus, it seems that this case has not yet received a truly accurate review and judgment to this day. I do not have the vision of an appraiser, nor the resources of a researcher, but I usually like to explore and refer to obscure phrases and classics. When I encounter a doubt, I often search until I forget to eat and sleep, until the truth comes out. I don't know when I accidentally recalled this case, and after reading Zhu Shuzhen's "Heartbroken Poetry and Lyrics Collection" and Ouyang Xiu's "Poetry and Lyrics Collection," I immediately realized that this "Sheng Zha Zi" lyric was indeed written by Zhu Shuzhen. Readers who want to know more about Ouyang Xiu's life experience and anecdotes need not be elaborated upon. Now, I will briefly introduce Zhu Shuzhen, firstly to confirm my views, and secondly to allow this generation of female writers who are deeply hidden and depressed to show their faces again in modern times.

Zhu Shuzhen was from Haining, Zhejiang, around the same time as Zhu Xi, and it is also said that she was Zhu Xi's niece, but this is somewhat inaccurate because, in terms of birthplace, Zhu Xi was from Xin'an. The genealogy does not record any brothers who moved to Haining. From a young age, Zhu Shuzhen already possessed a natural talent, was beautiful and charming, and loved to read. When she was at the budding age, she loved poetry and lyrics and once wrote a poem: "I first comb my hair and learn to paint my eyebrows, not knowing to whom my heart belongs? I will wait to hold the full Mid-Autumn Moon and separate from Xiao Lang with ten thousand poems." From this poem, it can be seen that she already had a very romantic and unrestrained mind and ambition at that time. She hoped to marry a talented man who could write poetry and prose, gentle and refined, so that they could reciprocate in the boudoir and enjoy the pleasure of companionship. Who knew that her parents were careless in her early years and deeply poisoned by the old ethical marriage system? They arranged a marriage with an ordinary family in the marketplace, so that she married a mediocre husband who knew nothing about poetry and books. Writing poetry and composing lyrics was like playing the lute to a cow. Although they did not often quarrel, she was depressed and sad because of this, and eventually died with resentment. Her poems and lyrics are full of expressions of dissatisfaction, most notably in a poem called "Sorrow": "Gulls, herons, mandarin ducks make a pond, knowing that wings are not suitable for each other; the Lord of Spring does not let flowers be the master, how can they grow together as intertwined branches"! She herself resented marrying the wrong person, and in a poem to her parents, she also wrote: "Poetry and etiquette are said to be far away, who are my relatives with zithers and wine? Sadly, I look at the silk sleeves, and new tear stains are constantly wiped away." Reading these four lines of poetry, one can know that she had been accustomed to playing with poetry, lyrics, zithers, and wine at home with her parents since she was a child. However, once she arrived at her husband's house, she no longer had this kind of companion that she loved! Therefore, she felt the desolation of life and the mediocrity of her husband. In her sadness, she could only wash her face with tears, and her silk sleeves were covered with tear stains! She also expressed her feelings in a poem on an autumn day: "Although a woman's eyes are soft, tears do not flow casually; I have no good feelings, so I wave away the autumn of the five lakes." Those who have a heart will probably not be able to help but shed tears for her when they read it.

Therefore, whenever there was a flowery morning, a moonlit evening, or a lamp before the moon, she would write her own feelings and thoughts at will to relieve her depression. In the poems and lyrics she wrote, most of them were nothing more than sorrow, resentment, sighs, hatred, grief, sadness, injury, lament, sickness, and tears. In summary, these things were enough to break her heart, and the common thread was the word "alone." Almost every poem in the collection contained an element of loneliness, such as: "Sitting alone by the small window without a companion, ashamed to face the crabapple flowers"; "Particularly suitable for a small pavilion under a secluded window; burning incense alone, sleeping alone"; "Sitting alone by the small window without a companion, pitying the frosty moon that is round towards people"; "Who can understand my quiet feelings at this time? Sitting alone in the courtyard, the night is already deep"; "Leaning on the railing alone, doing nothing, reading books in the cool breeze"; "The lonely lamp under the window dims by itself, bored, I lazily close the door"; "Leaning on the empty building late at night"; "Heavy rain flies on all four eaves, sitting silently in the empty room"; "Wandering under the moon shadow, wanting to leave but still reluctant"; "How many old things, who will I share them with tonight"? "I will offer my good feelings to accompany my dreams, only fearing that the lamp flower cannot bear the cold"! And so on, countless to list. There are also many places in the poems and lyrics where she sheds tears, such as: "Who can I tell my melancholy feelings to? I can't bear to look at the tears dripping on my silk clothes"; "Tears are welling up on my peach blossom face, sorrow flowing deeply onto my pillow"; "The lamp flower occupies the matter of burning my heart, and my silk sleeves are always used to wipe away my tears"; "Leaning on my pillow in the cold, unable to sleep, even a heart of iron and stone will shed tears"; "Turning and tossing in the mandarin duck quilt, who can I splash my pearl-like tears on"? "Sitting on the tower in the setting sun, leaning alone and secretly shedding tears," and so on.

Her situation was so desolate, and her husband was not to her liking; whenever there was a beautiful scene or a good time, she could not help but feel that it was all in vain. For example: "Leaning on the window all day long, quietly, what can I do with this spring before my eyes"? "The pond water is warm, and mandarin ducks come in pairs; the wind in the alleys is light, and swallows fly around"; "There is no place without the colors of spring in the world, only the people who should be reunited have not returned"; "The orioles and flowers have hatred and only offer it to me, the peach and plum trees are silent and only annoy me"; "How many places are there to hurt my heart, and I cannot control my melancholy feelings"; "Good times and beautiful scenery all become hatred, do not ask about the new year and the old year." Her resentment can be imagined. The "Sheng Zha Zi" lyric was created under these circumstances. In the two lines, "The moon rises above the willow branches, after dusk fell," some people think that Zhu Shuzhen had illicit love affairs, and the word "约" (yue, meaning "appointment") refers to having private affairs with a boyfriend. Some people think that the word "约" refers to her female companions. If Zhu Shuzhen really had a boyfriend, her poetry collection would have been burned by her parents, and less than one percent of it would have been preserved; it would already be just fragments, making it difficult to see the whole picture. But in her existing poems and lyrics, she has already revealed her hidden thoughts. For example, in "Sending Feelings," she wrote: "I want to send my longing and fill the paper with sorrow, the fish sinks and the wild goose stops again, clearly this trip is not far, but it feels like an endless end of the world." In "Unable to Sleep," she wrote: "The slight clouds blow, Xiao Night is not yet distant, pear blossoms with the moon reflect on the window screen, do not think too much about the surname, causing new sorrow to be chaotic like hemp." The second one says, "Silently hurting my spirit by playing the zither backwards with tears, picking out the cold lamp until I cannot sleep, taking off the phoenix hairpin to find dreams, opening my eyes until dawn in bed." The lyric "Hong Chen Zi" says: "The slanting wind and drizzle make the spring cold. Facing the wine, I recall the past joy; I once held the pear blossoms and wept silently, the fragrant grass breaks the smoke on the southern path. With tears of farewell, I look at the green mountains, last night I only got a dream opportunity, the water and clouds are leisurely, silently, what can I do when I wake up and my sorrow and hatred are still there. Turning and tossing in the quilt, I regret it in vain, it is easy to see heaven, it is difficult to see him." In "Sending Farewell," there is a saying: "The writing paper is full of a thousand sorrows, but there is not a single point of communication in my heart." One of the three "Lantern Festival" poems says: "Candles and silver flowers are red to the eye, and the drums and trumpets that open the sky are noisy with the spring wind. New joy is in hand in the midst of sorrow, and old things startle my heart in my dreams. I only wish to temporarily become lingering, and it doesn't matter if the moon is often hazy; how can I have time to get drunk while enjoying the lanterns, it may not be the same meeting next year." There are also two lines: "Returning, the forbidden leak has passed three or four, and the thin shadow of plum blossoms lies across the window." It can be seen that Zhu Shuzhen watched the lanterns until late at night on the Lantern Festival, and returned only when the moon reached the middle of the sky. Then, what is said in the "Sheng Zha Zi" lyric is indeed true, and there is no way to avoid it. Perhaps that lyric was written on the Lantern Festival of the year after this joyful meeting. If the word "约" refers to a female companion, then there are two poems in the collection about not going on a spring outing: "The neighboring girl invited me to go on a spring outing, I forced myself to brush away my sad eyebrows and go down the small building, but I hesitated to go out and reflected on myself, knowing that I was haggard and ashamed to see people"; "I am too lazy to respond to the intentions of young people, and my love of mood has always stopped, if I go to the old amusement place, I should only see spring sorrow in my eyes." Since there are spring outings with female companions, then there is nothing wrong with enjoying the moon with female companions as well. Therefore, regardless of whether it is a boyfriend or a girlfriend, this appointment did indeed exist in Zhu Shuzhen's life.

Speaking of Ouyang Xiu, he was born as a Jinshi and served as a remonstrance official, a participant in political affairs, a Hanlin attendant reader, a deputy privy councilor, a Qingzhou civil servant, a Chuzhou judge, and a junior tutor to the crown prince. He was nicknamed Drunkard and later called himself Layman of Six Ones, and was posthumously honored as Duke Wenzhong. Usually, his interactions with poetry, wine, and friends must have made his courtyard as crowded as a market, extremely lively, not to mention the Lantern Festival. How could he wander alone under the moon, sighing sadly and even shedding tears when the Golden City did not prohibit the blossoming of fireworks? Therefore, putting this lyric into Ouyang's collection seems a bit inappropriate, because male longing and nostalgia will never lead to weeping.

Ouyang Xiu once wrote a lyric: "Willows of Jiangnan, the leaves are small and have not yet provided shade, how can people bear to break them because the silk is light? Orioles pity the tender branches and cannot bear to sing, leave them to wait for the depth of spring. At fourteen or fifteen, leisurely holding a pipa to find, on the hall, money and wealth go down, at that time, meeting again is already concerned, let alone now"? After this lyric was written, many scholars criticized and refuted it, thinking that it was an erotic song; with Ouyang Xiu's prominent status, he was not allowed to write love lyrics at all, and any element of stealing incense and jade would reduce his reputation. He himself considered this lyric to be a lifelong burden after writing it. But comparing the "Sheng Zha Zi" lyric with the "Jiangnan Willow" lyric, its eroticism seems to be even greater than that of the latter. "Preface to Elegant Lyrics of the Yuefu Association" says: "Lord Ou is a substitute for Confucianism, and he prides himself on being romantic, but small people may write erotic lyrics and falsely attribute them to Lord Ou." "Records of Famous Ministers" also says: "When Xiu knew the Gongju, he was resented by Liu Yun and other candidates who failed the examination, and he was falsely accused of writing lyrics such as 'Drunk in the Penglai' and 'Looking at Jiangnan'." It can be seen that when later generations compiled Ouyang Xiu's collection of poetry and lyrics, many works by others were included. This "Sheng Zha Zi" lyric may have been a mistake made during the compilation.

Ouyang Xiu wrote very few poems and lyrics alone at night, while Zhu Shuzhen mostly composed them when she was alone and bored on moonlit nights. Taking the words "黄昏" (huanghun, meaning "dusk") in the lyric, they are often seen in the Collection of Heartbroken Poems and Lyrics, such as: "Like pear blossoms and drizzle after dusk"; "Sorrow becomes even greater at dusk"; "Fearing dusk and then twilight"; "Heavy rain falls at dusk"; "A slender new moon hangs at dusk"; "Facing each other in the water pavilion, it is already dusk"; "The old scenery of willows at dusk"; "Floating clouds all chase after dusk"; "Under the steps after a light rain at dusk"; "Leaning on the railing alone after dusk," and so on.

In short, after comparing, speculating, and judging from all aspects, it is indeed proven that the "Sheng Zha Zi" lyric belongs to Zhu Shuzhen. Because the circumstances, situation, life experience, and tone of the lyric are all different from Ouyang Xiu but coincide with Zhu Shuzhen.

### Sparks

— Tian Su

I love sparks, although sparks are so small.

But friends, we should not underestimate these tiny sparks. Tiny sparks are the genesis of the greatest force in the world!

With fire, there is light, there is heat, there is force. Tens of millions of small forces produced by sparks, gathered from tens of millions of corners, isn't that a huge torrent? It will destroy all strong and stubborn obstacles and flow all over every uneven surface of the earth.

Let me tell you a story from our childhood.

It was a winter dusk. We were playing too much on a wasteland far from the city, making us forget the way home. Yes, we lost our way, and the sky turned dark. The sky was covered with dark clouds. The moon and stars were swallowed in the darkness. The sharp night wind was blowing in our ears, carrying the miserable cries of seagulls. Withered trees, barren fields, tombs... the surroundings were so gloomy. In the heavy encirclement of darkness, we could not see our own shadows. We were all anxious and our hearts were shrouded in terror. We all wanted to cry. Suddenly:

"Look, isn't there a fire in front!"

One of our companions shouted with joy. We looked up and looked forward. Ah! A tiny spark was flashing in front. Although it was a tiny spark, what lay in front of us was no longer darkness! Our hearts were revived. We got new vitality. The light of hope was burning in our eyes. We rushed toward this spark.

Gradually, this tiny spark turned into a huge light. It shone in front of our eyes, like a mother's gentle palm, gently stroking our bodies. We gained the village, we gained sympathy, we gained warmth, we all smiled with relief, and we regained the light!

Korolenko said it well: "This kind of night fire has this characteristic: it overcomes darkness, it is close to us, it is shining." Yes, fire is the source of everything that comforts and amuses mankind!

In Greek mythology, Prometheus stole a spark of fire for the sake of the unimproved lives of humans on the ground. As a result, humans on the ground became more active. And Prometheus was therefore bound to the desolate rocks of Scythia and suffered for who knows how many years.

Although sparks are just a small bit of power.

But friends, have you ever heard, "A single spark can start a prairie fire"?

Let a tiny spark shine on the wasteland of the dark night!

### The Drama of the Novel

— Wang Pingling

A fortunate playwright, when his plays are often staged in major cities, his royalties, performing rights fees, if the theater agents and bookstore owners don't skim off the top, are naturally substantial. Some authors who are used to writing novels are also envious and itchy, and they start to practice writing scripts using the techniques of novels; but very few succeed. The reason is the lack of "drama." The British novelist Conrad once spent a lot of effort to adapt his famous work "The Secret Agent" into a play, and asked the playwright Galsworthy for advice. Galsworthy was confident that he could say a few honest words with the assurance of friendship, so he pointed out many shortcomings from the content and form of the script, purely from an objective point of view, hoping that he would correct them. Conrad agreed in person, expressing full agreement; however, because he had suffered greatly when adapting the script, he always felt that the success of the performance was absolutely possible. He thought silently: "Don't criticize me in an old-fashioned way, as long as it is moved to the stage, it will definitely take your front seat." In the end, he refused his criticism and did not change a single word. Who knew that when it was staged, it was indeed dry and dull, and not welcomed by the audience. Even friends who came to support the show could not help but sigh slightly and whisper to each other: "This is simply not a script, but a novel divided into acts."

Conrad's utter failure lies in the mistaken belief that all literary forms can use similar techniques to achieve the effect of expression. Everyone knows that although novels and dramas have many similarities, there are still different distinctions. People who want to try unfamiliar literary forms, neither can investigate their unique techniques, nor are willing to humbly accept the well-intentioned advice of experts. Undoubtedly, the result of their attempts must be a complete failure!

Both novels and dramas narrate stories, introduce characters, and explain the environment and time; however, modern novels should try to use acting methods as much as possible, letting the characters explain themselves and portraying the characters' personalities through actions. Only when absolutely necessary should they not write meaningless dialogues, and they must understand the "montage" technique commonly used in movies, writing out the people, places, and times in the story in an economical and concise way, and absolutely avoid redundant narration. Especially when characters appear in novels, everyone feels that the past flat spread is not as lively and active as the three-dimensional appearance in dramas. Modern novelists must be able to write characters on paper as three-dimensional as if the characters appeared on the stage, which is a technique that novelists must be good at. Otherwise, the drama of the novel will inevitably be extremely poor. What is the difference between a novel that lacks drama and those bland news reports?

Some novelists, such as Conrad, Henry James, and George Moore, can write better novels, but their works lack drama; therefore, the scripts they try to write are read plays, and once they are staged, they invariably fail. However, Alexandre Dumas, fils, the author of "La Dame aux Camélias," and Nikolai Gogol, the author of "Dead Souls," can also write better scripts because they are able to use acting methods when writing novels, making their works full of drama. That is to say, authors who cannot make their novels full of drama can never write scripts, and they cannot write dramatic novels without using acting methods to write novels. Dramatic authors do not need to know how to write novels, but novelists should read more famous plays, often watch the performances of various plays, and carefully experience the techniques of acting.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 64

— Ye Jingfeng

Before the car had traveled ten miles, we had already encountered trouble twice. At this time, it was too late to regret, so we could only be extra careful. The car was moving very slowly, the tracks were uneven, and it was shaking badly. Brother Hu and I had not rested all night. At this time, we had more food in our stomachs, the car was stuffy with sweat, and the weather was dull. With the car shaking, we felt very sleepy. Seeing that Brother Hu had already fallen asleep with his head drooping, I had to lean against the car wall and try my best to prop up my eyelids, looking at the fields outside the window to relieve my fatigue.

I don't know how much time had passed like this. I think it was at most ten or eight minutes. Suddenly, I heard Brother Hu shout loudly, "Hey—what's going on?" In the shouting, there was also a "pa" sound. It was just a moment. By the time I turned my head in surprise, Brother Hu had already jumped up. There was another "splash" sound, and I saw a tea vendor on the car holding his face, blood dripping from the corner of his mouth. A pot of boiling water porcelain was broken on the ground, and the water splashed on many people nearby.

Brother Hu wanted to go forward, but I quickly shouted to stop him. I asked what had happened, and it turned out that the tea vendor deliberately spilled a pot of boiling water on Brother Hu's leg.

At this time, the car immediately became noisy, full of public opinion: "This kid has skills, he knocked out two front teeth with one slap... People didn't mean to pour water on him... Ah, beat him... This kid is a spy, dare to hit people... Hold him, don't let him slip away..." While it was noisy, the front and rear car doors surged in, and many people came, some were car attendants, tea vendors, and two or three escorting police officers, as if they had made an appointment.

I stood with my back against the car window, watching the changes with cold eyes. The beaten tea vendor, seeing that people had come, immediately made a gesture and rushed towards Brother Hu, raising his hand to punch. Brother Hu laughed and casually grabbed the guy's arm and twisted it. Such a big man immediately knelt down, only shouting in pain. At this moment, the merchant-dressed thing sitting opposite us stood up, left his seat, pointed at Brother Hu, and shouted to the people who came in, "Arrest him and take him down!"

With this, the situation became clear, knowing that this was an arranged situation. The merchant-dressed person, without a doubt, must be the special agent's henchman, who came on the car to deliberately sit opposite us, trying to investigate our origins and route. Seeing that soft deception did not work, Brother Hu did not fall for it, so there was this trick of spilling boiling water. Maybe the original plan was not like this, because they did not know that Brother Hu was so skilled, so the evolution changed. If they had known in advance that Brother Hu was so skilled, perhaps the means would have been even more vicious.

"Hitting people on the car for no reason? - On what basis?" The police officers were already pressing forward.

"Are you the road bureau's police officers?... I have to explain this matter." I was afraid that Brother Hu would make too much trouble, making it difficult to end the scene, so I pulled him behind me. The tea vendor who was twisted was hugging his arm, standing in front, tilting his neck.

"Are you together?" A scar-eyed, thick-lipped police officer asked me, pretending to speak Chinese like a Japanese.

"Yes, he is my nephew, I am his aunt; probably together." I replied to him lightly.

"Why hit people? If he is wrong, he should go to me to explain it. Do you know that there is 'law' here?" This scar-eyed guy glared his eyes.

Hearing his tone, probably anyone who is a citizen of the Republic of China should be angry. I was originally prepared to teach this guy a lesson, but when I thought of our important mission, I must not fall for their trick because of this matter, I could only find a way to jump out of this circle of demons, so I said coldly:

"Since you are reasonable, then it is easy to talk... Now I and my nephew are together, so it is inconvenient to speak publicly for myself. Please ask these fellow passengers what exactly happened." As I spoke, I pointed my finger at a circle of people near me.

I don't know if these citizens believed in the philosophy of "each sweeps the snow in front of his own door," or if they were afraid of these hooligan police officers, or if they knew that there was a trap lurking in it. Just after I pointed like this, as if I had magic in my hand, everyone turned away at the same time.

"What are you talking to them about, arrest them and talk later!" The merchant-dressed person was a little anxious. Believe it or not, just as this sentence was finished, the train slowly stopped. It turned out that it had arrived at Shuangqiao Station.

### Cautions

— Shao Fu

At the anniversary reception of the China School of Journalism, Mr. Pan Gongzhan mentioned something: It seems that in recent times, various sectors have shown a tendency to be cautious toward journalists. This tendency can be said to be good for journalists, as it indicates prudence and responsibility. It can also be said to be bad, because it somewhat implies aversion. Regardless of which aspect it belongs to, we should all reflect and restrain ourselves; otherwise, we will inevitably be affected in news gathering.

Because of these words, I am reminded of Blair's article in The New York Times Magazine, which recently published a review of President Truman's press conferences, two paragraphs of which say:

"The American president's press conference can be said to be the main illustration of American democratic thought. Because the source of power of the American government, including the president, is the consent of the governed. Therefore, government officials are public servants, and their actions must be accountable to the people. News reporters at press conferences can unofficially represent the American people in questioning their administration."

"When the president is waiting for the reporters to come in, he often greets the people near his desk by calling them by their names, acting very affectionately. When the receptionist says, 'Everyone is here,' the whole place is silent. The giggling in the front row and the chatting in the back row stop immediately. The president stands up. He is no longer 'ordinary person' Truman; he is the President of the United States, and in front of him are representatives of the free press of the United States and reporters from other countries."

News reporters themselves certainly need to reflect and restrain themselves, and it is also most fundamental that everyone clearly divides responsibilities, abides by the law, and does not conflate public and private matters. If everyone can do this, then there is no need for caution, because caution, if allowed to fester, will evolve into a blockade.

Random Thoughts on Advertisements

### Strange and Bizarre, Then and Now

If you casually open a newspaper and look at those boxed advertisements, it is not difficult to see many bizarre pictures and words. Mermaids with human heads and snake bodies, fat babies with swollen bellies and feet, fashionable nude women, patients with rotten heads and feet – at a glance, feelings of beauty and disgust arise simultaneously. If you examine the words in those boxes in detail, most of the "advertising literature" makes you want to vomit, laugh, or curse! The reason is that in those multicolored, seemingly coherent but ultimately nonsensical words, there is no lack of good words like "exquisite," "king," "sensational," "unprecedented," "sacrifice," "delicious," etc., all of which are uniform and unchanging for thousands of years!

Of course, there are also some good advertisements that can be innovative and eye-catching. For example, the advertisements of several shoe and hat stores not long ago were indeed creatively produced. There are even more advertisements that are bizarre and intriguing. Recently, in a certain Chinese newspaper in Hong Kong, I saw an advertisement with the title "Introducing Mr. ×××, a Strange Doctor from Our Country, Using Medicine to Improve Social Morality," which said: "Doctor × has invented the latest and most wonderful medicines: Anti-Suicide Pills, Anti-Harm-to-the-People Pills, Anti-Adultery Pills, Anti-Divorce Pills, Anti-Free-Love Pills, Filial Piety to Parents Pills, Harmony Brings Prosperity Pills, Charity and Compassion Pills, Anti-Viewing-Bad-Movies Powder, Anti-Viewing-Lewd-Dramas Pills...etc. All of the above medicines, when taken according to symptoms, are invariably miraculous." What exactly are the pills mentioned in this advertisement? Or is there something else they are referring to? It truly leaves one feeling baffled and amused.

### Special Announcement

I remember seeing a newspaper advertisement before, which was a notice from a certain consolidated tax bureau at the time. The content was: "Regarding the matter of announcement; This bureau has now hired Dr. Zou ×× as a medical consultant. In addition to sending a letter of appointment, this announcement is made specifically. Dr. Zou's clinic...telephone...outpatient service...××× Consolidated Tax Bureau." To advertise for a doctor like this is truly unprecedented.

Here, I will write about some strange and bizarre advertisements from various countries around the world. These advertisements are not limited to those seen in newspapers.

The Indian Observer once carried an advertisement: "Mesu Soap, with the function of cleaning the skin, making it beautiful and fragrant, exciting your body and soul." It also said that the quality of the goods exceeded all European soaps because "if you are a man and use this soap, your career will definitely flourish; if you are a woman, you will immediately find a good husband."

A large gold and silver jewelry store in Spain made a skeleton out of real gold. The head, hands, feet, and body were all sculpted from gold, and electrical moving parts were installed to make the skeleton reach out, wave its hands and feet, and make all kinds of surprising movements to attract the attention of passersby. This novel advertisement even won the top prize at the country's advertising exhibition.

### The Ingenious Use of Tombstones

— Zheng

In a cemetery in Paris, there is a tombstone that reads: "Tomb of Fournier, inventor of the Eternal Flame Lamp. The lamp he invented consumes only one centime of oil per hour. He was also a good father, a good son, and a good husband. His widow is still continuing to run the Eternal Flame Lamp business, and goods can be delivered throughout the city. Those who see this tomb, please do not forget the lamp store across the street." Such advertising is simply inconceivable. Even more wonderful, there are even matchmaking advertisements on tombstones. This was in a cemetery in Massachusetts, USA, where there was such a wonderful passage on a tombstone:

"In memory of John H. Leighton, who died on August 6, 1800. His widow is extremely sad and hopes that compassionate people will go to comfort her. She is very young, only twenty-four years old, and possesses all the virtues of a good wife. She lives at number four Church Street in this village."

The world is so big, there is truly nothing that is not strange!

### Going Abroad

— Ge Zhen

After reading the article "Direct Flight to San Francisco" published in the Shen Bao, I realized the trouble of studying abroad is like "passing five barriers" and "beheading six generals." One must pass the barriers before being able to ride the long wind and break through the waves, finally breaking free from the encirclement and obtaining the opportunity to study abroad.

Of course, this does not mean that every student studying abroad has to go through such troublesome procedures. Being close to the water tower makes it easier to get the first glimpse of the moon: Some follow important national figures as nominal staff members, some request a special permit, some impersonate the wife of a diplomat, and some act as attendants to important medical figures going abroad, and they can cross the ocean. After a year and a half, they return to their home country and call themselves "students who studied abroad."

Genuine, qualified students studying abroad should not be so "careless." They should first cultivate considerable abilities in their home country, and not be like the situations described above: going abroad without a purpose and returning home without any gains. If one is a political science student, it would be fine to enter Yale, Oxford, Cambridge, or other universities. After graduating and working in the country, familiarizing themselves with the political situation, they might as well go abroad again and work in overseas agencies, gaining some experience. Such internal and external transfers will surely yield practical results. Otherwise, if it is just a name without substance, why bother?

Scientific Knowledge

### Shooting Stars Fly

— Yi He

The newspaper reported that on the night of October 8, thousands of meteors flew across the sky, resembling fireworks in the sky, and would continue for three days, until the 10th. Meteors were called Ben Xing (running stars) in ancient times. On a clear night, when we look up at the sky, we often see a star moving from one place to another, with a streak of light behind it, which is a meteor. So-called meteors are actually not like stars in the sky, and are not stars. It should be known that all things in the universe have the property of mutual absorption, that is, gravity. Therefore, various celestial bodies are scattered throughout the universe, and occasionally they are close to other celestial bodies, so a part of them is attracted. If another star is attracted by the Earth, and a part of it comes to Earth, that is a meteor.

Because meteors descend rapidly to the Earth and encounter the Earth's atmosphere, they become incandescent due to friction, so they can be seen shining. Their speed of travel is 20 to 40 miles per second, averaging 35 miles. The heating is greatest at a distance of more than 200 miles from the ground, and they are destroyed by their own combustion at a distance of 50 miles from the ground. Therefore, meteors are only swift sky travelers. However, some meteors are too large and have not burned up completely when they reach the vicinity of the ground and fall to the ground, and are called meteorites (Meteorte). According to chemical analysis, it is known that meteorites are mostly oxygen, iron, and sulfur.

Why are there so many dusts in the so-called city of dust? Apart from general coal smoke, it can be said that most of it is produced by meteors, because the ashes left over from the burning of meteors are scattered on the ground.

Meteors also exist during the day, but we cannot see them with the naked eye! If meteors fly to the Earth in groups, they are called meteor showers or meteor storms. There are meteor showers in certain seasons of the year, such as the Lyrid meteor shower at the end of June, the Orionid meteor shower in mid-October, and the Andromedid meteor shower at the end of November. The light colors emitted by various meteor showers are also different. For example, the light emitted by the Leonid meteor shower is blue-green, while the Andromedid meteor shower is red.

Pure meteorites or ashes can be found on Arctic islands such as Greenland, because there are no people there, and no other ash, only meteorite ash. Therefore, the precipitate obtained by dissolving snow is pure meteorite ash, which can be used for research.

### Three Children Born in a Single Birth Celebrate Their Fourth Birthday.

### How Roosevelt and France Dealt with Stalin (3)

— Translated by Pan Jin and Ge Chunliang

"When Stalin stood up to receive the sword, his emotional impulse was, I knew, very real. He stretched out his hands, took the sword from the red cushion, with tears in his eyes, which I saw with my own eyes. He quickly bowed and then kissed the sword. That great courteous expression, I knew, was definitely not deliberate. It was indeed very precious, touching, and sincere.

"He is a very interesting character. They say he is a countryman from the most backward part of Russia, but let me tell you, he has manners that the rest of us don't have.

"Churchill brought his daughter, Sarah, as his secretary and assistant. Of course, she did not attend the meetings, but one day, when we were waiting for the newspapers to announce, Sarah came out into the corridor where we were sitting to give her father something. Marshal Stalin immediately stood up courteously when he saw a woman, looking very puzzled because he didn't know who she was.

"Churchill took her arm and said, 'Marshal Stalin, may I have the honor of introducing my daughter, Sarah, to you?'

"Stalin bowed very low, took her hand, and kissed it in that old-fashioned, excellent European manner. The rest of us just said 'Hello, Sarah' or 'How are you?' So, by comparison, at this time, the best manners belonged to the Marshal."

There was an inseparable friendship between Franklin, Roosevelt, and the common men and women of America—to say the least, there was an inseparable friendship between him and the common men and women of the world. He wholeheartedly served them loyally. Even sometimes, when a certain plan that was beneficial to them could not be implemented for some good reason, he would investigate, estimate, and try to understand the arguments for why it could not be implemented: whether there was too much funding; whether there was too much government interference; whether the people's affairs were being controlled too much. Even if he saw a reasonable theory, he would still say, "True, but the people need it! They are expecting it!" He was still able to persevere to the end to get the matter passed.

His ability to get along with himself and others was gradually developed, which he did not have before. For example, when he first got his political job—Senator of New York State—he didn't have it yet.

I have a photograph of him standing on the floor of the legislature at that time: tall and thin, very active and agile, moving around on the floor. At that time, he rarely talked to anyone, and the senators also avoided him somewhat. He was not particularly likeable (that came later), with a hypocritically sincere expression and very little smile. He had a very unfortunate habit of raising his head, because he wore aristocratic glasses and because he was very tall and long, so the posture made it seem like his eyes were growing on his forehead, and made most people feel like they were looking up his nostrils.
