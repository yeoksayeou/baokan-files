### Marshall Proposes Before Leaving Chongqing: Communist Troops Should First Withdraw from Changchun, Awaiting Yan'an's Reply

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 1st] Special Envoy Marshall, after arriving in Nanjing, paid his first visit to Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin, Minister Chen Cheng, and Mayor Ma on the 1st, expressing his gratitude for their warm welcome at the airport yesterday. On the morning of the 2nd, Marshall personally inspected the American Embassy and the American military headquarters. After his second visit to Nanjing, Marshall also expressed considerable praise for the progress of the capital's municipal administration in this short period. He seemed pleased to hear that our military and political organs in Nanjing are currently vigorously implementing summer sanitation campaigns, taking measures to kill insects and eliminate bacteria. It is said that Marshall intends to hold a press conference after Chairman Chiang's triumphant return and the resumption of negotiations.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 1st] Some staff members of the Chinese Communist Party's delegation to the Political Consultative Conference have arrived in Nanjing. It is said that Zhou Enlai and his wife are scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on the 2nd.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 1st] Young Party members and members of the Democratic League residing in Chongqing are scheduled to come to Nanjing on the 4th on two special planes.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 1st] Secretary-General Shao Lizi of the National Political Council is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 3rd, and Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen can arrive in Nanjing on the 2nd.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 1st] Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen of the National Political Council flew from Chongqing to Hankou on the 1st.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 1st] A reporter visited the spokesman of Chairman Chiang's Xi'an Headquarters on the 1st and asked: What exactly is the content of the widely circulated reports regarding the Northeast issue? The spokesman stated: The reports circulating outside are not factual. General Marshall's visit to Chongqing this time is to continue efforts to mediate the Northeast issue. The central government is acting in accordance with its original intention of seeking domestic peace, and both sides are discussing matters frankly and sincerely. The examination and analysis of China's sovereignty and treaties, legal principles, discipline, and various agreements are particularly detailed. Finally, according to what I (the spokesman refers to himself) know, up until the evening of the 29th, the eve of General Marshall's departure from Chongqing, his suggestion to the Chinese Communist Party was: "At this time, the Communist troops in Changchun should first withdraw and hand over the defense to the Central Army, and then discuss other issues." However, the Chinese Communist Party did not accept his proposal at that time and only replied that it would ask Yan'an for instructions. Therefore, since the central government has not received any formal proposal, it cannot reject any proposal. As for the United Press's claim that Chairman Chiang has rejected the demands made by the Chinese Communist Party, there is no basis for this. In short, the current Northeast issue is only awaiting the reply from the Chinese Communist Party in Yan'an regarding General Marshall's proposal of "handing over Changchun for the Central Army to take over defense before discussing other issues."

### Communist Troops in Shandong Widely Invade, Railway Repair Work Cannot Be Restored

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 1st] The railway repair projects on all lines in Shandong Province have been completely suspended for ten days, and there is no sign of resumption of construction. Several cities besieged by the Communist troops have remained unresolved for months. Recently, the Communist troops in various places have launched widespread offensives again.

It is reported that the mediation policy of the newly appointed American representative of the group, Colonel Hawes, does not intend to go to various places for inspection but focuses on thoroughly solving fundamental issues.

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 1st] The situation in which the Communist troops in Shandong Province have been mobilizing their main forces for days to attack the National Army in Liaocheng, Yanzhou, Gaomi, Weixian, Zhangling, and other places is constantly emerging. This kind of ordinary offensive deployment is a planned action and is deliberately tearing up the ceasefire agreement. The general public, facing this increasingly tense situation in Shandong, is very anxious and deeply hopes that the newly appointed representative of the Executive Headquarters will have a brilliant plan to quickly quell the current crisis.

### Traitor Chen Bijun Applies for Retrial, Her Daughter Wang Wenxun Submits Application to Suzhou High Court Yesterday, Second Batch of Major Traitors in Beiping Transferred to Hebei High Court

[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 1st] It has been the ninth day since traitor Chen Bijun was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Suzhou High Court. At about 3 p.m. on the 1st, her daughter Wang Wenxun personally took the application for retrial to the High Court. The reporter happened to meet her. The daughter was wearing a light yellow raincoat and black galoshes, her face was sad, and she seemed to have deep worries. She gave the reporter a copy of the original application for review. The content was full of sophistry. She claimed that both traitor Wang and traitor Chen were determined to serve the Party as fuel and could not bear to see the people of the world suffer without complaint. She praised the "peace movement" as a movement of great benevolence and great courage. She listed two reasons and eight "virtuous deeds" of traitor Chen in benefiting the common people, hoping to reverse the verdict at the end. She also said: If traitor Chen is still found guilty on the day of the retrial, she is willing to go to jail on the same day to serve the sentence on behalf of her mother, so as to fulfill her filial piety. She appealed to the law enforcement authorities to uphold the righteousness of benevolence, sympathize with the love of crows feeding their young, and have mercy on her foolish sincerity, so as to fulfill her lifelong aspiration. The main points are recorded below: (1) After the establishment of the "peace government," the people in the occupied areas gradually recovered, the fighting spirit of the Japanese army was shaken, and the southward faction of the Japanese warlords rose, leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Finally, the United States and Japan declared war, and the offensive on the mainland eased, and the adverse current of the War of Resistance began to improve. (2) The troops called by the "peace government" were all trapped by the Japanese army and cut off from the rear. If they surrendered to the Japanese army or became bandits, it would not be a blessing for the country and the people. Calling for reorganization was actually to preserve strength, and they never confronted the central government. She then listed eight virtuous deeds of Chen Bijun: A. Rice in Guangzhou once rose to 120,000 pseudo-currency due to the Japanese army's own purchase. Later, it was suppressed to 40,000 to 50,000 pseudo-currency. B. Established the Guangzhou Refugee Children's Shelter, rescuing no less than several thousand refugee children. C. Established a work-study school in Guangzhou, with most of the funding borne by her. D. Established an infant nursery and a maternity hospital for poor women, housing infants and assisting maternity women. E. In the winter of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, launched a winter relief fundraising campaign, raising more than 6 million yuan, all of which was distributed to charitable organizations. F. In the 31st year of the Republic of China, when Hong Kong fell, the Japanese side had a plan to forcibly evacuate Hong Kong Chinese. After negotiations with the Japanese side, it was agreed that returning to their hometowns should be based on the principle of voluntary repatriation, and transportation, reception, and protection were provided along the way. G. In the 29th year, the Central Hospital was built in Nanjing, which is still praised by the citizens today. H. Strived to promote culture and cultural relics, and recovered the rare and valuable specimens of Far Eastern plants collected over the years by Sun Yat-sen University and the Botanical Research Institute in Guangzhou, which were about to be transported to Japan.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 1st] The Capital High Court has scheduled to hear the case of traitor Mei Siping at 9 a.m. on the 3rd. Special audience passes for the court have already begun to be distributed. 1,000 ordinary audience passes will be distributed on the 2nd. The Central Photography Studio and the Central Radio Station have installed mercury lamps and broadcasting equipment in the First Criminal Court of the High Court so that the circumstances of the trial of the traitors can be broadcast to the whole country. After the ugly appearance of the traitors is filmed into a movie, it will be immediately sent to various places for screening. In addition, the court is actively investigating more than 140 cases of major and minor traitors such as Lin Baisheng and Li Shengwu and will file public prosecutions one after another.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 1st] The military authorities have decided that the second batch of major traitors will be transferred to the Hebei High Court on the morning of the 2nd. The list includes Tao Shangming, the pseudo-chief of education, He Bingwen, the pseudo-mayor of Zhangjiakou, and a Liang from the pseudo-mayor of Yantai, totaling 60 traitors.

[Our Newspaper Report] The US Military Headquarters in the China Theater has been reorganized into the "US Army Headquarters in China" and was officially established yesterday. The department currently has 1,608 American officers and 2,973 soldiers. Its future tasks are as follows: (1) To assist in the reorganization and training of the Chinese army, which will be carried out by the military advisory group; (2) to assist the Chinese government in completing the repatriation of Japanese prisoners and overseas Chinese; (3) to transport Chinese troops and equipment; (4) to dispose of surplus materials; (5) to complete remaining work, such as increasing base registration and searching for missing American personnel.

The US military has assisted in the repatriation of 1,555,000 Japanese, 25,000 Koreans, 8,000 residents of the Ryukyu Islands, and 100 Indonesians.

Work in North China is scheduled to be completed on May 15, and the evacuation of Shanghai is scheduled to be completed on June 20.

There are currently about 1.3 million Japanese in the Northeast, thousands of whom have already been sent to Huludao for assembly and boarded ships to return to Japan on April 29. Repatriating the Japanese in the Northeast is the most difficult task, but it is expected to be completed by the end of September.

1,500 German overseas Chinese (including Nazi Party members and their families) will be repatriated to Germany by the US military from Shanghai in mid-June.

The disposal of surplus materials in China is limited to three months.

In addition, the number of American officers in the Army Headquarters will be reduced from 589 to 184.

[US Information Office Local Report] At its peak, there were 65,000 American troops in China. This has now been reduced to 4,581, but within this month, 900 of these 4,000 plus will be further reduced. They will return home on the "Ante Marine" ship, which arrives in Shanghai on May 17, as they are the personnel qualified for repatriation in May. In June, there are 800 American officers and soldiers qualified for repatriation. On the other hand, the US has recruited 1,000 experts from within the country, but their arrival date in China has not yet been determined.

[Another Report] Colonel Wiedeman, director of the US Air Force Evacuation Group, said: The rumor that Japanese technicians in China will remain until June 15 is absolutely untrue. At the same time, they will definitely not be allowed to spend their pleasant lives in Shanxi Province.

### Zhang Jia'ao Meets with Reporters in Shanghai, Discusses the Current Situation in the Northeast, and Calls for the Promotion of Friendly Relations Between the Four Countries in the Future

[Central News Agency Local News] Zhang Jia'ao, director of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, arrived in Shanghai on the 29th from Chongqing. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, the reporter specially visited Zhang's residence in the drizzling rain to inquire about the general situation in the Northeast. Zhang said: Since the central government took over the Northeast in October last year, it has been negotiating with the Soviet Union in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty, hoping to withdraw its troops on schedule and supervising the administrative officials of the provinces and cities to quickly take over the local political power. Although there have been several twists and turns in the troop withdrawal issue, the Soviet troops have begun to withdraw from Changchun in the middle of last month and are scheduled to withdraw from the country on the 30th of last month. As to whether they have completely withdrawn from the country by the 30th, detailed reports have not yet been received due to recent disruptions in communications. As for the takeover of the political power of the provinces and cities in the Northeast, because of the existence of local armed forces and Communist troops in various places in the Northeast, there have been twists and turns, and even conflicts have occurred. It is still hoped that a satisfactory solution to the defense issue can be reached as soon as possible so that a smooth takeover can be achieved. Other issues are also not difficult to resolve peacefully. Zhang continued: The Northeast issue is related to national unity internally and affects world peace externally. He hoped that everyone would put national interests first so that the people of the Northeast who have been in dire straits for 14 years can be relieved of their suffering as soon as possible and promote national unity. In addition, Zhang also mentioned the importance of Sino-Soviet friendly relations, not only the troop withdrawal from the Northeast is considered a complete solution. In the future, in order to seek China's stability and world peace, we must strive to promote friendly relations between China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union.

[United Press Beiping, 1st] News about the situation in the Northeast is quite chaotic. According to the Shenyang telegram of the New Voice Daily, the National Army occupied three-quarters of Sipingjie on the 29th and will completely occupy it on the morning of the 30th. However, this news has not been officially confirmed. According to a telegram from the New China Daily, from April 18 to 28, the two sides fought fiercely for ten days. The 7th Division of the Central Army, commanded by Zheng Dongguo and Liang Huasheng, repeatedly attacked but were repelled. The fighting has now stopped. According to a telegram from the Northeast on the 27th of the New China Daily, eight central airplanes bombed Dunhua, 200 kilometers east of Shenyang, on the morning of the 27th, causing many casualties among the people. A statement by the Air Force representative stationed in Beiping, published in the World Daily, completely denies this, saying that the Air Force is only responsible for transportation and has never participated in the war, and the government has not ordered it to participate in the war. Otherwise, the Central Army could have advanced faster. So far, only a few transport planes have flown to the Northeast. According to Communist news, the Communist troops completely took over Harbin on the 28th without encountering any resistance.

[French News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] (Delayed) The Communist side denies the claim of using Japanese gunners and technicians.

Editorial

### The Entire Nation Unites to Build a New Sichuan

Yesterday, the National Government issued an order to return to the capital, encouraging the military and civilians of the whole country to work together with one heart and one mind, day and night, to realize the mission of the Three Principles of the People. What is especially noteworthy is that the order specifically pointed out: "Sichuan has been known as the 'Land of Abundance' since ancient times and is the source of national power. Chongqing is located at the confluence of two rivers, controlling the north and south, and occupies a strategically advantageous position. Therefore, it was able to safely endure difficulties and achieve victory. Its great contribution to the nation will be forever recorded in history and will never be diminished. As we are about to return to the capital and Zhongshan Mausoleum is in sight, we realize the importance of the relationship between Sichuan and Chongqing after the difficult recovery of Nanjing. The government clearly designated Chongqing as the provisional capital in September of the 29th year [of the Republic], and recently designated Sichuan as a national construction experimental zone. Its system should be adopted and its name and reality should be respected. The Executive Yuan should supervise the relevant provincial and municipal governments to carefully plan and implement it, so that all of Sichuan will forever be the center of national stability and a model for national construction."

Indeed, the final victory of this war of resistance was due to the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang [Kai-shek], as well as the unity of the military and civilians of the whole country, who endured hardship and struggled tenaciously. However, as the national government's order stated, if there were no vast population and fertile land in western China, the struggle for victory would have been without a foundation. Sichuan supported the entire nation's war of resistance. Now that the war of resistance has been won, the responsibility for the post-war construction of Sichuan naturally falls on the government, but it also falls on the people of the whole country. In the difficult wartime environment, Sichuan could support the entire nation's war of resistance. How to jointly promote the post-war construction of Sichuan after the victory of the war of resistance is the responsibility of all Chinese people. Because Sichuan supported the entire nation's war of resistance, we were able to avoid becoming a subjugated people. Therefore, how to jointly promote the post-war construction of Sichuan is an unavoidable and obligatory duty for every Chinese person.

Speaking of the post-war construction of Sichuan, nothing is more important than the construction of Chongqing. Chongqing was the wartime capital and command center of China. In the long eight years, in the vast occupied areas, war zones, and rear areas, the light emanating from Chongqing illuminated the hearts of people everywhere. The government paid close attention to the construction of Chongqing, designating it as the provisional capital to honor its system. However, the construction of a new Chongqing after the war cannot rely solely on the government's strength. All Chinese people, whether they have been to Sichuan during the war and received the benefits of the Sichuan people, should do their best to assist. In the past eight years, Chongqing suffered fierce bombings by the enemy, countless soldiers and civilians died, and countless houses were destroyed. Because of their deaths, we live; because of the destruction of their houses, our homes were preserved. Those who died cannot be brought back to life, but we should build a grand and magnificent memorial archway in the post-war provisional capital for those compatriots who died in the war of resistance, to honor their loyalty and bravery forever. As for the public buildings damaged for the sake of the war of resistance, such as schools, hospitals, churches, and temples, which are related to famous scenic spots or for the welfare of the masses, the government should subsidize the reconstruction and repair, and all our people should generously donate to support this grand undertaking. In particular, the people in the recovered areas, who were under the rule of the enemy and puppets during the war and suffered deeply without a way to serve the country, will naturally have an even more unshirkable duty to cooperate in the construction of Sichuan and the construction of the provisional capital after the war.

As for the post-war construction of Sichuan, there are myriad details. Some focus on establishing a transportation system, while others strive to promote productive enterprises. The government naturally has appropriate plans for this. However, in terms of the long-term nature and great significance, nothing is more important than the development of water conservancy. In the past, Li Bing governed the Dujiangyan water system, and the entire Chengdu Plain benefited from it. His great achievements have been praised for thousands of years. Although Sichuan is rich in products, the people of Sichuan often have the saying of "relying on heaven for food." If the weather is unfavorable and droughts cause disasters, the rich agricultural production will inevitably suffer serious impact. In Sichuan, the "reliance on heaven" factor is particularly strong, so how to regulate water conservancy has a particularly long-term significance in Sichuan. Now the government has plans to develop the Three Gorges water conservancy project and the Dadu River water conservancy project. The beneficiaries of the development of the Three Gorges and Dadu River water conservancy projects are not only the people of Sichuan, but it can be said that it is particularly beneficial to Sichuan. In the future, when the Three Gorges and Dadu River water conservancy projects are completed, Sichuan will become the core of the national economy. This not only establishes an immortal cause for Sichuan, but also builds a new foundation for the entire nation. To repay Sichuan's contribution to the war of resistance and the nation, we should quickly put these water conservancy projects into practice. In the future, ten-thousand-ton ocean freighters can directly reach Chongqing. Not only will the ancient saying "The road to Shu [Sichuan] is difficult" no longer apply, but the completion of these two major water conservancy projects will make Sichuan a paradise for the nation and a model for the construction of the Three Principles of the People, which can shine in the history of human civilization alongside the southern United States in the Tennessee River Valley.

### Foreign Ministers Conference Discusses Italian-Yugoslavian Border Issues: Three Powers Oppose Soviet Demands; Decides to Have Representatives from Both Countries Present Their Views; Austria's Territorial Demands Rejected

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 1st: Molotov and Byrnes clashed at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference over the issue of appointing an Allied Control Commission to implement the Italian treaty, and no final decision was reached. A second meeting was originally scheduled for tonight, but it was temporarily cancelled.

[United Press, Paris, 30th] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference today discussed the Italian-Yugoslavian border issue, examining four different proposed boundary lines. Molotov demanded that a large part of the Istrian Peninsula be ceded by Italy to Yugoslavia, which was opposed by the representatives of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. According to sources from the conference, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States generally agreed, but the Soviet Union proposed moving the border further west. The Four Foreign Ministers Conference has now accepted Molotov's proposal to have two representatives each from Italy and Yugoslavia attend the meeting this Friday to present their views. It is reported that the United Kingdom, France, and the United States also advocate dividing the Istrian Peninsula based on a "line," with the port of Trieste remaining in Italian possession and most of the inland areas ceded to Yugoslavia. According to the three countries' plan, Trieste would become a free port under Italian sovereignty, providing access to the sea for Austria, Hungary, and other Central European countries.

### First Labor Day After the War: Stalin Addresses the Soviet People, Saying He Is Loyal to the Policies of Peace and Security

[United Press, London, 30th] In a broadcast to the Soviet people on the first Labor Day after the war, Premier Stalin guaranteed that the Soviet Union would always be loyal to its policies of peace and security, but he urged the Soviet people not to forget the international reactionary conspiracies that "hatch" new wars. Stalin also stated that all countries in the world do not want to see the scourge of war again, and we must always be vigilant and protect our armed forces and defense capabilities as if they were solid rings. All workers should complete and exceed the production targets set by the new Five-Year Plan. Only by continuously developing military science and military skills can the Soviet land, sea, and air forces shoulder the great responsibility of defending peace. During this war, the people realized that the fate of the country cannot be controlled by reactionary leaders. These people only know how to promote narrow, selfish, and anti-people goals. Countries that do not want to fall behind must take the fate of the country into their own hands, establish democratic systems, and actively fight against reactionary forces. The Soviet Union is willing to be at the forefront in the struggle for peace and security. The world has had the opportunity to recognize the strength of the Soviet Union and at the same time recognize the fairness of its policies, which are based on the recognition of the equality of all nations and respect for their freedom and independence.

[Reported by this newspaper] According to Article 6 of the 1943 Sino-American Agreement, the Shanghai District Court of Beizhejiang Road tried a criminal case for the first time yesterday. It turns out that Wenda, a sailor on the American merchant ship Cooley docked at the Hongkou Wharf, accompanied by ship foreman Kenny, went to the No. 11 brothel in Lane 12 of Yongding Road, Broadway Road, on April 8 at 11 p.m. When they failed to find pleasure and were about to seek other ways, they met Sproles, a second-class mate from the U.S. Naval Reserve, and his companion Mullen (mate on the U.S. ship Joffre Meyer). Kenny asked Sproles if he knew the pimp Cheli, but there was a dispute due to language differences. Kenny was stabbed in the back of the neck and fell to the ground crying for help. Wenda went to help, and Sproles stabbed Wenda's jacket with a small knife. Wenda became angry and stabbed fiercely with a three-inch sharp blade, causing Sproles to injure his lungs and internal organs. He endured the pain and ran out of the lane to the entrance of No. 573 Broadway Road, where he saw a military vehicle and rushed in to hide. Wenda chased after him and punched him severely before running away. Sproles was rescued by the American military police but died of his injuries at 9 a.m. the next morning. The murderer Wenda was arrested and interrogated by the District Court Prosecutor's Office. Based on the fact that he committed the crime of injury causing death under Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, he was prosecuted in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The court opened for trial at 2:05 p.m. yesterday. Judge Zhang Ji and Patrol Officer Pan Zupeng brought the defendant to the court. Wenda was wearing a black top, blue cloth trousers, and yellow leather shoes. He was calm and polite. Judge Meng asked him about his age, origin, and occupation, and he replied, "Twenty-two years old, American, sailor." When asked about the crime, he confessed everything without hesitation, but said that he stabbed Sproles because Sproles stabbed him with a small knife first, so he had to defend himself. He only stabbed twice, all in the back, which does not match the five stabs mentioned in the indictment. The defendant's lawyer, Gui Zhongshu, immediately requested, stating that according to the decree No. 88 of the Republic of China, Year 21, the autopsy of a criminal case must be verified by the prosecutor and the doctor dispatched by the court before it can be considered legal, so he requested the court to re-examine the body. The court immediately presented the chart verified by the American doctor and circulated it to the defendant. Then Mullen, Kenny, Schwakla, Slanmo, Forrest, White, Naklete, and other American witnesses were summoned and questioned in detail. Then it was announced that, except for Kenny and Schwakla who needed to stay in Shanghai for further inquiry, the remaining witnesses could return to the United States. Schwakla stated in court that it was difficult to stay in Shanghai and requested to return to his country. Judge Meng said that the court understood his difficulties and allowed him to leave Shanghai, but Kenny must stay in China for inquiry. Lawyer Gui Zhongshu requested an adjournment because the case was handled too hastily and it was inconvenient to collect evidence. The judge ordered a change of date for further hearing, and the defendant was remanded in custody.

### RMB 1 Billion Loan to Grain Merchants Can Purchase Approximately 30,000 Shi of Rice

### Confiscated Property of Traitor Zhou Fohai Robbed - Case Solved in 35 Hours

After a certain senior military organ was ordered to escort the former finance minister of the puppet regime, traitor Zhou Fohai, to Chongqing for detention, the soldiers Qiu Huizheng and others, who were recruited from the former puppet tax police general regiment, were sent to guard Zhou's residence at No. 262 Hufu Road in Shanghai, and Gui Songgen was stationed there for management. At about 8 p.m. on April 8, the soldiers, who were untamed, used guns to imprison the manager Gui Songgen in a small room, locking the door to prevent him from leaving. Then, they loaded two cars parked at the residence with ten bottles of foreign wine, Western suits, silk quilts, etc., and robbed them before fleeing. At midnight, Gui Songgen, who had been imprisoned, broke through the window and fled back to report the incident. The original military organ immediately dispatched detectives to search everywhere. After a day and night, clues were obtained that the two cars had driven out of Hunan Road that night and went to Huilan Township in Pudong, where the original purple-red car shells were repainted black in the middle of the night, looking as good as new, making it difficult to identify them as old items. On the second day (the 9th), the two cars were sold for 60 taels of gold. However, before the gold was in hand for even ten minutes, it was seized by the personnel of the original military organ along with the goods. In addition to the original car being recovered, the gold from the sale has also been seized. The case will be dealt with after the entire case is closed. In total, it took only 35 hours from the time the incident occurred to the time it was solved.

He hoped that the government would also sanction corrupt officials, unscrupulous speculators, and merchants. Regarding unemployed workers, Zhu said that we should not provide passive relief but actively open factories to accommodate them. Zhu also encouraged labor and management to cooperate sincerely and jointly shoulder the important task of building the country. Lu Jingshi of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Wang Xianqing of the Municipal Party Department, and others delivered speeches one after another, hoping that workers would unite and work together to seek their own independence and liberation. Then, amid enthusiastic applause, Chen Jieyu, on behalf of all workers, presented flowers to the families of the martyred workers and the workers who suffered disasters to express their respect.

### Another Pseudo-Official Shouting "Underground Work": Wu Kaisheng Willingly Turned Traitor After Receiving Favors for a Long Time; Seemed to Regret During Trial; Met with Family Members in Tears to Say Goodbye

[Our Report] Pseudo-official Wu Kaisheng, from Yixing, 47 years old, resident of 43 Dunxin Road, formerly served as a member of the Examination Committee of the Pseudo-Examination Yuan, Pseudo-Ambassador to Italy (did not go abroad), Pseudo-Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Secretary-General of the Pseudo-Committee for the Abolition of Extraterritoriality. After the victory, he confessed everything to the Military Intelligence Bureau. The prosecutor stated that before the war, the defendant had served as a secretary and advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our National Government, as well as the director of the Chinese International United Office in Geneva and the Minister to Switzerland, and had received favors for a long time. Therefore, he willingly turned traitor. After being sent to the High Procuratorate, Prosecutor Lu filed a public lawsuit against him for violating Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Cao Jun held the first trial in the temporary criminal court of the High Court. Wu wore a blue cloth long gown with white sleeves rolled up, worn old yellow leather shoes, and frameless white gold glasses. He bowed deeply to the court. According to his statement, although he claimed to have studied law, he actually graduated from the Department of Political Economy at the University of Lyon in France. After returning to China from Europe in 1932, he left the government and practiced law. After the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, he entertained wounded soldiers. After the fall of Shanghai, at the request of Yu Bingjian, the director of the Ministry of Communications' office in Shanghai, he set up a radio station at 612 Route Lafayette to communicate with the mainland. Later, it was discovered by a Japanese military patrol car and forced to move. After the fall of Zhenru, the International Radio Bureau was destroyed, so he set up the International Radio Bureau at 9 Route Sayme. All telegrams sent by the Central Government to Europe were forwarded by that office. There was a telegram from Chairman Chiang as evidence. The document was hidden in the base of the Buddha statue provided by his mother, so it was not seen by the enemy. Wu sighed and said, "If it had been discovered by the enemy at that time, I wouldn't have to face this lawsuit!" As for Wu's participation in the pseudo-government, according to his statement, "The pseudo-Nanjing regime wanted to use people as a signboard, so they pulled people in like conscripts to give them a title." The position of the Examination Committee of the Pseudo-Examination Yuan was announced by Chu Minyi without his consent, as was the position of Pseudo-Ambassador to Italy and Pseudo-Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. As for the position of Secretary-General of the Pseudo-Committee for the Abolition of Extraterritoriality, he said that the committee only existed in name and was never actually established. Judge Cao asked if he had participated in the pseudo-government's declaration of war on Britain and the United States or the signing of the "Sino"-Japanese alliance agreement during his tenure as Pseudo-Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. Wu replied, "I lived at 4 Wuyi Road in Nanjing at that time. I didn't even receive enough salary to eat pancakes, and I didn't go to work at all. It was just a title." After the victory, because the trend of reporting traitors was very strong, he surrendered to the Military Intelligence Bureau. The defendant's lawyer, Cai Xiaobai, presented several documents to prove that the defendant had connections with Chen Changfeng of the Attendant's Office and Cheng Kexiang of the Military Intelligence Bureau, and was engaged in underground work and protected central officials, all of which were supported by evidence. Judge Cao stated that the case still needed detailed investigation and adjourned the trial to a later date. Before the defendant was returned to custody, he requested to speak with his family members. After the judge's permission, he met with his wife and several others and said goodbye. Wu tearfully said to his family, "I am not a traitor. The judge will definitely handle it fairly."

### Suspected Female Traitor Zhu Cai Carries Her Child to Court

[Our Report] (1) French radio engineering expert Alaixi was accused of helping the Japanese search for spies from Britain, the Soviet Union, and Austria during the enemy occupation period. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Cao Jun held another trial. The defendant sophistically denied everything. Although Boge Laiski and others said they were harmed, they could not confirm that he had informed on them. Therefore, a detailed investigation is still needed, and the trial will be adjourned to a later date. (2) In the afternoon, the High Court interrogated a suspected female traitor case. The defendant, Zhu Cai, from Jiangbei, had assisted her husband, Zhu Bingrong, in serving as an intelligence officer for the enemy during the enemy occupation period, and had harmed our loyal patriots. Now, she was arrested after being sued by the family members of the victims. However, when the judge asked her questions, the defendant, holding a newborn baby she had recently given birth to in prison, cried and denied everything, saying that it was all her husband's fault. After being defended by her appointed lawyer, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for May 4th. (3) Dong Xuelin, a patrol officer of the Pseudo-Police Bureau of Nanhui, and Wei Wenshou, a clerk of the Pseudo-County Government of Nanhui, extorted and defrauded illegally during their tenure in the pseudo-government. The prosecutor filed a lawsuit against them for violating Article 3, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors. The trial of the case will be concluded tomorrow, and the sentencing will be on May 4th.

### Respect Teachers Movement: Students and Parents Donate Generously

[Our Report] Parents of students in municipal primary and secondary schools in this city are responding to the Respect Teachers Movement. Those who have money are donating voluntarily.

The cards are printed with "Contribute your own strength" and "Seek public welfare," but there is no name of the distributing organization, no signature or seal, and no number. A reporter asked the Respect Teachers Movement Committee if it had issued the above printed materials.

The committee also asked the reporter to declare on its behalf that those participating in the Respect Teachers Movement should pay attention to this. [Ren]

The Ministry of Education to Increase Teacher Training Classes by 3,000

[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing] The Ministry of Education believes that after the promotion of national education in the 19 provinces and cities in the rear during the Anti-Japanese War, the number of schools has increased sharply in the past five years, and there is a severe shortage of teachers.

### Tight Credit, Bulls Emerge: Gold and Currency Both Weaken; Allotment Price Revised to 1.74 Million

Yesterday, the "sha chi" lost its vigor, and many were eager to close out positions, leading to a continued decline. It opened flat in the morning and briefly rallied to 1.81 million, but this was short-lived. Credit was extremely tight, buying interest was weak, and the bulls panicked, gradually pushing prices lower. After 10:00 AM, it hovered around 1.75 million. The number of gold businesses registering with the Central Bank significantly decreased to only 265 bars, and the price was allotted at 1.74 million. Seeing this situation, the market knew it was difficult to succeed and the ranks disintegrated. The market price repeatedly succumbed, breaking through the 1.7 million mark again. At noon, it lingered around 1.68 million, and the weakness continued in the afternoon, falling to around 1.65 million. As a result, it closed 110,000 lower than the previous close. Ornament gold was at 179,000, refined silver fell to 1,700, and silver dollars were sold at 1,008. The unofficial interest rate was tightest early in the morning, around two jiao, but as the gold market cut losses, the unofficial rate also slightly decreased to 1.7 jiao.

Foreign currency, specifically U.S. dollars, also decreased following the gold price, the process being mediocre. It opened at 2,400 yuan in the morning, and there was some activity from buyers after opening, but the highest price could not surpass the 2,500 yuan mark. Later, as the gold price weakened, the currency market also declined. At noon, it struggled around 2,350 yuan, and the afternoon was similar. As a result, it closed 80 yuan lower than the previous close. Hong Kong currency tightened at one point midway, with limited trading volume, and continued to struggle below the Hong Kong exchange rate. The buying and selling prices slightly widened. As a result, the old stock closed flat compared to the previous close, and the new stock fell by 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 456, with both supply and demand being high. Robi was around 560 yuan. Both the official and unofficial rates for British currency were flat.

### Public Bonds Rise Across the Board, Chinese Stocks Continue to Fall

Public bonds, having fallen excessively, rebounded slightly yesterday. Unified Category C opened in the morning and immediately rose to over 6,000 yuan, hovering around 6,200 yuan. It briefly rose to 6,500 yuan, but only temporarily, as high prices were still suppressed. Near noon, it broke back below the 6,000 yuan mark, finding some stability at 5,950 yuan. However, the selling pressure remained strong. As a result, it closed 400 yuan higher than the previous close. Demand from large investors varied, but the starting point for buyers was mostly to grab a quick profit, so the overall trend was not very favorable. Miscellaneous brands of Categories A, B, and D were only at 100 yuan, and Category E rose by 150 yuan. Chinese stocks continued to fall, but the process was quite calm. Initially, they were stable, but generally, the psychology was that although there were recent rumors of active restoration of the stock exchange, the focus was still on speculative trading of hot and cold stocks. As a result, the five previously popular stocks were particularly deserted. Shortly after opening, at their peak, Yong Yarn was at 5,750 yuan, Mei Ya at 4,850 yuan, Jing Fu at 485 yuan, Xin Guang at 415 yuan, and Qin Xing at 330 yuan. Later, trading gradually diminished, and they all closed at lower prices near noon. Less popular stocks were also affected, but there were occasional speculative funds buying them, making them slightly more attractive than the popular stocks. Compared to the previous close, the five popular stocks each fell by about 5%, and mid-sized and veteran stocks among the less popular stocks also decreased slightly. Smaller stocks did not see much change. In the afternoon, asking prices were flat. Foreign stocks initially weakened but then stabilized, with some speculative funds returning. Yi Yarn broke through the 15,000 yuan mark after opening, and foreign banks absorbed some at the low price. Securities firms and speculative funds also returned. Near noon, the situation stabilized, and domestic and foreign targets focused on Yi Yarn, making it difficult for other stocks to recover due to lack of time. The afternoon closing result showed that Yi Yarn slightly increased compared to the previous close, while the rest continued to fall.

### Yarn Prices Decline, Cotton Transactions Flourish

Yesterday, the yarn market declined directly because the gold and currency turmoil had calmed down, and credit had tightened significantly. Therefore, under these two unfavorable news, yarn prices took a sharp fall. Initially, it plummeted by 100,000, and the "Double Horse" brand once traded at 1.18 million. All other brands fell. The 42-count yarn saw the sharpest decline. By closing, the "Double Horse" brand recovered to 1.22 million, and the situation stabilized slightly. At noon, the Textile Construction Corporation opened sales as usual, from 1-count to 100-count, with each count available except for the 20-count and 16-count coarse yarns sold on the market. Prices were reduced by 30,000 to 100,000 compared to the previous period. There were also ten types of yarn and thread, which were still tendered. Only Tong Taichang and Xin Tai bought four types, and the rest were not sold.

Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraph reported a decline of 10 to 21 points. The near-term was USD 27.60, the forward was USD 27.73, and the Midtling spot was USD 28.20. The local cotton market was affected by the sudden fall in gold and yarn prices, and it also turned flat. However, transactions further developed. The Textile Construction Corporation, after observing for many days, suddenly purchased 1,350 bales of American Pengjiapo and Indian Yamula brands. Wuxi Zhentai imported 200 bales of Cielitra. In addition, the trade conducted 5-600 bales.

### Silk Loses Color

Yesterday, silk market prices declined across the board. 120 Tianqiao rayon opened at 1.62 million yuan, and the lowest price called in the afternoon was 550,000 yuan. It ended at 570,000 yuan, down 130,000 yuan from the previous day. Other grades of goods were generally down by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan. Factory-managed foreign firm goods with 83% high uniformity had some transactions, opening at 2.6 million yuan. Other grades were all down by more than 100,000 yuan. The silk goods market fell sharply yesterday. Mei Ya bedspreads fell by about 13% per hundred strips. Da Cheng plaid crepe opened at 4,320 yuan and closed at 4,150 yuan. It fell again in the afternoon, trading at 3,880 yuan, a significant drop of 700 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Rumors of Inland Ban on Exports: Rice Prices Rose Another 1,000 Yesterday

Yesterday, the rice market was buoyed by rumors of an impending ban on rice exports from inland areas, and prices rose by about 1,000 yuan. However, "bai yuan" (white rice) was dull and lacked vigor, and "yin yuan" (shadow rice) saw reduced sales, decreasing by 1-2,000 yuan. Flour from Shantou and Ningbo were successively sold off, falling by 4-500 yuan. The oil market saw prices gradually decline due to the influx of Qingdao sources, decreasing by another 2-3,000 yuan. The soybean market was weak, raw peanuts were stable, red sorghum and corn were sluggish, bran supply exceeded demand, and prices decreased by 3-400 yuan. Soybean cake was weak but tight, slightly increasing by a hundred yuan or so.

### Shanghai Import and Export Statistics for the First Three Months of This Year

Bank of China Export Secured Loans Total 5.6 Billion Yuan

According to an announcement by the person in charge of the Customs Statistics Department, the value of Shanghai's import and export goods for the first three months of this year is as follows, with imports in millions of customs gold units and exports in millions of national currency units:

Import   Export

January  469.5  641.

February 758.3  308.

March  2,210.4  462.

From February to April 27th of this year, the total amount of secured loans for export materials handled by the Bank of China reached over 5.63926 billion yuan. These secured loan materials included raw silk, yellow wolf skin, sheepskin, pig bristles, tung oil, sausage casings, silk fabrics, leather goods, goose feathers, feathers, tea, etc. The most were shipped to New York, followed by London and other countries. Only peanuts, sesame, almonds, soybeans, and green beans, etc., were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Coal Market Remains Stable

The coal market process remains stable. Except for "Yanmei Kaiping No. 2 crumbs," which had external routes, the rest were dull and flat. However, "Kaiping No. 2 crumbs" from Pudong Wharf were slightly affected by the delivery certificate issued by the association, and the market price slightly decreased. The local coal industry association had previously applied to the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for an allocation of 5,000 tons of bituminous coal for retail to more than 500 companies. The allocation included 1,000 tons of "Kai Luan No. 1 crumbs" at a price of 150,000 yuan, 1,000 tons of "Kai Luan train blocks" at a price of 170,000 yuan, and 3,000 tons of "Kai Luo No. 2" and the payments were completed at the end of last month. The companies could collect delivery certificates from the association with their payment receipts. However, most of the delivery certificates mentioned above were for small amounts and for delivery at the Pudong Wharf. Small companies found the delivery process cumbersome and therefore sold them on the market.

The cost of firewood and charcoal increased due to high grain prices in the producing areas, causing a large difference between the cost and Shanghai's market price, affecting arrivals. Therefore, the market price was also slightly tighter, but actual sales remained sluggish.

### Sugar Sales Sluggish

Yesterday, the sugar market was weak due to sluggish sales, and prices continued to decline. In the morning, medium sand white sugar initially sold for 66,500 yuan, then 66,000 yuan, and further decreased to 64,500 yuan. In the afternoon, it decreased by another 500 yuan to 64,000 yuan, a drop of 3,000 yuan in total. The "Hao" brand opened with a batch of "Diao Qing" sugar at a price of 51,000 yuan, also down 1-3,000 yuan.

Several dozens of packages of ordinary "yuan zao" (dried jujubes) opened yesterday. They were softer and inferior in color and size, priced at 36,000 yuan. Over ten boxes of high-end "yuan rou" (longan pulp) opened. The goods were still good, priced at 100,500 yuan.

### Tea Prices Firm

The tea market has benefited from good demand in Suzhou, Tianjin and other places, and those who held goods were also firm in price, so the prices of some varieties have risen. New Longjing is also stable, and the special green tea most favored by the United States and Mumbai, India, is also showing signs of recovery. Yesterday, the Wu Chang Tea Industry Company took in about 400 boxes of Wuyuan goods at an opening price of 35,000 yuan per dan. It is planned to pack and ship them to South America when the shipping schedule is near.

### The Ups and Downs of the Gold Rush: The Central Bank Throws Out Over 3,000 Bars of Sha Chi Within Three Days

[Reported by this newspaper] According to related sources, the abnormal fluctuations in gold prices in this city in the past two days were greatly affected by a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 28th. The dispatch reported that the U.S. House of Representatives Monetary Committee had proposed raising the U.S. gold price. However, the source vehemently condemned the local speculators for quoting out of context. The latter part of the dispatch clearly stated that the U.S. Treasury Department opposed raising the gold price, so the chances of this proposal being discussed in the House were extremely slim. However, the market was unaware and fell victim to the conspiracy of speculators. Nevertheless, the Central Bank continued to follow its past policy and sold gold as the market moved. On the 29th, it sold 766 bars to the Gold Industry Association and 100 bars to the silverware industry at a price of 1.68 million. At that time, the market was still strong and the situation was still firm. The Central Bank then continued to sell more than 500 bars to the market, with prices fluctuating slightly according to the market. On the 30th, the market trend was still firm, and the Central Bank continued to sell 1,170 bars to the Gold Industry Association and 250 bars to the silverware industry at a price of 1.85 million. As the market was still floating, the Central Bank then sold more than 400 bars to the market, with selling prices ranging from a high of 1.92 million yuan to 1.76 million yuan. The market finally collapsed, and the Central Bank continued to sell relentlessly. Yesterday, the Central Bank continued to sell 275 bars to the Gold Industry Association at a price of 1.74 million yuan. The silverware industry had no appetite. In addition, it continued to sell more than 80 bars to the market, with selling prices ranging from 1.715 million yuan to 1.7 million yuan. Therefore, today the market has presented a one-sided situation, finally falling to a low price of 1.63 million yuan. In the past three days, the Central Bank has sold more than 3,500 gold bars, and a large amount of market speculation funds have been absorbed. The unofficial interest rate has risen sharply. It is said that there are many financial institutions that lack funds. The Central Bank will temporarily not provide them with the convenience of adjusting funds because they do not examine their lending policies, which only increases the amount of market speculation funds, so that they will know to be alert. Also, when gold prices fluctuated in the past two days, the number of those who asked the Central Bank to settle foreign exchange funds suddenly increased. After the Central Bank's generous supply, no one asked to settle foreign exchange yesterday.

Another report: It is rumored that the Central Bank will establish an International Foreign Exchange Review Committee. When the reporter inquired about it, it was informed that there was no news.

### A Large Quantity of Northeast Pig Bristles

Being Received and Taken Away by the Soviet Union: Bristle Prices May Be Hit

Recently, qualified people in the pig bristle industry learned that the price of the international pig bristle market may fluctuate recently. The reason is not due to the improvement and invention of substitutes, but due to the risk of a large number of special goods entering the market. The source of these goods is quite tortuous. When the Japanese invaded China, the United States did not sympathize. Although it still traded gasoline or cast iron, it was limited to cash transactions. The Japanese had extremely limited foreign exchange, so they scoured China's Northeast for export materials to support themselves. Pig bristles were abundant in the Northeast, and the Japanese collected them in many ways. When the Pacific War broke out, a portion had not been shipped out. Although the road to the UK was cut off, the collection continued to increase. When the atomic bomb exploded in Hiroshima, the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation and entered. This textile also changed hands. After the war, the Soviet Union also needed to import a large number of materials, but had no accumulated foreign exchange. These costless goods would inevitably be dumped on the international market at a lower price. The quantity is extremely alarming. It is estimated that there are more than 200,000 customs dan. These "black goods" have been discovered recently.

### British Bank to Increase Gold Purchases

[Reuters, London, 1st] According to a dispatch from the special correspondent of this agency: "The Bank of England" is likely to slightly increase its current gold purchase price of 172 shillings and three pence per ounce, in order to be closer to the U.S. price of 173 shillings and eight pence. Since 1945, the price difference between gold in the UK and the US has always been one shilling and five pence.

### Living Gifts

— Ouli

In the mountainous areas of northern Fujian, there is a lot of cedar production. Cedar grows very quickly. In one or two decades, it can be several zhang high and can be cut down for use or sale.

It is said that in these cedar-producing areas, villagers have a special custom. Whenever a family in the village has a newborn, when the baby is one month old or one year old, relatives and friends gather together to fence off a plot of land and plant cedar seedlings as a congratulatory gift. When the child is twenty years old and about to get married, the plot of land planted with cedar trees given by relatives and friends has already become a towering forest, becoming a very valuable cedar forest. It is said that many villagers rely on such a living "gift" from relatives and friends to start a family and career.

This kind of constructive congratulatory gift is much more meaningful and practical than sending flower baskets or sweets and biscuits.

This kind of living gift is worthy of our emulation.

### "Food" and Children's Mental Health

— Liu Lunci

Children often have many problems with their clothing, food, and daily life that require parents to study and address. Now, focusing solely on the item of "food," there are quite a few issues. For example, some children insist on eating certain foods while refusing to eat others, some need someone to tell them stories while they eat, some eat very slowly, and some refuse to eat if the bowls and utensils they use are changed. There are countless examples like these. Parents should understand that the occurrence of these bad habits is not without cause, nor is it something that happens overnight. To seek remedies and treatment, parents must first study children's psychology and gain a thorough understanding, and then find ways to deal with it.

The reasons why children refuse to eat, besides being because they are physically uncomfortable or because they have already eaten sweets and snacks before meals, so they do not feel hungry at mealtime, are mostly psychological. Some children who have always been spoiled by their parents need their parents to beg them to do everything, so they must wait for their parents to persuade them to eat before they are willing to eat, or parents grant children's every request, and if sometimes their requests are not granted, then they develop an attitude of hatred and resistance, and use refusing to eat as a threat. Their mentality is "If you don't agree to me, I won't eat." In addition, there are many other cases where psychological imbalances lead to children's loss of appetite or reduced food intake, such as the anxiety that occurs when school exams are approaching, the excitement and desire caused by preparing to attend a banquet, and the bad emotions caused by the destruction of beloved toys, failing school exams, and discord among family members.

The most foolish way to deal with children who refuse to eat is to not study the cause but simply force or coax them to eat. It is best not to leave their side while children are eating, or to coax them by saying, "Good boy, have another bite!" for fear that they have not eaten enough. Sometimes the more you coax them to eat, the less they want to eat. On the contrary, if you ignore them, they will eat obediently. When we find that children's refusal to eat is due to acting spoiled, making demands, and other displays of temper, then let them not eat. There is no need to beg or coax them. Occasionally missing a meal or two will not affect their health. On the contrary, if they eat once because of your begging, then it will make them develop a "me first" mentality, and every time they eat in the future, it will be necessary to have your begging. Once this kind of bad psychological habit is formed, its harm is actually more serious than missing a meal or two. Vomiting is also a problem related to children's eating. The reasons for vomiting are mostly because many gases are swallowed into the stomach while eating, or because they eat too much. Physiologically, it is generally because they suffer from congenital pyloric stenosis, where the pylorus of the stomach is too narrow, causing food to be blocked when it passes through the pylorus, which requires surgical treatment. The reasons for vomiting can also be pathological and psychological. But how do we determine whether children's vomiting is due to a physical illness or a psychological imbalance? First, a detailed examination should be made of the body. For example, if children suffer from brain tumors, meningitis, poliomyelitis, and acute febrile diseases, the physiological changes that occur during the onset period can cause vomiting. As for vomiting caused by psychological imbalances, the characteristic is that their vomiting often comes particularly easily, and at the same time, although they often vomit, it does not affect their nutrition. If it is found that the vomiting is indeed pathological, it needs to be treated with medicine. If it is due to a psychological imbalance, then it is necessary to study whether the environment in which the child lives is good, whether their life is reasonable, whether the schoolwork is too strict, and the level of intelligence, personality, and emotional issues, and then give appropriate treatment.

In short, children's "food" problems should be developed from the beginning of breastfeeding, forming a good habit, with appropriate quality and quantity, giving food on time, and adhering to it without change. Never be accommodating because the child cries, nor should you be too doting and offer frequent attentiveness. They should be given adequate rest after playing before eating. Arguments should not be held in front of children before meals, causing their emotional tension. Parents should take a consistent attitude towards training children's habits. Parents should set a good example when eating. Snacking should be prohibited before and after meals, away from the temptation of food, and the child's life should be properly adjusted, because many children love to snack, mostly due to the monotony of their spiritual life and being tempted by food. Even many adults stop children from making noise and crying by giving them food, or say hastily, "Go buy pastries," "Go buy sweets." These wrong measures and words need to be corrected urgently.

If parents can do all of the above, then children will not have "food" problems, and even if they do occur, they will be easy to solve.

### Small Apron

— Xiao Shufang

This is a small apron suitable for girls aged three or four. Most of the current season's clothing is made of woolen materials, and children easily get their clothes dirty. This apron can be worn at any time. If it is made well, it will add to the neatness and beauty when worn. Materials: Two to three feet of plain light-colored cloth or cloth with small red and blue flowers, red and blue cloth for trimming.

Instructions: Cut according to the dimensions in the diagram, slightly enlarged to allow for seams. The length can be adjusted according to the size of the child. Make a sandwich layer for the waist, with two loops at each end for the straps to cross through and tie a bow when wearing. The top of the bib, the bottom of the apron, and the two pockets are trimmed with non-fading red and blue. In the summer, it can also be worn as a backless little suit!

### Ballad of the Stepmother

— Ba Ling

"Little Cabbage, yellow in the field; A three-year-old child has lost their mother! Follow your father and live well, but I fear father taking a stepmother. The stepmother married for a full three years, gave birth to a son stronger than me; he eats meat, I drink soup, crying and weeping, I miss my own mother."

This is a ballad of children dissatisfied with their stepmother. It fully exposes the common situation of stepmothers discriminating against the children of the former wife. This is also a family problem worthy of attention.

It is hoped that women who are stepmothers will broaden their horizons and recognize that children belong to the nation, not to individuals or families, and that cultivating outstanding citizens of the next generation is their sacred duty. If one can hold this view, mistreatment will naturally not occur.

Mr. Shuofeng said: "A wife's mood is like a barometer in the family; a loving and happy wife is like a sunny day; if she is perverse, it is like a stormy weather." Indeed, most of the happiness and troubles in a family depend on the wife. A wife with a kind heart will inevitably make the family happy; otherwise, even if the family does not break up, it will at least not be happy and joyful. Therefore, the first secret to choosing a spouse is to consider her "mood."

Secondly, because a woman's mood is mostly formed by the combination of her mother's inheritance and the environment in which she lives. If the mother is a "shrew," and usually does not treat her husband with any dignity, then her daughter, having been influenced by her, will treat her husband the same way in the future. If the mother is a capable housewife, who is diligent and thrifty at home, and treats her husband as herself, then her daughter will be as diligent and harmonious as her mother in the future. Therefore, in addition to considering her mood, you should also carefully consider everything about her mother.

External "beauty" is certainly a great seductive power for women, and can also be used as a standard for choosing a spouse. However, many young people mistakenly regard it as the only standard, because external beauty will soon disappear. No matter how black your hair is, it will turn gray; no matter how apple-like your face is, it will become old. Therefore, external beauty is a beauty of time, and a beauty of time will be eliminated by time after a considerable period.
