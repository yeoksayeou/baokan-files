### Marshal Ma Returns to Nanjing Today; The Situation May See New Decisions; U.S. Ambassador Says Hopes for the Future Remain Strong

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 21st] The political consultation atmosphere in the capital has been stagnant for over a week. Especially in the past three days, Special Envoy Marshall went to Kuling, Mr. Zhou Enlai shuttled between Nanjing, Shanghai, and Henan, and people from the Democratic League were busy with the assassination of Li and Wen in Kunming. As a result, Yu Dawei told reporters that he could only say, "Light will eventually come." Shao Lizi even had several days of leisure, accompanying his wife in the Na Min courtyard in the sweltering heat. However, this kind of superficial stagnation should not last too long. Currently, the general public's speculation seems to be not "When will talks resume?" but "Where will talks resume?" It is heard that the government is arranging accommodations for all parties in Lushan. Marshal Ma, who is returning to Nanjing tomorrow, also has the mission of urging the CCP representatives to go up the mountain. Therefore, as of tonight, although government representatives and people from various parties have no intention of going to Xunyang, once Marshal Ma and Zhou Enlai return to Nanjing tomorrow, there will be new decisions.

[Our Kuling dispatch of the 21st] Regarding the Chairman's announcement, according to the Chairman's secretary, the Chairman had consultations with Ambassador Stuart on this matter. The details are unknown, but there are two possible speculations: (1) Ambassador Stuart and the Chairman have already reached an agreement; (2) The announcement was an idea discussed during the meeting between Stuart and the Chairman. After Marshal Ma arrives in Nanjing tomorrow and consults with Ambassador Stuart, and then contacts the Chairman, a decision on the Chairman's important actions can be made.

[Our Kuling dispatch of the 21st] Special Envoy Marshall has decided to leave Kuling at 7:30 tomorrow morning and take a special plane from Jiujiang at around 10:00 AM, arriving in Nanjing before noon.

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 21st] U.S. Ambassador Stuart, having caught a cold before leaving Peiping, suffered from increased coughing due to the cooler climate after arriving in Kuling. Although it was Sunday today, the Ambassador still immersed himself in work all day, drafting documents, but declined to see guests. At 4:00 PM, he received this newspaper's reporter at his residence. He stated that he plans to return to Peiping on the 23rd to handle affairs at Yenching University, and after a short stay, he will return to Nanjing. Whether he will go to Lushan again has not yet been decided, but if the Chairman invites him by telegram, he will go at any time. When asked about the Ambassador's opinion on the peace talks after his talks with the Chairman in Lushan, he replied that he has always had hope for the future of the negotiations and believes that a reasonable solution can eventually be found, because the current situation in China is very different from when the Qing Dynasty was overthrown or when fighting against Japan. This is purely a domestic dispute. The main reason why the two sides cannot coordinate is mutual suspicion and fear. If further understanding can be sought, then this psychological haze can be dispelled. When asked how long this would take, the Ambassador said, "It is not yet known." The Ambassador also emphasized to the reporter that he had told Chairman Chiang that he is a friend of China and should not be seen as an American Ambassador. He only hopes to do his best to help China achieve true peace. The current work is indeed extremely difficult, but he is determined to combine subjective understanding with various objective materials, study diligently, and seek a solution.

### CCP Personnel Fly to Peiping; Refusal to Be Inspected Causes Misunderstanding; Military Mediation Department Sends Personnel to Investigate and Finds Radio, Gold, etc.

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 20th] On the 16th of this month, a military mediation department plane flew from Zhangjiakou to the West Suburb Airport in Peiping. The plane carried several CCP personnel. When the luggage of the CCP representatives entered the city through Xizhimen, they refused inspection by the military police, which caused a misunderstanding. The situation was deadlocked until the afternoon of the 18th without a resolution. On the 19th, the issue was discussed at a meeting of the Three-Man Committee of the Military Mediation Department. On the suggestion of the American side, it was decided that the Military Mediation Department would conduct the inspection.

American Commissioner Robertson also attended. As a result, they found Jin-Cha-Ji Daily, Central Bank banknotes, radio equipment, and about 400 taels of gold. Part of the items has been retrieved by the CCP. The incident has now come to an end.

### Our New Fleet Arrives in the Capital; Commander Has Reported to the Naval Headquarters; Review Ceremony Will Be Held the Day After Tomorrow

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 21st] Eight new ships donated by the United States to our country arrived at Xiaguan at 6:07 PM tonight. By 6:30 PM, the ships were docked at their designated locations. The flagship Taikang led the way, and a huge flag fluttered in the wind, displaying a heroic posture. People waiting at the pier cheered and jumped for joy. Among the crowds were many young women holding children's hands, all looking forward, expecting the return of the naval heroes who had been away for more than a year. The Naval Headquarters had also made prior arrangements for liaison and reception. Chief of Staff Zhou also personally welcomed them. After dealing with today's busy official duties, Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng also drove to the pier at 9:00 PM and boarded the ship on a specially prepared speedboat for inspection. The entire crew welcomed him with the most enthusiastic emotions. In the twilight, our reporter visited the Taikang on the Yongxing speedboat, led by Deputy Captain Li Yu for a tour. The officers and soldiers of the fleet left the motherland in December 1944 and arrived in the United States in February of the following year. They immediately began basic training, with Americans as instructors. There were nearly a thousand Chinese sailors, including more than 70 officers, some of whom had degrees in shipbuilding from Jiaotong University, while others had ordinary secondary education. However, they were all healthy, lively, and full of vigor. The basic training was completed in ten months, and they then went to Cuba for further training. While in the United States, they participated in various competitions and received the highest honors. Because the motherland had won victory and the training had been completed, they left Cuba on April 6 to return home. They were warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese at various ports along the way, who presented them with various valuable gifts. On July 13, they passed through Yokohama, Japan, where they were inspected by General He Yingqin. They arrived in Shanghai on the 19th of this month. Their future missions will be determined by orders. The ships are very new. The Taikang has a displacement of 1,400 tons and was built in 1943. The ships are equipped with various equipment for combatting aircraft and submarines, but because of secrecy, they cannot be listed. Our reporter spoke with several sailors and found that they are currently eager to be relieved of the following two concerns: one is that they have been away from the motherland for too long and are not familiar with the domestic political situation, and the other is that they have been at sea for too long and feel unfamiliar with the mainland. It is heard that they will remain in Nanjing for about a day or two before sailing to Shanghai. It is also heard that the review ceremony for the eight new ships is scheduled for the 24th, and Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng will personally preside over it at that time.

[Another dispatch] Lin Zun, the commander of the new fleet, landed at 7:30 PM tonight with the captains of the ships and reported to the Naval Headquarters, where they were received by Chief of Staff Zhou.

### Ambassador Koo's Solemn Declaration: The UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Should Resume Transporting Supplies. There is Absolutely No Discrimination in Our Distribution of Supplies. The Communist Military Region Actually Receives More Than Other Areas.

[United Press Washington 20th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Koo Vi-kyuin, issued a statement denying that the Chinese government discriminated against the Communist Party in the distribution of UNRRA supplies. He stated: The Chinese government requests the immediate resumption of UNRRA's transport of all supplies to China. The Chinese government has thoroughly investigated the UNRRA personnel in China who promoted the reduction of food shipments by Lagenia two months ago. UNRRA personnel had accused that the Communist areas did not receive a fair share of relief supplies, and the delivery of supplies to the interior was also greatly delayed. The investigation results show that the Communist areas along the Yellow River received more supplies than any comparable region. At the same time, Zheng Baonan, director of the Executive Yuan's office in Washington, also issued a statement defending China's relief policy, stating that relief goods have been transported to the "truly needy" Communist areas. The Chinese government has thoroughly investigated all accusations made by UNRRA personnel. The results of the investigation show that supplies are strictly distributed according to the needs of each region, without any discrimination, as publicly announced by Jiang Tingfu, Director-General of the Executive Yuan's Relief Administration. The famine in any area under Communist control is not as severe as in the provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Hubei. In fact, more relief supplies have been shipped to the Communist area along the Yellow River than to any other comparable area. The statement also stated: We should also note that food accounts for almost 80 percent of the UNRRA supplies that China has received to date. Compared with other disaster areas, the areas under Communist control, except for the small pocket-shaped areas of northern Jiangsu and northern Hubei, are fortunately not lacking food.

[United Press Washington 20th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Koo Vi-kyuin, issued a statement tonight, firmly demanding that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration resume the transport of relief supplies to China, and indirectly blaming UNRRA itself for the delay in the distribution of supplies. It is claimed that the smooth distribution of relief supplies has been greatly hindered by certain difficult circumstances that China cannot control. For example, items obtained overseas are not notified in advance, there are no shipping manifests or invoices for the cargo, and the machines that arrive are either not what China requested or lack important parts and cannot be used. There are also large quantities of canned food that are already spoiled upon receipt and have to be discarded. The Chinese government has asked UNRRA to start shipping again and has notified the US government of the actual situation.

### The Second General Assembly of the Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference: Zhou Xiangxian Reports on Municipal Affairs, and Various Commissioners Report on Administrative Work

[Our Correspondent in Hangzhou, 21st] The Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference held its second general assembly at 8:00 am on the 21st. The chairman was Li Chaoying, Director of Education, with a total of 56 attendees, including Chairman Shen Honglie, Mayor Zhou Xiangxian, and Speaker of the Provisional Council Zhu Xianwen. Twenty-two were absent. First, Mayor Zhou reported on the administrative work of Hangzhou City in the past six months, stating: Hangzhou City currently has a population of 447,600, a decrease of one-quarter compared to before the war. Although the provincial government's revenue has increased monthly, it is still insufficient to meet expenses. It can only spend according to its means. The main achievements include the establishment of 20 new schools, the implementation of universal education, the establishment of a civil food regulation committee, the adjustment of prices, the improvement of sanitation, the dredging of waterways, and the restoration of electric lights on the Su and Bai Dams. Then, the commissioners of the eleven districts reported in turn on the administrative work of each district, all focusing on suppressing bandits, ensuring public security, stabilizing people's livelihoods, and revitalizing construction. All districts deeply felt the financial difficulties. In particular, Yu Shugong, the commissioner of the second district, said loudly at the meeting because the income was not enough for distribution, "The monthly income of the county magistrate is only over 63,000 yuan, and the monthly income of the staff is only over 23,000 yuan. Under these circumstances where it is not enough to maintain life, it often creates a phenomenon where no official is not corrupt. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the conference can discuss concrete measures to solve the problem." The meeting adjourned in the afternoon, and Chairman Shen hosted all attendees from 9:00 pm to 11:00 pm.

### Case of Japanese Police Shooting Taiwanese Compatriots: Statement by Our Delegation. Taiwanese Vendors Have Been Dispersed by Our Consulate. Japanese Police Opened Fire Without Cause, Resulting in a Bloody Incident.

[Central News Agency Tokyo 20th Special Dispatch] The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has taken emergency measures to prevent the recurrence of the shooting tragedy between Taiwanese people and Japanese police last night, ordering the closure of black markets in the Shinbashi and Shibuya districts, to be reopened after further notice. The blockade of the above two conflict sites may eliminate the brawls arising from disputes between Taiwanese, Koreans and Japanese rogues in these black markets. Our delegation to Japan issued a statement tonight regarding the shooting incident last night, the full text of which is as follows: When peace returned to the Pacific, Taiwanese compatriots in Japan attracted much attention. After fifty years of harsh rule by Japanese imperialists, Taiwanese compatriots suddenly became Chinese people again. The majority of Taiwanese in Tokyo, in order to make a living, rented a large area in Shinbashi to set up open-air stalls like those in Tokyo's "Rue Tian Huo Ju" (open-air stalls). Since the arrival of the US occupation forces in Japan, these Taiwanese have been operating stalls. The land base of these open-air stalls belongs to a certain Japanese company. From the 3rd of this month, the company owner has requested to terminate the lease. Although the Taiwanese have negotiated many times, they have not been successful. Subsequently, the company used force to drive out these Taiwanese vendors, resulting in a bloody tragedy that began as a verbal dispute. On July 19th, the company planned a large-scale brawl, gathering thousands of so-called Japanese rogues. Taiwanese compatriots also gathered hundreds of people to prepare for self-defense. Lin Dingping of our consulate in Tokyo made many efforts to disperse the Taiwanese compatriots. Unfortunately, these dispersed Taiwanese compatriots were shot at by Japanese police when they passed by a Japanese police station, killing four and injuring or mortally wounding twenty. The statement concludes: The Chinese Consulate considers this matter very serious and is taking appropriate steps to deal with the situation.

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 20th] News from Dalian has been quiet for a long time.

Now, due to the lack of fuel, people are cutting them down at will, and they may even be listed as the "Four Lights" in the future. Also, due to difficult living conditions, residents are mostly selling clothes and pawning items. Used clothing is cheaper than elsewhere. In the past, there were those who made risky business ventures on their own, but now few go there.

### Wuhan City's Agricultural Loans This Year Total Over 700 Million Yuan

[Hankou Correspondence] Regarding the agricultural loans of the China Farmers Bank in this city this year, it is learned that: (1) The amount of emergency agricultural loans is 250 million yuan. Since February of this year, most of them have been released until recently. There are 49 counties and cities that have been loaned.

However, the reporter had a detailed discussion with the person in charge of agricultural loans, and there are two points worth discussing regarding the loans that have been issued: (1) In terms of the target group, are they truly farmers? (2) In terms of the region, has it been popularized in every village? (Wei Li News Agency)

The County Government is calling a countywide public security meeting on the 24th of this month to discuss public security in the county.

Wuxi

Loans for Cocoon Depreciation to Aid Farmers

During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the rural economy of this county has been exploited by the enemy and puppet regime and has collapsed. After the victory, prices continued to rise, and the farmers' economy became increasingly difficult. After the spring plowing, most farmers lacked money to buy fertilizer, which greatly affected the autumn harvest. Moreover, the cooperative silkworm drying of the cooperative societies in various rural areas of this county cannot be sold in this autumn of cocoon depreciation, resulting in extreme economic difficulties for the farmers. Therefore, the cooperative societies presented petitions to the county government on the 18th, requesting approval to forward a letter to the Wuxi office of the China Farmers Bank for loans to aid them.

Hangzhou

Passenger Cars Robbed Midway to Quzhou and Lanxi

Three passenger cars traveling from Quzhou to Lanxi were forced to stop by more than ten bandits with two submachine guns and seven other firearms when passing through Liangtoumen, three miles near Luobu on the 18th, under the pretext of inspection. A total of more than seven million yuan in cash from all passengers was robbed and immediately fled. Now on the highways of Zhejiang Province, the remote areas along the road are not peaceful, and passengers are all vigilant and unwilling to carry banknotes with them, most of them remit money through the bank. As a result, bank remittances to Hangzhou have suddenly increased, and the number of trucks on the highway has also decreased recently. One reason is that the social economy is increasingly sluggish, and the purchasing power of the people is limited, so there is no profit to be made. The second reason is that the highways pass through remote mountain areas, with few people and easy for bandits to appear. Therefore, the highways that were bustling with activity two or three months ago have become very deserted recently.

Editorial

### America's War-Abolition Movement

The Second World War ended nearly a year ago, and the call for preventing a Third World War has already begun. This implies that the God of War is still threatening us, meaning that the God of Peace cannot yet graciously descend on the earth. How anxious this makes us! However, anxiety is useless. We must strive to win peace and work to abolish war.

Recently, one of the representatives of the United States attending the foreign ministers' conference, Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, returned to the country from Paris and reported to the Senate on the proceedings of the foreign ministers' conference, proposing a plan to prevent a Third World War. This is indeed good news for world peace. Connally's views on international politics have always been valued by the American government and public, and even by world opinion. In particular, this plan can be said to be his masterpiece. He personally experienced the turbulence of the foreign ministers' conference in Paris and deeply knows that the prospects for world peace are not optimistic. The bloodstains of the Second World War have not yet dried, and the crisis of a Third World War seems to be brewing. But he is not discouraged or disappointed, and he still uses all his wisdom and ability to formulate this war-abolition plan. In today's world, where humanity's struggle for peace has not yet succeeded, his sincerity is even more worthy of our respect.

Looking back at the war, although democratic countries were not necessarily able to take the lead in military terms, they were able to overcome any difficulties and achieve final victory because the major countries were truly united and unwavering. At that time, far-sighted politicians had already advocated that countries must maintain the spirit of striving for victory after the war and jointly build world peace. But once the enemy surrendered, the common goal no longer existed, and the actual interests of the countries were not entirely the same. As a result, "greed blinded wisdom," and their steps diverged. The psychology of suspicion and distrust grew imperceptibly. More than a year has passed since Germany surrendered, but true peace has not yet been realized. It was not until the recent foreign ministers' conference that it was decided to convene a peace conference of 21 European countries to sign peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. As for the German question, the four powers still had differing opinions and need to be discussed again in November of this year. The situation in the Far East is the same. Japan surrendered nearly a year ago, but the deadlock in Europe cannot be broken, and the Far East problem is even more difficult to solve independently. Therefore, Far East peace is also in a state of being within reach but not attainable.

But the Second World War lasted six years in Europe and eight years in the Far East, and the United States fought a bloody battle for four years before and after. Humanity has learned such a cruel lesson, and everyone should reflect deeply and sincerely desire peace! From the Far East to Europe, from Europe to the New World, under the whole world, who does not long for the eternal end of war? Although Willkie's dream of "One World" may not be realized immediately, President Roosevelt initiated the United Nations, and countries actually formed the United Nations together afterwards. If we still cannot have faith in "One World," it would truly be too much of a disservice to humanity's own wisdom.

Connally witnessed the crisis of the European situation in Paris and felt even more deeply the seriousness of future wars. Based on his research, he proposed seven war-abolition plans, which were earnest and sincere and should be praised and supported by all people of conscience. Roughly, his plan has five key points: (1) The United States should resolutely abide by the legal principles and the justice stipulated in the Atlantic Charter in all international negotiations, and advise other countries to do the same. (2) The United States should provide sufficient troops, aircraft, and warships to the United Nations Security Council for use in maintaining world peace. (3) The United States must maintain a strong army, navy, and air force to defend its territory and people and faithfully fulfill its obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter. (4) The United States should sign agreements with relevant countries as early as possible to jointly control atomic energy and other large-scale weapons that destroy humanity. (5) The United States should fully support the economic and social welfare programs of the United Nations to complete the various conditions necessary to maintain lasting world peace.

Connally's plan is neither an overly high ideal nor a novel idea. We only feel that it is practical and easy to implement. Confucius once said, "Is benevolence far away? I desire benevolence, and benevolence arrives." We can also say now: Peace is not far from people. If humanity wants peace, the God of Peace can descend. We must advise the major countries to truly respect the United Nations organization. We must regard it as the God of Peace. We must, like Connally, advise our own countries to contribute their capabilities to the United Nations on the one hand and obey the resolutions of the United Nations and abide by the charter of the United Nations on the other. Everyone should only use words and not force in any disputes, and the world will be at peace. From Connally's plan, it can be seen that the United States today knows that the era of isolation has long passed. To enjoy peace and prosperity at home, we must first seek world peace and stability. Connally's plan is the first step that the United States, based on this understanding, is taking with sincerity towards this path. In short, the United States is willing to stand on the side of international justice, devote its full strength, and take the lead in supporting the United Nations organization, making it the most effective tool for maintaining world peace. We not only hope that both the US Senate and House of Representatives can adopt this war-abolition plan as the basic principle of US foreign policy in the future, but also pray that this legislative spirit can be unanimously adopted by peace-loving people all over the world, especially the powerful countries. We must respect the United Nations, and we must not abuse the "veto power" to weaken the United Nations and prevent it from taking action against aggressors. Only then can the post-war world enter a new era of peace and obtain a reliable guarantee.

"Stopping war is the way to use force." This war-abolition movement in the United States is the martial virtue of the United States. It is only because the United States has a strong army, navy, and air force that it can make good use of its military force to defend world peace. We hope for the success of the war-abolition movement, and we especially hope that China can also take on this responsibility without hesitation and exert the spirit of "stopping war as the way to use force" to contribute to the world's war-abolition movement.

### Three British Warships Sail into the Persian Gulf: Iranian Government Protests, More Iranian Troops Head South, Tensions Rise.

[Agence France-Presse Tehran 20th] Officials have announced that the Iranian government has delivered a note to the British ambassador to Iran protesting the entry of three British cruisers into the Persian Gulf.

[Agence France-Presse Tehran 20th] Iranian Chief of Staff General Razmara met with the Minister of War this morning and immediately reported to Prime Minister Sadanah. Iranian political figures have said that the British Embassy has sent a note to the Iranian government requesting that measures be taken to protect the lives and property of British and Indian nationals in southern Iran. This demonstration of force by the British Navy is probably the result of this note. Once the Iranian government provides guarantees, the situation will ease, and the British cruisers will soon sail out of the Persian Gulf. In addition, a new batch of Iranian troops is heading to southern Iran. However, because the oil workers' strike in southern Iran has been resolved quickly, the British naval demonstration is probably meaningless.

London Statement Denies

[Agence France-Presse London 20th] Rumors that three British cruisers were anchored off the port of Abadan, ready to take action if British interests in Iran were threatened, have been denied by British officials. They said that the British cruiser "Norfolk" entered the port of Abadan to refuel, and immediately sailed out of Iranian territorial waters after refueling.

### Foreign Minister Wang and Party Depart Abroad in the Rain for Europe Yesterday; Wang and Zheng Deliver Speeches Before Departure

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The head of the Chinese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, the newly appointed Ambassador to the UK, Zheng Tianxi, the Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wu Nanru, the newly appointed Chargé d'affaires to Poland, Bao Yi, and secretaries Zhou Shukai and Guo Changlu, departed by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane for Calcutta this morning at 10:00 amidst the rain, en route to Paris. Minister Wang, dressed in a brown suit and a purple-red tie, looking spirited, waved goodbye to those seeing him off in the rain before boarding the plane. It is expected that they will arrive in Calcutta at 10:30 PM tonight. Mr. Wang's trip will last approximately one month before he can return to China. During his absence, the duties of the ministry will be handled by Vice Ministers Gan and Liu, and the European Department will be temporarily headed by the newly appointed Counselor, Gong Chao. This is the second time Mr. Wang has personally represented China at an international conference since becoming the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Before his departure, Mr. Wang made the following brief statement to the Central News Agency reporter: (1) The purpose of the Chinese government in participating in this peace conference is to promote its success. (2) Regardless of the source, China will support and implement all proposals at the peace conference that strengthen the foundation of lasting world peace. International justice is the main basis for lasting world peace. (3) Regarding international justice, various parties may have different interpretations, but all territorial disputes should be resolved according to the supreme principle of nationalism. This is indisputable. Anything contrary to this will be contrary to justice and harmful to peace. (4) The peace that the United Nations grants to its enemies must avoid all unnecessary and dangerous conditions. Otherwise, the day the peace treaty is signed will be the beginning of the revival of the enemy's reactionary forces, and its democratic and free forces will never be able to rise or develop.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The newly appointed Ambassador to the UK, Dr. Zheng Tianxi, left Beijing for the UK this morning with Foreign Minister Wang. After his departure, he told reporters: "I studied in England in my early years and lived there for ten years. Later, I served as a judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague for nine years, spending nearly twenty years in Europe altogether. I have many British friends. Therefore, I am very pleased to be appointed as ambassador to the UK. In 1935, the exhibition of Chinese Palace Museum artifacts in England was highly praised by friendly countries. At that time, I was in charge of the event in England and I deeply felt that both China and the UK are ancient civilizations, and cultural exchange can enhance understanding and mutual respect between the two countries." Mr. Zheng is from Zhongshan, Guangdong, is 62 years old, and holds a doctorate in law from the London School of Economics and Political Science.

[Reuters, Paris, 20th] The Luxembourg Palace, the pre-war site of the French Senate, is today undergoing major renovations and refurbishment in preparation for the 21-nation peace conference to be held there on the 29th. The palace was built in 1620 for Louis' mother, Marie de' Medici, and later became the residence of the royal family. During the French Revolution, it was used as a prison. After Napoleon became emperor, the Senate was established there. After the Nazi invasion of France in 1940, it was occupied as the headquarters of the German Army's Western Front.

### Purge in the Soviet Army; Large Number of Generals Transferred; Novikov Also One of the Victims; Konev to Succeed as Commander of Ground Forces

[Report from this newspaper] London, 21st Broadcast: According to reliable sources, it is believed that Marshal Ivan Konev will succeed Zhukov as the commander of the Soviet Ground Forces. Zhukov has been transferred to a less important position and is the first victim of the Soviet Army purge. It is believed that the second victim will be Marshal Novikov, commander of the Soviet Air Force during the war. His new position is currently unknown, but General Vorozheikin will be his successor. The purpose of this purge in the Soviet Army is to demote commanders who are close to the Western Allies. Zhukov and Novikov both had close relations with the commanders of the Western Allied forces. It is reported that several other Soviet commanders will also be transferred. It is believed that one of the main people among them will be General Bulganin, the Deputy Minister of the Soviet Army and Director of the Political Department.

### Studying Future War Trends; Three Important Recommendations Proposed; Unify Command of Army, Navy, and Air Force; Controlling Air Superiority is the Key to Victory; Report by U.S. Experts Published

[United Press, Washington, D.C., 20th] The White House today released the latest report of the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey. This report, drafted by civilian experts led by Deillier, is 30 pages long and pays extraordinary attention to air superiority in modern warfare throughout. Based on extensive surveys, it puts forward several recommendations, advocating that Congress pass a law to unify the U.S. armed forces under a single Department of Defense. In addition to the Army and Navy, there should be an equal Air Force responsible for both passive and active defense against foreign attacks, and for strategic attacks using airplanes or missiles. At the beginning of the Pacific War, the United States' strategic intelligence was far inferior to that of Germany and Japan, and research work was neglected. In the future, if intelligence is still lacking during a national crisis, it will inevitably lead to endless troubles. The current development of atomic bombing indicates that the basic principles of war remain unchanged, but atomic weapons will greatly change the scope of the use of manpower and armaments, leading to fundamental reforms in equipment, training, and tactics. The report also makes three recommendations: (1) Focus on research work to make the United States a world leader. The annual expenditure on research and development should reach $1 billion to ensure a reasonable level of national defense security. (2) Improve intelligence. The intelligence work of various agencies is currently irresponsible, and there is a severe shortage of capable intelligence personnel, which inevitably leads to panic and needs to be corrected urgently. (3) Maintain peace with armed forces. The United States is now one of the great powers and should be prepared to rise up to defend the law and fulfill its duties to guarantee treaty obligations. If the United States wants to become a force for maintaining peace, it must not only have this desire but also have this power.

### Turkey Holds General Election Yesterday; Voting Enthusiastic; Government Party Likely to Win; Shooting Incident Occurs in Izmir District

[Reuters, Istanbul, 20th] The Turkish people are scheduled to elect 465 members of parliament tomorrow. This election is based on the Western democratic method and is unprecedented in Turkey. This employs universal suffrage and direct voting, and the opposition party can compete openly for the first time. The victory of the Republican People's Party, the government party, is expected. The most powerful opposition party, the Democratic Party, is participating in the election in 46 of the 63 provinces of Turkey, with a total of 273 candidates. In the remaining 17 provinces, the People's Party has no opponent. Recently, there have been news of conflicts in various places, and two people were killed near Aydin village.

[United Press, Istanbul, 20th] Turkey is holding elections tomorrow, and the situation is quite tense today, and there have been shootings, with at least four deaths. It is expected that the number of voters on Sunday will exceed ten million. Istanbul is still under martial law, and the army commander has issued a warning that disturbances will not be allowed to occur. According to reports, a police reserve force of 200 people has entered the Izmir district. In other nearby areas, three people were shot and killed. Istanbul and Izmir are the concentrated areas of the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party is led by Bayar. Since the government allowed the reorganization of opposition parties last December, political groups have sprung up, with the Democratic Party being the strongest. President Inönü said that in today's international situation, the whole world is in danger, and Turkey is particularly worrying. He asked the people to continue to support the government to ensure security.

### India's Independence Movement

Since this war, only three major countries remain in Asia: China, the Soviet Union, and India. China and the Soviet Union are both independent and autonomous countries. In particular, this anti-aggression war has shattered the dream of the Axis powers, proving that the survival and independence of the two major Chinese and Soviet nations have achieved great success. However, India's independence issue, after years of struggle, remains to be realized. China and India live adjacent to each other, so we cannot but pay great attention to it.

India is located in the southwest of our country, with a population of nearly 400 million. It has an ancient culture, abundant resources, and a Mongolian race similar to ours. When our seaports were blocked one by one by the Japanese enemy, India became the gateway to our great rear area. Therefore, whether in peacetime or wartime, China and India have close relations with each other. Unfortunately, due to various obstacles and inconveniences, China still cannot deeply understand India, and India has no way of understanding the current China. After the end of the war, the wartime transportation between China and India immediately stopped, which further reduced our attention to the Indian issue, which is really not right!

From the current point of view, India's independence movement seems difficult to achieve perfect success for the time being. The ruling party in Britain now is the Labor Party, which claims to adhere to socialism. Since the Labor Party came to power last autumn, its face on the Indian issue is not much different from that of the Conservative Party government. Since Nehru and many other leaders of the Indian independence movement were released from prison last year, they have repeatedly stated that what the Indian nation seeks is independence, not autonomy, that is, to completely break away from the rule of the British Empire and not to become a part of the many dominions in the British Empire. However, the British Labor government still passes on the mantle of the Conservative Party, only allowing India to enjoy dominion-style freedom. No matter who or what group is sent to India for negotiations, after talking and talking, it still does not overflow the scope proposed by Sir Cripps on behalf of the British government in 1942. The British government's excessive emphasis on India, it is undeniable, makes India's independence not as simple and easy as that of the Philippines, while British newspapers say that the Philippines' independence is not as good as that of the British dominions.

Secondly, the internal situation in India is obviously quite divided now. India's independence movement over the years has been led by the National Congress Party. Unexpectedly, "since Yu was born, why was Liang born," Jinnah, who advocated the partition of India, has risen up and is in a stalemate with Gandhi and Nehru everywhere. As a result of the one positive and one negative forces canceling each other out, the Indian nation's struggle for independence has been greatly diminished. And just as the British cabinet's delegation to India had just returned to England, there was the so-called "untouchable group," which continued to make things difficult for the National Congress Party. Although India is a country, it has long been secretly divided into pieces in terms of race, religion, language, class, and customs, causing the flesh and blood to kill each other, and brothers to fight each other. In the same family, they have built high walls for others. Therefore, India's man-made inability to unite has become a major blow to India's independent future. A country whose sovereignty is violated by others is often also a country that is difficult to unite itself. Therefore, judging from the Reuters reports that have repeatedly publicized the news of the Indian untouchable group opposing the National Congress Party, it shows that India's independence movement will inevitably have to pay a considerable price.

However, freedom and independence, India's 400 million people, will eventually get it sooner or later. First, the Indian nation has a profound and subtle culture, which has awakened every Indian to the need for their country to gain freedom and independence. As long as the Indian nation itself feels an urgent need, it will inevitably achieve its goal. Second, in the independence movement, India's leaders are much stronger and more numerous than those of other oppressed countries in Asia, such as Burma, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies. Burma still cannot find a leader today who can lead the country internally and has international status externally; while India has countless leaders in addition to Gandhi, Nehru, Acharya, and Mrs. Pandit. India has such great leaders, just as China had the leadership of the Father of the Nation when overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, and the leadership of the Chairman when eliminating the warlords and resisting the Japanese invaders. There is no doubt that India's independence will definitely be successful sooner or later. Third, any country now expresses deep hope and sympathy for India's independence movement. From the United States to China, the Soviet Union, and other countries, they have made clear expressions, earnestly hoping that India's 400 million people can get rid of their shackles as soon as possible and jointly shoulder the great task of building a road to peace for this troubled world. Fourth, as far as Britain is concerned, the Indian nation has made a long and great contribution to Britain. Especially in the First and Second World Wars, the Indian nation has shed a lot of blood. When the British cabinet delegation to India reported to the House of Commons and the House of Lords on the 18th of this month on the negotiations with the Indian leaders, it stated that Britain was sincere in making India an independent and autonomous country as soon as possible. This attitude is very proper, and it is hoped that Britain will no longer make any additional conditions and fulfill its promise in the Far East, just like the United States did to the Philippines. In summary of the above four points, we feel that the future of India's independence has shown that it will have strong brightness.

Once India's independence is completed, it can be said that half of the overall situation of world peace has been built, because before the slave nations in Asia and Africa have gained freedom and liberation, all peace and security in the world are empty, and are no different from building on sand.

### US Determined to Unify German Economy

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 21st Broadcast: The U.S. Commander-in-Chief of the Occupied Zone in Germany stated today that the U.S. is determined to make the German economy a whole.

### British Lodges Strong Protest with Egypt Over Repeated Attacks on Troops; Deep Dissatisfaction with Harboring of Husseini

[United Press, London, 20th] The Foreign Office announced today that Britain has lodged a note with Egypt, which is very strong, protesting the continued attacks on British soldiers. Although the British government is aware that this hostile action is instigated by those who wish to see relations between the two countries deteriorate, it is also concerned about how the Egyptian government is dealing with this intolerable situation. The British side believes that the Egyptian government has not taken the methods it should and could take to protect the lives of British soldiers. The former Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Husseini, fled from France and is now under the protection of the Egyptian royal family in Alexandria. The British government has also expressed concern that the Egyptian government has not guaranteed to prevent his political activities. The talks between the British Ambassador to Egypt, Campbell, and the Egyptian government have not yet been completed. If Husseini stays in Egypt for a long time, the situation will be very unsatisfactory. According to unofficial statements from the Foreign Office, no matter what guarantees Egypt makes, London does not believe that Husseini will cooperate with Britain.

### Date Set for Atomic Bomb Experiment

[United Press, Washington, D.C., 20th] The Navy Department announced today that the detonation time for the underwater atomic bomb test has been set for July 24th at 23:50 Greenwich time, which is 8:50 AM Shanghai summer time on July 25th.

### British Bread Rationing Introduced Yesterday; Conservative Party Seizes the Opportunity to Launch Offensive; Grocer Commits Suicide Due to Anxiety

[United Press, London, 20th] With three vacant seats in the British House of Commons, by-elections are scheduled for next week.

### "One of the Elders" Attracts Much Attention; Hearing of Wen Lanting Postponed; Originally Scheduled for Today Due to Family Request for Delay; Lawyers Including Zhu Fu-jiu Reportedly Retained to Prepare Defense

[Reported by this newspaper] Wen Lanting, one of the "Three Elders of Shanghai," after being prosecuted by the High Procuratorate, was originally scheduled to have his first hearing at the High Court at 3 PM today. Many in the city are concerned about the Wen case, and it is expected that the courtroom would be filled with spectators on the day of the hearing. However, according to reliable sources, the case has been postponed with the approval of the High Court due to a request from the defendant's lawyers and family for a delay in the trial.

Wen Lanting is 76 years old and from Jiangsu Province. He was involved in the cotton yarn business in Shanghai in his early years and has served as a director of the Yarn Industry Association, chairman of the Exchange Federation, executive member of the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce, standing committee member of the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation, and executive member of the National Chamber of Commerce Federation. He was indeed a highly respected figure in the business world. However, after the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, Wen successively served as chairman and director of the puppet National Commercial Control Association, chairman of the puppet Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, chairman of the puppet Cotton Control Association, member of the puppet Material Control Review Committee, and member of the puppet Municipal Advisory Committee. In the cotton yarn industry, he also served as chairman of the Yarn Factory Federation, chairman of the Yarn Industry Guild, chairman of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange, and chairman of the Yarn Industry Bank. After the victory, Wen, along with the other "Two Elders," Yuan Ludeng and Lin Kanghou, was arrested by military authorities and sent to judicial authorities for trial and detained in Zhongzi Prison of Shanghai Prison for several months.

The life sentences handed down to Yuan Ludeng and Tang Shoumin greatly shocked Wen. During the High Procuratorate's investigation, he once refused to leave prison for questioning. Yuan was the director of the "Rice Control Association" under the "Commercial Control Association" at the time, and Tang was the chairman of the "Commercial Control Association" when Wen served as chairman. Now that Yuan and Tang have both been sentenced to life imprisonment, Wen anticipates at least a life sentence for himself, hence the saying, "The trial will be the same either way, so a quick verdict is better, why bother with more trials?" Currently, Wen's family has retained lawyers including Zhu Fu-jiu to prepare his defense. Although the date of the trial has been postponed, it will not be in the distant future.

### Strengthening Security in Suburban Areas; Search of Households in Beixinjing

[Reported by this newspaper] The residents of the Beixinjing area in northwest Shanghai are of mixed character.

Yesterday morning around 6 AM, military police patrol teams searched the town house by house until the afternoon. It is reported that the military police patrol teams will continue to search the surrounding villages to prevent unscrupulous elements from causing trouble.

Furthermore, the municipal military and police authorities believe that the areas along the Jinghu Road and the riverside are important defensive locations. The Songhu Garrison Command and the Municipal Police Bureau have issued urgent notices, ordering their respective jurisdictions to increase the number of police officers, contact local people's defense teams, and self-defense groups to be fully mobilized day and night for prevention. All pedestrians and ships docked at the mouth of the Huangpu River and the ports are subject to strict inspection to prevent chaos and ensure safety.

### Temporary Post Office Employees Request Promotion to Permanent Positions

[Reported by this newspaper] More than 140 temporary employees of the Municipal Postal Administration recently requested the Bureau to promote them to formal postal workers, postal assistants, and postmen. It is understood that the Bureau may not be able to approve this request in the short term, but the employees are trying their best to fight for it. A responsible person from the Bureau stated during an interview that, considering the current business situation of the Shanghai Post Office, even with the successive arrival of personnel from the rear, temporary employees will not be affected and laid off. At the same time, they have become quite familiar with the Bureau's operations after working for several months, so they will not be dismissed unless absolutely necessary. As for the salary, since the General Bureau has never approved the addition of permanent staff, it is already a special consideration to allow all temporary employees who pass the examination to join the Bureau as soon as possible. A "temporary" postman complained that their salary is about half that of a permanent postman, while their work is exactly the same. It is understood that the employees have formed a New Comrades Affairs Committee and plan to send five representatives to negotiate with the Bureau again today, and also entrust the General Labor Union to request the General Bureau to assist.

At that time, the setting sun was descending, and the evening breeze was gently blowing. The garden lawn of the corps was filled with women, and the atmosphere was cheerful. The entertainment program included the Pan Yuzhen siblings' skills troupe, performing various thrilling national arts such as diabolo, and Deng Wenqing performing magic and hypnosis. A dinner was held around 7 PM, during which Ms. Jun Yiyun, a famous Kunqu opera singer who is about to go to Beijing to perform, and famous amateur performers Mao Jinfang, Mao Yinfang, Zhu Min, Wu Husheng, and Fan Shiren sang.

It is reported that Ms. Zhang took the train to Beijing last night and will perform at the Central Theater.

### Dr. Li Zhaohuan Discusses His Impressions After Returning from Abroad; British Still Living Wartime Lives; United States Abandoning Isolationist Policy

[Reported by this newspaper] Dr. Li Zhaohuan, chairman of the National Association of Chinese Christian Youth, and Liang Xiaochu, the general secretary of the Association, flew to Switzerland at the end of February this year to represent the Association at the World Youth Conference. After the conference, they traveled through Britain and went to the United States to attend the North American Youth Conference. They recently returned to China, and a reporter from this newspaper visited his residence to inquire about his impressions of the trip.

Li said that the most profound impression of this trip was the fighting spirit of the British. He said that everyone in the UK, from the King down, is willing to sacrifice. Although the war has been over for a long time, because everything in the country has not yet recovered, the people are still living wartime lives, as if the war has not ended. The various controls that were implemented during the war still exist, so there is no black market in Britain.

After this war, the British deeply felt that the world trend had changed. Therefore, national governance and foreign policy have been adjusted. For example, many old friends in the UK believe that the so-called imperialism of the past is over. The current British government is a labor government, and unless there are unexpected twists and turns, the current government is expected to continue in power until 1950.

At this point, Li quoted the two major schools of sociology promoted in modern times: one is the environmental school, and the other is the heredity school. From the impressions of this trip, he deeply felt that the world trend has a tendency towards the environmental school. For example, the countries he visited on this trip, Britain, Switzerland, and the United States, have all abandoned their previous traditional policies, and all their policies are focused on adapting to the environment.

In the case of the United States, in terms of diplomacy, it has changed from its past traditional isolationist policy to adapting to the environment. After this war, Americans have deeply understood that in order to seek their own security, the collective security of the world must also be taken into account. Therefore, they are studying how to cooperate and help each other with the world and lead the world into a state of peace.

In terms of domestic affairs, the United States has gradually moved towards centralization in order to adapt to the environment. According to the United States, before the Civil War, it adopted a system of local decentralization. The North-South War was actually a turning point in centralization. Even at that time, there were still many people who opposed centralization. After President Roosevelt advocated it and was affected by the war, centralization became popular. For example: (1) Each province and city built airports. If the province and city could not afford the construction costs, they could apply for subsidies from the central government. (2) People's welfare undertakings were previously handled by each province and city, but in the past ten years, they have gradually been centralized and handled by the central government. (3) Labor issues were also previously handled by each province and city, but recently the central government has established a Department of Labor. Important labor issues are concentrated in the central government.

Dr. Li is 58 years old, from Nanhai, Guangdong. He studied in the United States in his early years and served as the president of National Jiaotong University for many years. In addition to being responsible for the affairs of the National Association of Youth, his main position is as a member of the Legislative Yuan. He is currently working hard to assist Sun Ke, the president of the Legislative Yuan, in preparing for the reopening of the National Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center.

### Refugees Encouraged After Recovery of Taixing and Other Places; Difficulties Remain for Return; Relief Work Cannot Be Relaxed

Many homeless refugees from Guanfu, Rugao, and other counties in northern Jiangsu have flowed into major ports along the Beijing-Shanghai line. Yesterday, a gentleman from the Guanfu Refugee Youth Group told a reporter that as of Saturday, the number of people transferring from Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, and other inland areas to this city was increasing daily. These refugees not only faced difficulties in food and drink relief, but also mostly slept in the open at night due to the lack of housing, which was very miserable. However, since yesterday, the situation has suddenly changed. Not only has the number of people coming to Shanghai suddenly decreased, but those who have already arrived in Shanghai have also flocked to the various associations of their respective communities in northern Jiangsu to inquire whether they can return home immediately. This is because the news of the recovery of Taixing, Rugao, and other places has reached this city. All the refugees were overjoyed and believed that their long-separated hometowns could be restored. However, in the above-mentioned areas, in addition to the refugee groups who are following the National Army's advance, or may have already seen their hometowns again, the number of refugees in Beijing and Shanghai is large, and even if they can return home, the supply of transportation is also a major problem. Therefore, although the refugees all hate not being able to fly back, in reality there are still difficulties. Therefore, relief work still cannot be relaxed in the slightest.

Midnight Charity Dance Postponed

The Hongkou Dance Hall Friendship Association, jointly formed by the employees of the Hongkou Xinsheng Club, Guohua, Kaifu, Nightclub, and Haili, was originally scheduled to hold a midnight charity dance and bazaar on the 20th from 12 PM to 5 AM the next morning to raise donations for the relief of refugees in northern Jiangsu. All proceeds will be used to relieve refugees in northern Jiangsu, and all expenses will be shared by the members of the Association. However, as this initiative has not been approved by the local Bureau, it has been decided to reschedule it for this Saturday (26th).

### City Government Tightens Staffing; Implementation Soon

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Government has submitted a request to the government authorities to tighten the staffing of the Municipal Government and its subordinate bureaus and affiliated agencies, and to reduce personnel, in order to balance revenue and expenditure due to the large deficit in Shanghai's fiscal revenue for this year and the large amount of various expenses. In the future, the number of retained personnel will be based on the combined number of employees of the former Shanghai Municipal Government and the former two concession authorities in the summer of 1937. As for the newly established institutions after the war, they will also be adjusted as needed. The relevant authorities have approved the above measures for implementation soon.

### Memorial Service for Martyr Yin Dantian

[Reported by this newspaper] Martyr Yin Dantian devoted himself to the work of resisting the enemy behind enemy lines during the war and died in battle on June 15, 1945, in Zhoujing Village, Bijing Township, Qingpu County. People from all walks of life held a memorial service at Jing'an Temple in western Shanghai yesterday morning at 10 AM. Participants included people from the municipal Party headquarters, all walks of life in Qingpu County, and friends of the martyr. The hall was solemnly decorated. Wu Shaoshu (representing Jiang Huaisu) presided over the ceremony. After offering incense, dedicating lanterns, and presenting flowers, the guests successively delivered speeches praising the martyr's deeds during his lifetime. The meeting adjourned after about an hour. Also, in order to commemorate Martyr Gu, people from all walks of life have established the Municipal Dantian Primary School on Hongqiao Road as a permanent remembrance. Before the war, the martyr's family was wealthy. During the war, he destroyed his family to join the army, and his family property was completely lost. After the martyr's death, he left behind a widow and young daughter, and only received a consolation payment of 30,000 yuan from his superiors. Their livelihood depended entirely on subsidies from the martyr's friends during his lifetime. The situation is very pitiful. The memorial meeting yesterday discussed jointly raising funds for the family to comfort the loyal soul.

Madam Zou, Mother of Qian; Second Anniversary of Death Yesterday

Madam Zou, the mother of Ms. Qian Jianqiu, director of the Municipal Women's Association, member of the Municipal Party Committee, and counselor of the Municipal Government, and the grandmother of Qian Ying, the section chief of the Land Administration Bureau, passed away two years ago. At that time, Qian was engaged in underground work, and the son-in-law, daughters, and daughters-in-law of Madam were arrested and detained in the Japanese Military Police Department.

Party, League, government, and military leaders Zhang Zhiben, Wu Shaoshu, Yu Songjun, Shen Chunhui, Chen Shihua, and hundreds of leaders of various women's organizations came to pay their respects.

### China Fisheries Company Opens Railway Refrigeration Business

[Reported by this newspaper] In the hot weather, being in a hurry to visit the railway refrigeration business opened by the China Fisheries Company of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry seems fresh! The theme is also timely.

According to the China Fisheries Company, they opened the railway refrigeration business this time in order to relieve the food panic and suppress the market prices of aquatic products and agricultural products. Therefore, they leased four refrigerated trains from the Jinpu Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, preparing to travel back and forth on the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Jinpu lines, specializing in transporting various frozen fish, fresh meat and eggs, and agricultural products such as fruits and vegetables.

At 4:50 PM the day before yesterday, one of the refrigerated cars making its first trip was attached to the fourth-class train departing from the North Station to Nanjing. When the reporter arrived at the North Station, the refrigerated car, fully equipped and ready to go, was being connected by the locomotive to other trains.

The outline of the refrigerated car is no different from that of an ordinary iron-covered car. However, it is painted a light gray color, which is a little better than the ugly iron-covered car. The maiden voyage was loaded with a batch of yellow croaker from the Fisheries Company. Therefore, when the car door was opened, although a cool breeze was sent, it was filled with a fishy smell!

The interior of the car is lined with wool felt up to eight inches thick on all four walls to insulate it from the outside heat. The top of the car is fully equipped with layered ice troughs, with more than three tons of ice installed. Although the space left in the car is not very large, it is said that it can also hold more than ten tons of fresh goods.

During the trial period, it is limited to one round trip on the Beijing-Shanghai line every day, with one car attached each time, and loading is limited to direct loading between Shanghai and Nanjing, and small stations along the way will not accept goods for the time being. If it is handled well, it will gradually be promoted to other routes and small stations, and the ultimate goal is to achieve universal service.

At present, the China Fisheries Company's rent burden to the Jinpu Railway Bureau is 960 yuan per ton per day. The load of each car is twelve tons, so the daily rental expense for each car is 11,520 yuan. And if the customer has fresh goods to load, they only need to add 30% to the freight stipulated by the original Railway Bureau, then your fresh goods, even on the busy, hot, and long Beijing-Shanghai road, can always maintain its freshness.

When leaving the North Station, the reporter found a train at the end of the fourth-class passenger train loaded with two rubber-wheeled US military refrigerated trailers. A person in the refrigeration industry unconsciously pointed out: This is a truly standard refrigerated car, because it uses ammonia compression to generate cold air. Our refrigerated car is inevitably dwarfed in comparison. However, the reporter believes otherwise. At present, although we cannot keep up with the novelty of others in terms of materials, the spirit of grasping reality and catching up should be strived for. The China Fisheries Company's opening of the railway refrigeration business this time has at least demonstrated part of this spirit. The reporter believes that in the near future, the real refrigerated car will run on all Chinese railways with the continuous expression of this spirit!

### Thug's Swapping Trick: Real Money Turns into Counterfeit

In this city, it's often heard that there are always thugs who use swapping methods to deceive ignorant villagers. These people are nimble, and once discovered, they quickly vanish, making it difficult to catch them. On the 20th of this month at 9:30 AM, Cao Guo'an (15 years old), an apprentice at Tong Chang Hua Foreign Goods Store at No. 100 Jinling Road, was ordered by the shop owner to deposit 610,000 yuan in legal tender into a cloth bag and send it to Mao Hua Bank on Henan Road. When Cao Guo'an was walking along Fuzhou Road towards Fujian Road, two men suddenly approached him from behind (one dressed in a white Hong Kong shirt and trousers, around 30 years old; the other in a yellow Hong Kong shirt and yellow shorts, also around 30 years old). They spoke with a northern accent, claiming to have lost a package of US dollar notes on the way, and asked Cao Guo'an if he had picked them up. Cao Guo'an, being young and inexperienced, unaware of the dangers of the world, immediately stated that he had not found anything and opened the cloth bag, allowing the two men to examine it. The two men rummaged through his bag for a while and then left. After they left, Cao discovered that 215,000 yuan of legal tender in the bag, including two bundles, had completely turned into counterfeit money. Only then did he realize he had been scammed and reported it to the responsible police station for investigation.

### Song Lijiang, President of the Puppet Maintenance Society in Songjiang, Cannot Escape Justice: Arrested After Hiding in Tushanwan

Songjiang, located in the southwestern suburbs of this city and bordering Shanghai, was occupied by enemy forces.

### Visiting the Infant Health Care Center: A Mother's Luck, an Infant's Blessing

In countries like the United States and the Soviet Union, for pre-school education and healthcare, from the moment an infant is born until they enter kindergarten, the state universally establishes infant health care centers to take on the work of education, upbringing, health, and medical care. What about in our country? There is no shortage of infant care organizations in various places, such as nurseries and orphanages, but unfortunately, most of them are poorly equipped, with dilapidated buildings, and various environments that are not suitable for the lives and health of infants. The infants sent there are left to grow naturally, with no effort to care for their health. In fact, they cannot properly fulfill their health care responsibilities. Therefore, it is simply impossible for salaried civil servants and working women to solve the problem of child care and health. Under these circumstances, countless infants are sacrificed every year. Even women who are eager to create a better future for children and want to solve this difficulty lack the courage to work hard due to economic reasons.

Recently, the reporter had the opportunity to visit the Shanghai Infant Health Care Center at No. 10, Lane 173, Dongbaoxing Road, North Sichuan Road. It is a newly renovated three-story modern Western-style house. When the reporter ran in, it happened that a foster child was being admitted. Two young ladies in white uniforms were examining the child lying on a white rectangular table, one was a female doctor with a stethoscope, and the other was a female nurse. Miss Liang, who was sitting at a writing desk for four people, greeted me very kindly. The reporter quickly took out a business card and explained my purpose. Under the diligent guidance of Miss Liang, the reporter went upstairs to meet Miss Yun Boqin, the director of the hospital, for the first time. Director Yun is a kind and approachable woman. Judging from her elegant demeanor and generous attitude, she is indeed a capable female leader.

When Director Yun met me, this "uninvited guest," she said very modestly, "We really can't handle fostering children in this place! So we are actively requesting the allocation of housing." Then the reporter asked her about the motivation for founding the hospital.

"My motivation for founding the health care center was also because I was originally a working woman. In order to serve society and focus on my duties, in order to take care of my child, I left my child in the hands of a servant who had no medical knowledge. My eldest child was raised by a wet nurse. As the saying goes, 'Breastfeeding is like three points,' and my eldest child's temper is just like the wet nurse's. All kinds of bad habits cannot be corrected even now that she is seven years old."

"For the second child, I decided to breastfeed myself, but because I didn't have much milk, the child was too thin. I had no choice but to hire a wet nurse again. The young wet nurse wouldn't listen to me and secretly let the child eat too many indigestible things. The weather was hot, and she lost her life to dysentery before we could detect it and treat her."

"This January, because I was busy with my work, my fourth child also died due to the misuse of medication by the servants and doctors at the public hospital," she said very sadly.

"I think that such an experience is not only the misfortune of the child, but also the misfortune of the country, especially the children of working women and civil servants. The pain is even deeper. On the one hand, in order to supplement the family income, they have to help their husbands find a job. On the other hand, they are reluctant to leave their children at home unattended or are unwilling to entrust them to servants. At the same time, there is no suitable place to entrust them. Therefore, I made up my mind. But doing one thing is not easy. These children have grown up so easily, all thanks to these children's nurses and the two enthusiastic doctors who take turns caring for them day and night." As she spoke, she asked the on-duty nurse to take a white disinfected isolation gown and mask and asked me to put them on. She herself also went back to the room to change into an isolation gown and mask before inviting the reporter to enter the first health care room for a visit.

The entire room was filled with small wooden beds covered in cream-colored new-style versatile, each bed sleeping an infant. Four beds were grouped together, and each group was cared for by a young lady in a white uniform who was a children's nurse. Changing diapers and feeding milk, they worked hard for the children as if they were mothers. However, every younger nurse was gentle and lively. The reporter subconsciously thought of her own childhood and couldn't help but feel sad. If there had been a health care center at that time, a child without a mother would never have suffered from the abuse of cruel and ignorant servants, which prevented her from achieving normal physical and mental development, thereby affecting her health.

After the reporter left the health care room, she asked Director Yun about future plans. She told me in detail as follows:

"Our hospital is still in its early stages of operation. The only job is to lay a solid foundation first." She applied to the relevant authorities for the allocation of housing. In short, this is a social enterprise, not something that belongs to an individual. However, I hope that people from all walks of life will show sympathy and assistance."

The reporter looked at the time and it was getting late, so she said goodbye and left. In addition to deeply admiring Director Yun's spirit of service in solving problems for everyone because she felt the pain herself, she also silently prayed for the eternal life of the Infant Health Care Center. This is truly the luck of the mothers and the blessing of the infants in Shanghai.

### Shen Honglie Discusses Future Education: Standardized Salaries, Institutionalized Funding

[Reported from Hangzhou by this newspaper] Zhejiang Province Chairman Shen Honglie, in a recent provincial administrative meeting, discussed the issue of future education. He said, "At the current stage, it seems that improving quality should be the main focus. The foundation of education in this province was unfortunately mostly destroyed during the war. Not only are school buildings insufficient and equipment lacking, but teachers are also mostly on the brink of starvation, making it difficult for them to concentrate on their work. The lack of primary school teachers is a particularly common phenomenon. In the future, secondary education in each county should be enriched according to the available funds. In the area of national education, salaries must be standardized and funding institutionalized, taken from the villages and used for the villages, to avoid burdening the people and the schools being in constant fear. This matter relies heavily on the assistance of public opinion institutions to adapt to local conditions."

### The China Welfare Fund is Setting Up a Children's Library

Madam Sun Hopes to Promote a Nationwide Movement

The China Welfare Fund, organized by Madam Sun, recently announced that poor children in Shanghai will have a free library. Two locations have been selected for libraries, with reading rooms and writing rooms. Students from middle schools and colleges in Shanghai have launched fundraising efforts to raise funds for the establishment of the library. The Children's Library will be jointly organized by the China Welfare Fund and the schools promoting the "Little Teacher Movement." Little teachers will teach reading and writing to children who have never had the opportunity to learn. Madam Sun hopes that the children's library, first established as two branches, will be the beginning of a nationwide movement. Currently, the demand for establishing free libraries is extremely urgent. Once this type of library is widely established, China's illiteracy rate will inevitably decrease sharply. The purpose of the plan to establish this type of library is also in this. Madam Sun said: "We should develop the habit of reading among poor children. To achieve this goal, we should collect books for them. The China Welfare Fund specially continues to request enthusiastic support from all parties."

### Autumn Book Shortage Needs Remedying; Joint Sales Method Still Shelved

[Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing] The current Seven-Organization Joint Office has successively obtained approval from the Ministry of Education to establish supply groups in various places for the supply of nationally designated textbooks, and implement the "unified sales" method. However, in order to take into account the interests of the vendors and the difficulties of each county and school in self-determined purchases, the unified sales method was slightly revised to "joint sales." However, it has been a month since the principles and key points were decided, and the implementation measures have not yet been drafted and passed, and the printing progress is also very slow. Now that the start of the autumn semester is fast approaching, the nationally designated textbooks will again be concentrated in a few cities for sale under the slogan of "too late," and there is still a tendency for book shortages in various places. The Board of Directors of the Seven-Organization Joint Office will convene an emergency meeting in the coming days to discuss remedial measures. It is reported that the Ministry of Education is quite anxious after receiving the news and will send personnel to Shanghai to supervise the work.

### Tight Credit Leads to Hoarders Selling; Rice Price Lower Than Limit Price; Grain Examination Committee to Meet Today to Discuss

[Report from Our Newspaper] It is learned that the Grain Price Review Committee, which has been suspended for five days, is scheduled to reconvene at 3 PM today to have important discussions. The arrival of rice yesterday was still low, so prices continued to fall. According to a survey, the retail price of top-quality white rice is only 67,000 to 68,000, which is 3,000 yuan lower than the review price of 71,000. Grain rice is even cheaper, only 47,000 yuan. However, actual sales are sluggish and few people are interested. The current inventory is still sufficient. In addition to the market supply, the daily inventory is about 30,000 Shih, and there are still 150,000 bags of foreign rice in the warehouse that have not been used. Last week, the China Grain Corporation had 110,000 bags arrive at the port, and it is said that 200,000 bags are expected to arrive continuously within the month, so the period of shortage can be safely passed. Whether the review price will be reduced will depend on today's market price and supply and demand.

[Another Report] Recently, the rice price in this city has tended to stabilize, and the source of rice from various places has increased greatly. Yesterday, a total of more than 12,000 bags of rice were transported to Shanghai from various production areas such as Suzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, and Wuhu, breaking the recent record. It is learned that the reasons are as follows: (1) Credit in various rice-producing areas such as Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Changshu, and Wuhu has been very tight recently, and local money houses have tightened lending, so rice merchants have come out of hiding. (2) A large amount of foreign rice is arriving one after another, and hoarders are anxious to sell. (3) The autumn harvest is approaching, and new grains will be available soon.

[Another Report] The rice price in this city has fallen. In addition to a small part of the lower-middle class buying brown rice, most people buy white rice. The sales of roasted rice are becoming increasingly sluggish. It is learned that more than 60 rice stores are reporting that the sales of brown rice are sluggish and the source of white rice is gradually becoming smooth. They have specifically sent a letter to the Rice Store Industry Association to submit to the Social Bureau, requesting that the brown rice received by the rice stores cannot be sold out and requesting appropriate measures to avoid unexpected losses.

### "Black" Banks and Money Houses: Tianjin's Usurers

[Tianjin Telegraph] Due to the severe credit crunch in this city recently, the market has been unable to recover. Most speculators have liquidated their goods in order to lend funds and seek high profits. The nominal highest interest rate is no more than 18%, but the black market is above 20%, and interest is calculated weekly. Interest is compounded after the weekend. If the amount of the loan is large, the accumulated amount is very considerable. Currently, the atmosphere for cracking down on black banks and money houses is very strong. Those engaged in this business mostly use shop names and deduct interest in advance when lending funds, and debtors issue post-dated checks in order to avoid responsibility. It is reported that the competent authorities are paying attention to cracking down on this trend of black banks and money houses.

### Petition to the Takeover Investigation Team; Request for Return of Robbed Cloth; Legal Reasons Presented

The case of the members of the three associations of dyeing, weaving, cotton cloth, and yarn in this city requesting the return of the remaining yarn and cloth forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppet regimes has long been noticed by the legal and public opinion circles. Recently, it was learned that the takeover investigation team has arrived in Shanghai to investigate the takeover of enemy and puppet properties. Various industries have suffered severely from the enemy and puppet regimes' purchase of yarn and cloth. To this day, their vitality has not recovered, and their business is sluggish. It is also heard that knitting manufacturers, affected by the purchase of cotton yarn, are short of funds and unable to operate. They have jointly submitted a request to dedicate the factory. It can be seen that the industrial crisis is fraught with dangers and the situation is extremely urgent. In terms of the dyeing, weaving, and cotton yarn industries that were most affected by the enemy and puppet regimes' purchase of yarn and cloth, about half have not yet recovered. Those that have resumed operations and then stopped have also emerged one after another. Those who勉維maintain the status quo also show signs of wavering. Currently, although the government is implementing industrial loans, very few dyeing and weaving industries have obtained them. The various industry associations have recently held meetings to discuss the increasingly serious situation and believe that the urgent solution is to request the government to implement industrial loans widely to alleviate the current crisis. However, the robbed yarn and cloth originally belonged to the factory numbers and should be returned as soon as possible to restore vitality. Therefore, returning the robbed yarn and cloth is an important step in rescuing industry and commerce. On the occasion of the arrival of the investigation team to Shanghai to investigate, a petition is being made to the team regarding the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau's forced mixing of privately owned yarn and cloth with enemy and puppet properties. According to inquiries from the industry, it was reported that the association had filed an appeal to the Executive Yuan regarding the request for the return of the robbed yarn and cloth. It is now heard that the Executive Yuan has instructed the Disposal Bureau to make a detailed reply. Legally speaking, the Bureau may make a legitimate handling again. However, this yarn and cloth has been sold in batches by the Disposal Bureau, which has caused great indignation among the industry, and there were original plans to launch a petition. Now, a petition is being filed with the investigation team in accordance with the law to investigate and protect rights and interests. Furthermore, the legal points of the petition submitted by the association are excerpted below: "According to Article 92, paragraph 1 of the Civil Code, a declaration of intent made under duress can be revoked. The victims and the association have repeatedly requested the authorities to return the items, which can be considered as an expression of revocation. Moreover, property rights have the right of pursuit and are rights against the world. The enemy and puppet regimes' purchase of yarn and cloth is no different from theft and robbery. And the stolen goods are recovered by the government. There is no doubt that it should be handed over to the original owner for collection. Furthermore, the Cairo Allied Declaration clearly states that any act of looting or robbery, whether formal or seemingly legal or close to a transaction voluntarily entered into by the parties, is invalid. According to Article 4, paragraph 1 of the principles for handling enemy properties promulgated by the Executive Yuan, it should also be returned to the original owner." It was also stated that: "The case was previously approved for return by the legal advisory committee of the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau. The revocation of the previous and subsequent measures by the deliberation meeting of the Bureau is indeed incomprehensible."

### Foreign Sugar to be Imported

Costing 46,000 Yuan per Dan, Import Tax Still Under Application

News of the import of foreign sugar into this city has already been reported. It is now known that some sugar merchants are placing orders with Cuba, Batavia, and other places. Currently, one or two batches, totaling 44,000 bags, have been ordered, with delivery scheduled for next month. The price of this foreign sugar is US$0.1875 per pound, equivalent to approximately 46,000 yuan per dan in national currency. However, the import tax rate for this sugar is still a problem. The Sugar Industry Association is currently requesting the customs authorities to levy tax as a necessity. If the customs authorities levy tax at the luxury goods import tax rate, the cost to sugar merchants will increase, making it difficult to make substantial profits.

### New Gold Mountain Branches Weakly Decline

New Gold Mountain branches previously entered from Guangdong via the Niuzhuang wheel, with further shipments arriving, totaling nearly a thousand dan. Industry insiders predict the quotation board is likely to ease again.

### US Senate and House Subcommittee Recommends Reinstating Food Price Controls and Retaining the Office of Price Administration for One Year

[United Press Washington, 20th] The Joint Subcommittee of the Senate and House of Representatives passed a resolution tonight to retain the Office of Price Administration for one year and reinstate price controls on several foods starting August 20th. The bill still needs to be passed by the House and Senate and signed by the President. The bill recommends reinstating price controls on meat, poultry, cheese, grains, cottonseeds, and soybeans starting August 20th. However, if the subcommittee finds that these foods are in sufficient supply before August 20th and do not require controls, then a decision will be made at that time not to impose controls.

### The Withered Slender West Lake

— Our Newspaper Yangzhou Dispatch on the 5th, Special Correspondent Wang Gonghan

Among the lakes in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces suitable for sightseeing, the first is undoubtedly West Lake, with its famous "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" scenic spot, described as "mountains beyond mountains, towers beyond towers." The second is Xuanwu Lake, framed and highlighted by the magnificent Stone City and the towering Zhongshan Mountain, filled with lotus flowers. The third should be the Slender West Lake in Yangzhou, characterized by its "slenderness."

Poetic Relics

To digress: originally, Yangzhou's prosperity was famous throughout history. At one time, its flourishing might have surpassed the "Six Dynasties of Jinling." This can be seen from the city's construction. Yangzhou was one of the nine provinces. During the Zhou and Han dynasties, present-day Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, and other places were all under the jurisdiction of Yangzhou. Even during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, Yangzhou still governed eight counties, including Jiangdu, Ganquan, Yizheng, Gaoyou, Baoying, Taixing, and Dongtai. The flourishing relics of the past are described in detail by Li Aitang of the Qing Dynasty in his "Yangzhou Shufanglu," stating that "Yangzhou merchants became rich through trade, and almost every family had gardens and pavilions. During Emperor Gaozong's southern inspection tours, many additions and decorations were made, and there were also mountain people, men of letters, painters, and skilled craftsmen embellishing the place, reaching a peak of prosperity at that time." Therefore, it is no wonder that in the poems of past generations, there are phrases praising Yangzhou such as "ten thousand strings of cash around the waist, riding a crane to Yangzhou" and "three parts of the moonlight in the sky, two parts of the charm belong to Yangzhou." There are also descriptions of the abundance of flowers and plants in Yangzhou. Li Bai of the Tang Dynasty wrote the line "descending to Yangzhou in the third month of smoky flowers," and Zheng Fan of the Qing Dynasty wrote the line "planting flowers for ten li is considered farming." Today's scenery on the Slender West Lake further proves that Tang Dynasty's Du Mu's line "on the night of the twenty-fourth bridge with the bright moon, where does the jade maiden teach the flute?" It can be imagined that it is only a remnant of the glorious past.

Northern Belles

What is the scenery like on today's Slender West Lake? This reporter believes that the Slender West Lake is beautiful, tranquil, and has a hint of charm - like an elegant and graceful Northern belle.

Although, after the impact of the war, this "Northern belle" born in the ancient Guangling of Huaian has some signs of weariness on her face. Many places show signs of decline and desolation. But this refers to some man-made buildings. As for the natural lake scenery, like "the Rainbow Bridge," like "the overlapping green of ten thousand pines," like the eternally beautiful and clear lake water - it is still worth lingering for visitors.

The lake is located in the northern suburbs of the county seat, with a winding surface of five li, with many winding paths and varying widths. The widest point is about one li. Precisely because of the many winding paths, the flat boat rippling through it makes visitors feel the wonder of "the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there is no way, the willows are dark and the flowers are bright and there is another village." The scenic spots on the lake include Luyang Village, Little Jinshan, Xu Garden, Five Pavilion Bridge, Lianxing Temple, Xiong Garden (Revolutionary Martyr Neng Chengji Memorial Park), Changdi, the former site of the Twenty-Four Bridges, and at the end of the lake, the Pingshan Hall, which houses the Fifth Spring under Heaven and Ouyang Xiu's calligraphy.

Small Tour by Boat

This afternoon, the weather was clearing up after days of continuous rain. Because this reporter had been separated from the "Northern belle" for many years, I took the opportunity to take a tour to comfort myself and her as well. The Old North Gate was closed due to the situation. We came out of the Tianning Gate and had tea at the Xiangying Gallery Tea House on "Lower Street." This place is very elegant. The house is next to the water, outside the railing, green willows swaying into the shade. Facing these swaying green willows, the ancient city wall covers half of the blue sky. The yellow walls of Tianning Temple on the east end, and the archway full of classical flavor, and the tour boat wharf, reflect the scenery here, inspiring poetic and picturesque feelings.

A tour boat into the lake, from Xiangying Gallery to the Five Pavilion Bridge and back, was negotiated for only 1,500 yuan. After sitting on it, a hawker selling sweets, melon seeds, and peanuts stepped onto the bow to solicit business. I bought 1,000 yuan worth of his goods.

The tour boat passed through the "Questioning the Moon Bridge" and crossed Luyang Village. I almost did not recognize this village, which was so beautiful in the past. The luxuriant trees and secluded views that were once there are almost gone. The boatman said that they were all cut down during the war.

The tour boat approached "Quyuan." Here, the azure sky affixed a row of towering pine trees like silhouettes to the beautiful sky. Looking from afar as other returning tour boats slowly approached under the rows of pine trees, and hearing the murmuring music of the boat head stirring up in my ears, the boat left in silence, and the sky and earth were silent.

However, passing through the Great Rainbow Bridge, one thing made me feel lost. On the west bank of the lake, the weeping willows on the Changdi that used to make me drunk are gone. Although the four-corner pavilion on the waist of the embankment still exists, I always feel that it cannot save the established defect. On the south bank of the embankment, the building of Xiong Garden can be seen to be broken down from afar!

Boating in the Middle Stream

Arriving at Little Jinshan (the mountain in the middle of the lake), I took a brief tour and saw it for a week. Buildings such as the "Lakeside Thatched Cottage" seemed to have been repaired, maintaining a lot of scenery. Then I climbed to the "Wind Pavilion" on the top of the mountain, and looked out at the lake and mountains, taking in everything. The Five Pavilion Bridge and the White Pagoda, and the "Wind Pavilion" are in corner positions, surrounded by smoky trees in front, behind, left and right. The wind blows the trees, and occasionally, the wind sends up the laughter of the boatmen from the bottom of the mountain. My friends and I could feel the joy in our hearts showing on our faces!

Coming down the stone steps from the "Wind Pavilion" to the Fishing Terrace, we boarded the tour boat again. We did not go to Xu Garden and Lianxing Temple on the opposite bank for sightseeing. We ordered the boatman to hold the tour boat in the hole of the Five Pavilion Bridge. (Note: This bridge has five pavilions combined into one, taking advantage of the fact that there are thirteen holes around the bridge.) Gusts of hurricane flowed through the bridge holes. We were lying down, unconsciously talking about the sky. The boatman chimed in, talking about the vicissitudes of life. He said that after the war, their livelihoods went from "good" to "bad," a world of difference. At best, they are making only one-fifth of what they did before the war. That is, there were hundreds and thousands of tour boats on the Slender West Lake before the war, but now there are only thirty or forty. He also mentioned how prosperous the ship's situation was before the war, but now it is unbearable to look back.

Listening to the boatman eloquently talk about the vicissitudes of life, witnessing the scenery of the lake and the two or three tour boats coming and going in the heart of the lake, I thought that the Slender West Lake was indeed withered.

### A Scorched Earth View of Huadian

— Changchun Airmail Dispatch on the 15th, Guan Rongqin

Jilin is mountainous. After arriving, my vision was greatly narrowed by the dense peaks connecting each other. After staying on the banks of the Songhua River for several days, I wanted to go somewhere else - to see places blocked by dense peaks; but I never had the opportunity. In Yongji, I saw General Long Tianwu. He said he was going to several counties south of Yongji to see the garrison and comfort the people. I asked to go with him. He agreed. Besides me, the following people went with General Long: Yu Jun of Jilin Daily, Xu of the army, Zhao, the second battalion commander, and staff officer Yang Degang, totaling eight or nine people.

Early in the morning of July 1st, we set off from a small town south of Yongji along the highway. After about forty minutes, we arrived at Guanmashan Village. The car stopped abruptly. After Commander Wang of the local garrison invited us to eat "Guangdong porridge," General Long went to give a speech to the troops and meet with the local elders and gentry. In the major cities of Northeast China, such as Liaoyang, Panjin, and Changchun, I could still see more smiling faces, but in Guanmashan Village, it was rare to see them. After thanking and paying their respects to General Long, eight or nine elders expressed their painful emotions. They said that the Eighth Route Army treated them well when they stayed, but when they left, they took all the grain, leaving only one dou for a family of eight. Unable to make ends meet, many villagers had to eat bean cakes to fill their stomachs. Even the horses that used to eat bean cakes regularly now looked much thinner. There is a small school here, but there are no funds. Hunger has scattered the teachers. The one or two who have not left, in addition to teaching students, also work as school servants. Everyone's eyes are focused on coping with life, and naturally less attention is paid to the education of the future masters. Who is qualified to complain about them! After the National Army stationed here, the local area stabilized, but in some remote villages, there were still scattered bandits who came to "borrow" grain. Although the villagers had no grain to lend, they could not stand the harassment. "The National Army won't leave, will they?" They were afraid that once the National Army left, some misfortune would follow. General Long's reply to them was, "The National Army will not easily abandon a place once it has recovered it."

Guanmashan Village, which belongs to Yongji County, is an important defense point south of Yongji City. The surrounding peaks and highlands have National Army bunkers recently built, either square or round. After talking with the elders, General Long went to see the bunkers on the two highlands. After finishing, eating lunch, we continued to go to the southeast. The destination was Hengdaohezi, more than a hundred li away.

### Compatriots Kneeling to the National Army

If the road was good, the journey of more than a hundred li could be completed in two hours. But the road to Hengdaohezi was so bad, especially the last section, which had only been repaired for a few days. Going up and down, with many stones, and the road was very narrow. Even the "Little Iron Island," which had conquered the original forests of India and Myanmar, made the same strange noise as the Wild Crane car. It took us a full four or five hours to climb it.

Hengdaohezi is a town in Huadian County, and it is also a small plain in the mountains. On one street (perhaps saying it is a main road is more appropriate), there are about a hundred houses on both sides, seven or eight of which are mud-built houses. The National Army only appeared in this small town in mid-June. This time it was passing through. When the people saw the National Army, they were so happy that everyone jumped up. They insisted on stopping the soldiers, wanting to treat them to the tea and food they had brought to comfort them. For military reasons, the soldiers politely declined. They wiped away their joyful smiles and all knelt down to the National Army, crying and begging, until the National Army used some of their things, then they let the National Army leave.

The people here all asked General Long to give them a speech, but there was no relatively spacious place. The two-zhang-wide "road" was muddy, and it was impossible to stand. There was no way but to hold a "symposium" in a house, with about thirty gentry and townspeople participating. First, General Long explained the purpose of the trip, which was to see the troops and defenses, and to represent President Chiang in comforting the compatriots. Then, the elders expressed the suffering of the past fourteen years and the pain of the eight months before the National Army entered. The old man sitting next to me told me that the suffering they had endured in the past eight months was deeper than what they had suffered in the past fourteen years. There are many Korean residents here. During the puppet Manchukuo era, they formed neighborhood protection groups, planted rice paddies, and ate rice. Although their lives were not as comfortable as the Japanese, they were much more comfortable than the "Manchu" people. After the restoration, they had no choice but to return their land to its original owners - their Northeast compatriots. As a result, their lives naturally became a problem. In addition, with the propaganda of the Eighth Route Army (such as how free and happy North Korea was), many young Koreans joined the Eighth Route Army. Some volunteered, while others were forced to. The local compatriots call them "Korean Eighth Route Army," perhaps "Korean Communists" is more appropriate. They acted in concert with the Eighth Route Army, and they also inflicted various illegal actions on the local compatriots. When the Eighth Route Army retreated to the east bank of the Songhua River, fifty li away, hundreds of "Korean Communists" followed them. The townspeople hoped that the authorities would send the Koreans who did not leave back to their country as soon as possible. I knew long ago that there were many Koreans in Jilin, but hearing what their ancestors said was the first time I had heard it since I came to this place.

### Huadian - Scorched Black!

— Ghastly Pale!

On the morning of the 2nd, after General Long gave a speech to the troops and inspected the fortifications, we went to Huadian County. The vehicles mostly took the road that the insurgents (called "Big Army" here) originally took. It was very bumpy. It took us more than three hours to finally drag ourselves there.

Huadian County is a bit like Hengyang. Five thousand of the six or seven thousand houses were burned down. The southeastern district was originally the essence of the area, but now it is a scorched earth. Only a Korean church stands alone in the scorched black rubble, looking particularly ghastly pale. There are more than 10,000 disaster victims, with 9,700 registered. The relief association organized by local merchants, with the assistance of acting county magistrate Deng Shisong, launched an emergency relief effort. Each disaster victim received twenty catties of rice, and those who were almost naked also received some cloth. What to do about food more than ten days later? No one knows. It is still summer now, but in two months, it will snow. They all know that this is a serious problem, and they are frightened by this serious problem. "Please have special pity and special relief for the people of Huadian!" A group of homeless elders pleaded with General Long like this. General Long promised to convey their request to the provincial government, and told County Magistrate Deng: "If funding becomes a problem, you can borrow a portion from the military headquarters."

The Huadian compatriots will never forget the unfilial Korean residents who acted as accomplices for the enemy. The Youth Army, which was the first to garrison Huadian, had few troops. The Korean residents provided intelligence to the Eighth Route Army, which had already retreated dozens of miles away. The Eighth Route Army immediately gathered seven or eight thousand people to attack Huadian. The disparity in numbers was too great. After a bitter battle, the Youth Army defending the city was forced to retreat north, with more than a hundred dead and wounded and more than a hundred captured. After General Liu Zixue's troops under General Long's command arrived, the Eighth Route Army retreated back to the east bank of the Songhua River. The city of Huadian caught fire a few days before the Eighth Route Army retreated. The arsonists were the Eighth Route Army, and even more were the Korean residents. Anyone who wanted to put out the fire or move out a piece of clothing would be shot. The fire was like wildfire, burning for eight days. The National Army and the staff of the temporary county government extinguished the remaining flames after entering the city. The refugees told reporters: There were so many fires, and the flames were so fierce, if the National Army had come three hours later, the city of Huadian would probably have been reduced to ashes!

In addition to wood, Huadian can be said to lack everything in terms of building materials. You can't buy them even if you have money, let alone if you don't have money! The disaster victims hope that the government will set up banks, prosper the market, and provide loans to get out of the dead end. Originally, Huadian was a rich county. The central Hongsilazi, Laojinchang and other places have gold, oil, coal, and copper and other mineral products. Most of the gold mining areas are in the hands of underground armies that are in contact with the National Army, while the copper and coal mining areas are still occupied by the Eighth Route Army. If electricity is restored, the gold mines can produce five to ten catties of gold every day. Some elders suggested that if the government's relief funds are a problem, it can try to use "gold mines" to offset the relief funds. General Long hopes that the Huadian compatriots will strengthen their self-defense forces, implement joint security, joint responsibility, and joint defense, support the local government in its relief and construction work, and assist the local garrison, so that Huadian, a piece of scorched earth, can regenerate in a safe atmosphere.

### The Problem of Emergency Driving

Editor: On the 14th of July, I saw in the newspaper that an ambulance crashed into another ambulance. After this strange event, my two or three brothers discussed it with each other, and the result of the debate led to another problem. Suppose at the Mud City Bridge, this six-way intersection, three vehicles came at the same time: one is an ambulance, one is a fire truck, and the other is a red police car. May I ask, Mr. Editor, which vehicle should the traffic policeman in charge let go first? Rescuing the sick is important, putting out a fire is also an important matter, and catching a robber is also an important matter. Which of these three matters is the most important? Please give us a clear indication and guidance. (Liu Jinkun and Sun Jing, residents of the Eastern Ward, 3rd floor, Tilanqiao Police Hospital)

(Editor's note) In principle, the vehicle on the road with the green light should be allowed to pass first, and then the congestion situation of the remaining two roads should be considered. Those that are clear should be released first, and those that are congested should be released later, still based on the traffic police's traffic lights.

Discussion of Concentration Area for Street Vendors

Recently, I read announcement No. 12330 from the city police department, which lists the entire section of Cixi Road as a concentration area for street vendors. According to the regulations, the road surface of Cixi Road is only two-thirds of that of Zhongzheng North Second Road. All sidewalks are occupied by nearby lumber yards, auto repair shops, and spray paint shops, and pedestrians cannot walk on them. Only one-half of the area is available for the passage of people and vehicles. It must also include large trucks, cars, rickshaws, tricycles, electric trams, and pedestrian traffic, which is already tight. Now that it is designated as a concentration area for street vendors, the nearby residents will suffer greatly. I hereby raise an objection to the police department, hoping that it will reconsider. (Shi Chengbin, respectfully) July 20th

The Bullying Second Landlord

Editor: Since the victory, the population of Shanghai has increased sharply, resulting in a housing shortage. Black-hearted second landlords are taking advantage of the situation, demanding gold bars for renting houses. They are now ordering tenants in the houses they previously rented to move out. Although they say they are taking it back for their own use, they are secretly lining their pockets. It is extremely hateful! For example, at a certain three-story attic on Caishi Road where we have been living for a long time, the second landlord is a woman. First, she pressed us with a huge increase in rent, and finally threatened us with moving out. We replied that we would wait until we found another house. Seeing that her plan was unsuccessful, she often cursed at us, with the purpose of making it difficult for us to accept and forcing us to move. But we are salaried people, how can we find gold bars to rent a house elsewhere? In this dilemma, shouldn't the authorities, who are above the people, consider the legitimate right to housing of the common people? (Lin Le)

### The Whereabouts of a Warrior Unforgettable to the People of Yangzhou: Dong Mingde Rises Steadily, Studying in the U.S. After Leaving Yangzhou, Now Serves as Deputy Commander of the Air Force

Editor Sir:

Having read in the social services section of your esteemed newspaper on July 4th about Mr. Liu Zhonghe's inquiry regarding the recent situation of Lieutenant Colonel Dong Mingde, I, being quite familiar with Lieutenant Colonel Dong and having served in the Air Force for many years, now provide a brief account of his recent situation as follows: Lieutenant Colonel Dong currently serves as the Deputy Commander of the 3rd Route of the Air Force. In our nation's Air Force, promotions are not easy. There are not many Air Force personnel with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Therefore, considering the importance of his current position, one can see Lieutenant Colonel Dong's achievements in the War of Resistance, as well as his outstanding academic abilities. Since Lieutenant Colonel Dong's departure from Yangzhou, he has been inflicting relentless blows on the enemy in the vast skies of the motherland. During the defense of Greater Wuhan, he had already been promoted to the nationally renowned commander of the Zhikang (Resist-Japan) Brigade. Leading his brave and heroic warriors, he deployed their silver wings, safeguarding the motherland. They shot down enemy planes and wiped out the enemy. Soon after, they were again galloping in the skies, delivering even more ruthless blows to the enemy. The planes were poor, and supplies were not replenished, yet as long as there was one plane that could take off, they would face the enemy, regardless of their numbers, with bloodshot eyes, and fight to the end! Lieutenant Colonel Dong still maintains a record of shooting down many enemy planes. After leaving Yangzhou, Lieutenant Colonel Dong went to Wuhan, Liangshan, Lanzhou, Chongqing, and Chengdu. Every day, every moment was fighting, fighting, fighting!

He was injured, but he flew again. At one time, he went to take on training work. He went to Chengdu, training batches of air force students. At the same time, he was also training students who had already completed their studies on how to fight. At this time, when our air force students had to be sent abroad for training, he was ordered to lead a large group of students to the United States for training. After arriving in the United States, his talent and insight amazed and impressed the Americans he came into contact with, who all gave a thumbs up and said, "You are top-notch!"

In the azure skies of the United States, Chinese air force students were undergoing intense training. Batch after batch graduated and returned to the country to participate in the War of Resistance. The batch of students led by Lieutenant Colonel Dong, after a long period of training, was also about to return home. At this time, the government was ordering a batch of B-25 medium bombers from the United States, which were about to fly to China to join the war. Lieutenant Colonel Dong was ordered to fly a B-25 back to the motherland. They departed from Memphis, USA, and passed through Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Scotland, Northern Ireland, England, Morocco, Tunisia, Tripoli, Benghazi, Cairo, Iraq, Iran, to Karachi, India, and then back to the motherland, a total distance of over 10,000 miles, with a flight time of over 50 hours. However, due to weather and other reasons, the journey took about 40 days. Some of the places he passed through, such as northern Canada, Greenland, and Iceland, had never been visited by Chinese people before, let alone Chinese air force personnel. Although the people in these places knew the word "China," their understanding was very vague. After Lieutenant Colonel Dong and his party passed through, their understanding of China became more concrete, knowing that China was also flying the latest aircraft like the Americans and British, fighting against the invasion of neighboring countries. This had a greater impact on China and was more admirable than crossing the Atlantic or Pacific.

After returning from the United States, he held an important staff position in the Aviation Commission. Later, he entered the Air Force's highest institution, the Staff College. After graduating, he has held his current position until now.

This is a brief overview of Lieutenant Colonel Dong's situation after leaving Yangzhou. His efforts and achievements over these many years, I think, will not disappoint his Yangzhou compatriots who remember him, such as Mr. Liu! Finally, Lieutenant Colonel Dong has read Mr. Liu's communication. He is very grateful for the kindness of his Yangzhou compatriots and Mr. Liu, and asked me to express his thanks here. His mailing address is: Headquarters of the 3rd Route of the Air Force, Chongqing. I hereby wish you good health, and readers prosperity. July 15th, in Chongqing.

### The Art of Dunhuang

— Wu Zuoren

More than two thousand years ago, two streams of culture flourished parallel and uniquely in the East and West: one was Chinese culture, and the other was Greek culture. These two cultures could not converge and interact due to the barriers of East-West exchange. Although Alexander had great ambitions, he stopped at the southern foothills of the Himalayas and cried in despair before turning back (this was in the 43rd year of King Xian of Zhou). It was not until four or five hundred years later, when Indian Buddhism spread to China, that Greek culture was indirectly brought in by Buddhist art, which had already been influenced by Greece. Dunhuang art is the most remarkable work we can see today that combines these two cultures.

During the prosperous Han and Tang dynasties, Dunhuang was an important point of East-West communication. However, since the Ming Dynasty feared the invasion of Tibet, it closed the border at Jiayuguan and left Dunhuang to foreign lands. Although the Qing Dynasty restored its control during the Kangxi and Yongzheng periods, the ancient Silk Road of Yangguan was no longer used by merchants. The once prosperous Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang gradually became buried in sand and forgotten. It is only in recent years that we have rediscovered the Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang. This is not a restoration of religious sentiment, but an appreciation and exploration of art.

The mutual influence of Eastern and Western cultures is an undeniable fact. Scholars and experts from China and abroad have long been tracing their traces. Dunhuang art is not the work of one family or one generation, but the donations and skills of countless devout men and women, and the ingenious management of countless artists and workers, spanning more than 800 years from the Northern and Southern Dynasties to the late Yuan Dynasty. Since the Ming Dynasty, although it has been repeatedly destroyed, the temples have been razed and the statues have been destroyed. There are still 309 caves with murals, which can be considered the only surviving ancient Chinese painting academy in the world.

Dunhuang art has indeed suffered serious damage: the statues have been destroyed, and the murals that have been spared from natural or man-made destruction have also suffered from color fading and incomplete peeling. However, we can still see the different styles of each era, as well as the costumes and lifestyles of each era. In addition to the Jingtubianxiang (Pure Land Transformations) and other paintings in the middle part of the murals, which have an Indian style, the illustrations of stories in the scriptures and the portraits of patrons painted on the sides are all based on the system of the time in terms of people, objects, palaces, costumes, and customs. Many costumes and lifestyles that we now consider to be new and Europeanized, the Mogao Grottoes murals tell us that they already existed in China more than a thousand years ago. Standing in front of these many murals, we gained many unexpected inspirations, and we cannot help but be surprised. In some caves, if we have time, we can spend a whole day looking at them, and we can still make endless discoveries.

In terms of style, the Northern and Southern Dynasties were bold and dynamic, with dragons flying and horses galloping, possessing the power of thunder and wind. The figures are mostly flat and simply colored (ceiling of Cave 191). Lines are also used to outline, but the strokes are not fixed on the shape; nor are they as incomplete as the modern European New School style (the "Guardians" in Cave 143, etc.). As for the strength and liveliness of the lines, and the lightness and vividness of the figures, later generations would not dare to try easily (Bodhi in Cave 143, and the beautiful woman in "Sakyamuni's Ascetic Practice" in Cave 240).

The Tang style, on the other hand, reversed the rushing of the early period, gradually tidying up the costumes and entering the realm of grace and magnificence. It requires the shape of the body to be moderate in length and the color to be rich. The background also changes from simple to complex. There are towering buildings, pavilions, and terraces, all paying attention to exquisite perspective. Of course, in this kind of scenery, the performance of the characters must also try to gather all the beauty that human beings can have in one body. Therefore, the Bodhisattvas of the Tang Dynasty have plump breasts and slender waists, long eyebrows and beautiful eyes. Their lips are moist, their faces are full, their shoulders are broad, and their palms are soft. They wear tall hairpins and long hair. We regard it as an Indian style. But the idea that creates this style must originate from the "Hellenistic" style of the late Greek art. Even the dancers and musicians are beautiful enough to decorate the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss. The change in these two expressions can be compared to the transition of Greek art from the free and clumsy period to the heyday in style. In thought, it can be compared to the transition of Christian art from the medieval style to the Renaissance. The Tang Dynasty was the peak of Chinese art, and the peak cannot be reached in one leap. There must first be the strong and rough style of the Northern and Southern Dynasties to the Sui Dynasty, like the vitality of life, and the power that is reached and exerted seems to be insufficient to contain the universe. During the Five Dynasties, foreign tribes invaded, and the 回紇 even trapped Shazhou. The Song Dynasty restored its homeland, but in art, it continued the legacy of the previous dynasty. The art movement had already declined from its peak, so there was no new creation in the Song Dynasty. However, when the Western Xia occupied Shazhou, the paintings in the caves, the murals on both sides of the entrance of the caves are now eroded by the accumulated sand, and most of them are incomplete. Still, at the top, you can see the symbols of the "Zodiac" (Les Signes de Zodiaque). The "Zodiac" originated in Babylon and was added to by the Greeks with mythology. Chinese mythology has not heard of this legend, and it is even more incomprehensible to put it into paintings.

Only one of the Lama caves is relatively large (Cave 309), which was created in the Yuan Dynasty. In the center of the cave, there was originally a giant sculpture, which was an image of the 伐喇祭喇 embracing the 煞娣. Unfortunately, it was completely destroyed more than ten years ago. Today, one can still occasionally find fallen fingers and broken palms in the ruins, and the broken pieces still show the skill of weaving. The subject matter of the murals is similar to that of the sculptures, so they have been spared from misfortune. The style already belongs to the Tibetan painting system, which is influenced by the Ajanta murals of India through Nepalese art.

As for the statues, except for those in Cave 309, which were completely destroyed, the rest in each cave are not complete. Although their heads are broken and their limbs are torn, and only the torso remains (Caves 273, 274, 275, etc.), their divine workmanship cannot be obscured. What is even more astonishing is the knowledge of anatomy and the standard of proportion and dynamics of the sculptors of the Sui and Tang dynasties. The precision of their observation and the purity of their expression can be compared with the masters Phidias and Praxitele thousands of years before them, and the giants Donatello and Michelangelo thousands of years after them, shining together on the wisdom of mankind. Not only sculpture, but also painting of the same period. The "Lotus Boy" on the divine curtain of Cave 132, although the color is black due to age, the strokes are smooth and not chaotic. According to its dynamics, length, muscle plumpness, and undulations, it all conforms to the appearance of a child, and it is a masterpiece among the masterpieces of Dunhuang art.

As for decorative patterns, they are especially rich in variety. The caisson patterns on the top of each cave have their own unique designs. And the materials used, whether they are plants, animals, or wind belts, auspicious clouds, all have unexpected structures.

(Zuoren notes that the Mogao Grottoes originally had different numbering systems by Stein and Pelliot. The ones cited in this article were compiled by Zhang Daqian)

### On the Study of Western Painting

— Liu Shi

Written for friends who love "Western painting" and to answer the questions of beginners

To learn so-called "Western painting," you must start with sketching, and "sketching" must start with drawing, which is different from learning traditional Chinese painting. "Drawing" is divided into two types: one is drawing as the basis for learning to paint, and the other is drawing that is purely independent and has interesting sketches. The former is a necessary exercise during the learning period and must not be perfunctory. It can be called learning drawing. In other words, the quality of the drawing foundation determines its future success or failure. The latter has the same value as the revived gorgeous color painting, and has a kind of Qingya style, which can be developed to the interesting aspect as much as possible, and can also be called a writer's drawing.

The necessary stage for studying "Western painting" is painting plaster models. There are three reasons for this: First, the plaster model is a still body, which allows beginners to describe it calmly. Second, the color is white, the outline is clear, and the lines are clear. Third, the quality and color are simple and easy to distinguish. Third, when you can place the entire object (plaster model) on a piece of paper without feeling cramped and wasting paper with too much blank space, then you have entered the door and can continue to explore dynamic objects. The so-called dynamic objects, small such as insects and fish, and large such as people and scenery, all the images in nature can be taken into the painting, as long as your ability is sufficient and your foundation is good.

There are many materials for drawing. Charcoal, pencil, pen, and even brush can be used to make exquisite paintings. When you feel monotonous and weak, adding water color to the drawing is "watercolor", and adding oil color is "oil painting". This is the orthodox method and spirit of so-called "Western painting".

Regarding "watercolor", as mentioned above: whether it is watercolor or oil painting, you must have a solid drawing foundation, and watercolor is not as generally stipulated that watercolor is the second stage for beginners and oil painting is the third stage. In a word, watercolor and oil painting have their own characteristics, their own interests, and their own independent values. The characteristics of watercolor are bright, light, and suitable for outdoor sketching and still life sketches. The materials are simple and easy to carry, and it is especially suitable for primary and secondary schools as teaching materials. Since ancient times, there have been no amazing masterpieces of watercolor painting, and few people have become famous and made a career solely with watercolor.

Oil painting is the main material in "Western painting". Successful writers in both China and the West regard it as the main material for painters. It is more complicated than any other material, allowing the author to fully express his desire for expression. It is suitable for creating great works and can last for a long time. However, beginners often use dull colors, and the picture is prone to chaos. The reason is that they are not familiar with the nature of colors, do not know the weight, and do not understand the layers. To solve the above-mentioned difficulties, you must start by studying the nature of colors, and then you will naturally understand everything after gaining experience from failure.

In addition to a solid foundation, painting also requires studying how to "compose". When the author finds a beautiful object, the first thing he is anxious about is "how can I arrange it in the picture?" There are lines and lines that match, light and dark distribution, color and color contrast, objects and objects near and far... just like a musician conceiving a symphony. Therefore, before you start writing, you must carefully think about it, and you can strive for the expected effect after you have made up your mind. And the quality of the composition can be used to judge the height of the author's painting talent.

"Bang!" Lihua furiously picked up a teacup and smashed it over. Then she threw herself down and cried!

Zhang Xian didn't say anything more. But the fire of jealousy didn't go out. From then on, he regarded the girls' school as an object of sorrow and hatred. He was determined to retaliate against that "erudite" person. He stirred up trouble in front of Mrs. Mo. He falsely accused Shao Ling of having bad intentions, often enticing Lihua to the girls' school for secret meetings, and said that Liu Ziyun was the one who "pimped" for them.

Mrs. Mo didn't believe Zhang Xian's words. She knew that Lihua was a well-behaved child, and she could also see that Dong Shao Ling was not a bad person. But what surprised her was that Lihua had never taken the initiative to get close to anyone; especially men, she had always been afraid and disgusted; but only this time, Lihua actually welcomed Dong Shao Ling so warmly; and got so angry at Zhang Xian's impoliteness towards Dong Shao Ling. This was indeed something worth pondering! She thought that Lihua was already fifteen years old, and fifteen-year-old girls should be sensible. For the sake of Lihua's lifelong happiness; for the sake of her own unsatisfied desires; she had to guard against it. Therefore, she began to interfere with Lihua's actions; and forbade Lihua from going to the girls' school often; her reason was: she was afraid it would affect Lihua's reputation. Even Liu Ziyun, she didn't allow Lihua to get too close to her. Lihua understood that this situation was caused by Zhang Xian. On the surface, she didn't resist, but secretly she still often went to the girls' school, often talked about everything with Liu Ziyun (she no longer kept silent to Liu Ziyun), and often met with Dong Shao Ling. She was accepting the education of the two of them, she was learning to be a human being again, and her spirit had unconsciously begun to have a new transformation!

### Casual Discussions on Art

— Wen Zhaotong

The issue of popularizing art, in today's so-called people's century, is already undeniable. The question lies in how to achieve popularization effectively.

For art to be popularized, I believe at least the following premises must be met:

1.  Art's content must be the masses.
2.  Art must belong to the masses.
3.  Art must lead the masses.

The trend of democracy today is like a torrent that cannot be stopped. In such a flood, the reality of the masses' lives is the best content for artists. Of course, the lives of the masses have their bright and dark sides. The artist's sole task is to expose the bright side as much as possible, while relentlessly exposing the dark side, so that the masses can obtain a more reasonable and necessary life.

The sacred and heroic posture of laborers, the exploitation and oppression by capitalists – these, when expressed through art, belong to the masses. Artists should go deeper, like Gorky, to make a prophecy: "The storm! The storm is about to break out! ...Let the storm rage even more fiercely!" – "The Storm Petrel." Fully assuming the duty of leading the masses.

Here, we must not ignore that, in terms of form, we should choose what the masses are familiar with. For example, in painting, shading is not as good as symmetry and line drawing. This is a basic condition.

Many friends are worried that Chinese national art will decline and eventually disappear. Therefore, they are painstakingly trying to preserve it everywhere.

But: I first question, what is Chinese national art? Can brush painting represent it? But it is clear that before the invention of brush and paper, there should also have been a nation, and even more so, art. It can also prove that the development of art follows the development of production technology. Useless is the mere cry for preservation.

If China were to continue under small-scale handicraft production, brush painting would likely remain unchanged without any problems. However, the world is no longer so simple. We need to use "atomic energy" to change the current production under the conditions of nationalized enterprises. Therefore, Chinese national art will inevitably change. What will it be like? Although we can hardly have a definite answer, at least it is not what everyone wants to preserve as national art.

Perhaps, we are not yet forgetful. What is the development course of that treasure, "Western painting," in China?

Realistic art can be called realist art. Such works rely on the writer truly experiencing actual life, without allowing for affectation.

For example, if a painter has never been on the battlefield or walked into a rear-area wounded soldier hospital, yet insists on creating a large composition of wounded soldiers in his attic studio, the result will be merely a shell, lacking moving power. Regardless of color or brushwork... it feels like a single breath, lacking a unified effect of composition from beginning to end, just like a Chinese painting without vitality, only a feeling of rigidity, dullness, dryness, weakness…

Gorky, the great writer known as a realist, whether in his "My Universities," "Mother," or "My Childhood"... all his works come from experiences in real life. Our artists should learn from him.

Artists with dull senses still believe that modern times only require studying a little about the emotions of brush and ink, the colors of lines, expressing life from apples, and showing nobility from landscapes and trees. But you cannot ignore the great scenes of unemployment, hunger, plunder, death... placed before your eyes. Why are you unwilling to face them and express them? Perhaps it is because you dare not?

No, artists, because they demand the establishment of pure art, believe that if the content is too close to reality, it will not be "pure." But, in the history of Western art, are "1830," "The Stone Breakers," "The Glutton"... many famous paintings, considered pure art?

Because life is stable, the senses also become dull. In the vision of these artists, there are only apples, landscapes...

But, society is developing forward, how can art stagnate?

"Art for art's sake" is the slogan of artists who want to break away from reality. However, there is no place in the world that can completely separate from reality. If a person has such an idea, it shows selfishness and stinginess.

Artistic value and social value are one. True art cannot lack social value, and correct social value depends on excellent artistic value to be expressed. Only wanting to improve artistic value while looking down on social value results in lowering artistic value.

Therefore, "art for art's sake" means striving for the determination of the social value of artworks. Otherwise, at most, it is "technology for technology's sake."

### Zhong Shouzhi: The True Meaning of Art

I recall that when I was in school, I saw an article by Mr. Cai Yuanpei advocating aesthetic education instead of religion. At the time, it made a deep impression on me, and my current inclination towards art may not be unrelated to it. Over the past ten years, the world has been turned upside down by such an earth-shattering war; moral decline, religious decay, and the corruption of people's hearts have reached their extreme. Although the wise and virtuous people of society have earnestly and passionately appealed, they have failed to awaken the ignorant and correct anything. When morality is mentioned, it is dismissed as outdated; when religion is mentioned, it is denounced as superstition. If this continues, all discipline and customs will be completely lost. The organization of society will also be destroyed and become chaotic, and the people's suffering will deepen, truly leading to an irrecoverable situation.

We are not advocating old religions or old morality, but how can a country exist or a society be organized without a central idea to maintain the goal of unifying people's hearts? The reason for the confusion in modern society is that there is no yardstick to measure human behavior. Therefore, we must open up a smooth path in the torrent of the times, which everyone should follow, as a driving force to maintain society. This is the so-called new morality, and the foundation for building this new morality is aesthetic education. Why? Because beauty and goodness are connected, goodness is morality, and beauty is the foundation of goodness. With a foundation of beauty, there will be good behavior. The various ugly performances in society today are unbeautiful, which is also ungood. If they knew how to love beauty, they would surely hate these ugly behaviors and would not be ungood. Therefore, we believe that all education should aim at aesthetic education, to cultivate a group of students, develop excellent character, and move towards the great path of ultimate goodness, which may be able to save the declining social customs and strive for a world of great harmony.

Here, I want to put forward two points for discussion, which should be noted in aesthetic education: one is beauty of character, and the other is beauty of action. Beauty of character is internal, and beauty of action is external. Whether a person's nature is good or evil has various explanations and reasons, which can be put aside for now. But whether good or evil, we must always make it tend towards a more beautiful and good state. How to make it tend towards a more beautiful and good state? That requires the subtle and transformative influence of aesthetic education; being in a room of orchids for a long time without smelling their fragrance, orchids are beauty, and in this room, one can be transformed by them. If one does not enter this room, or if there are no orchids in this room, then there is no way to be beautified. Conversely, the same is true for ugliness. If we enter a fish market from a room of orchids, we will surely cover our noses and cannot stay for a day. Then, after receiving aesthetic education, we will surely not associate with the ugly society again. With beauty of character, there will be beauty of action, and beauty of action is the external expression of beauty of character, which is also goodness. Having been nurtured by beauty, we will use it as a standard for measuring things. Anything that is ungood is unbeautiful; conversely, anything that is unbeautiful is also ungood. If everyone is like this, society can move towards the great path of light.

But some people say that art is a luxury, a pleasure, and in today's economic collapse and lack of resources, when there is no time to save lives and seek survival, how can we talk about beauty and unbeauty? Others say, "Art is the enjoyment of the bourgeoisie, and the common people have no fortune to enjoy it." This is seeing the scope of beauty too narrowly. Beauty has several aspects: splendor and magnificence are beautiful, and a gentle breeze and bright moon are not without beauty. The painter's realm is not necessarily to express tall buildings, but in rural cottages; in the poor alleys, there are also the best beautiful scenes; beauty and unbeauty are not divided by wealth and poverty, but by goodness and love, which artists can best understand. Therefore, our promotion of art today is not to advocate for the bourgeoisie, but to promote the common people's enjoyment of beauty. Furthermore, the low level of living of the Chinese people is well known, and people often have no opportunity to appreciate beauty; most people are in dirty and ugly environments, how can their minds be improved? If the common people can have more enjoyment of art, such as art exhibitions, concerts, the opening of parks, the repair of avenues, and the construction of common people's mansions, so that life becomes more beautiful day by day, and the degree of appreciation gradually increases, I believe that sinful behaviors can also be reduced invisibly through subtle and transformative influence, wouldn't society be able to hope for progress, and how can art be seen as a luxury?

Therefore, we promote art, opening up a bright and splendid garden in this evil society, and in this garden, we will bear beautiful fruits. This is Mr. Cai's original ideal, and it is also our work today.

Special Issue on Production and Construction

### The "Love Chinese Goods" Campaign

— Xu Baiyi

Recently, Mr. Hu Boxiang, the general manager of the Family Industry Cooperative, initiated the "Love Chinese Goods Campaign," which has been enthusiastically supported by various parties. Mr. Hu is a famous painter and is usually very serious about everything. To avoid misunderstandings, he formulated the following two regulations for the "Love Chinese Goods Campaign":

1.  The "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" uses publicity methods to correct the mentality of glorifying the use of non-essential foreign goods. Other than publicity, no actions should interfere with or hinder the freedom of others.
2.  The "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" is not about boycotting foreign goods. When conducting publicity, attention should be paid to avoid confusion.

In addition, for the sake of consistency, the slogan "It is most glorious to use Chinese goods" was also formulated and a drawing was made so that manufacturers can use it in their publicity.

The "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" is indeed a key task at present. It is certainly closely related to saving the industrial crisis, but we must recognize that the "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" is not the only way to save industry. Therefore, when promoting it, there is no need to involve other major topics. Just follow the literal interpretation of the "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" and do it earnestly. When the time is right, the expected results can be achieved, because doing the "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" well can already have a significant impact.

In fact, the "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" should be promoted not only at present but also in normal times, because China's industry is still very young. Goods produced under young equipment must be loved by the public in order for industry to progress and goods to improve. The larger the scope of sales, the easier it is to start improving. I remember that Britain once had a "Buy British" movement to promote goods made in the country. Therefore, if everyone is patriotic, they should love the products of domestic factories and protect domestic industry.

The "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" is not a boycott or opposition to foreign goods movement, because there are many things that the country cannot manufacture, which need to be imported from abroad. Conversely, anything that is produced in the country and can be used does not need to glorify the purchase of foreign goods.

For the convenience of explanation, we can divide goods into Producer's Goods and Consumer's Goods. We currently need to import producer's goods from abroad, such as machinery, equipment, and necessary raw materials, etc. We do not need to import consumer's goods for the time being, such as various luxury goods.

Last year, the American "Reader's Digest" had an article entitled "The Vast World Gives America Opportunities." The American post-war plan was to help various industrially backward countries to industrialize, so America could export many producer's goods to these backward countries. When the time was right, these countries would have industrialized, and their people would be able to buy various consumer goods. This, of course, is always thinking about the overall business for America, but as long as the assisted countries strive for self-improvement, there is no harm.

However, in China after the victory, although some factories are ordering machinery, the market is filled with a large number of consumer goods, which Americans may consider unexpected (although in fact, due to labor strikes in the United States, the production of machinery has not yet reached the ideal level).

The current "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" is a movement to correct erroneous mentality. Mentality occupies a very important position in all modern constructions. In combat, a sound mentality is required, and in construction, a sound mentality is also required. In fact, the "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" is a basic work to cultivate self-esteem. We often hear Americans say "We Americans," and Britons say "We British," but it is not easy to hear Chinese say how we Chinese are.

We sincerely hope that the "Love Chinese Goods Campaign" can be a good starting point for all mental construction work.

### New Building Materials

— Guo Xin

Aluminum roofs, glass walls, cement nails

Science is invading every house and every home with great force. The US government's plan to build millions of new family homes in recent years has spurred the invention of countless new building materials and devices. Any invention that proves useful will be mass-produced.

Research work is proceeding at an unprecedented rate, new products are being planned, and old ones are being improved. There has been considerable progress in roofing, paneling, and insulation. Aluminum, in particular, now has many uses. Aluminum foil insulation panels are easy to install in various forms and are durable, with strong reflectivity to heat. Aluminum can be further processed with special glass fibers to increase insulation and steel to increase strength, to make exterior wall coverings. Aluminum awnings and blinds can reduce heat by 75%: one side is polished to reflect heat, and the other is covered with silk to block heat absorption. The ongoing experiment is to replace the stone and brick of building exterior walls with aluminum; aluminum arches, windows, and roofs are already common in new buildings.

Steel mills have produced structural steel specially designed for building one or two-family homes. Flat, corrugated steel sheets can be used for inexpensive roofs without painting. There is also an aluminum alloy with the same beautiful and durable properties, which is made of asphalt compounds, crushed stone powder, and mica under certain heat and pressure.

Molding is also widely used in the construction of new houses. Building bathrooms and kitchens, building entire floors, and combining floors and ceilings of the floor below are all done using molding methods. Cement nails made by molding have replaced old-fashioned iron nails.

Glass is also a very useful building material. Glass bricks can be used to build interior and exterior walls. A new type of glass brick can be used for insulation, which is made by bundling glass threads together. Glass made in this way can also be used for the walls of game rooms, so that sound does not transmit to the outside. New composites of asbestos and laminated wood are used to make iron plates, insulation boards, and partitions.

Electronic power and heat have reached new industrial standards in the construction of fully equipped houses. In a factory in the west, the work of inlaying wood panels is done using the power of high-frequency radio waves.

### The Invention of Plastics

— US News

"Glass handbags," "glass belts," "glass raincoats," "glass combs"... "glass" things are emerging in an endless stream. Do you know what the original name of these "glass" things is? It's called "Plastic," also known as "pliable material."

Plastic products are commonplace in the United States, but they still retain their mystery for most people. It is not a simple thing like cement, mud, or putty. It is a product of modern organic chemistry.

Plastic was first discovered in 1869 when chemist John Wesley Hyatt used nitric acid and camphor to make celluloid. This new mixture was initially used to make billiard balls that were previously made of ivory. Later, this substance became known to the world as "celluloid." It is still one of the most useful plastics. Its main disadvantage is its flammability. Therefore, a safer celluloid raw material was later invented, called cellulose acetate, which is used to produce a large number of non-flammable films today.

By 1930, several types of plastics had been invented, each with its own characteristics, which could be used for certain purposes. When the war began, plastics played many new roles. In every more complex piece of combat equipment, plastic played an important role. During the war, 85% of the products of the American plastic industry were absorbed by the military. Most of the remaining products were also more important necessities. Modern battleships use a thousand plastic items. Ordinary airplanes also have as many as 200.

Now that it is peacetime, plastic manufacturers have set peacetime manufacturing plans. They will use wartime experience to manufacture various peacetime civilian goods.

### Introduction to Business Administration

— Xu Baiyi

Raw Materials

An enterprise engaged in production, with a factory, equipment, and people, cannot lack raw materials, because without raw materials, it cannot make goods, go to the market or sell, and cannot obtain profits.

Regarding raw materials, it depends on the different situations of each enterprise. For example, a car manufacturing plant mostly does assembly work, purchasing the necessary items from various places and engaging in assembly.

Many large industries have their own sources of raw materials, such as the United States Steel Corporation, which not only has steel mills but also coal and iron mines, so that they can supply themselves with raw materials without having to ask others.

In ordinary manufacturing plants, various raw materials can be purchased according to actual needs, but in purchasing raw materials, the following principles must be considered:

First, the source of raw materials must be continuous and uninterrupted:

Raw materials are necessary for manufacturing goods. In order to keep production work continuous, the source of raw materials must not be sporadic. Therefore, there must be a precise budget. Of course, this is closely related to sales work. Therefore, before the goods are manufactured, the opinion of the sales department should be sought, approximately how much can be sold in a year. The sales department needs to study how many similar goods on the market can be sold.

If the supply of raw materials is interrupted, there will be a shortage of goods on the market, and at the same time, machines and workers will have to stop, causing the company to suffer great losses. But conversely, too much raw material cannot be stored, because too much and poor sales will become a phenomenon of supply exceeding demand, causing working capital to stagnate and turnover to be sluggish.

Second, the price of raw materials must be kept balanced and cannot increase suddenly:

Raw materials are one of the main conditions constituting the cost of goods. Therefore, in order to maintain the profit of the selling price of goods, the price of raw materials cannot increase suddenly. Although the selling price can be increased after the price of raw materials increases, repeated increases in the selling price of goods will inevitably reduce sales. Therefore, the following two phenomena are bound to occur:

A. Reduced sales and reduced profits: This is easy to explain. For example, 100 pieces can be sold each month, and a profit of 200 yuan can be obtained for each piece, totaling 20,000 yuan in profit. If sales are reduced by half, then profits will also be reduced by half. Not only that, but all of the company's expenses must be borne by 50 pieces of goods, so costs will increase, and even the superficial profit cannot be obtained.

B. Increased costs and reduced profits: Originally, the cost of manufacturing a piece of goods was 80 yuan, sold for 100 yuan, and a profit of 20 yuan could be obtained. But after the manufacturing cost increases, in case it is not appropriate to increase the selling price, then the profit will be reduced.

For the sale of goods, under normal circumstances, the selling price cannot be determined by the manufacturer and changed at any time, because there is often more than one type of goods on the market. If others sell each piece for 100 yuan, unless the quality of the goods is better, the only way is to reduce profits. The result of reducing profits can easily cause the company to lose money, even to the point of collapse.

### A Letter Received

— Shao Fu

Four gentlemen from the Business Bureau of the Central Bank sent me a letter regarding an appeal concerning "the unreasonable assignment of colleagues returning from the rear to their duties." A section of the letter stated:

President Pei, recognizing the hard work and suffering endured by our bank's colleagues during the eight years of the War of Resistance, decreed that all colleagues returning with the government should be retained at the head office and not be arbitrarily transferred elsewhere. He also issued a letter to all colleagues, offering considerable comfort and encouragement. The heads of various bureaus and departments of our bank also shared this sentiment and were able to follow President Pei's intentions. However, the Business Bureau, on the contrary...

If this is indeed the case, I have a few thoughts on the matter.

We have all personally experienced the hardships of the War of Resistance. During this era of great suffering, compatriots in the occupied areas, as long as they did not shamelessly serve the enemy or willingly betray our cause, also endured similar hardships. We should not harbor the special and privileged mentality of "I participated in the War of Resistance" or "I came from the rear," expecting special treatment. However, it is only right and reasonable that the authorities, out of consideration for the hardship of following the government, traveling and being displaced, enduring gunfire, hunger, and cold, should offer special comfort and encouragement to those who worked in the rear. The Central Bank can and should offer preferential treatment to colleagues returning from the rear.

However, the administrative procedures for hiring personnel in an organization or group have their own regulations. If necessary, and if it is reasonable and lawful to do so, they have the right to make any arrangements. We cannot resist orders based solely on the reason of "returning with the government." If it is unreasonable or unlawful, we can, of course, refuse and even file a complaint.

We sympathize greatly with the letter from the four gentlemen of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank. The reason for not publishing it is that the letter lacks more concrete facts.

### "Everyone Has a Newspaper to Read, Everyone Has a Book to Read."

— Cai Xu

Suggestion: Establish a Shanghai Culture City at the Racecourse

In the article "Opinions on the Municipal Library" in the July 14th "Free Talk" column, the author presented four points for improvement to the management authorities, roughly as follows: (1) Western books outnumber Chinese books, and new magazines are not visible. (2) The catalog boxes are all in Western languages. (3) Library services, such as borrowing books and the use of the elevator, are suspended on Sundays. (4) The staircase is not clean.

Libraries are places that supply people with spiritual nourishment. In China, where culture is underdeveloped, library facilities have always been rudimentary. Shanghai is known as a city of culture, but I wonder, when foreigners come to this "city of culture," where can they find a trace of cultural atmosphere besides the superficial prosperity and extravagance?

The existence of the Shanghai Municipal Library is of historical significance. The reporter had long wanted to understand the situation after its takeover, so after reading the article, I made a special visit.

When the reporter arrived, Director Zhou was personally writing a letter to this newspaper, preparing to provide answers. Upon seeing the reporter, he said with a smile, "You've come at just the right time. Please convey this on my behalf." He first stated that he would humbly accept external criticisms and actively make improvements. However, the first two points listed in the article were, in fact, misunderstandings. The number of Chinese books in the library is not only not less than that of Western books, but it exceeds them by more than two times. Currently, the library has 21,260 Western books and 97,178 Chinese books. Because they were in a chaotic state when taken over from the former British Public Works Department, it was difficult to organize them all at once. They are still working hard to compile them. The reason why Chinese cannot be found in the catalog boxes is precisely because the numbering work has not yet been completed. More than a dozen people are working hard to speed up the compilation. The first collection of catalogs will be completed by the middle of next month. Regarding the addition of new books, because of limited funding, it is really impossible to purchase them. There are currently about fifty types of the latest Chinese and Western magazines, which are regularly available for readers to read. The reason why they were not discovered is due to it being Sunday. The Municipal Library, due to a lack of staff, often cannot operate as usual on Sundays when shifts are rotated, thus affecting readers' ability to study. However, Director Zhou also understands the importance of libraries on holidays, so he has begun adjustments starting this week to ensure that readers are not hindered by Sundays. Director Zhou also stated that the elevator was not out of service because it was Sunday, but because the elevator had happened to be broken these days and had been out of service for many days. Director Zhou fully acknowledged the uncleanliness of the stairs and expressed regret. Because there is too much dust there, Director Zhou will order the workers to sweep twice a day and has already added more than a dozen spittoons.

Director Zhou then told the reporter that the library currently has a total of more than 30,000 readers, with an average of more than 1,000 people visiting the library every day, of which students account for 40%, the business community 40%, and civil servants, soldiers, etc., 20%. The most lacking books at present are Chinese novels, which are loved by almost two-thirds of the readers. Therefore, it is stipulated that only one Chinese novel can be borrowed at a time, and it must be returned within one week. The most difficult thing administratively at present is the lack of cooperation from readers. Often, many people borrow valuable books and do not return them. When the guarantor on their application is sought, it is discovered that it is completely fabricated. Therefore, the library must verify the guarantor before issuing a library card, which is indeed an arduous task. Some are in Xujiahui, Pudong, Yangshupu, etc., which takes a lot of time. At the same time, the readers' failure to observe public morals is also really heartbreaking for the library. Half of a batch of new magazines is stolen within a week, and it is commonplace to tear out photos and illustrations from books. This kind of behavior that harms others and is excessively selfish must be stopped by the readers!

Finally, Director Zhou said that according to his plan, Shanghai needs at least five public libraries, located in the east, west, north, and central districts. At present, the only ones are the main library on Si Ma Road and a branch library in Nanshi, which only has more than 10,000 books.

Director Zhou once had a large plan—to transform the city's racecourse into a cultural city, with stadiums, libraries, museums, etc. The funding could be raised by the government issuing public bonds. This plan was suggested to Mayor Qian half a year ago, but seeing the current housing shortage and the city government's financial constraints in Shanghai, the realization of the plan is truly far away!

But we are always longing for: everyone has a newspaper to read, everyone has a book to read!

### Trolleys Skipping Stops Makes It Hard on the Common Citizen

— Gao Minxin

Yesterday, I read in this publication that Shanghai trolleys are a drain on one's energy and time. It is necessary to propose corrections to the authorities to meet the purpose of being affordable, stable, and fast.

The red pillars in the middle section indicate a stop for passengers to get on and off. Other wheeled vehicles also have the intention of someone getting on and off, being careful to prevent injury. Sometimes, the trolley is not crowded, yet it does not stop at the stop, or it stops but the door does not open. With a "ding ding" sound, the trolley drives away, leaving those waiting for the trolley feeling greatly deceived. The elderly, women, and children carrying heavy items are left in the rain or sun, regardless. This also causes disorder in the second trolley. Because the trolley ahead does not let on several people, more and more people are waiting on the ground. The strong fear losing the opportunity on this trolley and desperately push their way on, regardless of the elderly and children. The more this happens, the more the ticket seller avoids trouble and does not want to stop or open the door.

For example, the number 3 trolley, westward on Fuzhou Road, eastward on Shanhaiguan Road or Datong Road often skips the stop number 19. I saw one that luckily stopped, a rare opportunity, and struggled to get on. On July 16th, I tried one last time. Starting at 6:18 PM, I waited at the Fuzhou Road intersection of Daxin Street for the number 3 trolley going west. Six trolleys, starting with the towing trolley number 148, passed by without stopping. The driver said that four trolleys had not stopped, but he ignored me. No matter if I raised my hand and shouted or risked standing in the way, he ignored me. Finally, as it was getting dark, I saw the trolley for Maigeng Road had also returned. It was already 7:28 PM, costing one hour and ten minutes of time, but all was in vain. I eventually went to the Nanjing Road stop. There were still twenty or thirty people waiting there, but the trolley was extremely spacious, and both the front and back were not full of seats.

I think those drivers and ticket sellers believe that passengers can walk a few more steps, but passengers think that the red pillars are definite stops, and they have already walked quite a bit from East Jiangxi Road.

This is just one example. The same situation occurs at many other stops. I hope that the old stops in the middle of the long distance can be corrected and restored, with the aim of benefiting the common people.

### Free Rides

— Chen Zhongji

"Time is money" is a saying that sounds even more relevant to city dwellers, but every day we can see many people walking on the streets. Isn't this a waste? Do these people not like to take the bus or save time? No, it is really because transportation is too inconvenient. Look, even the most ordinary trolley in Shanghai today is not easy to enjoy.

But on the other hand, aren't cars also weaving through the streets like a tapestry? Look! Inside an eight-cylinder sedan, besides the driver, there is only a petite mistress hiding in the corner of the car. Compared with the trolley, which is like a sardine can about to burst, isn't it a humorous satire? Why is it that on the one hand, some people have no car to ride, while on the other hand, some cars have no one to ride, or are not allowed to ride?

Let's take a look at the United States, the birthplace of the automobile. Cars are very common in the United States, with almost every family owning a car, but there are still many people who do not have the opportunity to own a car. What do they do? According to people who have lived in the United States for a long time, in the United States, as long as you see an empty car, you can ask the driver for a ride. At that time, the driver will never refuse the request. He will definitely give you a free ride. Especially every Saturday, the roads near schools are full of students. Upon seeing a privately owned car entering the city, they ask for a ride, and the car owners are very happy to accept it because it is fun to have a companion join them on a lonely journey. Moreover, Americans like to make friends.

Even the American military vehicles in Shanghai can be requested for a free ride. As long as the driver is not a White Russian or a Jew, and it is not a official vehicle marked for a specific unit, almost any vehicle will grant the request. The author himself has had four experiences.

But why is it not the same with Chinese-owned cars in Shanghai? Perhaps no one has ever asked the pot-bellied merchant sitting in a privately owned car for a free ride, but even if you have the courage to ask, in addition to a flat refusal, you will definitely be laughed at as crazy!

Cars come from America. When friends who own private cars examine whether every part of the car's mechanism comes from the United States, why don't they learn the good things from others?

### Psychological Technique

— Junjie Kan

The United States has always respected women and advocated "ladies first." Therefore, in theaters, one cannot impolitely ask them to remove their fashionable hats. So, the clever theater authorities came up with a solution by projecting the following words on a slide:

"In order to respect elderly women, all older ladies do not need to remove their hats."

As a result, all the women's hats in the theater were removed.

### Letter to My Deceased Wife, Fengjun (15)

— Zhou Shoujuan

Alas? In summary, during these nine years, you were always worried about the country and the family, expending your mental and physical energy, and finally you were worn out alive! I remember after you returned to Suzhou sick on the Lantern Festival, I tried my best to persuade you to let go of everything and enjoy life while you still could. Once you were a little healthier, I would accompany you to listen to storytelling, watch movies, and taste all the sugar foods and snacks in Guanqian Street and Xuanmiao Temple, using these small pleasures to compensate for the bitterness and hardship you had endured for nine years. You even smiled and agreed, saying we would definitely do that. At that time, I also promised you that I would definitely find another way out in the future and no longer engage in that sickening writing career, which made you worry about my health. So, both sides had no objections, and it seemed like we had signed a gentleman's agreement. Even though you were bedridden, I still let you manage the income and expenses. As soon as I got money, I would gather enough of it, tens or two hundred thousand, and hand it over to you, fearing that I gave you too little and you would run out of it all at once and start worrying again. I think you understood my painstaking efforts in your heart, right? During the few days when you miraculously recovered, I often asked you what you wanted to eat. You shook your head and replied, "I don't want to eat anything. This illness has already cost you a lot of medical expenses. I really feel bad. In short, is your financial ability enough?" I replied repeatedly, "Enough, enough, enough!" While busily showing you the ten or more tens of thousands of cash I had gotten that day from selling some jewelry. You asked where it came from? I lied and said it was remitted from the Shanghai newspaper. Only then did you smile slightly and say, "Then, I can rest assured." Alas! Feng, why did you always have to be so considerate of me? For your sake, I would be willing to ruin the family. But medicine was ineffective, gold was useless, and after all, it could not buy back your most precious life!
