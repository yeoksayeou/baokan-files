### Reorganization of the Communist Army and Stationing Issues to Reach Preliminary Conclusion Soon; Executive Yuan to be Reorganized According to Resolutions

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 4th] It is understood that regarding the future organization of the military, concerning the combined use of infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineering, transportation, and various types of armored vehicles, military experts have debated the structure. Some advocate for the unification of all arms, while others argue for maintaining the old system of military branches with a reorganized structure, leading to lengthy discussions. It is now learned that military authorities have decided that training for each military branch will temporarily remain as separate units. However, during combat, the various branches will be evenly distributed among the infantry divisions for joint operations.

This group will also be responsible for receiving all enemy tanks surrendered, with the intention of forming the backbone of China's future army.

Editorial

### Farmers' Day for Farmers to Voice Grievances

Yesterday was Farmers' Day. Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang made a special broadcast to farmers, expressing his respect and condolences for the great sacrifices and contributions of farmers to the country and the nation. He also hoped that all the people of the country would work hard on three things: (1) Supporting peace and unity to establish a national order; (2) Participating in rural self-government to realize the democracy of rural politics; (3) Reforming the rural economy to realize the democracy of the rural economy. Regarding the first point, Gu said: "After the victory of the War of Resistance, what the country needs is to build peace and unity. What is most likely to hinder our country's construction now is social unrest and national division. The manifestations of social unrest and national division are the disturbances of bandits everywhere and the separatist rule of military forces. Now, if we want to lead the country onto the path of peaceful nation-building, we must break the phenomenon of chaos and separatism that endangers the country. The recent Political Consultative Conference decided on a peaceful nation-building program, among which the most important principles are to follow the Three Principles of the People as the highest guiding principle for nation-building, and to unite all forces in the country under the leadership of Chairman Chiang to build a unified, free, and democratic new China. We hope that the nation's farmers will promote the realization of these principles." We bought Minister Gu's broadcast to the nation's farmers, deeply feeling the government's concern for the welfare of farmers. The establishment of Farmers' Day shows how much the government cares about the farmers. The establishment of Farmers' Day was due to the adoption of a resolution at the National Agricultural and Forestry Administrative Conference on March 22, 1941, to thank farmers for their contributions to the War of Resistance. Yesterday's Farmers' Day was the first holiday after the victory of the War of Resistance. We passed this holiday when spring returned to the earth and the sun shone on the world, and we couldn't help but feel many emotions.

China is mainly a country composed of farmers; farmers are the backbone of China's population. The reason why we were able to achieve victory in the eight-year long War of Resistance, although the reasons were not simple, was mainly due to the contribution of the farmers. Most of China's soldiers come from the countryside; the rural children prevented our source of soldiers from drying up, and ultimately enabled us to successfully complete our great patriotic war. This is well known. Thanks to the hard work of the farmers, we had no worries about food shortages during the arduous long-term war, allowing us to devote ourselves to the war effort. This is also well known. Apart from these two points, there is an even more important point that is not widely known. That is, during our long-term War of Resistance, the reason why our national economy was able to avoid collapse was mainly due to the countryside. China's rural economy supported our eight-year long War of Resistance. In addition to joining the army and farming, Chinese farmers also devoted themselves to other kinds of production. It was thanks to these kinds of production that the War of Resistance was able to be successfully completed. To give an example, under the wartime conditions of the Haikou blockade and transportation difficulties, farmers everywhere worked hard to manufacture local paper, so that newspapers, publishing, and even all cultural activities in the interior would not stop. These contributions to the War of Resistance were really too great. On the first Farmers' Day after the victory of the War of Resistance, we must first express our deep gratitude to our farmers.

However, Chinese farmers silently and indifferently work in their fields, in their villages. They themselves do not understand their contribution to the War of Resistance, nor do they understand our thanks. Everyone is like an unnamed hero, silently and diligently working. They are truly the life of our nation. We say to them, "Thank you for your contributions that made the War of Resistance successful." They do not understand, they do not care. In their simple words and heavy footsteps, they know what kind of life they are living. The elderly, after taking a puff of their pipe and drinking a sip of tea, will let out a sigh and say something like "These days are really hard!" Indeed, when celebrating Farmers' Day, we really should not forget the suffering of Chinese farmers. Only by finding ways to improve their actual lives a little can we live up to the profound meaning of the nation's designation of Farmers' Day.

Today, the suffering of Chinese farmers is too deep. The exploitation by landlords is well known. However, even worse than the exploitation by landlords are the government officials. Since the conversion of land tax to in-kind payment, the cruelty of the grain administration authorities towards farmers has been endless. In the highest authorities of the grain administration, there was originally no intention to make things difficult for farmers, but due to the layers of the grain administration system and the lawlessness of the lower officials, the victims were still the poor and helpless farmers, the farmers whom we want to thank on Farmers' Day. On the first Farmers' Day after the victory, we voice grievances for the farmers. First, we must ask the government to abolish the existing grain administration system and thoroughly investigate the crimes of grain administration officials who acted lawlessly and bullied the farmers and punish them severely.

In addition, the taxes and levies borne by farmers are too cumbersome. Not to mention the land tax, farmers have to pay taxes for carrying a few bamboo poles into the city, and they have to pay taxes for bringing some chickens and ducks into the city. Every move, everything has to be taxed. "Rural idiots" feel that the government's taxes and levies are cumbersome and almost everything is taken from the farmers. This is really an unwise thing for the government. When the National Revolution was carrying out the Northern Expedition, there was a slogan of "abolishing exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies." However, the current "exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies" are still exorbitant and miscellaneous. "Farmers' Day for farmers to voice grievances," we want to ask the government to abolish the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies imposed on farmers.

The above is presented. Our government is concerned about the welfare of farmers, and we deeply believe that it will be able to implement them one by one. Today, with the national promotion of the call for "industrialization," we are celebrating Farmers' Day at the beginning of the year, which is even more meaningful. Indeed, our future nation-building must move towards "industrialization," but we must not forget that agricultural production is the foundation of the nation. Our future nation-building is planned nation-building, and industry and agriculture must be given equal importance. Within the scope of agriculture, we must never forget that the primary task of the farmers' movement is the people's livelihood, and the basic principle of the people's livelihood is "those who till the land should own it." Now that everyone follows the Three Principles of the People as the highest principle of nation-building, we must ensure that those who till the land "have" their land. As for the improvement of agricultural affairs and the improvement of farmers' lives, we must avoid copying established methods and thinking that what works in foreign countries must also work in China. We must adapt foreign methods to the necessary conditions while taking into account objective facts. Only in this way can farmers truly receive practical benefits.

### Wei Daoming to Negotiate with the US for a Loan of 2 Billion US Dollars for Reconstruction and Industrial Development

[United Press, Washington, 4th] President Truman has asked Congress to approve the US loan of $3.75 billion to Britain. It is understood that this move may cause other countries to successively request the same loan, and countries may submit requests without waiting for Congress to pass it. It is expected that China will be at the forefront. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming has returned to Chongqing to report on his work, and has returned to his post. It is generally speculated that Ambassador Wei may have received instructions to start negotiating a large loan with the United States. The amount of the loan should be at least 2 billion US dollars. According to Chinese officials, if this loan is approved, it will be used for China's post-war reconstruction and the revitalization of industry and commerce, with emphasis on the modernization of existing industries and the development of other industries. China will try its best to rely on its own strength to seek reconstruction and industrialization, but due to limited financial resources, it will be difficult to bear this heavy burden if it wants to establish a solid foundation in politics, society and industry. Recently, President Truman announced that after the political situation in China stabilizes, the United States will give preferential consideration to the issue of loans to China. The attitude of the United States towards China can be seen from this.

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Former US Commercial Attaché to Shanghai, Ms. Smith, said in a speech at the New York Export Advertising Club that China is now transitioning from handicraft industry to technical training and scientific research, so as to win a solid position among the major countries in the world. This creates more opportunities for American goods and manufacturing methods. There are currently more than 1,000 Chinese technicians practicing in American industries, and tens of thousands of people are being trained in Chinese schools, all of whom are at the forefront of China's progress. China has a very high level of discernment for the art of advertising, and publications throughout China are also constantly increasing.

### US Aid to Reconstruction: Our Country's Shipbuilding Industry

The office has only six staff members, cooperating with the Hong Kong branch of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and is responsible for transshipping UNRRA supplies to China. The supplies are first unloaded in Hong Kong and then transported to Guangzhou by rail or other means, where the local branch of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration inspects and disposes of them. Recent relief supplies arriving in Hong Kong include freight cars purchased by UNRRA from the US Army and Navy. A batch of train locomotives is also en route, most of which will be shipped to Shanghai. In addition, three more ships are expected to arrive here soon.

### Jiangxi Province Transportation Reconstruction Project to Be Completed by Year-End; Restoration of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Take at Least Two Years

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 4th] The transportation reconstruction work in Jiangxi Province will not be fully completed until the end of this year due to insufficient labor and materials. In particular, bridge projects require more materials due to the thorough destruction, and a suitable supply method has not yet been found. Currently, the Nancheng-to-Linchuan section of the Fujian-Jiangxi Line has been opened to traffic, and the Linchuan-to-Nanchang section will be opened by the end of March. The Ningdu-to-Yingtan section of the Jiangxi-Zhejiang Line is operating normally. The Jiangxi-Hunan Line will soon resume its pre-war route, passing through Niuhang, Wanzai, and reaching Liuyang and Changsha in Hunan Province, connecting with the Sichuan-Hunan Line. However, the construction of various sections of this line within Jiangxi has not yet started and still follows the Jiehua-Long route into Hunan, operating normally. Water transportation is mostly difficult due to low water levels. Although small steamships operated by private individuals run between Xun and Ji'an-Ganzhou, the shallow water and high freight rates cause inconvenience for travelers. The recent surge in rice prices in Nanchang is due to various reasons, but transportation obstacles are also one of them.

[United Press International, Guangzhou, 4th] The slow pace of reconstruction in southeastern China is largely due to the difficulty of repairing the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. The Guangdong-Hankou Railway is 700 *li* long and is the only railway connecting coastal ports with the Chinese interior. According to engineers who have just completed the survey, it will take at least two years to restore the railway to its pre-war condition.

[Our Newspaper Report] According to a London broadcast on the 4th, US Representative Stettinius suggested at today's Security Council meeting that the Council should not take formal action on the Soviet Union's opposition to the stationing of British troops in Greece for the time being. At the same time, he requested that Britain, the Soviet Union, and Greece not take any further action on this matter. Greek representative Archimedes said that the stationing of British troops in Greece is purely an "internal matter" and hoped that the Security Council would not discuss the issue until the general election in Greece is held.

[United Press, London, 4th] The United Nations Security Council met today to reconsider the Greek dispute. It is expected that the Soviet Union and Britain will accuse each other of endangering world peace, which may cause a second conflict. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky had a direct debate with British Foreign Secretary Bevin last Friday. It is expected that Vyshinsky will demand the withdrawal of British troops from Greece. Most representatives believe that Vyshinsky has been patient so far, but today he may be straightforward and clearly state the Soviet government's position. Most representatives believe that the hope for a compromise in the Greek dispute is very slim.

[Reuters, Athens, 4th] The Greek left-wing party has requested the United Nations Security Council to send a special committee to Greece to investigate and prove that "democratic conditions do not exist and a white terror continues unabated."

[Reuters, London, 4th] The first part of the inaugural meeting of the UN General Assembly has entered its final week this week, aiming to complete its current task by February 9 or 10, the date of the extended meeting. The task of this session is only to complete the organization of the UN, except for the decision on the permanent seat of the UN and the election of judges of the International Court of Justice, which are all within the plan of this session. As for the establishment of the Trusteeship Council, it has also been decided not to be resolved in this meeting. The work of the General Assembly and committees this week will discuss the refugee problem. The question of whether the World Federation of Trade Unions can participate in the work of the UN organization has not yet been resolved.

[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd, United Press] The committee of eight members who recommended 42 square miles of Greenwich and Stamford, Connecticut as the permanent address for the United Nations organization has flown back to London. The survey report is expected to be submitted within three or four days.

### Japan No Longer Mysterious: The Inside Story Fully Exposed

[Reuters, Tokyo, 4th] Japan, once the most mysterious country in the world, has now become an "open book" for the Blue Army officers. The US Army Department of Intelligence has collected more than 1,500 kinds of documents about Japan. When the Allied forces landed, technical intelligence personnel first inspected Japanese arsenals. Later, the Army and Navy intelligence groups and scientists also went out to search. The following are some important gains of military intelligence personnel: Japan's attack submarines and aerial torpedoes were invented based on the principle of gliding. However, Japan abandoned the work of aerial torpedoes in 1944 due to the lack of necessary gyroscopes. In 1944, Japan obtained basic plans from Germany for manufacturing rigid carbon aircraft and rocket engine fuel, and immediately set up factories to manufacture them. However, due to the lack of technical personnel and raw materials, and all work records were destroyed when the Allied forces bombed Tokyo, the work was suspended indefinitely. Japanese morale was still very strong at the end of the war, because the Japanese people did not know how the war situation had changed in the late stages of the war. However, due to the lack of unified benefits for the victory goal, it inevitably gradually became a divided situation. Other aspects of Japan, such as political parties, shrines, synthetic rubber, suicide tactics, the black market, broadcasting, and whaling, have all been discovered by US intelligence personnel.

### Egyptian Government and People Firmly Demand: Complete Withdrawal of British Troops; Rift Between King Farouk and British Ambassador Deepens; Egyptian Nationalist Party Opposes British-Egyptian Treaty Negotiations

[Reuters, London, 4th] Britain's response to Egypt's note requesting the withdrawal of British troops has delayed the outbreak of political unrest in Egypt, and the conflict of interests between Britain and Egypt is not likely to become sharp soon. When the Egyptian government first made the specific request for the complete withdrawal of British troops, the crisis was expected to occur when British Ambassador to Egypt, Lord Killearn, presented his response. Egypt's political situation will not allow any government to continue to exist or maintain good order for long, unless the government can make strong demands for the withdrawal of British troops. Any government that fails to make efforts in this regard will inevitably be attacked by public opinion and will be difficult to win the favor of King Farouk. It is said that the King instructed the cabinet to make a request for the withdrawal of troops. The 26-year-old King Farouk has become an important figure in Egyptian politics, and his position seems to be above the cabinet. At the same time, the rift between the King and the British ambassador seems to be gradually expanding. It is said that the relationship between the King and the British ambassador has been tense since February 19. Since the King dismissed former Prime Minister Nahas, the relationship between the King and the Wafd Party has been separated. King Farouk is now trying to win the support of the people to fight against the leader of the Wafd Party, who, under pressure from the people, not only hopes to regain power but also advocates deeper social reforms. Therefore, if the King is too stubborn, he will inevitably become his target of attack. If the current Nokrashy government is not satisfactory, the King often tries to avoid endangering his own position. In short, the national ideology in Egypt is already very strong, and public opinion advocates the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and the merger with Sudan. Although this British reply can delay the crisis for a while, it will eventually be difficult for the Egyptians to be satisfied.

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 3rd] The leader of the Egyptian Nationalist Party and former Prime Minister Nahas declared today: Any agreement signed by Britain and the current Egyptian government cannot be recognized by the Nationalist Party. Since our country was not invited to participate in the signing of the Italian agreement, it is difficult to make demands for the recovery of lost land, and this matter is even more unacceptable to us. In addition, according to sources who know the situation, another batch of British troops has landed in Alexandria, and it is expected that other troops will continue to arrive in the shortest time.

### Stalin Cables Iranian Prime Minister, Hopes to Enhance Friendship Between the Two Countries, Iran Receives Notification to Prepare for Direct Negotiations

[United Press Black Hill, 4th] Marshal Stalin cabled the new Iranian Prime Minister Saddan today, hoping that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Iran will be enhanced. In his telegram to Prime Minister Saddan, Mr. Stalin said, "I deeply appreciate Your Excellency's friendly sentiments towards the Soviet Union. I hope that during your tenure, the friendly relations between our two countries will be strengthened and promote the happiness of both sides." British Prime Minister Attlee also sent a reply telegram to the new Iranian Prime Minister of Iran.

[Reuters Tehran, 4th] Iranian newspapers today reported that the Soviet government has notified Iranian Prime Minister Saddan that the Soviet government is prepared to receive an Iranian mission to engage in direct negotiations in Moscow regarding the Azerbaijan incident.

[United News Agency London, 3rd] Preliminary negotiations on the Iranian issue have begun in London. Former Iranian Prime Minister Suhaili, who accompanied the Iranian delegation to the UN General Assembly, met with Soviet Chief Representative Vishinsky once, but it was largely just a matter of exchanging pleasantries.

[Reuters London, 4th] "The Observer" commented that the United Nations Security Council has decided to hand over the Iran-Soviet dispute to the countries directly concerned for direct negotiations. The Soviet government should not want these negotiations to fail again. The Soviet Union's needs should be mainly moderate, so as to be acceptable to the majority of the Iranian people. It would be especially appropriate to provide Iran with some of the materials it needs. The Soviet Union's most important need should be the concession of oil exploration rights in northern Iran, followed by the establishment of a Soviet-style regime in Azerbaijan, equivalent to the independence of a province. Because the Soviet Union's Baku oil fields and pipelines are close to the area, Moscow hopes to use Azerbaijan as a barrier. The next most important thing is to reorganize the central government to make it a centralized and more progressive government, preferably similar to the governments of Romania and Bulgaria. Some British people say that the expansion of Soviet influence in northern Iran is a failure of British diplomacy, but this is not the case. Although the Soviet Union has obtained oil exploitation rights in northern Iran and promoted the interests of local and proletariat, Britain can still launch agricultural and social welfare affairs in southern Iran to counter it. Britain's position in the entire Middle East is actually similar to this. Syria, Lebanon, and even Iraq all hope that the British will withdraw. Britain has been in the Middle East for nearly sixty years, but it has indeed lacked significant achievements in social welfare. It is not too late to take remedial measures now.

### Fighting Still Occurs in Various Places, Situation in Dutch East Indies Not Clear, Formal Negotiations Unlikely to Begin This Week, Dutch People Demonstrate Demanding No Use of Force

### Japanese Yasukuni Shrine Changed to Amusement Park

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 3rd United Press] The Yasukuni Shrine, formerly used for propaganda by Japanese warlords, plans to "democratize greatly" today and install amusement park facilities. Priest Ikeda of the shrine said that in view of the sharp decline in tax revenue, the shrine will set up rotating playing machines, ice skating rinks, table tennis rights, and other game facilities in order to maintain its livelihood. The shrine contains the divine souls of 300,000 Japanese war dead, but after the end of the war, the number of incense offerings has become increasingly rare, which is indeed a psychological reflection of the people's defeat. Ikeda went on to explain that this amusement park move is based on the legend of the shrine, which is a place for both gods and people to enjoy themselves.

### Safeguarding Schools and Protecting Teachers, Director Gu of the Bureau of Education Issues a Statement

[This City News] Recently, after the end of the semester, private schools in the city are experiencing personnel disputes due to the dismissal of teachers or facing criticism from parents due to the announcement of closures, such as Zijiang and Shenjiang schools, which have filed complaints with the city's education authorities. Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, issued the following statement on this matter: (1) The purpose of running schools is to cultivate talents for the country. Donating money to establish schools is originally a public welfare undertaking for society. Now that victory has arrived, education is a necessary task to be promoted. All levels of schools are only allowed to increase, not decrease. If private schools have financial difficulties, in addition to asking the board of directors for subsidies, they can use legal means to raise funds from all walks of life. If there is still no way, they can request relief from the administrative authorities. They are absolutely not allowed to close down voluntarily, causing children to lose their schooling. (2) Teachers and staff should be protected in accordance with the law. The Ministry of Education has long had clear regulations on this method, and this bureau will naturally follow it. For the sake of improving teaching efficiency, school authorities should not lightly change the originally appointed teachers unless there is sufficient reason, so as to avoid causing disputes. The above two points have been ordered to all private schools in the city to strictly comply with.

### Trial of Japanese War Criminals, Two Different Perspectives

The U.S. War Criminals Tribunal held its third trial at 10:00 am yesterday at the U.S. Military Tribunal in Tilanqiao Prison, trying 18 Japanese war criminals who killed three U.S. pilots in Hankou. Presiding Officer General Middleton, four colonels as jurors, and plaintiff's defense lawyer Lieutenant Colonel Weiss, defendant's lawyer Lieutenant Colonel Kiggins, and other responsible personnel, all arrived on time. The 18 Japanese war criminals sat in the dock, listening to the U.S. Army captain translator explaining the various debates to them in Japanese. The opinions of the judges were somewhat different at the second hearing on the first day of the month, which led to fierce debates at the second trial. At the third hearing yesterday, after two hours of verbal battle, the opinions of the parties were slightly unified. The main dispute was that everyone had different views on the case, and there were also slight differences in opinions on the disposition of the 18 prisoners of war. General Middleton advocated that "equal treatment" should be given to each war criminal and a "fair trial" should be given to each war criminal. Lieutenant Colonel Weiss explained: "Our hatred for Japanese war criminals has reached its peak today. During the war, the Japanese forcibly imposed charges on U.S. pilots and put them to death with illegal trials. In the trial courts of these pilots, the Japanese did not give them defense lawyers, and they had no opportunity to defend themselves. Therefore, the treatment that the Japanese are receiving today is really a privilege that war criminals could not have dreamed of." The charges against the 18 war criminals still need to be discussed for some time before they can be determined, and the court has scheduled a retrial at 9:00 am on the 11th.

### Anniversary of the Youth Army's Enlistment, Viewing the Brave Army Under Inspection

—Jie

A year ago, under the call of our wise leader, knowledgeable youths from all over the country rose up and abandoned their pens to join the army. In less than three months, they exceeded the predetermined goal of 100,000. At that time, the Anti-Japanese War was at its most difficult stage. They were determined to sacrifice for the country and were receiving the strictest training in the rear, preparing to fight the enemy to the death. Who knew that the enemy would surrender completely on the day the army set out, which made this "brave army" of the new China fail to fulfill its long-cherished wish.

Yesterday was the anniversary of the "brave army's" enlistment. The 207th Division of the Youth Expeditionary Force held a grand military parade in Zhongzheng Park at the end of North Sichuan Road to commemorate it. Before 1:00 pm, all the officers and soldiers of the division, fully armed and full of energy, were lined up waiting for the inspection. About several thousand citizens came to visit, including farmers who had rushed from Jiangwan.

The military parade ceremony began at 1:20 pm. First, Qian Dajun, Mayor, Wu Shaochu, Chairman of the Committee, He Dekui, Deputy Mayor, Li Jilan, Deputy Commander, Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, and Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, accompanied by Liao Yaoxiang, Commander of the New Sixth Army, and Luo Youlun, Commander of the 207th Division of the Youth Army, inspected the week to the sound of military music, and then boarded the parade platform. When the marching column passed by the parade platform, everyone who visited could not help but give warm applause. Indeed, the steps were too neat, and everyone had a healthy physique, everything symbolized the bright future of the new China.

After the inspection, Mayor Qian delivered a training speech, saying, "Last year, on March 20th, the Japanese Zeng followed the Chairman to fly from Chongqing to Kunming, and inspected you once at Beijiaochang. At that time, the Chairman was very concerned about your living and training conditions. As for the Youth Army, it was produced in the autumn of the year before last, when the enemy was frantically attacking. The Chairman felt that the quality of the national revolution was not good enough, and the training was not enough, so he launched 100,000 youths to join the army, and compiled the knowledgeable youths of the whole country into ten divisions. All the equipment and supplies were improved as much as possible, and strict training was given, so that they would become a living force with a quality higher than everything else, to destroy the enemy. In August last year, the Anti-Japanese War was victorious, and I am very happy to meet the soldiers of the 207th Division again today. In the future, under the premise that national construction must first build the army, your responsibilities are heavy, and I deeply hope that every soldier will not live up to the Chairman's earnest teachings, pay attention to the future, strictly abide by discipline, and exercise their physique, so that everyone can become a cadre of the army."

Then, Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Liao Yaoxiang, Commander of the New Sixth Army, Luo Youlun, Commander of the 207th Division, and others gave speeches, with many encouraging words. The ceremony ended at 2:45 pm, but the visiting citizens surrounded the "brave army" and were unwilling to leave. Finally, they temporarily launched a few comrades to perform a set of bayonet techniques, which won the applause of the audience.

### Local City Discovers Meningitis: 23 Patients Already

Since the beginning of winter in this city, the climate has been warm and the weather has been abnormal, resulting in the successive outbreaks of smallpox and diphtheria. Recently, hospitals have reported that there have been as many as 23 cases of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis. The Health Bureau is actively promoting prevention work in the hope of controlling the spread. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention to cleanliness, avoid public entertainment venues, wear masks, and regularly use gargling water to wash their throats. Meningitis is mostly contracted through the nose or tonsils in the throat. The disease is most prevalent in spring and winter, and children are easily infected. The incubation period is approximately one to four days. Patients suddenly experience chills and shivering, followed by high fever, headache, vomiting, stiff neck, and red rashes on the body. If the neck of the patient is bent by hand, the knees will automatically flex towards the back. These are all helpful in early clinical diagnosis. If such symptoms occur, the patient should be sent to an infectious disease hospital for treatment for safety.

### Retrial of Yang Xiguang

People Arriving in Court to Provide Statements

[Report from this newspaper] Yang Xiguang, a Shandong native, was formerly the chief of the Culture Section of the Special High Section of the Tongfu Road Police Bureau under the puppet regime, and is suspected of arresting our underground workers. After the victory, someone reported him, and Yang was arrested and transferred to the court. The case has been tried repeatedly. The defendant claimed that he had rescued and released our arrested underground worker, Han Zhennong. Han had a radio station in Shanghai, responsible for air force intelligence liaison work, and continued to operate after his release, providing information. Han's wife, Zhu Qisun, testified to this in court. The court ordered that Han himself, who is in Chongqing, must come to court to testify in person. Han's wife quickly sent a letter urging him to come to Shanghai. Therefore, when Judge Liu Yugui opened the court at 10:30 AM yesterday, Han personally arrived in court and described the details of what happened, saying that he is now the Deputy Captain of the Air Force Supervision Corps. After being arrested in Shanghai in February 1945, he was indeed rescued by Yang Xiguang, and he did indeed provide me with information afterward. The defendant applied for bail, and the court ordered him to submit a petition, pending a decision by the collegiate bench. The case was adjourned for retrial, and the defendant was returned to custody.

Two cases of traitors will be pronounced this afternoon, namely: (1) Wu Yimin, a secret agent of the enemy's Shanghai East Gendarmerie, and (2) Xu Xing, a member of the Xin Zhuang puppet inspection station.

### Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association Agrees to Raise Dyeing Prices by 20-30%

[Report from this newspaper] There are dozens of factories in the dyeing and finishing group of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association. The prices for dyeing and finishing for customers have long been set in a public schedule that is jointly observed. The association has also appointed a standing committee to adjust the schedule from time to time and notify members. The "red schedule" (premium rates) has also been determined, reportedly adding 20-30% to the old prices. According to sources in the association, coal prices have been rising recently, and the market prices of dyes are also trending upward. Although De Fu Yanghang (a German trading company) has been allocated some dyes after being cleared by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, the amount is extremely small and the prices are also high, which is invisibly contributing to the rise in dyeing prices. The association held a meeting yesterday to discuss requesting De Fu Yanghang to quickly sell the second batch of goods to be allocated at fair prices to prevent dyeing prices from continuing to rise. The following is a summary of the red schedule dyeing prices (from Grade A mercerized Shilin to Grade B light-colored standard cloth, all are based on 12 pounds and 40 yards of cloth per piece. From Grade A mercerized white silk, to handkerchief cloth, 12 pounds and 30 yards of cloth are used as the standard. Yellow-gray rainproof cloth is calculated as 12 pounds and 40 yards. The dyeing price of each two-grade product is calculated at 90% of the original price). Exchange rates are also very strong. Because the exchange rate of Singapore dollars to Hong Kong dollars is higher than the exchange rate of Singapore dollars to national currency, most overseas Chinese are remitting funds from Singapore to Hong Kong, and then converting them into national currency and bringing them back to the country.

### Economic Briefs

United Press, New York, 4th.  Dingke, Secretary of the American Paper and Pulp Association, announced today that the American paper industry is rapidly increasing production. Based on current production levels, paper and paperboard production this year is expected to be one million tons higher than last year.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs originally planned to establish a Bureau of Commerce, to take over the Trade Commission and the Fuxing Corporation, with Li Gan as the director. However, Li is unwilling to take this position, and the establishment of the Bureau of Commerce has been delayed. The hundreds of staff members of the current Production Bureau and Trade Commission are waiting for the transfer and dare not leave their jobs.

Previous reports that the Singapore authorities have imposed restrictions on imported goods are inconsistent with the facts, because the authorities are only restricting certain special goods, while ordinary goods are not restricted. Moreover, after the restoration of Singapore, in order to restore a prosperous market, there is no reason to restrict the import of ordinary goods. Therefore, there are more people recently purchasing goods in Hong Kong in preparation for shipping them to Singapore.

It has been decided that the right to navigate China's coast will be reserved for domestic operations. In order to facilitate the current commercial transportation between various countries and China, it has been decided that foreign merchant ships that have signed reciprocal treaties with China will be allowed to enter Chinese ports that already have customs and are open to foreign trade. As for foreign merchant ships in Hong Kong wishing to sail to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen and other coastal areas, they must also apply to the Chinese Ministry of Communications or the Director of the Guangzhou Office for a permit.

[Report from this newspaper] During the occupation period, the capital of various companies was forcibly converted into puppet currency, and many of them increased their capital with puppet currency. How to convert this into legal currency now is quite a problem. A certain agency has sent an inquiry to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and it is said that a reply has been received with instructions. The measures will be announced soon.

### Talking About Gambling During the New Year

— Zhu Junyi

The "official" New Year has passed, and now it is the "people's" New Year.

The "official" Gregorian New Year has never been able to find any new atmosphere. All there is: hanging national flags, the official New Year's worship of the various agencies, newspapers publishing special issues, a day off, and nothing else. The "people's" Lunar New Year is very different. As the saying goes, "Firecrackers get rid of the old, and peach charms renew every household." Everyone uses all their energy to spend this few days of the annual holiday. In my hometown of Western Zhejiang, there are two folk sayings to describe the New Year: "Eat until you burst, gamble until you are happy." It can be seen that the two major events listed in the Lunar New Year are only "eating" and "gambling."

In the past few days, everyone has been busy with the work of eating. The Nanhuo stores (stores selling dried and preserved goods) are crowded all day long with people buying New Year goods. However, the weather is not cooperating this year. The climate is very warm. If you prepare too much, you may not be able to enjoy it yourself, so I will put aside "eating" and talk about "gambling."

In the past, during the Lunar New Year, the government usually took an open-eyed and closed-eyed attitude toward gambling among the people and did not interfere. As a result, those who did not gamble much usually joined in the fun during the New Year when there was nothing to do. Those who liked to gamble were even more eager to gamble wildly during this period. The rich naturally wanted to gamble, and the poor had to scrape together some gambling money to try their luck. Adults were gambling, and the children had New Year's money on them, so they squeezed in the middle to join in the hustle and bustle. Not only were families closing their doors tightly, immersed in dominoes and dice, with the sounds of "pi pi pai" and "ca lang lang" coming from the east and west. There were also various gambling stalls on the streets, attracting the lower classes. This was simply a gambling world.

During the enemy and puppet era, there were even gambling dens. At that time, I don't know how many people indulged in them and became bankrupt. Countless bums, transformed from gamblers, were added to the streets out of thin air. I remember that the young owner of a famous tea shop in this city lost a head office and thirteen branches in a gambling den overnight. Such a wild gamble would make the people of even the world-famous gambling country of Australia listen and have to admit defeat and sigh "at least."

Recently, local authorities have implemented the New Life Movement and severely banned gambling. It is said that in Hangzhou, after arresting gamblers, they were fined and paraded around the city with mahjong tables to show the public. This method is quite new and interesting. This Lunar New Year, the police in this city can abolish "slapping hands" and imitate this method, arresting dozens of gamblers for a group parade, which is much more interesting than dropping dragon lanterns.

In short, gambling is never a good thing. To put it in official terms, it "wastes manpower and money" and should be completely banned. However, one point must be paid attention to, that is, the gambling of peddlers and hawkers must be banned, but the gambling of high officials, nobles, and wealthy merchants hiding in foreign houses must be even more banned.

### Worries and Desires

— Hua Mei

For thousands of years, the human race, using its unique intelligence that surpasses the universe, has gradually created a brilliant and dazzling new world for itself - a modern society that is extremely civilized and gorgeous.

But what great work is it? It is the endless stream of various infinite desires that will never stop growing from the sea of human desires that has pushed it to completion! Millions of people will answer this unanimously. This is truly an immortal statement! Because without desire, humanity would have no progress! However, the most uncomfortable "worries" (including wars and all man-made disasters, as well as all unhappiness and misfortune caused by humans) that the entire human race has ever discovered have arisen from this. In other words, although they enjoy the blessings of civilization because of their own labor, they also suffer from an equal degree of worries and constantly entangled pain.

In order to satisfy their various desires, countless unavoidable conflicts of interest arose. These conflicts gradually evolved to the point of white heat, and eventually they argued with each other, verbally abused each other, and fought. As a result, both sides suffered unexpected obstacles to their beautiful ideals, and experienced acute unhappiness. Worries arose in that instant. The above is the origin of worries.

Based on the above theory, modern clear-headed philosophers have opened up a new "law" - the rise and fall of worries and desires are directly proportional.

If we interpret this new law with simple mathematical theory, we can get the following conclusion.

If desire can be made equal to zero, then worry must also be equal to zero. The lower the desire, the more certain worry will decrease to the same extent. Conversely, the higher the human desire, the resulting worries will certainly not encounter exceptions that do not increase.

We humans of the 20th century, living in this civilized world, enjoy all kinds of blessings, but the hateful worries still show their cruelty anytime and anywhere, constantly hurting our innocent hearts. This is truly unfortunate. In order to reduce unnecessary mental suffering, we should restrain ourselves and resist our unnecessary desires, which can eliminate the worries that are about to erupt. When improper and excessive desires erupt in our self-conscious hearts, we can be bold in doing so, because this can often make us a happy and self-controlled person!

Friends! Do you envy other people's suits and leather shoes? Do you envy other people's foreign buildings and mansions? Do you also envy other people's luxurious lives? In fact, these are not worth our nostalgia too much. They are suffering from worries and pains that are no less than yours because of this!

"Contentment brings happiness," this famous saying should become an immortal motto in our life of a hundred years!

Thought

### Congratulations and Blessings

— Ye Bianzhou

Although there is a proverb that says, "The sky has unpredictable winds and clouds, and people have fortunes and misfortunes from morning till night," we can clearly understand that the scope of such a statement is extremely narrow and refers specifically to a sudden occurrence of fortune or misfortune. It is definitely not the true fortune or misfortune of life. The so-called true fortune or misfortune of life cannot be compared to wind and clouds in the same way. A more accurate prediction can be made before the fortune or misfortune occurs. Moreover, the person making this accurate prediction is not someone else, but oneself. However, there are still some people whose minds are controlled by fatalism, and they have a "philosophy of life" that they believe is the supreme truth, namely, "Enjoying blessings in this life is due to cultivation in the previous life, and suffering in this life is due to doing evil in the previous life," which is even more of a deceptive and empty ghost story.

A happy life is what everyone yearns for, but if you only yearn abstractly without stepping onto the path to happiness, you will never be able to wait for happiness. Although on this path to happiness, there are bound to be thorns and thistles that will prick your skin, and rugged and steep mountain roads that will make you weak and stumble, and there are even muddy swamps that are not easy to see clearly that will make you sink. But we must overcome all of this with an iron will and a courageous spirit; only in this way can we obtain true happiness. Therefore, I dare to say: "There is no happiness in the world that can be obtained without suffering, otherwise such happiness is shameful; at the same time, there is no happiness that cannot be obtained after enduring hardships, unless you have not recognized what true happiness really is."

What about misfortune? It is the same. Although much misfortune should be blamed on society, what is society itself? It is also the sum of the ideological forms of each of us. It can also be said that each person is a small cell in society. If each cell can function, then why can't the misfortunes blamed on society be eliminated!

Education

### Authentic Goods, Fair Price

— 君

Following the last meeting where private primary and secondary school principals in the city decided on the tuition standards for the upcoming semester, the Bureau of Education felt the figures they set were too high and reduced them. Consequently, the schools then felt the numbers set by the Bureau of Education were too low. After several meetings between the two parties, it was decided that, in addition to tuition, a miscellaneous fee would be added. After much haggling, the schools were finally satisfied.

While the schools were satisfied, the general parents inevitably had a heavier burden. However, in all honesty, if the schools can truly use the increased fees to improve teacher salaries and purchase educational equipment, I believe parents would grit their teeth and pay up for their children to attend a good school. In recent years, due to the meager salaries of teachers, those qualified to be teachers have been forced to seek other livelihoods, leaving behind some who are ignorant and not much more knowledgeable than the students themselves, resulting in a waste of countless people's precious time. As for educational equipment, it is even more pitiful. Not only is the equipment within the school shabby and in disrepair, but many school buildings are like pigeon cages, trapping students inside without seeing the light of day, which is unacceptable. I hope that after this fee increase, there will be substantial reforms.

It reminds me of a phrase used by shops to attract customers: "Authentic goods, fair price." Although comparing schools to shops may seem disrespectful, if the performance of each school can truly live up to these four words, then they will have justified themselves to the students and parents.

### Concerning Prostitutes

— 陳錦江

Speaking of "prostitutes" may immediately provoke disapproval from many "gentlemen," but this problem has lingered in Chinese society for hundreds of years. Yet, even now, "gentlemen" are still reluctant to even mention it.

Like an atom releasing its accumulated heat energy, it is difficult for human power to control. Moreover, aren't prostitutes themselves members of society? And aren't the consequences caused by prostitution universally acknowledged?

Now, we can truly rejoice, for we are now "democratic." In a democratic country, everyone must be liberated. However, prostitutes singing on the streets and soliciting customers on the roadside do not know how to value themselves, do not understand democracy, and do not liberate themselves automatically. Therefore, it was necessary for our diligent authorities to close down massage parlors and escort agencies one after another, finally "liberating" this group of professionals in the industry of morality. (In reality, this is only a very small portion.) As for the rest, such as brothels and establishments for prostitution, they are ordered to register immediately.

They have been liberated, or they have registered and believe liberation is on its way, but the future is long. What will they do? Although they were not necessarily so base in the past, and were not necessarily born as prostitutes, today, moral integrity has been stripped from their lives. In today's society, if they don't sell their bodies, they will be excluded from other occupational circles. Now that they are liberated, what will they do?

This is a social problem, a social problem that has long been avoided by "gentlemen"! Naturally, since it is not yet the time of public servants of the people, there has been no forward-thinking arrangement of better occupations for this group of liberated wretches, nor has their future fate been considered. They are simply hastily rectifying local morality!

We truly wonder, why not send them to reformatories to receive some moral education? Has education failed to such an extent that even "integrity" and "shame" cannot be instilled in this group of abandoned people?

Public Morality

### The Symbolism of Women's Clothing

— 渡雲

I recall that Li Yu, in "Idle Thoughts," mentioned that women's clothing is related to the overall trend of national fortune, with a logical basis and room for verification. Qian Qianyi, who surrendered to the Qing Dynasty at the end of the Ming Dynasty, even presented the Qing emperor with ten conditions of non-submission to conceal his traitorous behavior and let the next generation bear the responsibility of "restoring the Ming." The so-called "ten non-submissions" included "Old submits, young does not," meaning that infants still wore crossover robes; "Yang submits, Yin does not," meaning that the statues in temples were still sculpted wearing dragon robes; "Secular submits, monks do not," meaning that monks still wore kasayas and Taoists still maintained the attire of Ming Dynasty scholars. In other words, the "ten non-submissions" were nothing more than preserving a part of Ming Dynasty attire to evoke the people's feelings and thoughts of restoring the country, which was a well-intentioned effort!

The style of clothing is indeed somewhat related to national fortune, especially women's clothing, which changes constantly. Around 1936 and 1937, single cheongsams with a large right-side placket were popular in the summer, making one wonder if they were Japanese. In 1937, the August 13th Incident broke out, and Shanghai soon fell. Women's clothing became a symbol. After a long time, a combined Chinese-Western style spring coat appeared this spring, suggesting that the American army would soon arrive in Shanghai. Sure enough, the Japanese Emperor surrendered unconditionally, and a large number of Allied troops came to Shanghai. This style became a forecast again. Isn't it strange! Meanwhile, Japanese women in Shanghai were wearing Chinese cheongsams, foreshadowing the decline of their country's fortune.

Furthermore, after women cut their hair, they did not reduce the trouble, but rather made various styles with their hair. "Hair is a woman's glory" is indeed true. Initially, women favored perms, and later they were styled into "airplane" shapes, which symbolized the rise of the air force, ranking first among the land, sea, and air forces. Due to electricity problems, perms were banned, so women generally combed their hair into two horn-like styles on their foreheads, which was similar to the Japanese style. However, recently they have changed it again, combing it into a single horn style. What does this symbolize? Some say that horns on a woman's head indicate the expansion of women's rights. Perhaps the upcoming National Assembly will open, drafting a constitution, and women's participation in politics will hopefully be realized.

### Surge in Divorce Cases in Britain

— 廷鈞

In recent years, Britain has been facing a very serious social problem, namely the sudden surge in divorce cases. Most of those seeking divorce are families of soldiers who have been sent abroad, and most of the requests are made by the men.

People concerned about social issues have carefully studied and realized that this phenomenon has many causes.

The main reason is, of course, that soldiers have been separated from their wives for too long. Soldiers are away from home for an average of forty to forty-eight months, without being able to take leave to return home once. It can be said that never in British history have so many people been in the military at the same time, and so many people have been separated from their families for so long. Men live abroad, and women live alone in empty rooms, everyone leading a desolate and lonely life, which naturally leads to misconduct and divorce.

Men are the majority of those requesting divorce, which is not to say that women are less loyal than men. This is partly because men have flawed attitudes. Because some men even think that having a relationship with an unmarried woman does not count as adultery. Among the poor working class, men have outdated ideas. When they come back and see that their wives have met a few boyfriends, and then go out with their boyfriends, walking side by side, they think it is "improper" and want to get a divorce. Among the working class, women earn more money during wartime than usual, and are more economically independent, which is also one of the reasons for divorce. During the wartime population movement, women often moved to industrial cities, met a few boyfriends, and when they had a little more money in hand, their behavior became less restrained.

In addition, marriages were too hasty during wartime, the selection was not very careful, and life after marriage during wartime was so difficult, all of which contributed to divorce.

Now, a group of social workers in Britain are using various methods to prevent such family tragedies. Among a group of divorce cases, some cancel their original intentions and reconcile, which is due to the efforts of social welfare workers, or because children soften the hearts of adults (which is the main reason), or because husbands understand the suffering of their wives living alone in empty rooms.
