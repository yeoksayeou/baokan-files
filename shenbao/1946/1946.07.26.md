### Restoration of Traffic on the Yangtai Highway; National Army Advances Beyond Hai'an; Recovery of Lingbi and Xiaoxian on the Outskirts of Xuzhou

[Report from Our Zhenjiang Office, 5th] According to an urgent telegram from Taixian, our National Army entered Hai'an on the 24th (120 *li* east of Taixian), and is advancing towards Fu'an on the 25th. The National Army in Qintong is also advancing along the waterways towards Shiyan, hoping to join forces in Dongtai. The National Army's advance beyond Hai'an is like entering an unpopulated area, and the capture of Dongtai County is imminent. Furthermore, after the Communist army's attack on Liuhe on the western front was thwarted, they fled towards Tianchang. Our National Army took advantage of the victory and pursued them in separate routes, like a hot knife through butter. The vanguard troops have retreated near Jiang Gaojiayan (over 30 English miles from Huaiyin). The Communist army inside Huaiyin City is preparing to withdraw.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 25th] Over 20,000 Communist troops, aboard 500 civilian boats towed by motorboats, traveled south along the canal from Huaiyin. Yesterday, they urgently advanced through Baoying towards Gaoyou, preparing to reinforce the offensive around Yangzhou and Liuhe. Furthermore, over 20,000 Communist troops reinforcing the offensive against Liuhe from Tianchang and Xuyi have not yet appeared on the front lines as of now.

[Report from Our Zhenjiang Office, 25th] According to a military spokesperson, the outskirts of Yangzhou are still surrounded by the Communist army. Our National Army has consistently adopted a defensive posture, awaiting developments on the Tianchang and Taixing fronts. However, the National Army on the Tianchang front has advanced to the suburbs, but progress has been hindered by the Communist army's main force.

[Report from Our Zhenjiang Office, 25th] The situation in northern Jiangsu is becoming clearer. According to an urgent telegram from Yangzhou, the Communist army on the Yangtai Highway was completely cleared by the National Army this morning. The damaged Guangfu Bridge has been repaired with the cooperation of the National Army and local residents, and telecommunications between Yangzhou and Taixian have returned to normal. Furthermore, at 2:00 PM today, two unidentified aircraft of unknown nationality were spotted in the southwest sky over Xiannvzhen, and machine-gun fire was directed at the ground, killing eight farmers and injuring an unknown number. It is also reported that a contingent of the Communist army from Tianchang infiltrated Dazaishi in Renhe Town last night at 12:00 AM, with unclear intentions.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 25th] Lingbi County, a Communist army stronghold south of Xuzhou, was recovered by the National Army last night. Tianchang is also expected to be recovered within days.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 25th] Reliable sources confirm that the Communist army's offensive from Supingshan, Sui, and Yongcheng, attempting to threaten Xuzhou, has been blocked on all fronts and is gradually collapsing. As of now, the outskirts of Xuzhou are impregnable.

[Report from Our Jiang Office, 25th] Military sources report that after the National Army in Xuzhou was forced to engage in battle, they defeated the Communist army on all sides of the outskirts of Xuzhou. The Communist army dispersed into smaller units and fled along remote mountain paths. The National Army in Xuzhou is advancing steadily along the coast and has recovered Xinan Town in one fell swoop. The western forces have recovered Xiaoxian.

[Report from Our Toujiang Office, 25th] Military sources report that the Communist army in northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and southern Shandong recently advanced towards Xuzhou. The garrison troops in the outposts around Xuzhou met and attacked the invading forces. According to reports, after several days of intense fighting, the Communist army invading from Xiaoxian in the west and the Communist army invading from Xinan Town in the east were bravely repelled by the National Army.

### No Result in Mediating the Central Plains War; Group Returned to Xi'an Yesterday; Communist Army in Fang County Fleeing Towards Zhushan

[Report from Our Hankou Office, 25th] Military sources: (A) The main force of the Communist army under Li Xiannian is still entrenched near Fengjiadian, northeast of Manchuanguan (the border between Shaanxi and Hubei), continuously launching offensives, attempting to invade the National Army's defense zone, and has not shown any sign of accepting mediation by the peace envoys. (B) On the 22nd, a remnant of the Communist army, numbering 3,000 to 4,000, fled west to Zhushan County, and there are signs of them heading north to Baihe County on the Shaanxi border to join forces with Li Xiannian. (C) The Communist army that disturbed Fang County has been completely driven out by the Self-Defense Forces after the 21st and has fled towards Zhushan. Local order has been restored, and the displaced civilians are returning home to resume their livelihoods. However, many young men were conscripted by the Communist army, and there is widespread mourning. The government is handling the aftermath.

[Report from Our Beiping Office, 25th] A certain military figure stated: Of the 60,000 Communist troops in the "Central Plains Military Region," after the ongoing major battle, only 5,000 to 6,000 remain capable of combat. The rest have mostly dispersed.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 25th] The group of thirty-two arrived here by car at 3:20 PM this afternoon. The group had requested a meeting with Communist army leader Li Xiannian at Nengjuzhai, but was unable to make contact, resulting in the temporary suspension of the group's mediation efforts.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 25th] Since the 14th, the Ninth Group, stationed in Laohekou to conduct mediation work, has dropped letters by airplane four times, inviting Li Xiannian to send representatives to Laohekou, Xichuan, and Longjuzhai for negotiations, but has received no response. The peace efforts of the past half-month have yielded no results. Xue Zizheng, the Communist representative sent by the Ninth Group to Hankou for liaison, and Wang Zhenlv, the government representative, flew to Laohekou this morning to join General Lu Jishi, the government group leader, and Colonel He Zhujian, the American group leader. They will fly to Xi'an tomorrow, and the thirty-two-member group will depart from Longjuzhai to Xi'an at the same time and then fly to Beiping to consult with the Military Mediation Department.

### Chief of Staff of the Hankou Garrison Headquarters Refutes Communist Party Statement

[Report from Our Dankou Office, 25th] Deng Dingyuan, Chief of Staff of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, recently refuted the distorted statement made by Zheng Shaowen, the Communist Party representative stationed in Hankou, in Beijing on the 11th of this month, based on the facts: (A) Zheng Shaowen claimed that the "310" Southern Military Region had been largely occupied by the National Army after over a month of fierce fighting under the National Army's major offensive since mid-May. In reality, there was no fighting in Hubei and Henan before June 25th. His fabrication is truly laughable. (B) He said, "The purpose of this major battle was to capture Yihuadian and annihilate the main force of the Communist army." Let us ask, what is the strength of the Communist Party's Central Plains Military Region? Is the area occupied by the Communist army a natural fortress? If, as the Communist side claims, the National Army surrounded the Communist army and launched a planned attack, the result would inevitably be a major blow, and it would not be difficult to defeat them. Why would they be allowed to flee west across the road and cause trouble everywhere? (C) He also claimed that "Popi River and Husa in the east were successively captured by the 72nd and 47th Armies of the National Army on the 27th," which is even more absurd. Two orders from the 6th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Column of the Communist army, recovered by our front-line troops, prove that the column began its operation at 19:00 on the 21st, and that the 6th Regiment was originally stationed near Hefan, south of Guangshan and east of Popi River. The fact that the Communist army began its operation on the 21st proves that it had been six days from the 21st to the 27th. The National Army only opened Popi River at the request of the people six days later, which further shows that the facts have been reversed and the claim is self-defeating. When Mr. Deng spoke, he showed the two orders from the Communist army. After the reporters read them in detail, it became even clearer that the Communist army's propaganda was indeed unfounded.

### Snow Flies in the Eighth Month of the Lunar Calendar in the North; Soldiers in the Northeast Prepare Winter Clothing

### Captured American Soldiers in North China Returned to Camp After Release

[Report from Our Beiping Office, 25th] The seven American soldiers detained by the Communist army were released yesterday. According to an announcement today by Lieutenant General Lockett, the commander of the US military stationed in Tianjin, the American soldiers were abducted by about 80 armed Chinese men in green uniforms while going to the countryside to buy ice. After negotiations by the Military Mediation Department group, they were released south of Changli at around 4:00 PM yesterday. The seven American soldiers have returned to the headquarters of the 7th Regiment of the US military in Beidaihe.

### Communist Army Abducts Judge from Taixian; Local Court Requests Assistance in Rescuing Him

[Report from Our Suzhou Office, 25th] After the Communist army captured Taixian, they burned all the court records of the local court, arbitrarily released prisoners, and abducted Judge Chen Chuanyuan and Accountant Sun Yizhao.

### Yu Dawei Talks About 600 Kilometers of Railway Traffic Awaiting Repair; Passenger Trains Resume Service on Five Lines in the Northeast

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 25th] Before the implementation of the traffic restoration agreement, our reporter visited Minister of Communications Yu Dawei today. Mr. Yu said: I have been in office for less than two months, and I am studying various traffic problems separately and listening to reports from various units. Currently, the important thing to discuss about traffic problems is still to obtain a solution to political and military problems, that is, to reach a settlement in the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. In addition to doing everything possible to restore the work that has been destroyed, the ministry does not want to formulate any new plans. Currently, the rectification and improvement of transportation is truly a complex matter, and whether it is railway, highway, aviation, or water transport, everything needs to be reorganized. It is also reported that the most urgent repairs are needed for a total of 600 kilometers of railways nationwide. The Communist army has wreaked havoc, cutting each section of the destroyed steel rails into several pieces, making them impossible to reuse. Among the various materials that the United States is helping China with, transportation tools and equipment account for very few, and they often cannot be used immediately due to incomplete accessories, which is the biggest and most painful difficulty at present. It is also learned that the most severely damaged railway is the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, where more than 70 kilometers have been completely destroyed, and all sleepers and equipment have disappeared. Although the Yuehan Railway has been barely opened to traffic, various facilities are lacking and it is difficult to maintain. From this conversation, the reporter learned that the restoration of transportation is 100% dependent on the solution of political problems.

[United Press, Beiping, 25th] Local transportation authorities announced today that five lines of the Northeast Railway within the government-controlled area, including Beining, Jichang, and Shenchang, have resumed passenger train service.

### Officers and Soldiers of the Parachute General Corps Waiting for Ships to Arrive in Shanghai in Hankou

About 4,000 of them came to Hankou from Hunan and are currently waiting for ships to go to Nanjing and then to Shanghai.

### Commander of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters, Huo Kuizhang, Summoned to Guling; Presented a Report on the Kunming Incident to the Chairman; Berry Issues a Statement Refuting Zhou Enlai's Remarks

[Report from Our Kuling Office, 25th] Huo Kuizhang, Commander of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters, was summoned and arrived in on the 23rd, leaving Kunming. He went up the mountain yesterday morning and presented a report on the Kunming incident to the Chairman at 9:00 AM today.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 25th] Luo Longji, Liang Shuming, and Zhang Shenfu, representatives of the Democratic League, visited Shao Lizi, the government representative of the Political Consultative Conference this morning, to make requests regarding the assassination of Li and Wen. (1) The government, the Democratic League, and the United States should each send one person to form a three-person investigation committee to conduct on-site investigations in Kunming; (2) The perpetrators of the case should be publicly tried.

It is reported that the government is still considering these requests. It is heard that if the Democratic League sends someone to Kunming to investigate the Li and Wen case, the likely candidate would be Liang Shuming.

[City News] Colonel Berry, Deputy Director of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, issued the following statement regarding Zhou Enlai's remarks: Recently, the Shanghai newspaper intercepted General Zhou Enlai's remarks stating that the Sino-American Cooperative Organization had transferred silent pistols to the secret police of the Chinese government. This statement is completely unfounded. During the three years I served as Chief of Staff of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, Group Leader of the US Navy in China, and Deputy Director of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, I never handled the receipt of such weapons, so there was no way to transfer them to any department of the Chinese government. Furthermore, a detailed inspection of the entire list of American materials obtained by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization revealed that no silent weapons were transferred by the US Navy in China. The various weapons of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization were all normal weapons, and their use was completely limited to attacking the Japanese army. The past war achievements of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization fully prove that these weapons did indeed exert their greatest effectiveness within the above-mentioned scope of use.

### Three-Person Meeting to Be Held Soon; Zhou Enlai Flew Back to Beijing from Shanghai Yesterday; Met with General Marshall This Morning to Exchange Views

[Report from Our Office, 25th] Regarding the news that Chairman Fu had a trip back to Beijing, our reporter learned that the Chairman will not return to Beijing in the short term.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 25th] It is learned that the possibility of moving the location of the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations to Lushan is very small, because the Communist Party insists that it will never go up the mountain. At the same time, the government representatives participating in the negotiations have not left Beijing. Now that Zhou Enlai has returned to Beijing, the reporter visited a government representative, who said that the three-person meeting may be held soon.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 25th] Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao flew to Beijing at 5:00 PM on the 25th. Mr. Zhou originally planned to visit General Marshall tonight, but because he felt very depressed about the recent passing of Tao Xingzhi, he changed the arrangement to meet with General Marshall at 10:00 AM on the 26th to exchange views on various issues of the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations. Mr. Zhou has achieved results and reached an agreement on the two matters of relief for the "Liberated Areas" and the closure of the Yellow River in Shanghai. The content will be released soon.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 25th] An American official here said: Chinese Communist representative Zhou Enlai returned to Beijing this afternoon. As soon as Mr. Zhou returns here, the two American mediators, Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart Leighton, will be able to discover whether there is still a possibility of a peaceful resolution to the current dispute. The two have recently met with Chairman Chiang in Guling to listen to the government's full views, and now they are eager to hold negotiations with Mr. Zhou within the scope of these views. However, it is still too early to finalize any concrete plan at this time, because even if peace talks resume, everything will have to start from scratch.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The London Times editorial today reviewed the China issue, stating: China's greatest hope lies in the people's desire for peace. This matter can be judged to what extent in the coming months. In short, only the Chinese people can decide the fate of China at present.

### Conflicts Erupt Everywhere in Shanxi Province; Taiyuan and Xinxian Are Both Under Siege

[Report from Our Beiping Office, 25th] Official sources: Taiyuan is now surrounded by the Communist army, and the situation is extremely tense. Xinxian is currently under attack by the Communist army. It is reported that the Communist army has been discovered near Huangzhai, 60 *li* from Taiyuan. The Communist army besieging Taiyuan comes from three sides: Nie Rongzhen's troops from the Jin-Cha-Ji border region, He Long's troops from northwestern Shanxi, and the 379th Brigade (originally belonging to Wang Zhen) from northern Shaanxi. The Communist army seems to want to capture Taiyuan first, and then attack Datong.

[Report from Our Tianjin Office, 25th] Conflicts are erupting everywhere in Shanxi Province. Xinxian is surrounded, and Taiyuan is in a state of war. It is reported that the Communist army has been discovered in Huangzhai, 60 *li* north of the city, but this has not been confirmed. The air-raid siren, which used to be sounded during curfew hours, was canceled on the 22nd and is now reserved for air defense purposes. There are fierce battles in Fenyang, Pingyao, and Qixian in central and western Shanxi. The Communist army in southern Shanxi is also launching offensives in Anyi.

### Li Minran Arrives in Shenyang as Lin Biao's Representative to Visit Military Authorities

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 25th] Lin Biao's representative, Li Minran (also known as Li Lisan), accompanied by Cai Zong, arrived in Shenyang by air from Changchun at 3:00 PM today to pay respects to Chief Executive Du.

[United Press, Shenyang, 25th] Lin Biao's representative, Li Minran, flew here from Changchun at 3:00 PM this afternoon, apparently intending to meet with Xiong Shihui and Du Yuming for discussions. According to Li's remarks to the press, the prospects for peace are bright, and the Chinese Communists will not violate their promises. If local negotiations can proceed smoothly, it will greatly benefit the Nanjing negotiations. Li plans to stay here for two or three days.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 24th] Li Minran is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 25th as Lin Biao's representative to visit military authorities. It is rumored that Rao Shushi will be appointed as the political commissar of the New Fourth Army, and Li Minran will serve as the Chinese Communist representative to the Executive Headquarters' Forward Division in Changchun.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 24th] Liao Yaoxiang and Shang Chuan jointly hosted a banquet for Li Minran and Zheng Dongguo at the Railway Hotel last night. Li Minran and Colonel Tyson (representative of Dai Boermen) all expressed their sincere hope for peace. Li Minran further believes that peace in the Northeast will help the negotiations in Nanjing and the peace of the whole country.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] The situation in the Northeast is becoming tense again. The buffer zone along the Songhua River line has not been delineated, and the Communist army is massively concentrated on the north bank, preparing to cross the river and launch an offensive along the northern section of the China Changchun Railway. Other Communists also say that there will be a major war in the Northeast.

[United Press, Beiping, 25th] The "Xin Sheng Bao," which is close to General Du Yuming, reported today that after many long meetings between the government, Communist Party, and U.S. representatives in the Executive Headquarters' Forward Team in Changchun, an agreement has been reached regarding the neutral zones in the Northeast: no war shall occur, and no troops shall be stationed. However, the government's administrative personnel will not be prevented from taking over. It is said that the detailed rules of the agreement have been agreed upon by all parties and will be announced soon.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th] Northeast news: (1) The buffer zone north of the Songhua River is still being negotiated for establishment. It is reported that the government insists that the Communist army withdraw from Taolaizhao and retreat another two miles, while the Communist Party insists that the National army retreat to the south bank of the Songhua River. The dispute has not yet been resolved. When the Red House was captured by the Communist army and the National army was preparing to counterattack, the group arrived to mediate, thus avoiding a war. However, this issue remains unresolved. (2) Representatives of the U.S. and Communist Party from the Thirtieth Executive Team left Shenyang yesterday for Benxi and then Anshan to continue their investigation. (3) The work of the Northeast Executive Headquarters Division is becoming increasingly weak and ineffective. After Dai Boermen's suggestion for a Du-Lin meeting failed, he quietly returned to Beiping yesterday. Rao Shushi is still滞留in Yan'an and has not returned. If the situation cannot be greatly improved, the Changchun Executive Headquarters Division will become an empty institution.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th] U.S. Representative Major General Dale Boermen of the Executive Headquarters Changchun Division came to Beiping from Changchun to report on the situation in the Northeast to the Executive Headquarters authorities.

Li Lisan Discusses the Meaning of His Changed Name

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 24th] Deputy Chief Executive Zheng Dongguo visited Li Minran (Lisan) on the 23rd, and their conversation mainly revolved around memories of past events. Zheng talked about India, and Li talked about France, which was quite pleasant. Li once told people that his departure from the old name "Lisan" indicates that the name and the "Lisan Line" belong to the past. His use of "Minran" symbolizes that his views and opinions are completely different from the past.

[United Press, Harbin, 25th] Li Minran, a mysterious figure in the Northeast, has returned to the Chinese Communist Party after sixteen years of exile. A United Press reporter met him at the Communist Party hotel, which was recently the residence of Malinovsky, and sat down to talk with him. When asked why he returned to China, Li replied: "I was re-elected as a Central Committee member by the Communist Party Congress in April last year. It was not until August last year, when Guo Moruo was in Moscow, that I found out about it, and of course, I was eager to return to China." Li visited Mao Zedong in Yan'an three weeks ago, which was his first time in eighteen years. Li is currently the Director of Foreign Affairs and Advisor of the Chinese Communist Party's branch in the Northeast Executive Headquarters. In reality, he is a behind-the-scenes figure of the Chinese Communist Party, and his power in the Northeast is quite large, not less than that of Lin Biao. Li is currently forty-six years old.

### Negotiations Underway Between China and the Soviet Union Regarding the Removal of Industrial Equipment from the Northeast; Chinese Embassy Claims Sino-American Commercial Treaty Will Soon Be Completed

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] The new Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, hosted reporters this evening and gave a speech reviewing China's domestic and foreign problems, stating briefly: The continued presence of U.S. troops in China is necessary to complete the repatriation of Japanese prisoners and to ensure transportation lines. The Chinese and Soviet governments are currently negotiating the issue of the Soviet Union's removal of industrial equipment from the Nine Eastern Provinces. The Chinese government has repeatedly protested this removal. [Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] U.S. Representative to the Allied Reparations Commission, Pauley, said that the United States is pushing the Far Eastern Commission to pass his proposed plan, which is to ship the Japanese machinery in crates to restore the coal industries in Fushun and Anshan in the Northeast. His plan has been submitted to MacArthur, who has forwarded it to the Far Eastern Commission, but so far, there has been no action.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun, in his first reception for journalists since taking office, said today: "The majority of the Chinese people understand that the U.S. military has a specific purpose in China, which is to disarm the Japanese army and repatriate the Japanese back to their country. Therefore, they are very grateful for the U.S. military in China. 'I do not understand what those who demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China intend.'" Ambassador Gu refuted rumors that Special Envoy Marshall had failed in his mission to unify China, saying, "I do not believe that Marshall's mission has failed." He also denied that there is a civil war in China, saying, "Although there are conflicts everywhere, there is no civil war in the true sense of the word." As for the Sino-American commercial treaty, "Progress is being made, and it is expected to be completed rapidly within a few weeks."

### The Executive Yuan Announces the Truth About the Sugar Price Issue

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] President Song of the Executive Yuan previously stated that some members of society had questioned the increase in sugar prices in Shanghai after the establishment of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. At a press conference, he promised that after returning to Nanjing, he would order the relevant authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into the truth and discuss normal handling methods for publication. After President Zhu returned to Nanjing, he immediately ordered Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Wenhua, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zhou Yichun, and Chairman of the Resources Commission Qian Changzhao to jointly investigate, discuss, and submit a report to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan has now published the situation in accordance with the report:

(1) The Establishment of Taiwan Sugar Corporation and Past Sugar Sales

Before the Japanese surrender, the Taiwan sugar industry was operated by four Japanese companies: Japan Sugar, Taiwan, Meiji, and Qiaoshui Port. It had jurisdiction over 42 sugar factories, 2 million mu of sugarcane fields, and 2,000 kilometers of railways, with a capital of 300 million Japanese yen. It was the largest industry in Taiwan. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Japanese, due to a shortage of rice, converted most of the sugarcane fields in Taiwan to grow food. In addition, the Allied bombing of sugar factory facilities caused great damage. Therefore, before the armistice, Taiwan's sugar production had fallen to 300,000 tons per year. In October of that year, after government personnel arrived in Taiwan, the Sugar Industry Supervision Committee was established on December 1. In April of this year, it was handed over to the Sugar Industry Takeover Committee. The sugarcane planting season is from July to September each year, while the sugar production season is from January to April. It takes 18 months from the time sugarcane is planted to the time it is harvested. Therefore, the sugarcane planted this year will not be available for sugar production until the beginning of next year. Last year, when the surrender occurred, the sugarcane planting season had already passed, and at that time, due to the severe shortage in Japan, the number of sugarcane planted was limited. From January to April of this year, 86,000 tons of sugar were produced using the existing sugarcane. From January to April of next year, due to the impact of insufficient planting last year, production is feared to decrease sharply to 30,000 to 40,000 tons. The production in the year after that will depend on the quantity of sugarcane planted this year. The Resources Commission took over the Taiwan sugar industry in April of this year, when it was ordered to handle it. It was approved to jointly operate it with the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office. Because a small portion of Taiwanese compatriots invested in it, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation was established to operate it. It was formally established on May 1. The Resources Commission hired American experts to go to Taiwan for on-site inspection and to assist the company in formulating a recovery plan. The preliminary report from the American experts has now been sent, estimating that the supplementary repair equipment will require US$30 million, to be used over three years, with approximately US$10 million in the first year. After the completion of this recovery plan, it can produce 1 million tons of sugar annually, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the entire country and more. If each ton is calculated at US$100, it can save US$100 million in foreign exchange annually. In summary, the scale of Taiwan Sugar is grand, and the undertakings it engages in include not only sugar production but also railways and farmland. The restoration funds are considerable, and a large amount of foreign exchange can be saved in the future. It should be managed by the government in a unified manner. (To be continued)

### The Education System Urgently Needs Reform

The last academic year has ended, and the next is about to begin. Education is the lifeblood of nation-building, revolving year after year, continuing forward, to cultivate the nation's new generation. However, the current Chinese education system, in terms of its merits and demerits for the nation, is truly worthy of examination.

The content of China's new education emphasizes the equal importance of moral, intellectual, and physical education. Judging from the implementation over the past thirty to forty years, strictly speaking, failures outweigh successes. First, let's talk about physical education. To make the race healthy and transform physiques, there are originally many conditions. The public's educational level, economic capacity, and various social systems related to national health, such as the promotion of health services, restrictions on marriages of disabled men and women, improvements in dietary methods and dietary ingredients, are all closely related to the progress or decline of the general public's health. All responsibility cannot be attributed to the education sector alone. However, as far as the education sector is concerned, the promotion of physical education in the new education over the past thirty to forty years has been extremely narrow. The manifestation of physical education is limited to the holding of sports meets and ball games, and there is little achievement in the general sense of health preservation and recuperation in physical education. As for moral education, it is even more nominal. The training of character must pass through practical life to have a lasting and fixed influence. Currently, although schools at all levels have courses such as civic morality, in reality, the moral education itself has completely fallen into the trap of bookishness, in one ear and out the other, with no effect at all. The political chaos, the prevalence of corruption, the deterioration of morality, and the decline of morale in all these years are sufficient to illustrate the complete failure of China's new education in moral education in the past. The only focus of China's new education in the past seems to have been entirely on intellectual education. Intellectual education originally includes thought and knowledge, but thought and knowledge are obviously not just activities in the classroom, and have never left the classroom and separated from books. We analyze China's current education system, from elementary school to university, and it is all about how many points are required to pass, how many courses are required to pass to be promoted, and how many years are required to graduate. The recruitment of students is mainly based on written examinations, and those who fail due to oral examinations are rarely seen; the hiring of teachers only asks about resumes, not character. Classes begin and end, schools open and close, and vacations begin and end, this is the form of China's "education," and this is the content of China's education. Today, China's entire education is just a kind of "bookish" education, and there is almost nothing else besides "books"!

The greatest purpose and task of education is to cultivate character and train people to be human. The transmission of knowledge is certainly important, but the training of morality is especially important. Character is the land, knowledge is the building; if the land is not solid, the construction of high-rise buildings is all a waste of effort. We all have children now. If we study carefully, sending a child to school, from elementary school to university, where will he get scientific training? How can he develop a modern mind? If the mind is not modernized and scientificized, he will inevitably lack rationality, his thoughts will be confused, and he will be unorganized and inefficient in his work. If we further hope that he will have lofty ideals, great ambitions, and amazing inventions, it is like climbing a tree to catch a fish! If we look at the leaders in various fields today, which one has not been baptized by the new education? However, the country is getting worse day by day, and society is becoming more chaotic day by day. If we think about the cause and effect of this, we have already thought about half of it. Now, the means of corruption in society are becoming more and more sophisticated, the ability to quibble is becoming more and more advanced, and the decline of morality is becoming more and more serious. Education that does not emphasize character training but only holds a few books will inevitably train selfish, deceitful, narrow-minded, and tyrannical people, and selfishness, deceitfulness, narrow-mindedness, and tyranny are all sufficient to undermine social stability and hinder national progress. Now China's education, this year follows the same pattern as last year, next year follows the same pattern as this year, year after year, always copying like this, it can be said to be wasting the country's public funds, misleading the youth's time, and ruining the nation's seeds!

We have chatted with friends who are in charge of university administration, and they are all worried about the pathological state of today's education system and feel infinite pain. However, the reform of the entire education system cannot be achieved by the shouts of a few people, nor can it be promoted by newspapers that occasionally mention this issue. Today, those who bear the responsibility for national education administration should make a great determination to first focus on and study this issue with all their strength; the gentlemen and ladies who are in a leading position in the education and culture circles are naturally duty-bound to come out and discuss this issue, so as to lay the foundation for reform. Education is the foundation of nation-building. We believe that China's current education system urgently needs a comprehensive review and reform, so as to enrich the nation's life and create the nation's future, and it is absolutely impossible to continue in this way year after year.

### Yesterday's Test Detonated a Shallow-Water Atomic Bomb, Stirring Up a Steam Column 9,000 Feet High, Two Target Ships at the Center Were Hit and Sunk One After Another

[United Press International, Bikini, 25th] The results of today's shallow-water atomic bomb explosion are as follows:

[Ships Sunk] The battleship Arkansas, the aircraft carrier Saratoga, a sailing ship, a tank landing craft, and a medium landing craft attached to the atomic bomb. [Ships Damaged and Leaning in the Water] The battleship New York and Nagato, the aircraft carrier Independence, the cruiser Pensacola, the destroyer Hughes, and the transport ship Fallon. [Ships Damaged at the Bottom of the Lake, Unclear] Five submarines submerged during the test.

[United Press International, Flagship USS McKinley, 25th] Atomic Bomb Test Commander Blandy announced today: "Six or eight submarines were originally parked underwater to test the power of the atomic bomb. We do not know if they have been sunk. None of them have surfaced. From the air, two are still parked underwater in their original positions. There is still radiation near the target ships in the lagoon, so it is impossible to immediately determine the extent of the damage to the warships. There are no casualties." Blandy then reported on the water column stirred up by the atomic bomb, saying: The water column was about 5,000 feet high, and the gas and water vapor column was as high as 9,000 feet. The diameter of the bottom of the water column was 2,100 feet, and the diameter of the top of the column was even larger. The giant waves stirred up quickly dissipated, and when they hit the shore of Bikini Lagoon, they were only 7 to 10 feet high. The ships parked outside the lagoon were not affected by the waves, radiation, or underwater impact.

[Agence France-Presse, Near Bikini Atoll, 25th] According to official announcements: As a result of the shallow-water atomic bomb explosion in Bikini Lagoon, the target battleship "Arkansas" sank, and a steel-hulled oil tanker and a landing craft also sank to the bottom of the sea. Four submarines were parked underwater during the test, and two more were parked on the surface. According to aircraft reports, a submarine has been found underwater. The ships parked east of the center of the explosion do not appear to have been damaged; the aquatic plants at the bottom of the lagoon were torn apart by the bomb, and the surface of the water is a deep blue color. The authorities are now trying to collect samples of seawater containing radio radiation. However, it will not be possible to approach the area near the sunken "Arkansas" for several days. It is believed that the ship sank in about 15 minutes, because the smoke and fog over the lagoon disappeared in 15 minutes.

### The Scene After the Explosion in a Flash

[Reuters, San Francisco, 24th] The electricity from Bikini has just started pouring in. Within five minutes after the fifth atomic bomb exploded, seawater sprayed to a height of about 5,000 feet, followed by steam droplets spraying to a height of 4,000 feet. The diameter of the sea surface where the seawater rose is estimated to be about 2,136 feet, and the higher the water column, the thinner it seems to be. Within two minutes after the explosion, all target ships, except for a few on the periphery, were shrouded in water vapor and could no longer be seen. Ten minutes later, the water vapor had not yet dissipated, but at the same time, waves about five feet high were seen hitting the coral shore of the island. Thirteen minutes later, 16 target ships could be seen, and half an hour later, it could be determined that the 29,000-ton battleship Nevada, the Japanese battleship Nagato, and the 11,000-ton cruiser Independence were still on the surface. Before the experiment, the radio report said that Lieutenant General Blandy had announced a half-hour postponement of the atomic bomb explosion, and at 3:30, the USS McKinley announced that the atomic bomb had been detonated five minutes later than the scheduled explosion time using a radio button. An officer on the ship reported the time to the explosion. When the report reached only one second left, a loud bang was heard, and at the same time, seawater surged up into a column that became thinner towards the tip. Ten minutes after the explosion, Lieutenant General Blandy announced on the flagship that the atomic bomb had exploded at 8:35 Bikini time. When the clouds gradually disappeared, the 26,100-ton battleship Arkansas had disappeared and had sunk. The stern of the aircraft carrier Saratoga was submerged in the water, and the battleship New York also appeared to be damaged. The palm trees on Bikini Island seemed to be broken. Blandy was able to announce preliminary results within two or three hours after the explosion.

Target Ships on the Lake Surface Rocked Like Toys

[United Press International, B-29 "Bikini Voice" aircraft, 24th] The world's fifth atomic bomb exploded underwater in Bikini Lagoon, and the battleships on the lake surface rocked like toys, but the force of the atomic explosion did not sink most of the battleships arranged in the target area. When the giant bomb exploded, the lagoon was stirred into a sea of fireworks. The waves in the middle of the lagoon surged with the explosion, but did not roll over Bikini Island. The seawater initially rolled up a giant peak, dark brown, and rushed straight into the sky, followed by a second phenomenon of underwater explosion. Suddenly, from the surging water surface, a huge domed column of smoke and water erupted, with a black and brown bottom, disturbed and boiling. The central ring of steam quickly dissipated in the sunlight. All phenomena were fleeting and disappeared in an instant. A piece of steam immediately rose on the sea surface, covering the fleet, like white wool covering it, obstructing the line of sight. The center of the lagoon was an unusual blue color, proving that the atomic bomb had destroyed the lakebed. A glance at the fleet from the air proved that although most of the battleships had not sunk, they had been thrown out of their original positions by the explosion force, and the bottoms of the ships were almost damaged.

Palm Trees on Bikini Island Were Swept Away in an Instant

[United Press International, Bikini, 24th] The world's first underwater atomic bomb exploded at 9:35 tonight (Greenwich Mean Time) in Bikini. The sound was very loud, and the water column was as high as a mile. However, when the smoke dissipated, at least 16 ships were still floating on the surface. The sound of the explosion was so loud that it could be heard clearly by radio listeners as far away as San Francisco. According to official observers, this water mist is very different from that stirred up by the atomic bomb exploding in the air. This wave of spray shot into the sky as high as 8,000 feet. A cloud hung over the blue sky of Bikini, obscuring the view of the air observers. The palm trees on Bikini Atoll, although unharmed during the bombing in the morning of July 1, have now been completely destroyed. Scientists originally predicted that it would stir up 100-foot giant waves, which obviously did not materialize. United Press International reporter Whitehead, representing the American press, observed on a B-29 over Bikini and telegraphed: "The bizarre force of the world's fifth atomic bomb has burned Bikini Lagoon into a cauldron of flames, smoke, and steam. The fate of the ships parked there is unknown." The water column rose at an alarming rate, and when it reached about a mile above the sky, it spread out into a mushroom shape, and its top formed millions of icicles, which fell on the sea surface one after another.

Drone Aircraft Venture into Dangerous Areas

[Agence France-Presse, San Francisco, 24th] A large number of aircraft will participate in the second atomic bomb test on the morning of the 25th to observe various phenomena after the explosion. The observation range will be centered on the explosion site, and its radius will be 30 miles, so that 66 aircraft can work at the same time. Within this hypothetical range, it will be divided into four areas to be treated, called "Sugar", "Dog", "East", and "Victor". At that time, the aircraft will fly from sea level to 10,000 meters. Such a large-scale use of aircraft to observe scientific phenomena is unprecedented. Photography and film equipment are installed. Scientific experts will analyze various rays of light, whether visible to the naked eye or not, with a spectroscope. There is also a special team dedicated to observing the impact of radio waves. Some aircraft are equipped with automatic driving equipment, called "Vere," to measure radio activity in the atmosphere. There is also this "Lo Peak" aircraft, which will fly into the danger zone, and its automatic pressure gauge can measure the average force of the explosion.

### Australian Earthquake and Thunderstorm in Kyoto Said to Be Related to the Test

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 25th Broadcasting: The seismic waves recorded by the seismograph at the Adelaide Observatory in Australia are said to be the result of the atomic bomb explosion on Bikini Island. According to government astronomy expert Dewey Er, the record was most significant sixteen minutes after the explosion, equivalent to a disturbing induced wave. However, the Sydney seismograph, which is 700 miles closer to Bikini Island, did not record any tremors. Also, there was a terrible thunderstorm in Beijing, and some people think it is related to the atomic bomb test on Bi Island.

[United Press International, USS Appalachian in Bikini Lagoon, 25th] The USS Appalachian, a ship for newspaper reporters, entered the lagoon this evening, less than nine hours after the explosion, and is parked in the southern part of the lagoon tonight.

### Wilson Appears in Court to Recount the Tragic Situation of the Nanjing Massacre: Knifing, Gun Stabbing, Burning Alive, Defilement, Japanese Soldiers' Barbarity is Appalling

[United Press International, Tokyo, 25th] Dr. Wilson of Arcata, California, who practiced medicine in Nanjing, testified in the International Tribunal today that during the Nanjing Massacre, Japanese soldiers knifed, stabbed, and defiled women in every way, and even burned residents alive. He also recounted how Chinese doctors and nurses at a university hospital escaped when Japanese soldiers captured Nanjing on December 13, 1937, and how the Japanese soldiers committed all kinds of atrocities, resulting in the hospital being full of wounded people, how the Japanese soldiers stabbed pedestrians, how they spat on and slapped innocent civilians, and how they repeatedly defiled a large number of residents before massacring them. After more than six weeks, the cruel acts committed by the Japanese soldiers against civilians in Nanjing gradually decreased.

### The Defense Repeatedly Attacked, General Qin Fought Alone

[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 25th] Today was the fourth day that General Qin Dechun testified in the Far East International Tribunal. The defense lawyers of the defendants repeatedly stood up to question him, trying to absolve the Japanese leaders of their responsibilities. General Qin fought alone, extremely hard.

When the defense lawyer Brooks stood up and questioned: Was the July 7th Incident caused by Japan issuing a declaration of war, or by China declaring war? (Answer) The Chinese government has never issued such an order. (Question) The witness stated in his statement that the defendant Matsui said, "Asia is Asia for Asians, and the British and Americans are willing to be expelled from Asia." Regarding the expulsion of British and American forces from Asia, please explain in detail? (Answer) Are the attacks on Manila and Pearl Harbor not the best symbols of expelling British and American forces from Asia? At this point, the president of the court believed that the answer to this matter had been completed and urged the defense lawyer to proceed with the questioning quickly. Brooks actually said, "I want to prove that as a result of Western countries coming to China to expand their commercial power, Japan was forced into a great war." The president of the court then asked Brooks to provide evidence. Brooks asked Qin another question, saying that during the Sino-Japanese conflict, did China file a complaint with the League of Nations or protest to the Japanese government? Can the witness provide information on the protest? (Answer) I am not familiar with the central government's diplomatic negotiations. Regarding Japan's acts of aggression, I have repeatedly reported to the central government. (Question) When did you report to the central government? Just as Qin was about to state the main points of the Zhang Weak Incident report, the president of the court stopped him and said: "If you need to report the content, you can submit it to the Chinese government. Please wait a moment, defense lawyer." The defense lawyer then continued to question, "What was the witness's position during the Lugouqiao Incident? Where did you receive the training of staff officers?" This question was stopped by the president of the court. The president of the court and the defense lawyer suddenly started arguing about the issue of recovering lost land after the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu. After noon, Brooks continued to question: Before 1937, did President Chiang or other Chinese officials ask Japan for financial assistance? (Answer) No. However, there was once a contact for economic cooperation, but this was also requested by the Japanese side to China. (Question) Did the economic cooperation include military supplies, weapons, ammunition, etc.? (Answer) No. (Question) Before 1937, were there foreign generals who entered the Chinese army and maintained a close relationship with the Chinese army? At this time, the prosecutor stated that the question was irrelevant. The session reopened at 2:30. The president of the court announced, "I hereby report the court's decision that objections to questioning should be limited to major matters from now on." Then, after briefly questioning Qin, he ended the opposition questioning of Qin by the identification people over the past few days. Then, witnesses Robert and Wilson were called to the court to prove the Nanjing Massacre.

### After Returning from the Food and Agriculture Conference: Zou Bingwen Discusses Impressions of Travel in America: The United States Spends 100 Million Gold Yuan Annually to Improve Agriculture, Our Agriculture Should Use Mechanical and Scientific Farming

[Reported by this newspaper] Dr. Zou Bingwen (pictured), our agricultural expert, flew to the United States on March 7th to attend the Executive Committee of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. He returned to Shanghai on the USS General Gordon a few days ago. Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper made a special trip to interview him and asked about his impressions of this trip. He said: This stay in the United States lasted about three years. His impressions can be divided into three points: (1) Americans are quite concerned about various affairs in our country. During his stay in the United States, he traveled in various places and had a lot of contact with people in the American agricultural sector. He deeply felt the sincerity of American friendship towards China, but the recent frequent news of disputes in our country inevitably made some Americans feel disappointed. Therefore, he urgently hopes that this unfortunate event can be resolved as soon as possible, so that our country's position in the international community can be improved.

Agricultural Country Actually Suffering from Famine

(2) Our country is an agricultural country, and in theory, it should provide food to other countries instead of relying on food from other countries. But the fact shows that before the war, our country often suffered a famine once every few years, eventually relying on the assistance of countries around the world. After this war, news of famine in our country spread all over the world again, making others feel that our country itself does not pay enough attention to agriculture, resulting in this result. Therefore, he deeply hopes that our country can have a remedy for this past mistake in the future. (3) Among those returning home on the same ship were 465 specialized personnel in agriculture, industry, transportation, and other fields sent by our government to the United States for internships. During the internship process in the United States, he was responsible for presiding over the agricultural personnel. During the return trip, he had group discussions with the trainees on the ship and deeply felt that each member had the ability and vitality. Therefore, he hopes that after returning home, the government and society can use these trainees so that each member can do their best.

When the reporter asked about his thoughts on China's agricultural construction after returning home, he said: I studied agriculture in the United States and deeply felt that the American government is very dedicated to agricultural construction. The American national treasury allocates nearly 100 million U.S. dollars for agricultural expenses every year. Therefore, the improvement of agricultural production, the development of the rural economy, the improvement of farmers' lives, and the popularization of farmers' knowledge can all achieve ideal goals. Not only that, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture also hires a large number of experts to engage in scientific research. The invention of DDT insecticide and penicillin were all invented by experts from the Department of Agriculture. Its benefits to human well-being are not limited to agriculture alone. In contrast, everything in our country feels backward and cannot be compared. The immediate priority is to achieve the following three conditions: (1) National agricultural production is self-sufficient, (2) Increase the income of farmers nationwide, (3) Develop agricultural products to earn foreign exchange.

Use Machinery, Intensify Reclamation

Zou also explained that because China needs industry, the number of farmers has decreased, the unit area of arable land has increased, and cooperative methods need to be used to gradually achieve agricultural mechanization. At the same time, because there is a lot of wasteland in China, especially in the nine northeastern provinces, reclamation needs to be intensified to increase the production area and enrich farmers' incomes. Finally, Zou said: American agricultural production is now surplus, and the arable land per person has increased from 100 to 120 acres. Chinese farmers can only cultivate a few acres per person, and there is a lot of labor waste. We must use machinery and scientific farming methods to increase production and reduce famine.

Short Stay, Will Go to Nanjing Soon

According to reports, Mr. Zou is currently the head of the Chinese delegation of the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group, a senior advisor to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Food, chairman of the Chinese Agricultural Society, and one of the fifteen executive committee members of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. The conference held its first founding conference in Quebec, Canada last November. After attending the founding conference, Mr. Zou returned home briefly on December 10th last year. He then flew to the United States again on March 7th this year to participate in the second executive committee meeting held by the conference in the United States. The conference continued to hold its third executive committee meeting in the United States on June 28th and adjourned on July 3rd. Mr. Zou boarded a ship in San Francisco on July 10th to return home. It is reported that the fourth executive committee meeting of the conference will be held in Denmark on August 28th this year. The annual meeting will be held in the same place on September 2nd. Mr. Zou will fly to Denmark to participate at that time. It is rumored that Mr. Zou will stay in Shanghai for a short time and then depart for Nanjing on the 29th of this month.

### Agricultural Organizations Hold Tea Party to Welcome Returning Agricultural Personnel: Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Will Coordinate Work Allocation

In order to adapt to the needs of agriculture after the war, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry selected outstanding technical personnel for internships in the United States last April.

Except for more than 40 trainees in agricultural economics and agricultural extension, whose internships were extended to the beginning of September due to circumstances, the remaining 110 people completed their one-year-plus studies and returned home on the American ship "General Gordon" with Dr. Zou Bingwen, an expert representing our country at the United Nations Agricultural Conference, arriving in Shanghai at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday. At 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and other organizations such as the Shanghai Fish Market held a tea party at the Tsinghua Alumni Association to welcome them. More than 100 people including Minister Zhou Yichun, Zou Bingwen, and the trainees attended. Minister Zhou first gave a welcome speech, hoping to contribute to Sino-American agricultural technology cooperation. He also hoped that they could use what they have learned and work hard for their positions to meet the needs of national construction. After Wu Juenong of the Chinese Agricultural Society delivered a speech, Minister Zhou invited Dr. Zou Bingwen to deliver a speech. Finally, Director Zhao Lianfang of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry reported that the trainees who went to the United States for internships, except for those who have already contacted jobs, can register first if they want to be introduced by the ministry. The ministry has now received letters from the Jiangsu Agricultural Improvement Committee, the Guangxi Provincial Government, the Hubei Relief and Relief Sub-Administration, and the Sichuan Agricultural Improvement Institute and other agencies, requesting the supply of talents, and they are very welcome to apply. Mr. Zou Bingwen advocated that in order to fully match people and things, it is best for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to coordinate the distribution. Minister Zhou immediately made an appointment with each trainee to talk to the department in batches, and the hosts and guests enjoyed themselves until about 6 o'clock before dispersing.

### Customs Seizes Large Quantities of Nylon Stockings and Cosmetics

According to a person in charge of customs in this city yesterday, the bureau has heard about the evasion of taxes and smuggling of imported goods. However, according to the results of the investigation, most of the glassware and American food sold on the streets and alleys of the city have already been taxed, so the current smuggling situation is not as serious as rumored outside. According to the round-the-clock efforts of the anti-smuggling team of the customs, it has cracked down on smugglers hundreds of times each month, with a value of more than hundreds of millions of yuan. Recently, it has seized as many as eight smuggling cases of prohibited imported goods such as nylon stockings and cosmetics, with a value of approximately more than 400 million yuan. Most of these smugglers are sailors on American warships, colluding with local traitors, using large sailing boats and sampans when the fleet approaches the Wusongkou to engage in smuggling through exchange. The customs authorities are now making every effort to prevent this despicable smuggling. In order to eliminate smuggling, they are encouraging people to report it as much as possible and give informers a reward of 30% of the total value of the smuggled goods.

### Complicated Drug Trafficking and Fraud Case: Defendant Liu Guanmin's Inside Story – Japanese Attempted to Poison American Soldiers

[Our Newspaper] Liu Guanmin, a native of Yantai, residing at No. 14, Lane 206, Rue Amiral Bayle (present-day Baike Road), possessed four pounds of morphine hydrochloride and intended to sell it. On March 30th of this year, he went to the home of Japanese man Maekawa Iichiro, asking him to find customers. On April 2nd, Liu, along with Zhu Guobin (residing at No. 8, Lane 1275, Zhongzheng Road), a doctor from Wuxi and his business associate, took a bottle of morphine samples to Maekawa Iichiro. That afternoon, Maekawa Iichiro took the sample to another Japanese man, Hande Yoshio, who then passed it through Japanese men Ida Noboru and Oshima Masao (female) to Chen Qingfeng (residing at No. 42, Zhe Xing Lane, Route D'Esvres). Chen, a Taiwanese, intended to purchase the drugs and traffic them to Taiwan. He then asked his friend Ke Jiajun to contact Oshima Masao on his behalf. Oshima Masao brought the sample to Ke's residence at No. 127, Youheng Road. After examining the goods, Chen and Ke agreed with Oshima on a price of 3 million yuan per pound. On the morning of April 4th, Ida Noboru obtained Liu Guanmin's consent. At around 2 PM that afternoon, Oshima Masao went to Ke's home, collected an advance payment of 1.47 million yuan, and handed it over to Ida Noboru. At this time, Liu Guanmin suddenly changed his mind, believing that the Japanese had no real power in China. He intended to embezzle the advance payment. He colluded with a Norwegian man named Rona, tricking Maekawa and others into a small room in the Flora Cafe on Yuhang Road. After receiving the advance payment of 1.47 million yuan, Rona claimed to be an American military intelligence officer and tricked the Japanese men into leaving. Afterward, Liu received 1.07 million yuan, and Rona received 400,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Ida and others, feeling aggrieved by Liu and Rona's fraud, immediately reported it to the Second Company of the Independent Third Battalion of the Military Police. The military police detained all the suspects and referred the case to the District Procuratorate for public prosecution. At the first public hearing yesterday morning, the defendants hired lawyers Yao Junyu, Shan Yuhua, Shen Ying Shi, and others. All denied the drug trafficking charges. However, according to Liu, in February of this year, during a visit to Zhu Guobin for medical treatment, Zhu told him that a Japanese man named Ota (who has now returned to Japan) wanted to purchase a large quantity of morphine, intending to use Jewish intermediaries to bring it onto American warships, mixing it into the water pipes to poison American soldiers. Liu, feeling indignant, reported it to his friend Rona, an American military intelligence officer. Rona then informed the American military authorities, who then instructed Liu, Zhu, and others to feign cooperation with the Japanese to investigate their conspiracy. Liu admitted to being connected with American military intelligence and denied any intention of fraud. After questioning each defendant in court, the judge, deeming the case complex, ordered them to be remanded to custody separately and adjourned the hearing.

### Zhu Chansheng, Key Suspect in the Rong Case, Escorted to Shanghai; Police Station Interrogated Him All Night; Authorities Will Host Press Conference to Report Progress

[Our Newspaper] Since Zhu Chansheng, a key suspect in the Rong Desheng kidnapping case, was apprehended in Fuzhou and escorted to Shanghai, Zhang Shishi, Chief of the Criminal Division of the Police Bureau, has personally interrogated him all night. Yesterday, Section Chief Li of the Second Section was dispatched to the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters to study the confessions of the relevant criminals in detail. Therefore, the investigation of Zhu may take another day or two before he can be transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for joint processing. Furthermore, Xuan Tiewu, who is also the Garrison Commander, considering the complexity of the case, has ordered the Criminal Division of the Police Bureau to send personnel to jointly interrogate all the arrested suspects in the case with the Investigation Department. He will host a press conference for the city's media in the near future to report on the progress of the case.

Supplementary Notes on the Investigation Process

[Another Report] The report yesterday did not fully detail the investigation and arrest of Zhu Chansheng, another principal offender in the case. Here are some supplementary notes.

On June 27th, the Changshu Branch reported, based on information from plainclothes police officer Xu Zhengting, that Zhu Chansheng, residing at No. 131, East Siwen Lane, Xinzha Road, had repeatedly committed kidnapping cases in the past. Since the Rong case occurred, Zhu Chansheng's whereabouts have been mysterious. After the Rong case ransom was paid, it was discovered that he was spending lavishly, which was highly suspicious. The Director of the Zhao Branch, Deputy Director Yin, and Section Member Zhang Faxiang began investigating. After discussing with Director Zhang of the Criminal Division, they determined that Zhu Chansheng was highly suspected of being involved in the Rong case. On the morning of the 28th at 2 AM, Section Member Zhang Faxiang, along with police officers Wang Ji, Ding Fanglong, Zhang Huiyu, and Hao Tingjie, went to arrest him at his address. Unexpectedly, Zhu had left two days prior, and his wife had returned to her hometown three days before. They immediately took Zhu Chansheng's mother-in-law, Su Guo, his brother-in-law, Su Xiaolin, and his live-in partner, Fan Jinbao, along with a piece of paper found in the residence, to the station for interrogation. The results of separate interrogations revealed that Su Guo and Su Xiaolin were adamant about not revealing the whereabouts of Zhu Chansheng and his wife. According to Fan Jinbao, he heard that Zhu Chansheng had gone to Fuzhou, but whether that was true could be inquired from Meng A'er (address unknown). As for Zhu's wife, she had taken luggage back to Henglin the day before. Before leaving, she gave me this piece of paper (the paper found) and asked me to call Rong Xianzhang and ask him for 150,000 yuan," and so on. Later, the telephone company confirmed that Meng A'er lived at No. 6, Qingchang Lane, Aerjin Road. The original investigators rushed to arrest him but were unsuccessful. They then went to the Zhenzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Xiaoshadu Road and finally arrested Meng A'er (i.e., Meng Youzhang). He was brought back for questioning and confessed that Zhu Chansheng had indeed taken the Deng Keng ship to Fuzhou on the 26th of this month because the ship's compradore, Shen Bomin, knew Zhu. As for Zhu's whereabouts after arriving in Fuzhou, he said it could be inquired from Shen Bomin. Based on the above clues, Director Zhao of the branch decided on four measures to be implemented simultaneously: (1) The branch immediately telegraphed the Fuzhou City Police Bureau to detain Zhu when the Deng Keng ship arrived at the port. (2) Police officers Zhang Huiyu and Hao Tingjie were immediately dispatched to guard Zhu Chansheng's home. (3) Fan Jinbao was instructed at the station to telegraph Rong Xianzhang to send money to Zhu's home. (4) Deputy Chief Yin led Section Member Zhang Faxiang, Ding Fanglong, Tang Mubin, and others to Henglin overnight to investigate and arrest Zhu's wife. Rong Xianzhang indeed sent money to Zhu Chansheng's home on June 29th and was immediately arrested by the police officers. He confessed, "I owed Zhu Chansheng 150,000 yuan because Feng Zhongjia asked me to seek favor from the old man, so I sent the money after receiving the telegram, there is no other relationship," and so on. Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Yin led officers directly to Zhu Wuda's home (i.e., Zhu Chansheng's younger brother) in Henglin, where they arrested Zhu's wife, Zhu Su, Zhu's younger brother, Zhu Wuda, and Zhu's sister-in-law, Zhu Chen, and found 3,000 US dollars, a diamond ring, and a gold bracelet in her bag. They brought Zhu Su, Zhu Wuda, Zhu Chen, and the seized ornaments back to Shanghai. According to Zhu Su, the US dollars were given to me by Zhu Chansheng when he left, I don't know where they came from." It was found that the funds released in Shanghai included 1 million yuan borrowed by Sun Yuming, the owner of the Datong Barber Shop, on June 23rd, and 500,000 yuan to Sun Rui San, a relative on Huoshan Road, both handled by Zhu Wuda. Later, Sun Yuming was also arrested, and he stated that the loan was given in the form of a check from Yuanchang Qianzhuang. It was later discovered that the drawer of the check was the wanted criminal Yuan Zhongzhu. According to Meng Youzhang's confession and the investigation by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, it was learned that the compradore of the Deng Keng ship was indeed Shen Bomin. The ship was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Fuzhou on July 2nd. Officers were dispatched to Wusong to wait for the ship. Shen Bomin and Meng Weichen were brought to the General Bureau for interrogation and confessed that Zhu Chansheng was currently residing at No. 6, International Hotel, Zhongping Road, Fuzhou. Director Zhang of the Criminal Division immediately telegraphed Captain Yu of the Fuzhou Provincial Water Police Corps to detain him quickly. A team of officers led by Zhang Faxiang who had moved to become a Section Member of the 2nd Division on July 10th, took the Zhoushan ship to Fuzhou and they did not arrive there until the 13th. They learned that Zhu was detained by the Water Police Corps, and they made their demand to them on the 21st and escorted the suspect to Shanghai on the 24th, where he was sent to the transport department.

Recently, there has been a proliferation of counterfeit small-denomination 2,000-yuan Central Bank notes on the market. Fang Zijin Silver Shop on Dong Xihua Road, Hongkou, had a customer come to exchange jewelry and pay with 250,000 yuan in new 2,000-yuan Central Bank notes. The silver shop accepted the money as usual and then paid 150,000 yuan of it to a paint merchant. When the merchant deposited the money in the bank, the teller, seeing that the notes were suspicious, used a magnifying glass to identify them as counterfeit and immediately returned them to the merchant. The merchant went to Fang Zijin Silver Shop to negotiate, and while they were arguing, a patrol team happened to pass by. After inquiring about the reason, they took the silver shop's accountant to the Tilanqiao Branch to investigate.

### Yuan Meiyun – Good News – Suspension of Execution – Not Hopeless

[Our Newspaper] Film star Yuan Meiyun was sentenced by the District Court to six months in prison and deprived of public rights for one year due to opium addiction. Later, Yuan's family filed a petition to suspend the execution, and after examination by a forensic doctor arranged by the procuratorate, it was found that she was no longer addicted to drugs. Citing Article 88 of the Criminal Law, the procuratorate requested the Criminal Tribunal of the District Court to exempt her from execution, but the request was rejected by Judge Shen Tianbao. Xian Chuanbang, a prosecutor from District Court, opposed the rejection of the request. A complaint was filed on the 24th, and two copies were made. One was sent to the District Court to be forwarded to the High Court, and the other was sent to the defendant Yuan Meiyun.

The complaint stated: The defendant Yuan Meiyun, female, 29 years old, from Tianjin, in custody, was detained by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau on April 12th for a drug case and sentenced by this court on May 17th to six months imprisonment, limited to two months for compulsory drug rehabilitation. Subsequently, the prosecutor noted that the defendant had been imprisoned for more than three months in the detention center of this court and Shanghai Prison, and that the forensic doctor of this court had examined her and found that she no longer had drug addiction. It was deemed that there was no need to execute the punishment, and a request was made to exempt her from the execution of the sentence. However, the Criminal Tribunal of this court rejected the request, stating that there was no record of the execution of the compulsory drug rehabilitation. It has been discovered that Yuan Meiyun has been in the detention center and Shanghai Prison for over three months since being transferred from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to this court, which has passed two months from the date of the judgment. During this period, the defendant has been effectively subjected to compulsory drug rehabilitation in the detention center of this court and Shanghai Prison. The original judgment also limited two months for compulsory drug rehabilitation, and so on. It has both the form and substance of the compulsory drug rehabilitation and is not entirely without the execution of the compulsory drug rehabilitation. It is not inconsistent with the provisions of Article 88, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, this appeal is lodged, requesting that the original ruling be revoked and a new ruling be made. This is addressed to the Shanghai High Court.

Commercial News

### Deadline for Applications This Afternoon; Regularly Scheduled General Sale of Low-Priced Sugar; Wholesale and Retail Prices Have Been Set

[Our Newspaper's Report] The widespread sale of low-priced sugar in the city can be realized by next Tuesday at the latest. The Social Affairs Bureau has reached an agreement with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation and the local Southern Goods and Tea Food industries. The Taiwan Sugar Corporation will wholesale sugar to designated retail stores at a price of 74,000 yuan per dan (100 kg), which will then be sold to citizens at a price of 860 yuan per jin (500 g). It is understood that the registration procedures for the relevant industries will close this afternoon. As of last night, the industries that have registered to retail (or use for their own purposes) include the Southern Goods industry, the Tea Food industry, and the Candy and Biscuit industry. The list of store registrations from the soft drink industry has not yet been sent to the bureau. The cooked food industry has also requested to register, and Director Wu has instructed that "a review of the nature of this industry should be conducted before approval." Only two organizations, such as the Jinghu Railway Bureau, have requested sugar for their own use. Three consumer cooperatives have applied for registration. Of the more than 500 Southern Goods businesses in the city, 367 have applied to join through the trade association, requesting a total of 5,000 bags. It is reported that the bureau has approved this request. The Tea Food industry has requested more than 3,000 bags. The principle of approval is as follows: those requesting 20 bags or less will be fully approved, while those requesting more than 20 bags will be approved for half the requested amount. After the amounts are approved, the Social Affairs Bureau will transfer payments directly to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. It is reported that the payment procedures can be completed by Saturday after the registration deadline at noon today, with delivery on Monday, and sales can begin by next Tuesday at the latest at a price of 860 yuan per jin. Smaller stores in the unregistered industries can purchase in bulk from their counterparts at a price of 81,000 yuan per dan. Their retail price will also be 860 yuan per jin. According to the chairman of the Southern Goods Association, the association will assign 36 supervisors to patrol the areas where low-priced Taiwan sugar is sold in the 18 districts of the city to prevent members of the industry from concealing or raising prices. Citizens can also report any such incidents to the trade association or the Social Affairs Bureau.

Sugar Merchants Petition the Bureau to Order Foreign Sugar to Shanghai

After the Social Affairs Bureau and the Taiwan Sugar Corporation established a sugar allocation method that directly allocated sugar to retailers, the local sugar merchants were alarmed. Yesterday morning, they convened an emergency meeting of the industry and appointed Liu Meibo, Liu Songxin, Li Fengchang, and Zhu Guoming to petition the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon. It is understood that Director Wu stated that sugar from the seventh allocation period would not be allocated to sugar merchants, but that this could be considered from the eighth period onwards. It is also learned that some sugar merchants, due to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's control of the entire transport, marketing, and allocation of sugar, have ordered foreign sugar to Shanghai from four foreign firms with very favorable terms. The sugar is expected to arrive in port by the middle of next month at the latest, with a price of 80,000 yuan.

### Gold Prices Slightly Lower, US Dollar Continues to Fall

The market was sluggish and lackluster. Gold opened at around 1.95 million yuan in the morning. After opening, the high price was 1.952 million yuan. The US dollar eased significantly. Later, the price retreated to 1.94 million yuan. The central government allocated 100 bars, and the price also retreated to 1.9425 million yuan. After 10:00 AM, the market became even more peaceful, struggling at around 1.945 million yuan until noon. The afternoon remained peaceful, and the final price was slightly lower than the previous close. The purchase price for gold ornaments was 1.007 million yuan per tael. Silver was flat, while silver dollars fell slightly. Interest rates were very loose, ranging from 0.1 to 0.12.

After the US dollar was suppressed by physical goods, many floating positions were sold off, causing the price to fall from 2,570 yuan all the way down to 2,525 yuan, before stabilizing slightly. At noon, the price hovered around 2,540 yuan. The afternoon remained flat, and the final price continued to fall by 20 yuan compared to the previous close.

### Cotton Loans in the Planning Stages

Total Amount May Be 30 Billion

With the cotton harvest season approaching, the Farmers Bank of China is cooperating with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to prepare cotton transportation and sales loans. The target of the loans is cotton farms and cotton farmers, and the scale is quite large. It is understood that the loan methods are being planned by the Farmers Bank and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The country will be divided into several regions for purchase and sale. The loan amount may be 30 billion yuan, and ginneries will be established in various regions. It is planned to purchase 60 of the most suitable cotton gins to be set up in 30 factories, exclusively for cotton processing and packaging.

Depressed Bond Market

The bond market remains weak. Although there were a few outsiders who came to buy in the middle of the day, it did not attract the attention of all parties. Category C bonds reached a high price of 800 yuan at the opening in the morning, and a low price of 750 yuan at the close at noon. The final price fell by 60 yuan compared to the previous close. Category A and B bonds were still flat, while Category D and E bonds fell slightly by 20 to 30 yuan.

### Demand for Spot Cotton is Quite Strong; Yarn Prices Were Weak Yesterday

Yesterday, the yarn market was externally tight but internally weak. Yarn factories were unwilling to sell at low prices due to reduced production, while buyers were unwilling to purchase due to sluggish sales and low prices in the interior. The stalemate was difficult to sustain, so prices began to decline yesterday, falling by an average of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Sentiment was also very weak, with no sign of a rally.

Yesterday, New York US cotton telegrams suddenly fell by 100 pounds. The near-term price was US$34.38, the long-term price was US$34.41, and the spot price of Midling cotton was US$35.06. Local spot cotton transactions were again enthusiastic. The market price was not affected by the sharp drop in US cotton, because private factories have a strong need. Factories such as Dacheng, Xinsheng, Anda, and Qingfeng all made purchases. The market price continued to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

### Taking Over Enemy and Puppet Factories: Three Suggestions from the Industrial Sector

Regarding the thirteen factories that have contributed to the war effort being allowed to take over enemy and puppet factories, as reported in this newspaper, a leader from the industrial sector in the rear area said: It is deeply regrettable that this matter has only been approved today, as it would have been of greater assistance if it could have been realized half a year earlier. The industrial sector in the rear area now has three suggestions for consideration. First: We hope for widespread application, as these thirteen factories are not the only ones that have contributed to the war effort. Other factories should also be given preferential treatment to avoid any perceived bias. Second: Installment payments, with the price paid in installments over five years. Third: The machinery of each factory should be valued according to current U.S. market prices. If the price is based on domestic market prices and must be paid in a lump sum, it is feared that no factory in the rear area will accept such preferential treatment. The above three points have been presented to Special Commissioner Zhang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Representatives from various factories in Hunan and Guangxi who are petitioning in Beijing also plan to raise these issues.

[Report from this newspaper] The green tea produced in Pingshui (Shaoxing), Zhejiang, for export, includes varieties such as Chunmee and Gunpowder tea. The annual output is no less than 200,000 boxes, with the United States being the main market. Although some of the new crop has been produced and shipped to Shanghai, the foreign firms are quite demanding on pricing, offering only slightly more than 100,000 yuan per dan. The tea producers state that the cost of raw green tea in the production area is about 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per dan, and when adding the labor for re-processing and all taxes and fees, the cost per dan is at least 200,000 yuan. Based on the current situation, the losses are significant. Some time ago, the tea merchants there once requested the government to purchase the tea to reduce losses. It is now heard that the China Trust Bureau has already taken reasonable measures and is actively proceeding. It is also learned that tea merchants in Tunxi and other production areas in Huizhou, Anhui, are also planning to appeal to the authorities for similar treatment.

### Rice Market Weak for Several Days, Yesterday Began to Rebound, New Rice from Various Places Arriving Continuously

Yesterday, the northern and southern markets together received more than 6,000 shi of rice. After several days of sharp declines, the shops took advantage of the situation to buy. Sales in the southern market have become more active, and sales in the northern market are also not bad. High-quality rice is firm, and medium-grade rice has rebounded by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. New rice from Zhejiang, Nanjing, Pudong, and other places has all arrived on the market, but the quantity is still small and there is no official market price yet. It is expected that a large amount will arrive after autumn. Flour from Wuxi is still in strong demand, but sales are sluggish, down by another 300 to 400 yuan. The factories have also reduced prices by 200 to 300 yuan. Shantou dealers are selectively buying high-quality wheat, but the Ningbo merchants' appetite for lower-grade wheat is not strong, so high-quality wheat has risen by 400 to 500 yuan, while medium and lower grades are stable. Although soybeans have arrived, the oil factories' appetite is not strong. Sales on this street are normal, and Chaozhou merchants are buying slightly, so the situation is stable. Green beans, broad beans, and red beans are all weak, while raw peanuts are stable. The supply of cooking oil is still scarce, and the Guangdong merchants are still active, so raw oil has continued to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil have also risen by about 1,000 yuan. Sales of soybean cakes in the countryside have slowed down, and the price has become stable.

### Stock Market Remains Weak

There is still profit-taking on Chinese stocks, and there has been no improvement. However, due to loose monetary policy, there has been some bottom-fishing and trading activity. Qin Hing is relatively stable because it is being sold together with underwear at a low price. The prices of various stocks fluctuated greatly during the day. At the high point, Wing On Textiles was 660 yuan, Mei Ah 4,500 yuan, King Fook 255 yuan, Sun Kwong 240 yuan, and Qin Hing 180 yuan. At the low point, Wing On Textiles was 620 yuan, Mei Ah 4,120 yuan, King Fook 220 yuan, Sun Kwong 220 yuan, and Qin Hing 155 yuan. At the midday close, the market turned hesitant, and as a result, Wing On Textiles, Mei Ah, King Fook, and Sun Kwong all fell by a little less than 5%, while Qin Hing rose slightly. Smaller and less popular stocks fell again by about 5%, and underwear, which was being sold together, fell by 10%. Original stocks also declined.

Foreign stocks remained difficult to support, but the fluctuations have narrowed. Ewo Textiles fell from 9,100 yuan to 8,700 yuan, and Jardine Matheson fell from 9,200 yuan to 8,700 yuan. Trading was limited. As a result, compared to the previous close, Ewo Textiles, Wheelock Marden, and Shanghai Dockyards were unchanged, while Ewo Brewery, Jardine Engineering, Shanghai Land, and Asia Life were all slightly lower.

### Rumor of Caustic Soda Arrival

It is rumored that a British trading firm has 3,000 barrels of caustic soda arriving, and 2,000 barrels of American goods have also been shipped from the South Pacific Islands, so people are feeling weak. The factories' appetite for raw materials is decreasing because they are stopping night work. Goods such as Red Eagle brand soda ash, bleaching powder, pure alkali, acetic acid, and sulfuric acid are not being traded, and the trend is particularly soft.

In other news, British firm Jardine Matheson bought 199 cases of aged Zhong Chou Chunmee tea, while Wu Chang Tea Company bought 85 cases of aged Te Gong tea and 47 cases of aged Shang Qimen tea. These were sold by Ning Shin Kee, Yee Chee Heng, and Lung Kee Hing. Other tea companies, such as Sun Wah, are still in negotiations with sellers. As for the shops and merchants on this street, sales remain strong. The prices of aged Shang Bai Lin, new Longjing from Wenzhou, and aged Zhong Chou Jasmine tea have all risen compared to the previous day's close, while the rest remain unchanged.

### China Trust and Tea Merchants Meet, Seeking Barter Trade with the Soviet Union

The Central Trust Bureau is actively launching new plans to save the Chinese tea crisis, focusing on promoting barter trade with the Soviet Union. People in the tea industry are delighted to hear this news. It is understood that the Central Trust Bureau will convene representatives of tea merchants today, including key responsible persons from the Tea Merchants Association and the Export Guild, to discuss preliminary plans. Matters such as quality, price, and payment terms will all be discussed. Last night, various tea magnates were already preparing separately. If the discussions today yield satisfactory results, the tea merchants will quickly implement a barter trade plan in order to partially break through the tea industry's difficulties, and the overall hardship can be gradually alleviated. As for the Qimen tea that has already been produced, which is valued at 270,000,000 yuan and contains 15,000 boxes, it was decided at the Export Guild meeting held at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday to send telegrams to various tea firms, requiring them to send personnel with over 200 types of tea samples to Shanghai within ten days and hand them over to the Chinese Farmers Bank for inspection.

### Pre-War Deposits: Hong Kong Banks to Settle Separately

For the settlement of account deposits by Hong Kong banks in the first half of this year, for depositors who had deposits before the war and have withdrawn a small portion after the restoration, the receipts and payments will not be calculated together temporarily. Pre-war deposits will still be listed in the deposit account, and the withdrawn funds will be treated as advance payments, with interest calculated monthly. Regarding the signatory rights of depositors, the banks have issued a notice to reorganize, stipulating that all signatory rights of commercial firms and companies must be authorized by all shareholders of the firm or company to be valid, in order to avoid disputes due to the many changes caused by the changing environment.

### Damaged Banknotes: Central Bank Exchanges as Much as Possible

In order to reduce the unwarranted losses of the people, the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank has expanded its original "Damaged Banknote Exchange" office to exchange damaged banknotes as much as possible, free of charge. However, for banknotes with a face value of less than three-quarters but more than one-half, only half of the face value will be exchanged. Those who deliberately damage banknotes will not be accepted.

### Atomic Stoves: Available for Sale in Hong Kong

Following atomic pens, atomic lighters, and atomic cloth, the United States has also introduced atomic stoves and atomic fuel, which have recently arrived in Hong Kong. The atomic stove uses atomic fuel for combustion, which is economical and convenient. The Hong Kong distributor is the Minsheng Trading Company.

### Cotton, Cement, and Timber Shipped Successively from Britain and the United States

[Report from this newspaper] Cotton, cement, and timber are being imported in large quantities. The British company's freighter "Syrmian," which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from London via Singapore, brought over 29,000 bags of cement and over 1,000 tons of miscellaneous goods from Britain, as well as 5,630 pieces of pine lumber from Singapore, and also 488 boxes of legal tender. The Chinese and American Shipping Company's manager Lamas, arrived from the United States with 13,140 pieces of cotton, which is relief supplies. The Taikoo Company's British and American freighter arrived from Qinhuangdao with 600 bags of cement.

### Dutch Gold Nationalized, Includes Precious Metals and Foreign Currencies

[Reuters, The Hague, 25th] The Dutch government has ordered the Dutch people to deposit or sell all gold, precious metals, and any currency held abroad to the Dutch Bank by July 23. Gold or precious metals acquired after July 8 without approval must also be deposited with the bank within ten days of acquisition.

### 300 Tons of Yangquan White Coal Arrive: Fierce Price Surge in Firewood and Charcoal

The white coal market remains firm, and all goods are steadily at their peak. 300 tons of Yangquan white coal were transported by Dalian ship yesterday. High-grade bituminous coal is in short supply on the market, and users are still actively purchasing, so the market price continues to rise. Bituminous coal powder is still depressed due to poor sales, and the market price is getting lower and lower. Firewood and charcoal have been boosted by the rise in white coal, and all parties' interest has turned active. Also, due to the scarcity of supply, the market atmosphere has suddenly improved, and all goods have seen a price surge.

### Disaster Victims and Refugees in the Five Southern Provinces Appeal to La Guardia

— A Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent Lin Youlan in Hong Kong, dated the 17th

They painstakingly repaired the Yuehan Railway and built the Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway, fully expecting to receive large quantities of relief supplies from UNRRA... but La Guardia's ban deprived them of assistance!

Hong Kong is one of the three major UNRRA transportation centers in China. About 40% or more of the UNRRA relief supplies shipped to China are transshipped through Hong Kong. This percentage will continue to increase in the future, because behind Hong Kong lies the vast disaster area of South China, with countless famine victims and refugees awaiting urgent relief. Since the successive repairs and openings of the Yuehan Railway and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway, the relief supplies stranded on the opposite shore of Hong Kong in Kowloon for the past six months due to transportation difficulties are now surging into the disaster areas of Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Guangxi like a tide along this major transportation artery. But at this time, the UNRRA Director-General ordered the suspension of relief shipments to China, which is a terrible blow to the disaster victims who have placed the greatest hope in UNRRA and have managed to survive through wind and dew over the years!

Mr. La Guardia ordered the suspension of relief shipments to China, initially saying that the relief supplies were being "used for political purposes"; then he pointed to "China's inability to supply facilities for unloading materials and the lack of inland transportation"; later he blamed the inefficiency of our distribution agencies. In addition to the fact that Director-General Jiang of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has answered each of these points one by one, the reporter would like to summarize the opinions of people in South China and add a few more words: (1) There are no political disputes in the South China region; (2) Transportation facilities in South China are improving day by day; (3) With smooth transportation, the drawbacks of the distribution agencies can be reduced. From this point of view, Mr. La Guardia made this "inhumane" decision without clearly understanding the situation in China, at least in South China.

Why Should Disaster Victims Suffer?

Everyone knows that the Yuehan Railway was repaired with the assistance of UNRRA. The flour eaten by the road workers was supplied by UNRRA, the road materials were supplied by UNRRA, and the replacement locomotives and freight cars were also supplied by UNRRA... The Chinese engineers did not fail UNRRA's good intentions and repaired this badly damaged railway in half a year. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway was also repaired with the assistance of UNRRA. The disaster victims in South China are now asking in unison: Why did Mr. La Guardia order the suspension of relief shipments to China? Why is the opening of the railway and highway regarded as "lack of transportation"? Is it because there is this excuse of "lack of transportation" that it is better to "temporarily lend" the food (2,000 tons of white rice) stranded in Kowloon to the Hong Kong government, and leave the famine victims in Hunan and Guangxi behind?

UNRRA is not unaware of the current tragic situation of the disaster victims in Hunan and Guangxi. President Truman's representative inspected the disaster areas of Hunan and Guangxi a month ago and publicly stated that he believed it was necessary to increase relief supplies in order to provide assistance. We understand UNRRA's situation and are unwilling to force others to do what is difficult and insist on demanding the allocated relief figures, but Mr. La Guardia must not think that he can be deceived and even order the suspension of relief shipments to China. Now, although we have agreed to continue shipping food to China, the refugees in South China, who are severely affected by the disaster, need other material relief in addition to the meager food. In South China, especially in Hunan and Guangxi, UNRRA has an unshirkable responsibility for the reconstruction of rural areas, the construction of industry, and even the dissemination of culture. Now that the transportation network in South China has been gradually restored, UNRRA's supplies are piled up on the west coast of the United States, and Mr. La Guardia is sitting idly by while millions of disaster victims, who have lost their homes and possessions in order to win the common victory of the Allied countries, are suffering from hunger and cold and are on the verge of death, and is tolerating the interruption of the relief supplies they have been praying for day and night. This is not justified in terms of reason or morality.

Please Look at the Disaster Situation

According to the reporter's investigation, the UNRRA relief food currently waiting to be transported in Kowloon is only 16,600 tons. According to the person in charge of the Kowloon Storage and Transportation Bureau, about 1,000 tons of relief supplies are transported from Kowloon to the provinces every day, so this number can be transported within two or three weeks. Other machinery, such as agricultural implements, trucks, and railway equipment, is also being assembled and successively imported into the interior of South China via highways or railways. The number of industrial raw materials allocated by UNRRA, such as cotton and cement, is extremely small, and the actual needs are even further apart. Even if Mr. La Guardia allows food and transportation equipment to continue to be shipped to China, without machinery and industrial raw materials, our factories will not be able to start work, and there will be no way to rebuild our villages and towns destroyed by the enemy. Millions of men and women will at most live a life of half-full and half-hungry, and will not escape the suffering of disaster victims. The UNRRA relief supplies were already insufficient to meet the actual needs. Mr. La Guardia recently departed from the United States to inspect UNRRA's operations in Europe. We hope that he can visit China along the way, especially taking the trouble to visit the provinces of Hunan and Guangxi, which are the most severely affected by the disaster, and see the real situation of his close neighbors on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. I believe that the clear-sighted and decisive former mayor of New York will regret his miscalculation in ordering the suspension of shipments!

"Death Warrant"

Millions of disaster victims in the five southern provinces are now hoping that Mr. La Guardia will quickly revoke the ban and actively transport relief supplies to China. They still have a sincere sense of appreciation for UNRRA and Mr. La Guardia. If Mr. La Guardia still fails to understand the true situation, is ignorant of the facts, and insists on going his own way, then Mr. La Guardia will create an extremely bad impression in the minds of the disaster victims in South China—in the minds of all the Chinese people. What is the reason for this? Please allow the reporter to state it:

The Yuehan Railway, which runs through Central and South China, was opened by UNRRA as the first railway to be repaired in China after the war. If what it brings into South China and even the interior of China is not the supplies that can alleviate disasters and save lives, but the European and American goods that absorb China's remaining economic blood, not the relief supplies that are relied on to revive the broken and dismembered rural villages and towns, but the foreign materials that destroy the vitality of Chinese society, not the machinery and tools that build up the dying national industry, but the cheap commodities that overwhelm China's economic recovery, then Mr. La Guardia will be giving the disaster victims in China the most effective "death warrant", accelerating the death of the disaster victims in China, and at the same time contributing to the total collapse of China's economy and society!

Final Expectations

The reporter would like to specifically point out: The warehouses in Hong Kong are now filled with various cheap European and American goods and expensive luxury goods, ready to take advantage of the Yuehan Railway to enter the interior of China in two ways, pouring into the interior of China with the power of gold dollars and pounds, making a new attempt to "conquer" China. Of course, we cannot blame this possible tide of violence and waves on Mr. La Guardia's unwise decision. But UNRRA is an international organization that "relieves" disaster victims and assists countries that have suffered from war in "post-war" rehabilitation. In the past, it has continuously given us various material assistance to relieve the vast disaster situation and gradually revive the countries that have been severely destroyed. If the work is abandoned halfway, we have sufficient reason to ask Mr. La Guardia to immediately revoke the ban and continue to transport relief supplies as much as possible to meet our urgent needs—to eliminate the disaster situation and revive China.

The reporter is stationed in South China and has witnessed the above-mentioned matters, and only looks at this national issue from the perspective of South China. It cannot be denied that there have been many problems with the distribution agencies of relief supplies in South China. The disaster victims in South China feel this more keenly than Mr. La Guardia, and have now asked the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to strive for reform. Mr. La Guardia has a compassionate heart to help the world, and should think from a broad perspective, and should not give up eating because of choking, or abandon the fundamentals and pursue the trivial, resulting in adverse consequences. The disaster victims in South China's accusations against Mr. La Guardia are well-intentioned. Until now, they do not seem to have lost their expectations for UNRRA.

A Sad Tale of Guangxi
— A Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong in Guilin, dated the 10th

Soaring prices are like a ruthless iron whip, striking people's hearts with panic and chaos. Rice! Rice! Rice! How many people are anxiously thinking about tomorrow's rice in their dreams, but how many people are using their position, borrowing their name, and colluding with some rice thieves from some bureau or public treasury who should have been shot long ago to desperately collect rice and hoard it like crazy, with compassionate words on their lips, but sucking the blood of the famine victims in their stomachs!

The Latest Model of Automobile Recently Invented in the United States (A Special Photograph sent by Our Correspondent for the New York Times)

### Selling Children with Straw Marks

At a meeting of the Guilin City Council, the councilors asked with heartache and indignation: "Is there anyone hoarding goods to make a profit?" The answer was very generous: "The city government is paying close attention to this matter and has sent people to investigate everywhere. No hoarding has been found in the city so far." Beautiful, proper, and superior. If there is to be any discovery, unless Bao Zheng is resurrected. The "official stockpiles" of hundreds of thousands of catties in the suburbs, when will they have mercy?

On the one hand, officials are plotting and laughing slyly with the rice, and on the other hand, tragedies of selling children with straw marks are found everywhere in the province, lined up on the streets. With 150 catties of grain, you can happily take away a hungry "soul". Before the crops have turned green or yellow, and before right and wrong can be distinguished, what can heaven do?

### Cannot Steal, Difficult to Endure Hunger

There are too many reports about bandits. Talking about some petty thieves may not be boring. When the relief rice from UNRRA arrived in Guilin, the famine victims ran to the rice boats and dug open the rice bags with their fingers, stealing three or five taels and tasting a meal of old punches. When the relief flour was "collected and stored" in the warehouse, the famine victims scraped the powder from the outside of the bags with bamboo strips in groups, and were also severely beaten. When the rice entered the warehouse and the flour also entered the warehouse, the famine victims had to wait and see. The taro and sweet potato seeds planted outside the fields were dug up before they even sprouted. A "gentle thief" dug up a patch of sweet potato seeds from a She field and left a note on the ground: "Knowing that seeds cannot be stolen, it is pitiful that hunger is unbearable." Fourteen characters, so glaring.

### Three Million Potential Starving Ghosts

The new crops are far away, and the collection of land taxes is like ten thousand stars of fire. The collection of taxes is as many as the numbers, not a single point is reduced. In addition, another 30% of public grain must be added. How many disasters, but another big stone must be pressed on them! The people of Guangxi are born with a hard life. They dare not complain, nor will they complain. If the country wants them to die, how can they resist? I hope the government will show more pity, and they will endure the tears without saying a word.

In addition to land taxes and public grain, there are also ropes that are tightly wrapped around the hearts of the people of Guangxi. After the revision of the fiscal revenue and expenditure system, the original budgeted revenue of Guangxi Province was 3 billion yuan, while the expenditure was 8 billion yuan, with a total deficit of 5 billion yuan. Where does this 5 billion yuan come from? Naturally, the wool always comes from the sheep. Every three steps is inseparable from the word "tax", and now the tax items in almost every county are too many to count. In addition to land taxes and public grain, there are prosperity donations, military grain, self-defense donations, garrison donations, slaughter taxes, tobacco and alcohol license taxes, restaurant taxes, health surcharges, use license taxes, public scale fees, stall donations, ... and I don't know how many temporary levies, truly donating everything and donating heavily, with many patterns, which cannot be fully described. Adding to the 5 billion yuan, 3.15 million of the province's 14.6 million people are famine victims who are "potential starving ghosts", to squeeze out their intestines and internal organs.

### A Miserably Small Disaster Relief Donation

The disaster is deep and heavy; how much progress is there in the work of rescuing the starving and saving lives? One drought after another, one flood after another, scaring people so much that their hearts leap to their lips. It's already the sixth month of the lunar calendar, and the new grain should have been harvested long ago, but the rice in the fields hasn't sprouted yet. The number of people lying on the ridges of the fields starving to death is increasing day by day. There's no money for disaster relief, so we rely on donations. Most people in the province are waiting to be saved, so where will the money come from? The county with the fewest disaster victims has 30,000 people, and the county with the most has as many as 97% of its population affected by the disaster. The province can't think of any other way, so it can only extend a hand for help! Fellow Guangxi natives living outside the province have been running around appealing for help, and the Guangzhou headquarters has ordered its subordinates to cut back on food and donate. The Shanghai press has also raised some money on behalf of the victims. But all this adding up makes for a pitifully small amount. To be honest, the disaster in Guangxi is no lighter than the one in Hunan, but the results of the relief efforts are as different as earth and sky. Why is this? We beg our compatriots across the country to save the lives of the people of Guangxi!

Amidst the cries of disaster, the Provincial Assembly has finally achieved a result: the dispute over the speaker has been resolved. The Ministry of Interior replied with a telegram, stating that there was no reason to consider Chen Xiguang's four votes with the character "Xi" as invalid votes. As a result, Chen Xiguang was steadily elected Speaker of the Assembly with 44 votes. Li Renren failed. The Assembly, which had been in a complete mess, finally saw clear skies. Chen assumed the post of Speaker, and the Provincial Government was finally willing to attend and give a policy report (the Provincial Authorities refused to attend and give a policy report while the Speaker issue was unresolved). The congress was extended, and the assemblymen once again made appeals for disaster relief and raised stern questions. It seems as if many things combined are like an unhealed wound, and every time it is soothed, it is pain and blood. The people of Guangxi have truly suffered enough!

### Such a Township Head!

Dear Editor:

I have a relative who was a very kind farmer before the war. During the war, he joined the National Army to resist the enemy. After our village fell, he joined the guerrillas to harass the enemy. After the victory, he returned to his village and continued to farm. Unexpectedly, he was accused by the township head, So-and-so, using his henchmen, of being a stray guerrilla fighter. He was detained and extorted. Later, the local troops found out about it and, because there was no evidence, he was released. However, my relative lost more than 20 "shi" of rice as a result. But the township head really knows how to take advantage of opportunities, so he threatened the ignorant villagers who originally accused my relative, and they also lost more than 30 "shi" of rice. The township head, fearing that the matter would be exposed, framed my relative again, and unfortunately he was detained again. I dare to ask the authorities to uphold justice and thoroughly investigate this matter, so as to relieve the people of their suffering. (A villager from Chashan Township, Jinwei District, Jinshan County)

### The Abominable Wenzhou Liners

Dear Editor:

The shipowners of the liners sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou are heartless and insane, and the ship's stewards are vicious and unscrupulous, extorting passengers without restraint, leaving them in great distress with nowhere to turn! Here are six of the most egregious examples: Can there really be no law and no order on the seas?

1. The ships have a limited carrying capacity. The shipowners, blinded by greed, secretly load cargo after the customs officers have sealed the hatches, so that the goods are piled up like mountains, blocking the passage, and even the places for urination and defecation are used for storing goods. If they encounter storms, the danger is extreme!

2. After the ships arrive at port, soldiers are asked to guard the hatches and passengers are not allowed to board until the day of departure. At this time, the cargo is already piled up and the hatches cannot be reopened, so male and female passengers, young and old, have to climb aboard using ropes (their luggage is only hung outside the ship). Moreover, it was raining that day and the ropes were slippery. A misstep could mean disaster for the elderly and young.

3. The fare for each person in steerage includes 3,200 yuan for food (a total of four meals, averaging 800 yuan per meal). The shipowners require this to be collected at the time of ticketing. Two meals are served each day, with no vegetables at all, so that passengers eat less. They don't care at all if passengers starve or get sick for two days and three nights. It is estimated that after one voyage, they can rake in millions of yuan from food costs alone.

4. After buying a ticket for steerage, one could originally lie down on the floor of the steerage area, but unexpectedly it is completely filled with cargo. The stewards forcibly set up sleeping boards, each of which (about three feet wide) is sold for 30,000 yuan, with the permission of the shipowner. As a result, those who cannot afford to buy a board have nowhere to stand. How can they not get sick after two days and three nights!

5. The ship's stewards treat the passengers like prisoners, with harsh voices and unbearable attitudes. If you argue with them, you run the risk of being beaten!

### The Key to Managing Grain

Dear Editor: Since Mayor Wu strictly cracked down on speculation, the price of rice in Shanghai has remained stable for a long time, for which we citizens are deeply grateful. However, with strict price controls, traders have no profit to be made, and the amount of rice stored in Shanghai is gradually decreasing. In the future, if the source really becomes scarce, the black market price will be unimaginably high. Furthermore, low grain prices hurt farmers, which will also affect rice production in the future. Rice is produced and sold domestically. Instead of trying to lower the price of rice, we should allow it to have a reasonable price so that farmers are not at too much of a disadvantage and do not feel that farming is not worthwhile. There were examples of farming being unprofitable last year, and it is even harder to say this year. The key to managing grain is to minimize exploitation between producers and consumers, so that merchants do not reap huge profits. It is definitely not enough to just focus on lowering the price of rice. We who live in the city only hear the voices of consumers, and rarely hear the voices of producers, so our views differ from those of farmers. (Shi Chisheng)

### Surplus Milk for Starving Children

Dear Editor:

According to reports, milk sheds in this city are pouring milk into sewers due to poor business. The goods are discarded on the ground, wasting resources, which is a great pity. I wonder, is this surplus milk? Or is it sour milk? In my opinion, if it is indeed good milk, it could be sent to refugee camps daily. I imagine that many refugees suffer from malnutrition, or are infants and young children lacking wet nurses. This would allow them to get adequate nutrition, which would preserve the nation's vitality. Milk sheds would also find a suitable way to dispose of the milk. I hope the owners of milk sheds in this city will consider adopting this suggestion. (Yu Yuying)

### Talking About Essential Medicines for Malaria

– Xu Xiangren, an Old Man of Sixty-Six

Dear Editor: Mr. Chen Guofu, as a party and state elder, advocated for traditional Chinese medicine. 消盡, I saw the chronicle yesterday and suddenly arrived with it, drafting this short article. I do not wish to use this to seek fame, but merely as a reference. I wish you success in your work! Respectfully submitted by Xu Xiangren.

Social Services

To understand the treatment of malaria, one must first understand the source of malaria. It occurs after the Beginning of Autumn, End of Heat, and White Dew periods. Having chills followed by fever is considered true malaria. Having chills and fever at irregular times in spring, summer, and winter is considered similar to malaria. Experiencing it once a day indicates a mild case; once every two days indicates a more severe case; once every three days indicates the most severe case. Malaria is caused by external factors such as sudden cold after heat, seeking coolness and being exposed to dew, blocking the "rong wei" [Nutritive Qi and Defensive Qi, which comprise the Wei Qi] and "qi." Internal factors include consuming too much raw, cold, greasy food, suppressing the stomach Qi and preventing it from spreading. Malaria does not have as many variations as typhoid fever, but tertian malaria can linger for years, forming a "malaria mother" [splenomegaly], causing a yellow complexion and thinness, indicating exhaustion of stomach Qi.

The most effective medicines for malaria are Changshan and Caoguo. Changshan has a cold nature and is toxic, causing vomiting. It should be stir-fried with ginger juice before use. Malaria cannot develop without phlegm; phlegm is transformed from greasy substances. It is commonly believed that malaria patients who can eat are easier to treat, because beggars have no access to meat and greasy food, so no phlegm is produced in their stomachs. Changshan can remove the phlegm, so it is called a "robber agent." Caoguo has a warm nature and is non-toxic, not causing vomiting. It can transform cold phlegm and dispel miasma from fog and dew, so it is considered as important as Changshan and is also an effective medicine for malaria. From the perspective of a medical doctor prescribing medicine (the perspective of a medical doctor prescribing medicine and a pharmacist compounding it are completely different), these two ingredients alone cannot form a prescription. Therefore, if cold prevails, Cinnamon Twig and ginger are added. If heat prevails, Skullcap and Anemarrhena are added (sometimes it is necessary to use both cold and heat remedies). For excessive phlegm, Pinellia Ternata, Fritillariae Cirrhosae and Tangerine Peel are added. These are all essential medicines for true malaria. As for warm malaria, miasma malaria, female malaria, male malaria, malaria forming nodules (malaria mother), malaria turning into consumption, use Cornu Cervi Degelatinatum and Aconite for Yang areas, and Polygonum Multiflorum and Dolichos Lablab for Yin areas. After the illness, it is necessary to regulate the spleen and stomach, and to avoid pork (there used to be a farmer in Muxi Township who would experience severe chills and tremors every time he ate fresh pork, and he would recover on his own. The villages are prone to malaria, and he must have had tertian malaria), duck meat, cold and raw shellfish, mung beans, hyacinth beans, tofu, vermicelli, and bean curd sheets for 100 days. If these are violated within 100 days, there will invariably be a relapse. During and after the illness, it is necessary to leave the table. All who are treating or being treated for malaria must know this.

[Note from Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner Shen Yaoxian] Mr. Xiangren has been practicing medicine for decades and has unique experiences in treating illnesses. His discussion of the relationship between patients' dietary habits and constitution is to take the patient into account, so his treatment plan applies different methods based on different constitutions. This is a truly profound meaning. However, the source of malaria is mostly the transmission of bacteria by mosquitoes, so Western medicine uses quinine to treat malaria, aiming to kill the bacteria. Sometimes arsenic and mercury preparations, such as 606, are injected to treat severe malaria. From this, we can see that the first priority in treating malaria is to kill the bacteria. Changshan and Caoguo are indeed effective in cutting off malaria. Changshan has a cold nature, a bitter taste, and is poisonous. It is not yet confirmed in current pharmacological experiments whether it has the ability to kill bacteria, but it can stimulate the central nervous system, reduce body temperature, reduce the excretion of nitrogen, and prevent the rise of body temperature. It is indeed effective. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the focus is on dispelling phlegm and fluids. Caoguo has a warm nature and a pungent taste, and its functions include cutting off malaria with phlegm, eliminating accumulated cold food. Doctors say, "Malaria cannot occur without phlegm." Using the two phlegm-expelling ingredients is no different from driving out bacteria, which has a profound meaning. Based on my limited understanding, Changshan and Caoguo are essential medicines for cutting off malaria, but the addition of vermifuges such as smoked plums, betel nuts, and Dichroa Febrifuga, if symptoms allow, would be even more effective.

Dear Sir, We are writing to inform you that on the afternoon of the first of this month, a motorized sailboat departed from Qinglong Port to Shanghai, carrying about 30 to 40 male and female passengers. While passing near Shizilin in Baoshan County, a fire suddenly broke out and the boat burned. At the time, male and female passengers jumped into the river to save their lives, and their fate is unknown. On the morning of the 4th, a female corpse of unknown origin was floating on the sea embankment outside the north gate of this town. The female corpse was approximately 40 years old, with a long, round face and long hair. She was wearing a dark blue homespun short shirt, black homespun trousers, small feet, and white socks. She had no shoes. Her height was approximately 4 feet 9 inches. We have already prepared a coffin and buried her on her behalf. We hope that the deceased's family members will quickly come to this town's office to claim the burial. We respectfully ask your newspaper to borrow a corner to publish this on our behalf, and we will be eternally grateful. Respectfully, to the Editor of the Shen Bao, Baoshan County Chengxiang District Chengxiang Town Office.

Health and Medicine

### A Historical Account of Cholera

— Zheng Weiru

Opening modern medical books, the definition of cholera reads, "An acute, specific infectious disease affecting the ileum, characterized by copious rice-water stools, watery diarrhea, vomiting, muscle cramps, anuria, collapse, and death. It is an endemic disease, often spreading via water and land routes to become an epidemic. The causative agent is the cholera vibrio." From this definition, one can understand the symptoms, transmission, and causative agent of cholera. Ancient Chinese medical texts, such as the "Neijing," state that disorders in the stomach and intestines are called cholera. The "Ling Shu" says, "Clear qi is in the yin, turbid qi is in the yang; when clear and turbid interfere, it is cholera." These texts mostly describe abnormal gastrointestinal symptoms without classifying cholera as a specific disease. Although the "Neijing" may not date back to antiquity, it was transmitted by people during the Zhou and Qin dynasties, so around 1000 BC, China probably did not have the current form of cholera. Leafing through the revised and enlarged "Complete Book of Cold Damage," "jiaochangsha" (twisting bowel disorder) is described as, "In summer, without headache or fever, but feeling pain in the lower abdomen, or pain and distension in both the heart and abdomen, unable to stretch. People may suspect it is yin syndrome or attribute it to eating too much raw and cold food, not knowing it is due to summer heat flowing and concentrating, and the internal organs unable to resolve it, thus the lower abdomen pains first, then spreads to the heart and abdomen." This seems to describe symptoms like bowel obstruction or visceral stones, not true cholera. The same book also describes the vomiting method for "dry cholera": "Summer heat enters the abdomen, causing nausea and abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, the diarrhea being like water pouring out. This is due to the violent eruption of summer heat, disrupting ascent and descent, separating clear and turbid, and the diarrhea is the body fluids of the five viscera. It should be stopped quickly... Sometimes this condition is mixed with food stagnation, which doctors mistake for food injury and treat with purging, which is wrong. Some also say that it is the removal of impurities, not knowing that the body fluids are rapidly depleted, and the original qi is greatly damaged. Stopping it immediately is the best course. Furthermore, if there is no vomiting or diarrhea, it is dry cholera, causing immediate death..." Whether this condition is the same as today's true dry cholera is impossible to confirm because the description is not thorough. This book was compiled and edited by Zhang Heteng in the third year of the Tianqi era (1623), drawing on various famous masters. According to Koda Tsutomu's experience, the modern so-called dry cholera has no diarrhea, but this does not mean there is no exudate in the intestines. In many cases, patients did not have diarrhea before death, but autopsy revealed the intestines filled with fluid. Cholera deaths without vomiting or diarrhea are rare. According to the works of Anaslan and Tuhui Ning, there is little mention of this. Kerping also stated that this condition is extremely rare. Mike Folsom even frankly said that he had never seen dry cholera. Therefore, whether the above description is a symptom of acidosis is unknown. The original book also states that summer syndrome develops into fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and cholera, and after prolonged illness, develops into malaria and dysentery... thus, vomiting, diarrhea, malaria, and dysentery are indistinguishable, which is a far-fetched argument.

In 1813, Wu Tang published "Wenbing Tiaobian" (Analysis of Warm Diseases), stating, "Cholera is most common in the long summer, rooted in yang deficiency and cold-dampness accumulation, and its impact is not light, harming people in an instant." It also says, "Vomiting and dysentery, cold and heat, body pain, or no cold or heat, but abdominal pain, is called cholera." It further states, "Vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, fever, chills, stiff limbs, cold hands and feet." Judging from the symptoms, it is quite similar to true cholera. This book was written ten years before it was published, so China had true cholera before 1803. However, to diagnose cholera from a modern scientific medical perspective, the true cholera vibrio must be detected in the patient's vomit and diarrhea. However, clinical experience shows that symptoms can closely resemble cholera but the patient's vomit and diarrhea do not contain the cholera vibrio. Conversely, some patients with symptoms unlike cholera have cholera vibrio detected in their feces.

The Homeland of Cholera

According to "Cholera" by Rogers, "The cholera records of the 1817 Indian pandemic are indeed detailed and accurate. At that time, the epidemic was so widespread and virulent that some considered it a new disease unprecedented in history. However, according to John McPherson, the records of Sanskrit historians and Hippocrates as early as 400 BC are quite similar to today's cholera. From 1503 to 1817, there were about a dozen cholera epidemics. In the 17th century, cholera was reported in the east coast of India, the East Indies, and China. From 1781 to 1783, it spread from Calcutta to Madras and Burma, almost reaching all parts of India. After 1794, it remained dormant for 23 years until it started spreading from Bengal, the home of cholera, to other places in 1817, reaching neighboring states, and the epidemic subsided in 1823." There are many conflicting opinions regarding the occurrence of this disease. In 1826, Kahn insisted that the disease must be transmitted by contact.

Spread to Europe

Wang Xunchen's "Yilin Cuocuo" (Corrections in the Forest of Medicine) states, "In the xinmao year of Daoguang's reign [1821], vomiting, diarrhea, and cramping affected several provinces, especially the capital. Too many people died. The poor who could not afford burial received coffins from the national treasury, costing hundreds of thousands of taels of silver in just over a month." Chen Xiuyuan's "Yixue Shizaiyi" (Practical Explanations of Medicine) records, "A student asked: 'In the gengchen and xinji years [1820, 1821], many people in Fujian died from this disease, starting in May and peaking in June and July, gradually lessening and becoming easier to cure after the White Dew season. In the gengchen year, there was a severe drought and extreme heat in the summer, so people thought the disease was caused by the heat. In the xinji year, there was no flooding but it was cold in the summer, so people thought the disease was caused by cold invasion. Yet the symptoms were the same in both years. What is the reason?'" The xinmao year of Daoguang's reign, 1821, and the first major cholera epidemic with reliable historical records occurred from 1817 to 1823, originating in the province of Bengal, India, corresponding to the years of Jiaqing 21 to Daoguang 3. Yu Yan's "Landao Yuhua" (Jade Talks from the Cold Hut) quotes "Lu Dingpu's Lanting Yuhua (Jade Talks from the Orchid Pavilion) saying, 'Since the gengchen year of Jiaqing [1820], patients have been continuous.'" He also quotes Xu Xinmu as saying, "In the xinmao year of Daoguang, this disease was rampant." Therefore, he says, "The epidemic of cholera in our country started in Fujian province in the 23rd year of Jiaqing [1818], and spread to various provinces, reaching Yanjing [Beijing] in the following year of Daoguang 1 [1821], clearly spreading from south to north." According to records, in 1818 (Jiaqing 23), cholera was transmitted from India to Fujian via water routes, then spread north to the capital. The major epidemic in India, Persia, and Europe from 1826 to 1837 also originated in Bengal, spreading north from Calcutta to Poland, Sweden, Berlin, Vienna, and Edinburgh. In 1832, London saw 4,000 deaths, and Paris had 7,000 deaths in 18 days. Quebec and Montreal in Canada, and New York in the United States, were also affected. Later, Portugal, Spain, and Italy were not spared. The epidemic completely stopped in 1838. At that time, transportation was still primitive, so it took five years to spread from Bengal to Europe. Later, due to the increasing development of transportation, it often spread from India to Europe in just a few months.

European Epidemics

During the European epidemic of 1847-1849, it is said that Russia had one million deaths, and Britain had over fifty-three thousand deaths. In 1849, Dr. Snow proposed that cholera was caused by toxins in the vomit and diarrhea of patients. If these toxins were ingested by others, they could be produced in large quantities in the intestines. He also stated that poor sewage systems allowed excrement to flow into rivers and wells. If this water was used for drinking, it would cause infection. At the same time, Bouchet also stated that cholera was caused by microorganisms growing in the intestines. However, in 1856, the Royal College of Physicians of England's theory of airborne transmission of toxins prevailed, overturning the above two theories completely.

Global Pandemic

In subsequent years, such as 1855, 1863, and 1866, several global pandemics originated in India, spreading to neighboring countries and Europe. From 1879-1883, the development of railway transportation in India caused the spread to accelerate. In 1883, Egypt had 50,000 deaths. Experts from Germany, France, and England were sent to conduct on-site investigations. Finally, Professor Koch of Germany discovered comma-shaped bacteria in the vomit and diarrhea of patients, revealing the secret of the cholera pathogen. At that time, McNamarra had gained considerable insights into cholera research. He had hypothesized that the rice-water excrement of cholera patients contained microorganisms, but the British government refused to fund McNamarra's research on this issue. After the Koch's research team published the germ theory, the British government sent bacterial experts to India to investigate, but the results of the investigation denied Koch's views.

During 1892-1895, the spread of cholera was even faster than before. In less than five months, it had spread from the northwestern provinces of India to St. Petersburg (Leningrad). Hamburg in Germany was also affected, and it spread to the United Kingdom and the United States within a few days. From 1918 to 1919, 500,000 people died in India from the major epidemic.

Point of Origin in India

Looking at the above history of cholera pandemics, most of them originated in India, with the delta downstream of the Ganges River in Bengal as the center of transmission. Therefore, Bengal is known as the "home of cholera." After the major epidemic from India spread to our country 95 years before the founding of the Republic of China, there have been annual epidemics, resulting in many deaths.

The Theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine

Among Confucian doctors in our country who personally experienced cholera epidemics and wrote medical theories, Wang Mengying stands out. He wrote "Cholera Treatise" (1837) and "Revised Cholera Treatise from Suixi Residence" (1862), both based on the theories of the Neijing and the Shanghan Lun, focusing on the debate between cold and heat. We cannot be overly critical, but we must praise his cholera theory, which states, "Cholera, sometimes called 'hanging leg spasm,' refers to cholera with muscle cramping, not a separate disease." "Cholera, sometimes called 'twisting bowel disorder,' is dry cholera." "Regardless of whether cholera exhibits cold limbs, aversion to cold, a white tongue, and a completely yin-cold appearance... it must be understood that cholera is always caused by summer heat. Extreme heat can resemble cold, which is false cold. Therefore, Xu Lingtai said that cold cholera is rare, occurring less than one in a hundred cases." It also says, "Cholera is caused by heat, as stated in the Neijing. Liu Shouzhen said, 'The triple burner is the pathway for water and grain transformation. If the heat qi is excessive, transformation will be abnormal, causing vomiting, diarrhea, and cholera. The nature of fire is restless, so it is like this.' Yet the likes of Xue Lizhai dared to base their theories on cold, misleading future generations. All who suffer from heat cholera are killed by these gentlemen." It also says, "Cholera belongs to heat, according to the Neijing. Liu Shouzhen said that the Sanjiao is the pathway of water and grain transformation, and when heat qi is excessive, the transformation is abnormal leading to vomiting and diarrhea. Fire is of restless nature, as a result Xue Lizhai and others dared to base their arguments on cold, misleading posterity. The book was written by Xu Qi in 1888. At that time, Koch had already confirmed that the comma bacillus was the cause of cholera, and Pfeiffer had already tried using live comma bacillus for immunization. Xu Qi still cited scriptures, arguing about cold and heat. The postscript says, "In the past, Wen Taizhen burned rhinoceros horns to illuminate water monsters, counting them one by one... this theory is not just as clear as illuminating water monsters." The inescapable truth is not whether cholera belongs to cold or heat.

Prevention and Environment

We usually describe a large number as "countless as the sands of the Ganges." However, the number of deaths from cholera epidemics that have spread from the center of the lower Ganges River to various parts of the world can be compared to the sands of the Ganges. We look back at history, hoping to learn lessons from history as a mirror. In modern Europe, except for a small part of the southeast, there have been few cholera epidemics. Even in Japan, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and the British Malay Peninsula, the harm of cholera is decreasing. This is due to the combined effect of preventive injections and environmental sanitation. However, only preventive injections without attention to environmental sanitation are only half effective. A clean environment coupled with prevention is of course even better. If we believe that disease enters through the mouth, then environmental sanitation is even more important. Currently, preventive injections are limited to cholera, a disease that everyone fears. Typhoid preventive injections are implemented by only a few, and dysentery prevention is even less effective.

If environmental sanitation is good and the health organization is strict, cholera is not to be feared. During the cholera epidemic in Europe, the epidemic was rampant in countries such as Berlin, Russia, Austria, and France. Berlin maintained commercial and transportation ties with the outside world, but cholera could not gain a foothold in Berlin. This fully illustrates the importance of environment and sanitary administration.

Drinking Water and Cholera

The author spares no effort in seeking details, and again cites historical facts to prove the above. In 1892, over 8,600 citizens of Hamburg died from cholera. At that time, Hamburg's drinking water was drawn from the Elbe River, but the city's drainage also discharged into the river. Due to tidal action, excrement flowed back upstream of the water source. Citizens' drinking water was first led to a pond for sedimentation, but there was no filtration equipment. As the city's population increased, the water demand also increased, so water was led to the reservoir, often without sufficient detention for sedimentation, and then used by citizens, resulting in many deaths from infection. At the same time, Altona, adjacent to Hamburg, also drew its drinking water from the Elbe River. All conditions were the same as Hamburg's, except that the drinking water had to be filtered through sand. However, only 328 people died from cholera. The following year, Hamburg added drinking water sand filtration equipment, and the epidemic was greatly reduced.

At this point, the author will describe the method of flies spreading germs to conclude. Cholera vibrio is extremely weak against dryness, and dies in ten minutes at 50 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the transmission of germs by the body, wings, and legs of flies is not important. However, cholera vibrio can survive in its intestines for several days. Flies mainly suck liquid and semi-liquid food. If they encounter solid food, they regurgitate liquid on the food, wait for the food to dissolve slightly, and then suck it up. Therefore, if its esophagus contains cholera vibrio, our food will be contaminated. Moreover, flies excrete their feces on food while sucking, so if this fly has stayed on the excrement of cholera patients and then stays on our food, our food may be infected with cholera bacteria. However, historical major cholera epidemics tell us that they are always due to water contamination. Flies may transmit some sporadic cases, but simply exterminating flies cannot prevent the spread of cholera. In summary, as long as we fully provide citizens with clean drinking water, fill in wells and ponds, remove garbage and excrement, and ban unsanitary food vendors, not only cholera, but other infectious diseases can be reduced to a minimum.

### The Latest on Streptomycin

— Fu Kang

Today, many people are waiting for the supply of Streptomycin. Dr. Keefer of Boston, USA, said that,

as reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Keefer is now bringing this drug to physicians, saying:

"Its main interest… is to determine its effectiveness and toxicity in certain infectious diseases that are not curable by sulfonamides, penicillin, and other therapies… They have many diseases waiting for us to study."

Of the available Streptomycin, the National Research Council accounts for about 31%, with the remainder allocated to the Army, Navy, U.S. Public Health Service, and Veterans Administration.

For disease use, Streptomycin is currently used to treat typhoid fever, food poisoning, undulant fever, tularemia, certain genitourinary infections, blood poisoning, meningitis, pneumonia, bacterial endocarditis, while research on tuberculosis is limited.

### Anemia and Iron-Supplementing Medicine (Part 2)

— Zhang Changshao

(3) The Impact of Anemia

Everyone knows that blood is the most precious substance in the body. The nutrients needed by every cell in the body must be supplied directly or indirectly by the blood. However, the most important nutrient is not protein or vitamins; oxygen is the nutrient most needed by the body's cells. The more important the organ, the more indispensable oxygen is. Oxygen deprivation in the brain for a few seconds can lead to unconsciousness; oxygen deprivation in the heart for one or two minutes can cause it to stop beating.

Oxygen is absorbed from the lungs and transported throughout the body to various organs and tissues, entirely dependent on the red blood cells within the blood. As far as we know now, the most important function of red blood cells is carrying oxygen, and it is almost their only function. Anemia is a reduction in the number of red blood cells in the blood, so the oxygen-carrying capacity of anemic patients will naturally be reduced, inevitably leading to mild or severe hypoxia.

Because the brain and heart are the most susceptible to oxygen deprivation, these two organs are the first to be affected when oxygen is lacking. Therefore, the various symptoms of anemia are mainly the result of brain and heart hypoxia. Naturally, the hypoxia caused by anemia is relative, not absolute, so it does not lead to unconsciousness or cardiac arrest. Patients with very mild anemia may not feel any abnormalities themselves, but they become short of breath and have a rapid heartbeat more easily than normal people when climbing steep slopes or engaging in slightly strenuous exercise. Patients with somewhat more severe anemia feel physically weak and fatigued easily, and cannot recover quickly after fatigue. They naturally dare not join classmates in strenuous activities such as ball games and swimming. Even when going upstairs or walking a little faster, they pant heavily, and their heart feels like it is about to jump out of their mouths. These patients often feel dizzy, have tinnitus, and are prone to fainting. The ankles often have slight edema. As for patients with severe anemia, they easily become short of breath and have a rapid heartbeat even without exertion, and these symptoms are naturally even more severe during exertion.

If chronic anemia is not corrected, all tissues throughout the body will be affected by hypoxia, resulting in not only illness but also premature aging.

(4) Causes of Anemia

The lifespan of red blood cells is much shorter than that of humans. From generation to destruction, the average duration is only about three weeks. Under normal circumstances, old red blood cells in the blood are constantly destroyed and die, and new red blood cells are constantly generated. The bone marrow is where new red blood cells are produced. If there is any disease in the bone marrow, or if it is damaged by certain substances, the function of red blood cell regeneration often becomes impaired, leading to severe anemia. This type of anemia is called aplastic anemia, and there is currently no effective treatment. Patients often die quickly after contracting the disease. Fortunately, this type of anemia is very rare. People with poor complexion should not be overly suspicious or worry unnecessarily.

More than 99% of common anemia is due to the excessive loss of red blood cells, which the bone marrow cannot replenish in time. Chronic bleeding or repeated bleeding is the external loss of red blood cells; accelerated destruction causes the internal loss of red blood cells.

Patients with hemorrhoids, gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, etc., often unknowingly bleed repeatedly, leading to anemia. Patients with hemorrhoids often bleed slightly each time they defecate. Although the amount of bleeding is small each time, the cumulative amount over time is considerable. Bleeding from gastric ulcers and duodenal ulcers is very common, but in most cases, it is not vomited out but excreted through the stool, so patients often do not pay much attention. Ulcer patients who have black stools are a sign of bleeding and should seek immediate medical treatment to avoid dangerous massive bleeding.

Adult women are more prone to anemia than men because of menstruation. The total amount of blood loss during each menstrual period averages about two fluid ounces, totaling as much as twenty-four fluid ounces per year. If the diet provides sufficient nutrition, it will naturally be replenished quickly, preventing anemia. However, if there is malnutrition or excessive menstruation, anemia is likely to occur.

Intestinal parasites, especially hookworm disease, are also prone to causing anemia. However, roundworms are generally not a cause of anemia. Many mothers suspect roundworms (the most common intestinal worm) are the cause when they see their children have a "poor complexion," which is a misconception.

Accelerated destruction of red blood cells in the blood is medically known as hemolysis. Hemolysis is also a cause of anemia. Many infectious diseases, especially chronic malaria and pulmonary tuberculosis, often cause hemolytic anemia. This is because microorganisms secrete a substance that destroys red blood cells. Several toxins can also produce the same situation.

All the various types of anemia mentioned above have clear causes, and common anemia falls into this category. In addition, there is a type of anemia called pernicious anemia. The cause is unknown, and the condition is extremely severe. If left untreated, it often leads to death. This type of pernicious anemia is extremely rare in China. It is feared that it is difficult to find one case in ten thousand anemic patients, so we do not need to consider it.

Spring and Autumn

### Saroyan

— Cao Xizhen

There was an inconceivable thing in the American literary world, that is: Although there is a writer, he has won the respect and love of a wide readership; Although his works will spread quickly after publication, selling all over the world, and being translated into many languages; Although his works are so meaningful and powerful. However, the gift he received under the criticisms of American critics with different opinions was mixed praise.

Saroyan is already a familiar name among Chinese new literature readers. Countless of his short stories have been introduced to readers after being translated successively by Mr. Lu Shuxiang, Mr. Chen Yuan and the author, etc. And his best short story collection "My Name is Aram" and the novel "The Human Comedy" have also been translated by Mr. Lu Shuxiang and Mr. Liu Wugou respectively. (The former was translated by Kaiming Bookstore, and the book title uses one of the stories, "The Pomegranate Tree"; the latter was published by Wenguang Bookstore. It is a pity that both books were published in Chongqing before the victory, and Shanghai has not reprinted them after the victory. This is undoubtedly a pity for readers in Shanghai who love Saroyan.)

Saroyan, his parents were both Armenians, was born in Fresno, California, USA in 1908. He did not go to school or read any books properly. In his youth, he worked as a newspaper boy, a telegram delivery boy, and did odd jobs on farms to maintain his independent life. He wanted to become a writer when he was thirteen years old. At that time, he was a telegram delivery boy, working during the day and studying on his own at night, reading some novels and also started learning to write. He went to school for some time at the age of fourteen, but left school again at the age of fifteen, and since then bid farewell to school.

Saroyan's fate of submitting manuscripts, like the path experienced by most writers, is equally unfortunate. Despite sending out manuscripts one after another, they were always returned, being thrown into the wastepaper basket by the editor. Later, he felt that imitating the style of previous writers would always lead to failure. Therefore, he decided to create "Saroyan's own style." Sure enough, the novel "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze" in the "Saroyan style" was not only selected and published by the editor, but also appreciated by some critics, giving it positive reviews. (After that, he continued to write more than a dozen short stories and published a collection of short stories titled "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze", which is also his debut collection.) This kind of criticism encouraged Saroyan to move forward on the road of creating his own unique style, and the determination to write novels in the "Saroyan style" became even more firm.

The sales of his novels were not too bad, and a large sum of royalties provided him with travel expenses to the Soviet Union. The impression of the Soviet Union made him write the short stories "The Singer from Omsk" and "Russian Writer". These were later collected in a short story collection called "Peace, It's Wonderful!".

He is a prolific writer. Up to now, he has written more than 500 short stories. The published short story collections include "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze", "Inhale and Exhale", "Little Children", "Peace, It's Wonderful!", "Three Times Three", "My Name is Aram", and "The Trouble with Tigers". "The Human Comedy" is a novel. His most recent short story collection is "Dear Baby", and the novel is "Adventures of Wesley Jackson".

His novels are mostly autobiographical, mostly writing about his life as a newspaper boy, clerk, farm assistant, telegram delivery boy, and student in his youth and childhood, and some people he came into contact with in life. For example, the telegram delivery boy in "The Human Comedy" is a shadow of his childhood.

After 1938, he not only continued to write novels, but also began to try writing scripts. The scripts he wrote include "My Heart's in the Highlands", "Love's Old Sweet Song" and "The Time of Your Life". Among them, "The Time of Your Life" was the most successful, and won both the "New York Drama Critics' Circle Award" and the "Pulitzer Prize" for drama. His plays are all humorous comedies.

Because Saroyan's works have his own unique style, he does not devote himself to the embellishment and gorgeousness of rhetoric, does not pay attention to grammar, does not like to study structure and skills, and does not like pretentiousness; he just uses simple conversations and some of the most economical explanations necessary to connect the conversations, and incorporates his own planned theme, and then completes his style. Of course, this style has aroused a kind of bad or even malicious criticism from some conservative and specialized critics who specialize in formal integrity, which is also very natural. It is of course right to say that his works do not pay attention to grammar, rhetoric, skills, and structure. However, it seems unfair to completely obliterate the great achievements of his original style and simply say that Saroyan is not acceptable.

As for the personalities of the characters portrayed in Saroyan's writings, they are very simple, and sometimes one even doubts whether such simple characters exist in the world. However, these simple characters are very lovely, so lovely that they make people laugh and scream for help. From these characters, we can see Saroyan's understanding of love and hate, friends and enemies for mankind; and, it also reflects Saroyan's outlook on life and the world.

Saroyan is being vilified on the one hand, and praised by some more objective critics on the other hand.

Saroyan's initial criticism can be said to be completely similar to that of the great American democratic poet Whitman. Moreover, Saroyan, like Whitman, rarely cares about external criticism. Indeed, he has always continued to write in accordance with his style. Saroyan once replied to critics: "I have my own style. No matter how you criticize, I will always move forward on my established creative path." "All I want to say is a simple story, and I'll say it however I want. I don't understand the rules of rhetoric, and I don't understand the secrets of writing." In addition, his counter-criticism to critics is: "Maybe writers see farther than critics, maybe critics see farther than writers."

Saroyan's success today is none other than because he can create his own style and not be an imitator or follower of any writer. Yes, writers should create their own style!

During World War I, he was a newspaper boy. And this time during the war, in order to understand the war and enrich his life, he resolutely joined the army. After the victory last year, he has returned to the United States from Europe to continue his writing life. Saroyan did not disappoint readers, and his "Adventures of Wesley Jackson" is a masterpiece completed with war as the theme.

Saroyan is still young. His efforts will surely bring him richer harvests; to the readers, there will surely be more, more solid, and more abundant food for the soul. Saroyan will never disappoint readers, himself, and the times. He has the power of creation, and he has his own creative methods. — July 16, 1946.

### The Fog of Mountain City

— Shi Bei

Fog, like love, plays on the heart of the mountain peaks, creating all kinds of beautiful changes. — Tagore

People who live in Chongqing will naturally appreciate the mystery of the fog. From August each year to April of the following year, this is the fog season. Misty and vast, like a fishing net cast into the vast sea before dawn, it envelops the sky, hills, houses, rivers, and is also attached to people's faces and hearts. Looking at this dense fog, it contains people's sorrows, anger, and hopes.

We often use the changes of fog to predict the weather: in the early morning, if we see waves of fog rising lightly and slowly from the surface of the Yangtze River and Jialing River, or from the small streams under the hills, gradually gathering into heavy fog, then the weather that day will definitely be sunny. However, if the early morning fog is sparse and scattered casually, that day will definitely be a day of light breeze and drizzle. At this time, a light mist floats on the river, and light rain dances obliquely in the fog, which is the true scene of "sails returning in misty rain" in the ancient books. However, this is completely different from the fog on a sunny day. I love the thick fog on a sunny day, because it is so thick and profound, like an impenetrable glass bead, but it also makes people yearn and guess. I also love the fog in the rain, because it is like light and soft gauze, like a bright dancing dress. From the vague and hazy isolation, you can glimpse the raindrops jumping in front of the window, and you can also look at the distant and faint returning sails from the window.

When the sky is filled with thick fog on a sunny day, the smoke from the houses mixed in the fog cannot be seen in the morning. The earth is locked in the fog. Running out of the house onto the street, it is impossible to see clearly beyond a distance of three or four feet. Cars coming and going are driving with their headlights on and honking their horns, moving slowly, sometimes even stopping to explore the way forward. Rickshaw pullers shout and yell, they walk even more slowly. From Lianglukou to Xiaoshizi, the road is relatively flat and straight, making it easier to walk, but it is necessary to be extra careful when passing through the lively Lianhua Street and the downhill and winding area of Shaanxi Road.

In the fog, the bustling sounds of the city are coming from ahead, but you cannot see the people moving. Standing on the towering city wall of Chuqimen, apart from hearing the noisy voices of the people in Haitangxi on the opposite bank and the clamor of the boatmen by the river, you cannot see anything else. At this time, you seem to feel like you are in a dream. Listening to the symphony of the busy, sad, and happy lives of the world, you will doubt whether the world is real or illusory!

At eight or nine o'clock in the morning, the sun hangs in the sky, but its light cannot overcome the obstruction of the fog, and it can only show its face like the moon. The sun is like moonlight, which is an interesting spectacle. The so-called "Sichuan dogs barking at the sun" is the situation at this time. Without the glare of strong light, we can raise our heads and stare at the sun, like appreciating the gentle and beautiful full moon. Until the sun is high in the sky, the sunlight gradually dissipates the fog. At this time, the sunlight completely shines on the ground, and the remaining fog on the river disappears like steam, but the white fog on the distant mountain peaks is still like silk ribbons that do not disperse.

When daytime passes, the fog follows the footsteps of the night and comes lightly.

The fog at night is a bit chilly. The street lights in the fog emit cold light, watching the dim night fog, moving silently. At this time, if you open the window, the fog outside will fight with the lights, and slowly it will want to flood the room, until the temperature in the room digests it into small water droplets, which are attached to the wall.

I remember that during the war, the people of Chongqing had to thank the fog for its grace, because during the more than half a year of the fog season, the fog protected the mountain city like an air defense net. Enemy planes did not dare to invade easily, and people could be free from the danger of air raids. This is the natural protection that fog built for Chongqing. Now, if you ask the people in the mountain city, they can still talk enthusiastically about the comfort of the fog season.

In addition to Chongqing being known as a famous fog city, London is also a world-famous fog city. It is said that the fog in London is yellow-ochre, but the fog in Chongqing has a clear, white, milky color. This is probably because London has many factories, and the air flow mixes with smoke, and the fog also mixes into a heavy yellow smoke. The surroundings of Chongqing, with hills and water, are almost entirely a green natural body, without too much turbid smoke from factories, so the fog still maintains a clear, floating, and light foam atmosphere.

The British all appreciate the fog in London and love the fog in London. They say that the reason why the British are particularly rich in steady political style and have a reserved and thoughtful character is due to the silent and subtle influence of the fog in London. Their poets also say that the fog can give them inspiration for reverie. They often chant the interest of the fog. Like this, the fog's influence on the British can be considered a kind of spiritual nectar. However, when we Chinese people talk about fog, we associate it with the gloomy and hateful side. This is not because we lack the wisdom of appreciation, nor is it because we are incompetent and cannot grasp the divine truth of fog, but because we only know how to live in peace in the fog, and use the obscurity of the fog to cover up other people's vision, secretly doing things that are not allowed to be shown in broad daylight. Therefore, many people are deceived and harmed, and the perpetrators can be free and at ease. So, we cursed the man-made fog every day, and gradually even the natural fog became the object of our disgust and curse.

Chongqing has had fog since ancient times, and this year and next year will be the same. Even in the infinite future, the natural fog will still come in the fog season, filling this mountain city. But whether our attitude towards fog is still as hateful as in the past depends on ourselves!

The fog season in the mountain city is coming soon. In the coastal city thousands of miles away, I can no longer see the soft fog shadow. I miss it, because I love the profound and magical white fog shadow spread on the earth!

### I Want to Be Strong

— Zhongyuan

I have never told you this sentence; you must not have expected someone as weak as me to say this sentence; in the deep night, in the early morning, in the quiet dream, even I myself wonder how I can say such a sentence today. But I want to tell you that since you shone into my life like a strange light, and then disappeared suddenly like a flash in the pan, I have had this sentence in my heart: I want to be strong!

I do not deny often shedding tears for you on bleak rainy nights. I also do not deny that since that day, I hid your letters, hid your photos, hid the last bit of memory you gave me, in that broken little drawer. To this day, I still haven't dared to open that drawer. Calculating the days, it has been six months. But I want to tell you that in these six months, I finally used the shield of reason to resist the fierce attack of emotion, and I lived like before, and I am saying this sentence: I want to be strong!

Of course, I will always remember that small room, which is where I first met you. I will also always remember the many meetings with you eight years ago, in that quiet alley. I will even more always remember that once you looked at me with strange eyes, sighed silently, and left. However, although these painful memories are all vividly in front of my eyes, I hold my head high from the pain, shouting this sentence: I want to be strong!

I remember you once said to me that you would come to my place to see me. Now I am still dreaming that one day a sudden miracle will appear: you are standing in front of me again, smiling at me, looking at me. At that time, I might cry bitterly to you like a child, or I might stretch out my cold hands to hold you tightly. But I believe that in the end, I will wipe away my tears, let go of your hand, and say to you: "I want to be strong!"

Long serialized novel

### Double Birds, One Nest (96)

— Zhao Qingge

"Mr. Dong!" Lihua called out softly.

Dong Shaoling was reading a book. He looked up and saw Lihua hesitantly walking in, and he quickly responded by standing up.

"Hey, Xiaohua! Why are you running out here alone so late? Is something the matter? Sit down and let's talk!" Dong Shaoling looked at Lihua's face, which was filled with a heavy air, and couldn't help but ask her in surprise, leading her into the room.

Lihua didn't sit down, nor did she speak. She stood blankly in front of Dong Shaoling's desk, occasionally sweeping Dong Shaoling with affectionate eyes.

"Why aren't you saying anything, Xiaohua! You look so unhappy. Are you angry with that rascal violinist again?" Dong Shaoling said, patting Lihua's shoulder kindly, as if coaxing a child.

Lihua remained silent, her mind seemingly elsewhere, gazing intently at Dong Shaoling's entire being, at all of Dong Shaoling's belongings; as if a sculptor were here, doing the work of engraving.

"What's wrong, Xiaohua? Are you angry with me?" Dong Shaoling asked, puzzled. He was starting to feel inexplicable.

"No, Mr. Dong!" Lihua finally opened her mouth.

"Then why are you so unhappy today? You're ignoring me and not even smiling at me." Dong Shaoling took her hand and said.

"I, I'm sad!" Lihua stammered.

"Why? Hey, you shouldn't be so pessimistic at such a young age! Be happier in the future, Xiaohua!" Huang Shaoling consoled her, stroking her.

"I, I… I'm leaving tomorrow!" Lihua finally choked out the knot of pain in her heart!

"Is it to Wuhan? I heard Mr. Liu say that she's going with you too," Dong Shaoling said without surprise.

"Mm!" Lihua turned her face away and cried!

"It's good to go to Wuhan, and you won't be lonely with Mr. Liu accompanying you. You'll see more places and gain more experience. You should be happy, so why are you sad instead?" Dong Shaoling walked over, lifted her chin, and patted her face, saying, "Are you sad to leave Kaifeng? Then come back when the war is over!"

### Face and Travel Expenses

— Shaofu

A major incident in Shanghai has now entered a dead end!

I am an amateur when it comes to sports and have never had any contact with the sports world. Regarding the charity match incident of the South China team, which has turned from a deadlock into a stalemate, I, as a rational citizen with a sense of overall interest, cannot help but say a few words in indignation.

As the situation has evolved to the present—the South China team refusing to play due to not obtaining the consent of the Welfare Foundation, and Li Huitang about to lead the team back to Hong Kong—I believe that all the mistakes are the fault of the Municipal Sports Association. Why do I say this? It's not because the Municipal Sports Association is now "on the cross" and being "shown up," but because the Municipal Sports Association is too honest, believing that everyone is genuinely doing it for the sake of the victims in Xiangzhong and Northern Jiangsu!

Pitiful! The hungry people of Hunan, in the battlefield where they have been in and out seven times!

Pitiful! The people of Northern Jiangsu, who are still under the constant threat of gunfire, with their homes in ruins and wandering in ditches!

You, your countless eyes are watching that football, your lives are under the feet of others, and what can you do if they disdain to kick it?

If everyone were truly doing it for the victims, I believe there wouldn't be so many problems. Is there any basis for this? Yes, let me list a few quotes from the people involved as an index:

Chapter 1

Li Huitang: The five initiators invited the South China team to participate in the charity match "for convenience in coming to Shanghai," but Mrs. Sun among the five did not actually agree.

Rong Qizhao: You (the author notes: referring to Li Huitang) saw that the Welfare Foundation's affairs were deadlocked and once expressed your determination to comply with the Municipal Sports Association's intentions; now you have suddenly changed your mind and must seek the Welfare Foundation's consent. How can you justify yourself? The Municipal Sports Association originally did not want to hold the charity match but accepted the request of Mayor Wu and the other five "to make an exception" and preside over it.

Southeast Daily Report: If the Municipal Sports Association is willing not to insist on its "position," there is still a glimmer of hope to turn the tide. The separation lies in sports being sports, and the distinction between sports and legal orthodoxy.

Zhou Jiaqi: South China team captain Li Huitang visited me the other day and expressed his agreement in principle with the Municipal Sports Association's various measures; however, since South China was invited by the Welfare Foundation, the Football Committee should invite the Welfare Foundation in writing for consent before they can play, for the sake of "face."

Chapter 2

Mr. Fusheng of the Xinwenbao: The expenses for this charity match, even if necessary, must be minimized, and the "travel expenses" of the South China team should be strictly audited and paid. We are absolutely opposed to a gold-digging method of tens of millions.

Xinwenbao Report: The reporter also asked Mr. Li whether it was true that 35 million yuan in travel expenses had been remitted to Hong Kong before they left, as rumored. Li replied: It is true, but the amount is slightly different because the team's equipment and travel expenses were very large. This loss is the responsibility of the Welfare Foundation.

Dagongbao Report: According to Li Huitang, the expenses this time are very large, probably exceeding those of the Xingdong team's trip to Shanghai (the Xingdong team received 53.34 million yuan in travel expenses). Zhou Jiaqi replied that the Municipal Sports Association would be responsible for the legitimate travel expenses, which would be paid from the proceeds of the charity match, but the exact figures could not be predicted.

After reading the two chapters of the index, you, the intelligent reader, should be able to understand the situation. As for why the Municipal Sports Association sent a letter to Hong Kong to stop the South China team from coming to Shanghai, and why the South China team still crossed the sea to come, etc., there is no need to elaborate.

The "exception" that has been "broken," even if repaired, will still have scars. Alas!

### How Much is Mount Tai Worth? How Many People Rely on Mount Tai for a Living?

— Dongfang Jing

For countless readers and moviegoers around the world, Tarzan is a handsome young man living in the African jungle, with a strong chest, never wearing clothes, only a cloth around his waist. He swings from tree to tree, fights wild beasts with his bare hands, protects the good, and punishes the wicked.

For the editors of "Publisher's Weekly," the Tarzan story is absurd and utterly criticized.

For the creator of this king of the jungle, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tarzan is a good business.

Burroughs, unlike most writers, did not think his work would be immortal. He didn't even consider himself a writer, but rather a brilliant businessman who created a fictional character to make the most money in the publishing industry.

Burroughs has made $10 million from Tarzan. This includes royalties, film rights, radio rights, and comic strips in 200 newspapers, as well as many products using the Tarzan trademark, such as bread, ice cream cups, knives, toys, book bags, notebooks, bows and arrows, chewing gum, masks, forest costumes, etc.

Of these, three million are royalties from film companies making Tarzan films. Twenty-three Tarzan films have been made. Burroughs recently signed a contract with Smallville Company to lease them the film rights to Tarzan for a term of twenty years, for a rental fee of four million dollars. Burroughs' secret to making money is that he never sold the character "Tarzan," he only rents it.

Since 1923, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc., has been the sole owner of Tarzan.

The first Tarzan novel, "Tarzan of the Apes," was published in 1912 in a pulp magazine. Since then, Burroughs has written 55 best-selling novels, selling 35 million copies in 60 different languages. This is a miracle for someone who didn't start writing until the age of 36. And he initially wrote novels out of necessity, to support a wife and two children.

Burroughs is a tall, broad-shouldered man with a large, oval face, bald head, and brown skin; no one would believe he is 71 years old.

The latest Tarzan book, called "Tarzan and the Foreign Legion," was written two years ago, but due to the paper shortage, it will not be published until 1947.

### Terrible Leprosy!

— Fang Jun

I have visited a leprosarium. The patients housed in the leprosarium are truly appalling. In various forms, there is no condition that is not present. Bent hands and feet, staggering movements, eyebrow shedding, swollen face and large ears with a peculiar skin color, are especially terrifying. This kind of suffering is extremely toxic and easily contagious, and is almost incurable. Modern medicine has not yet made effective inventions to deal with this, so people suffering from this disease eventually have no way to escape the sea of suffering. According to the patients themselves, the itching is bone-deep and cannot be scratched, so it is very difficult to endure, a hundred times more painful than death, perhaps because the bacteria have penetrated deep. Some say that this is a disease of extreme dampness and toxins. The symptoms of the disease seem to have a certain formula. It always starts with ringworm, which is unbearably itchy, gradually expanding and becoming leprosy. Whether this is the case, I have not studied it. But the attention that Cantonese people pay to ringworm may stem from this.

Although leprosy patients do not want to be isolated from the world, people will inevitably stay away from them, fearing them more than the plague. Therefore, rural areas in Guangdong deeply hate and detest patients with this disease. Once discovered, they must be forced to leave, otherwise they will be put to death without much pity. Taking my hometown as an example, there is a place where leprosy patients live in the whole county, called "Leprosy Mound," which is managed by someone and is extremely strict. Once committed, they cannot cross the line. However, patients who are admitted must first pay a fee and the payment must be cleared before they are allowed to enter the gate. Once inside, they can never come out for the rest of their lives. It is said that when leprosy patients leave home, they first turn the ancestral tablets upside down, tear open the roof tiles, and then go out, saying that this will prevent heredity. This is the general custom of rural areas for leprosy patients, and it is also to express the meaning of determination, not only with a superstitious nature.

In rural areas, in dealing with leprosy, patients who have money are sent to "Leprosy Mound" to spend the rest of their years. Patients without money are put to death. The method of execution is to force them to a designated remote mountain valley, give them strong wine mixed with opium juice to make them drunk, and then throw them into a deep pit dug in advance, immediately cover them with soil, and level it with the ground. This is called live burial. Although the method is cruel, it is a necessary measure for the safety of the villagers. As for the home of the patient, the roof tiles are removed and the doors are sealed, leaving it to be eroded by wind and rain and exposed to the scorching sun to eliminate the remaining toxins; and the nearby neighbors burn sawdust (i.e., wood bran) in front of their doors, filling the room with thick smoke, not daring to for the whole day, which is called disinfection.

In addition, there is a reward in rural areas for capturing leprosy patients. Anyone who sees patients who have escaped the above two methods of life and death and are living in the wilderness should be captured and killed immediately, and buried, with a heavy reward. The reason is that these patients have a strong desire to live, so they try their best to hide their traces so as not to be exposed (the villagers call it "not showing their face"). The best way to hide their traces is sex, sex between patients and non-patients, and eating the flesh of dead infants. Patients who escape into the wilderness are preparing for this method of treatment. If there are dead infants, they will steal them and cook them. If they encounter women, they will rob and rape them (women are seduced). Stealing dead infants and cooking them is certainly abominable, but raping women is not allowed by law and morality here. Because the person who is raped has already been infected, and after three days, they will also be a leprosy patient. Their cruelty is unforgivable, and the villagers must kill them precisely for this reason.

Patients with mild leprosy do not show their faces at first, but the villagers are very aware of this, as if they have a special eye. If they are discovered, people will secretly place banyan leaves and banyan roots in the well. Once patients with mild leprosy accidentally drink it, the poison will be released, with large ears, eyebrows falling out, swollen face and bent fingers, body itching, and soles of the feet ulcerating. At this point, there is no way to hide it, and their homes must be destroyed.

Leprosy can also be cured if treated before it occurs. A villager once walked in the mountains at night and saw a beautiful girl (i.e., a mild leprosy patient who seduced men), taking advantage of her loneliness, and had sex with her. He returned and realized the danger and was very afraid; but he was quite knowledgeable in medicine, so he hurried to the cowshed, took a bullock, killed it and cut open its abdomen, removed all the intestines, and while it was still hot, nakedly entered the abdomen and asked his family to cover him. But his body was too large and the abdomen was too small, so he could not fit completely, and one hand stretched out of the abdomen. After a day and a night like this, the poison was completely removed. Three days later, there was nothing unusual except that the hand outside the bullock's abdomen had not been completely cleared of poison, and the tendons suddenly contracted, and the five fingers were bent inward and could not be stretched again.

Leprosy is the most terrible disease. Cantonese opera also describes it. Now Cantonese actor Liao Xiahuai performs this kind of satirical drama, which is called his signature piece, entitled "Local Top Scholar" (Cantonese people call being infected with leprosy "winning the local top scholar"), which vividly depicts this kind of life.

[Editor's note: The above descriptions of leprosy are mostly rural rumors. Whether they are in line with medical principles remains to be studied by experts.]

### Epidemic Hospitals are Overcrowded, Where Should Cholera Patients Go? Only 1.35 Million Out of 3.7 Million Citizens Have Been Vaccinated.

— Bai Jun

Today, when cholera is raging in Shanghai, all the epidemic hospitals in the city are full of patients. There are no empty wards or empty beds. Large numbers of patients are constantly pouring in every day, wanting to be hospitalized, but there is nowhere to accommodate them. They can only be injected with a life-saving injection and then carried home. This is truly the biggest crisis facing Shanghai today!

According to the announcement of the Epidemic Prevention Committee on the 14th, there are a total of 1,892 cholera patients, including previous cases, and 133 deaths. If these large numbers of sick people still cannot be accommodated, I think the spread of cholera will further expand, and the death toll will also increase. Currently, 1.35 million people have been vaccinated, but Shanghai's population is more than 3.7 million. How can the vaccination work be quickly expanded for the remaining 2.35 million people? And on the other hand, how to increase the capacity of epidemic hospitals? This is truly an urgent matter!

Here, I will offer a few small suggestions:

(1) Increase the number of epidemic prevention working groups. The current 20 teams should be increased by 10 or 20 more teams.

(2) Compulsory vaccination. Anyone who wants to take a train, car, tram, ship, plane, or enter public places such as cinemas, theaters, dance halls, and cafes must have a vaccination certificate.

(3) Working groups should be densely distributed in the suburbs to vaccinate the poor in the lower classes.

Everyone knows these things, but only heaven knows how to do them! Let's talk about the vaccination certificate. Many are issued casually, and the certificate holders have not been vaccinated. Therefore, the implementation of many measures still requires the authorities to strictly enforce them, and the people are deceiving themselves!

### Rising Step by Step, Retreating Step by Step

— Xin Yun

If you observe carefully, you will find the following situation: In elementary school, at the end of the semester, the first, second, and third places are mostly girls. Then, in junior high school, the first, second, and third places are mostly occupied by boys, while girls are after the fourth or fifth place. When you look at high school, it's even worse. Girls' rankings are often among the last few. Of course, there are also many girls who get first place in high school, but the above situation is very common. Why is this the case? Find the answer yourself!
