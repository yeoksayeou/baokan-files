Its organization consists of Commissioners Robinson, appointed by the U.S., Zheng Jiemin, appointed by the National Government, and Ye Jianying, appointed by the CCP. An Executive Group is established under them, with U.S. Colonel Berlute as the director. Cai Wenzhi will undertake the Executive Group's tasks on behalf of the government.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th Dispatch] Ye Jianying made a brief statement to reporters at the Beijing Hotel on the afternoon of the 13th: This is my first time in the old capital. I just looked down at Beiping from the sky and deeply felt that its reputation is well-deserved; it is indeed our country's greatest city. This time, the three commissioners and I came to the north to be responsible for the work of the Executive Department and are determined to work in a spirit of cooperation and take unified action. After the Political Consultative Conference opened in Chongqing, the atmosphere at the venue was very harmonious, and the prospect of peace is extremely optimistic. Today, peaceful nation-building is a unanimous demand of the entire country. We should immediately cease conflict, restore transportation, and engage in construction.

[United Press, Chongqing, 13th Dispatch] Ye Jianying stated: As a result of the ceasefire agreement, he does not believe there will be any difficulties in the future for national army representatives to visit communist-controlled cities.

[United Press, Beiping, 13th Dispatch] Most of the personnel of the Military Mediation Executive Department have arrived here. The most important work of resolving China's internal conflict has begun today. Accommodation has been arranged for 125 Americans, 170 Kuomintang personnel, and 170 Communist Party personnel who are jointly participating in this peace effort.

### Fourth Session of Political Consultative Conference to Open Today; Discussion of United Government Plan; Five-Person Group Agreed on Scope of Agenda Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 13th Dispatch] The Political Consultative Conference will be adjourned today due to the weekly holiday, but the five-person group meeting will still be held for consultations. It was decided that the conference agenda would be divided into four topics: politics, military affairs, the National Assembly, and the draft constitution, to be discussed in sequence. The fourth session of the conference will be held at 3:00 PM on the 14th and will begin to discuss the first topic, the united government plan, in the political issues. Fierce debate is expected. The agenda for the days after tomorrow has not yet been determined. The five-person group will decide on the detailed program.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th Dispatch] The five-person group of the Political Consultative Conference, composed of members Chen Lifu, Dong Biwu, Chen Qitian, Liang Shuming, and Wang Yunwu, consulted on the agenda at 9:00 AM on the 13th and agreed as follows:

(1) In accordance with the scope stipulated in Article 3 of the conference's rules, the agenda is divided into four categories: politics, military affairs, the National Assembly, and the draft constitution. The political category is further divided into two subcategories, A and B. A is the government organization, and B is the governing program, totaling five topics.

(2) Starting from the 14th, one category will be listed each day for general discussion at the conference. After a broad exchange of opinions, the chairman will designate a subcommittee to draft a report, which will then be proposed to the conference for consultation.

(3) Because the political category contains two topics, if the discussion is not completed in one session of the conference, it may be discussed again, and the remaining categories will be postponed accordingly.

(4) Each party will recommend one to two members for each subcommittee, to be designated by the chairman. Each person may serve on two subcommittees.

(5) News reporters will not participate in subcommittee meetings.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th Dispatch] The main agenda of the third meeting was to listen to reports from the government and CCP representatives on the process of their talks. Zhou Enlai, in his report, solemnly reiterated the CCP's recognition of the Three Principles of the People as necessary for China, the recognition of President Chiang's supreme leadership position in the country, the recognition of the Kuomintang as the largest party, and respect for its history and position in the revolution. He also acknowledged the National Government. In explaining these four points of recognition, he did not review the facts of certain instances of defying military orders and government decrees over the past eight years, nor did he review Zhu De's surrender orders from the Yan'an headquarters. Regarding the United Conference of Liberated Areas prepared in Yan'an last year, he gave various new explanations, believing that it was only a union of mass organizations and did not attempt to establish a national regime. When talking about the request for the government to recognize the liberated area regimes and armed forces established by the CCP, he stated that they could still be reorganized after recognition. Zhou Enlai's frank and sincere report won warm applause.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th Dispatch] Since the government and the CCP have held talks, why does military conflict continue and even expand? What are the reasons for the conflicts in recent months, and why were they not resolved during the talks? This is a question for the people of the whole country. Shao Lizi gave a concrete answer in his report on the 12th. When negotiations began on August 29, this point was not overlooked. The CCP proposed to cease all armed conflicts and wait in place. The government had to make military deployments for the surrender of Japanese forces and made many concessions during the negotiations. Finally, the government proposed to the CCP that as long as the CCP troops did not obstruct the National Army's acceptance of surrender, there would be no problem. However, this final proposal to guarantee peace was not understood or agreed to by the CCP, and this internal matter, which was not published in the minutes of the talks, bears the responsibility for two months of military conflict.

### Northeast Is Also Our Territory; There Is Absolutely No Reason for Autonomy

[United Press, Beiping, 13th Dispatch] The Northeast Residents Association here sent a telegram to the Political Consultative Conference and Special Envoy Marshall, opposing the proposal by certain circles in the temporary capital that the Northeast should be regarded as a special zone. It strongly stated that the nine provinces of the Northeast are an inseparable part of China, and there is absolutely no reason to grant them autonomous status. It went on to say: In the past fourteen years, all free Northeasterners have followed the leadership of Chairman Chiang, and their determination has not changed. The Northeast cannot be separated from mainland China.

### Ministerial Order to Carry Out Restoration Work; Zhou Jingyan Discusses North China Transportation; If the Ceasefire Order Is Thoroughly Implemented, All Railways Are Expected to Resume Traffic After Three Months

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 13th Dispatch] Regarding the preparation for the restoration of national transportation after the government and the Communist Party simultaneously ordered a cessation of military conflict, according to those in charge of the Ministry of Transportation, on the second day of the Political Consultative Conference, the Ministry of Transportation has issued an order to its subordinates to carry out various transportation restoration work. However, this work is of a comprehensive nature, and there are many aspects that need to be negotiated with the Communist Party. Therefore, in addition to issuing orders to all levels of institutions to mobilize and carry out restoration work, the Ministry of Transportation will have detailed measures. As for the military transportation on the Yangtze River, because the takeover of the recovered areas has not been completed, troops are still needed to go there. Therefore, this decision is subject to discussion by the Military Mediation Executive.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th Dispatch] The local transportation authorities have stepped up preparations for the restoration of transportation. Shi Zhiren, special envoy of the Ministry of Transportation in the Beiping-Tianjin area, was ordered to formulate a railway restoration plan. Telecommunications personnel who withdrew from Zhangjiakou have now registered and been screened by the Ministry of Transportation here and are prepared to be ordered to return to their original posts.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th Dispatch] If the order to cease conflict and restore transportation can be thoroughly implemented, then all railways in North China are expected to resume traffic after three months. Today, this reporter visited Zhou Jingyan, head of the North China Transportation Restoration Project Supervisory Group, and according to him, the situation of each road is as follows: (1) The Pinghan Railway south from Beiping can reach Yuanshi, but between Baoding and Yuanshi, it is often attacked and destroyed by Communist troops, so it cannot operate regularly. The situation between Yuanshi and Zhangde is unknown. It is rumored that the roadbed in that section has been completely destroyed, and the ten station houses have also been burned down. On November 8 of last year, the group had prepared the materials and planned to start repairs immediately, but it was suspended due to military changes in northern Henan. If the materials and manpower are fully prepared, it can be repaired in about one month under unobstructed conditions. (2) On the Jinpu Line, from Tianjin south to Dongguang, the sleepers between Dongguang and Lianzhen have been removed and destroyed in three places, totaling 1,130 meters. The destruction between Lianzhen and Jingguantun is the most severe. Not only has the roadbed been dug into ditches, but water has also been let in. The situation between Jingguantun and Yucheng is unknown. From Yucheng south to Gunzhou, the conditions are good. The conditions between Gunzhou and Liguo Station and the Linzao branch line are all unknown. No detailed report on the extent of the destruction of this road has been received, and it is impossible to estimate the time to repair. (3) On the Pingsui Railway, from Beiping west to Qinglongqiao, the area from Kangzhuang to Tianzhen is occupied by Communist troops. Communist troops travel from Huailai and end at Tianzhen. From Tianzhen via Datong to Huaiyuan, it was destroyed by Communist troops. This section is already being repaired. If the entire line is open to traffic, from Taiyuan north to Ningwu, the area between Ningwu and Huaiyun was destroyed by Communist troops. From Taiyuan south to Houma, the situation south of Houma is unknown. (5) On the Jiaoji Railway, Jinan can reach Zichuan to the east. Among them, the section from Dalinchi to Zhoucun was newly repaired this month on the 6th. The three places destroyed in the east between Lancun and Jiaoxian, between Gaomi and Fangzi, and between Yangjiazhuang and Zichuan Dian, have not been repaired due to a lack of materials. If sufficient preparations are made, they can be repaired in about half a month. (6) On the Beining Railway, Beiping can reach Jin County. Before long, military vehicles may be able to reach Dahushan. The railway tracks on this road are also sometimes destroyed. Overall, the restoration and preparation work for the railways in North China will take three months to complete. Before the issuance of the ceasefire order, the last large-scale attack by Communist troops on the Beiping Railway was on the morning of the 7th, from 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM, when the Communist troops attacked Changxindian. About 2,000 Communist troops participated. The railway police force suffered considerable casualties. The destruction of North China railways by Communist troops, obstructing communications, obstructing military attacks on stations, and other items, occurred 259 times in October, with November being the peak of destruction, totaling 606 times. December has gradually decreased to about 300 times.

### Safety of Three Roads' Traffic Still Awaiting Factual Guarantee

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] From Xuzhou urgent telephone: After the ceasefire order arrived in Xuzhou and Zhengzhou, Director Gu Zhutong and Director Liu Zhi immediately and urgently ordered all departments to comply. The real effect of the issuance of the ceasefire order can be seen in the traffic situation three days later. Currently, the traffic safety of the Jinpu Xuji section is still under testing. The traffic safety of the Kai-Xu section of the Longhai Line and the section of the Pinghan Line north of Zhengzhou to Zhangde, a distance of 103 kilometers, must also await factual guarantees. After receiving the ceasefire order, the mission of the stationed troops and patrol teams along the aforementioned roads will be changed to protecting the roads. According to a certain road leader, it is premature to say that there are no more difficulties for the patrol troops in the future, but if the Communist troops keep their word and no longer destroy the railways, it will be easier for the patrol teams to distinguish between bandits and communists.

### Chen Cheng Arrives in the Capital; Bai Chongxi Returns to Nanjing to Meet Him

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi returned to Nanjing at 4:00 PM yesterday. Today, he personally went to Jiang'an to meet Chen Cheng, Minister of Military Administration, who came to Nanjing from Chongqing. One day after the Army Headquarters issued the ceasefire order, it received many telegrams of reply from various places, all expressing respectful compliance with the order. According to news from Yangzhou: There are still sporadic actions near Taixian County in northern Jiangsu, but the National Army aims to ensure Yangzhou and Taizhou, and even if the Communist troops are creating a false impression to cover their retreat, they will not pursue them.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th Urgent Telegram] Minister of Military Administration Chen Cheng, traveling east from Chongqing on the warship Tongxin, arrived in Nanjing at 7:00 PM on the 13th. Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi and Zhu Yisu and others boarded the ship to welcome him. Minister Chen's stomach problems have recurred, and he has only partially recovered. It is reported that when Chen passed through Yichang, he witnessed a large gathering of people returning to their hometowns, and because of the lack of transportation and difficulties in evacuation, food and accommodation were problematic. He was very concerned and gave concrete instructions to the local officials to evacuate as soon as possible. He also believed that the current shipping on the Chongqing-Yichang section should be temporarily stopped at Shashi to reduce congestion in Yichang.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th Dispatch] After the peaceful gospel of stopping conflict and restoring traffic was announced here, the people of the old capital raced to tell each other, and their joy was extraordinary.

All department stores were sluggish, and no one was buying.

A large number of personnel from the Northeast Headquarters are in Jinzhou and are prepared to enter Jinan with the army.

### Beiping and Tianjin Lack Judges; Courts Have a Lot of Backlogged Cases

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 12th Dispatch] The judiciary in Beiping and Tianjin is currently facing unimaginable difficulties, namely a lack of judges and lawyers. It is learned that among the judges in Beiping and Tianjin who did not serve in the puppet organization, only He Chengdao (already appointed president of the Hejiang Provincial High Court), Lv Shizheng, Li Yuancheng (both judges of the Hebei High Court), and Liu Chongsong (director of the civil division of the Hebei High Court) still retain their qualifications as judges. Among the lawyers who did not appear in the puppet organization and have not lost their qualifications today, only Huang Shoufa. It is said that Huang had his lawyer registration canceled before the Anti-Japanese War and has re-registered today. Due to the extreme shortage of judges, the courts have a large backlog of cases. It is said that the number of prisoners held in the detention center of the local court was 600 at the time of victory, but has now increased to 1,132, all because of a lack of judges, so they are backlogged and have not been tried.

### Military Affairs Commission Spokesperson Declares: Communist Troops in Shandong and Henan Continue to Attack, Expresses Regret Over Communist Party Newspaper Propaganda

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 13th] The Military Affairs Commission spokesperson issued a statement on the 13th, stating: Today's Chongqing Xinhua Daily published on its front page a news item stating that "Kuomintang troops in Rehe and eastern Hebei are destroying the order to cease the civil war," which is clearly propaganda. After the government representatives and the CCP representatives agreed on measures to cease conflict and restore transportation, this commission immediately telegraphed orders to all units on the evening of the 10th, instructing them to begin implementation immediately upon receipt of the telegram, and to fully implement it in all areas by 12:00 noon on the 13th. The transmission of this order was difficult due to the large number of units, congested lines, and communication difficulties, and it was naturally difficult for it to reach all of them immediately. Mr. Zhou Enlai also stated in a press conference on the 10th, in response to a reporter's question, that "a complete ceasefire will be in effect within three days, but perhaps some villages may still have sporadic fighting because the orders have not yet arrived." However, the newspaper did not clarify the time the order was issued or the communication difficulties, and even brought up the matter of the National Army entering Lingyuan on the 10th, and publicized it extensively. This was quite unexpected. Moreover, CCP troops are still launching large-scale offensives in southern Anhui and northern Henan. This commission has received reports from Director Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief Chen Daqing, Commander Hu Zongnan, etc., stating that: (1) The Communist Army New Fourth Army Chen Yi's 7th Division and the Lunan Military Region troops, totaling over 20,000, captured the Nanda Coal Mine in Zaozhuang, Lunan on January 11th, and carried out extensive destruction. (2) The Communist Army New Fourth Army troops continued to fiercely attack Lincheng and destroyed the railway. (3) The Communist Army 115th Division and 8th Division, totaling over 20,000 people, fiercely attacked the Jiawang Coal Mine (northeast of Xuzhou) on the 12th. (4) The Communist Army Taihang Military Region's Old Second Regiment, Old Seventh Regiment, Old Eighth Regiment, New Eighth Regiment, 41st Regiment, 45th Regiment, 98th Regiment, and the Hebei Detachment, totaling over 10,000 people, under the command of Zhang Hongyi, commander of the 7th Sub-district, besieged Xiuwu County in northern Henan and the Dazhifang south of the city on the 12th, with increasingly intense attacks in the afternoon. (5) The Communist Army Taihang Military Region's Li Da's 385th Brigade, 386th Brigade, New 1st Brigade, and the Jiluyu Military Region's Song Renqiong's 1st Regiment, 4th Regiment, 5th Regiment, 6th Regiment, 8th Regiment, 10th Regiment, 14th Regiment, 15th Regiment, totaling over 20,000 people, under the command of Wei Jin, commander of the 5th Sub-district, and Zeng Chengjin, commander of the 9th Sub-district, began besieging Anyang on the 12th, with clear intentions to occupy northern Henan. The government has remained silent about the large-scale offensives by the CCP troops mentioned above and has not made them public, merely showing tolerance and the government's determination to cease conflict, as it has not yet exceeded the prescribed time limit. However, the Communist Party newspaper Xinhua Daily has, on the one hand, ignored the fact that they are attacking government troops, and on the other hand, failed to acknowledge the difficulties in the arrival of orders, and claimed that government troops were violating the ceasefire order even before the jointly agreed-upon deadline for ceasing conflict (12:00 noon on the 13th) had expired. It seems that propaganda is being placed above national interests, which is regrettable.

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 13th] The General Headquarters of the Chinese Army printed 500,000 copies of Chairman Chiang's order to cease military conflict, distributed them by airplane to various locations, and then printed an additional 300,000 copies for distribution.

### UN Organization, Security Council Established, Economic and Social Council Elected, China Elected

[This Newspaper News] London, 13th Midnight Broadcast: The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to continue at 3 pm tomorrow. After the election of various members of the Security Council today, the Chinese representative, Wellington Koo, congratulated the elected members and expressed his opinion, saying: "At present, geographical conditions have been taken into consideration, but this cannot become a fixed rule, because other regions do not have non-permanent seats. We should not have an absolute fixed rule, and geographical distribution should be observed, but geographical principles should not contain an exclusionary nature." The head of the French delegation, Bidault, agreed with Dr. Wellington Koo's remarks.

Terms of Office of Six Members of the Security Council

[United Press London, 12th] The United Nations Security Council, backed by the military strength and moral force of the 51 countries of the world, will be the future headquarters of the United Nations Organization to denounce aggressor countries. The council has a total of 11 seats, with 5 permanent members, belonging to the five countries of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and China.

The six non-permanent members are allocated by region: Australia represents the British Empire's self-governing dominions, Brazil represents South America, Egypt represents the Middle East, Mexico represents Central America, the Netherlands represents Western Europe, and Poland represents Eastern Europe.

[Reuters London, 13th] Before the United Nations General Assembly was scheduled to hold the election of the six non-permanent members of the Security Council yesterday, the Soviet representative moved to postpone the election, which was rejected by the General Assembly. As a result, six countries, Australia, Brazil, Egypt, the Netherlands, Mexico, and Poland, were elected as non-permanent members of the Security Council. Australia was elected on the fourth ballot yesterday, with 46 votes. The third ballot was to decide whether Australia or Canada should be elected. As for the remaining five non-permanent members of the Security Council, they were elected in the first election shortly after noon. When the Canadian representative announced that he was giving up the candidacy for non-permanent member, the entire audience gave him the warmest cheers. At 4:30 pm (0:30 am Shanghai time), the six non-permanent members of the Security Council were formally elected. As for the terms of office of the non-permanent members of the Security Council, some should be two years, and some should be one year. Australia was first elected as a non-permanent member with a term of two years, and the terms of Poland and Brazil were also two years. The terms of Egypt, the Netherlands, and Mexico were all one year. The Security Council temporarily stipulates that its chairman will be changed every month, and the rotation will be based on the first letter of the name of each member state.

### Drafting the Treaty with Italy - Representatives of the Five Powers are Preparing -

[United Press Paris, 12th] According to diplomatic circles here today, the matter of signing a treaty with the former enemy countries in Europe, as decided by the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, will begin in London soon. The representatives of the foreign ministers of the five major powers will first draft the Italian treaty. The head of the French delegation to the United Nations General Assembly,苗維爾, received this notice in London and is expected to return to Paris tomorrow to report to the French government, so that the drafting of the treaty can be carried out during the United Nations General Assembly. It is believed here that Italy may be notified to send representatives to London to participate in the meeting. Regarding this matter, France separately inquired with the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom whether former enemy belligerent countries would be allowed to speak when signing the treaty, in accordance with the decision of the Moscow Conference. Although the countries have not replied, it is believed that at least the United States supports France's view. In addition, France also believes that countries such as Greece and Yugoslavia, which suffered directly from Italy's participation in the war during the war, should be allowed to participate in the treaty negotiations.

### Chief of Staff He is Too Busy with Official Duties to Go to England in Person

### The United States and the Soviet Union Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss the Plan to Unify Korea, Limited to Economic and Political Matters

[United Press Washington, 12th] According to authoritative sources: Representatives of the US and Soviet occupation forces in Korea will hold a meeting within the next week, at which the US will propose a broad plan to unify Korea, and it is expected that the Soviet Union will accept it. It is said that the scope of the talks will be limited to "urgent economic and political issues," and the issue of withdrawing the occupation forces is not within the scope of the talks. The State Department official said: The issue of the occupation forces will be considered by a joint US-Soviet committee after steps are taken to establish a provisional government in Korea. The plan proposed by the US State Department to complete the occupation mission recommends three points: (1) Eliminate trade, transportation, and traffic barriers caused by the division of Korea into two parts; (2) Strive for the unification of administrative functions; (3) Prepare for the withdrawal of Japanese residents, most of whom now reside in Soviet territory.

[United Press Seoul, 13th] After returning to the city after inspecting the provinces, Lieutenant General Luqi took over the position of Military Governor of Korea today.

### Japanese Troops in Siam Surrender

### Stilwell Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the US Western Defense Zone

[US Information Service San Francisco, 13th] The US Department of the Army recently announced that General Stilwell has been appointed as the Commander of the US Western Defense Command, with headquarters in San Francisco. General Stilwell served as the Commander of the US Army in the China-India-Burma Theater and as Chiang Kai-shek's chief of staff. He was recalled to the country in October 1944 and served as commander of the US 10th Army in June. In addition, United Press reported that Major General Merrill, famous for leading the "Merrill's Marauders" in the Burma campaign, has also been appointed to serve in the Western Defense Command.

### The United States is Watching the Situation After the Reorganization of the Shidehara Cabinet, MacArthur Approves Japan to Hold General Elections

[Reuters Tokyo, 13th] General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan, has approved the Japanese government to hold general elections at any time after March 15.

[United Press Washington, 13th] The State Department announced today that the US State Department is closely watching the situation after the reorganization of the Shidehara Cabinet. It also said that everything is in the hands of the capable MacArthur. The Dalton Commission, which is currently inspecting Tokyo, has nothing to do with MacArthur. Prime Minister Shidehara said last night that he had completed the reorganization of the cabinet, and as a result, five ministers, one deputy chief secretary, and one director of the Legislative Bureau have resigned. According to news received here, this cabinet tide is the first test of Secretary of State Byrnes' explanation of the Moscow Communiqué. Byrnes said that the clause that he had entered into the revocation of effect was only half a month ago. The clause that he inserted into the three reservations refers to the point that MacArthur's power cannot be interfered with or infringed upon in any cabinet tide in Japan. Byrnes said that after preliminary discussions with the representatives of the other three powers of the Four-Power Control Commission on Japan, MacArthur could take the necessary decisions on the successors of the Japanese cabinet members who resigned. If the Japanese cabinet were to resign en masse, MacArthur could also resolve the cabinet tide alone, announcing one cabinet member each day until all ministers were appointed. The Soviet Union has not yet informed the United States of its intention to join the Four-Power Control Commission, so the commission has never actually existed, and therefore MacArthur does not need to hold preliminary discussions with the other three powers in accordance with the Moscow Communiqué.

### American Soldier Drunk and Murderous, Sentenced to Death

[United Press, Osaka, 13th] An American soldier, on the eve of being transferred, got drunk in Nara and stabbed two Japanese people to death with a knife. Today, he was sentenced to death by an American military court. This is the first time an American soldier has been sentenced to death for attacking Japanese people.

### One Hundred American Liberty Ships to Send Japanese Soldiers and Civilians Back to Their Country

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 12th] Former Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, Vice Admiral Barbey, told reporters today that the withdrawal of four million Japanese soldiers from the Asian continent back to their country will allow the withdrawal of the U.S. military from North China and the North Sea to be implemented ahead of schedule. It is said that one hundred American Liberty ships are currently being sent to transport Japanese soldiers and civilians back to their country, at a rate of 100,000 people per month. These Liberty ships are now staffed with Japanese crew members, allowing 10,000 U.S. naval officers to be relieved of their duties. In addition, another hundred Liberty ships will be used for the same purpose.

### China's Economic Situation Improves, Trade Prospects Optimistic: U.S. Department of Commerce Report on Legal Tender

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] According to a report by the Department of Commerce: China's economic situation is gradually improving, and trade prospects are even more optimistic. Inflation has been curbed, and at the same time, foreign goods are continuously arriving, which has suppressed the prices of foreign goods. Several foreign banks in Shanghai have resumed operations one after another, and although it has not been clarified what their future functions will be, the supply of foreign exchange should be more convenient. The wartime trade control regulations have recently been relaxed, which has also contributed to the recovery of trade. Before foreign exchange transactions return to normal, it is necessary to store imported goods entrusted to foreign banks. In addition, the rampant petty theft and congestion in the dock and warehouse areas prevent trade from recovering quickly. Finally, the official pointed out that after the abolition of extraterritoriality in China, American commercial organizations in China will be subject to Chinese courts and commercial law in the future.

### Anecdotes from the General Assembly: Post-War London's Vitality Not Yet Recovered, Foreign Guests Eat and Sleep Uncomfortably

[United Press, London, 12th] Representatives from 51 countries at the United Nations General Assembly are now meeting in Westminster. If the distinguished guests wish to dine in the nearby special dining room, it is difficult for them to satisfy their appetites because the rations are "strict" and there is no room for leniency. Moreover, all meals must be "self-service." There are only two dining rooms for representatives, secretaries, and visitors, so they are often full, and those who arrive later have to wait in a long line. Today's dishes are very simple and can also be seen as reflecting Britain's emphasis on "filling food" and the continued scarcity of luxury goods. The menu is meat pie or fish, boiled sweet potatoes that the British are accustomed to eating, and Brussels sprouts, which, like all British casual meals, are limited to three courses. However, even with such simple dishes, when the number of representatives and staff dining exceeds the amount of food prepared, it often has to be reduced. In a dining room on the fifth floor, the choice of food is slightly more, costing three shillings per meal. On the first floor, it only costs one shilling and sixpence. The difference is that there is meat pie upstairs, and downstairs there is British sausage, which is also stuffed with some fillings. However, representatives from various countries are not only allowed to eat strictly rationed food. Most of them live in large hotels in London, where there is always a considerable amount of delicious food to choose from.

[Associated Press, London, 13th] Here are a few anecdotes from the first session of the United Nations General Assembly: (1) The Germans made a material contribution to the first General Assembly of the United Nations. The former German Embassy building in the UK is now the design headquarters for the delegations of various countries to the United Nations. (2) Due to the lack of hotels in London, many representatives were forced to share a room with two people, but one Danish representative was an exception because he admitted that he snored very loudly. (3) The Turkish representative enjoyed a special allocation of sugar because he could not swallow it unless he put four or five cubes of sugar in each cup of coffee. (4) London telephones have a conversion device for local and international calls, which is specially for the use of representatives from various countries, but the American representatives cannot talk to their friends in their own country because telephone workers across America are on strike.

### U.S. Congress to Reconvene Today, Encountering Four Major Problems; Undersecretary of State and Treasury Secretary Broadcast Jointly, Urging the Public to Support the Loan Agreement to the UK

[Reuters, London, 13th] The Sunday Times today published a dispatch from Washington stating that the U.S. Congress is scheduled to reconvene tomorrow and will immediately encounter four major problems: the nationwide strike wave, the dispute between Congress and President Truman, the withdrawal of American troops from the occupied areas of Germany and Japan, and the loan to the UK. American newspapers published news of the labor unrest in large characters, which overshadowed international news. However, there is still hope for a resolution to the labor unrest by the end of the week. Regarding President Truman, his appeal to the public against Congress has so far received little response. Although he has not broken with Congress, he has almost no hope of controlling Congress on domestic issues, so that his policy of international cooperation has won public support, but he has not been decisive on domestic policies. Speaking of recovery, it is more valued by the public than the U.S. mission in Germany and Japan. Observers are very concerned about this issue and believe that this is the first major test of whether the United States is willing to fulfill its responsibilities in peacetime after the war. The American public is now aware that it is impossible to withdraw troops and at the same time ensure the fruits of victory. At the same time, the U.S. government has now begun the preliminary action of "selling" the loan to the UK to the American people. Assistant Secretary of State Acheson and Treasury Secretary Vinson have jointly broadcasted to urge the national public to support this move, but the opponents have made it clear that their line of attack will not be ignored. Acheson said in a broadcast on Saturday night that the loan to the UK is necessary for the U.S. foreign economic policy because it can promote the future economic prosperity of the UK. Acheson also said that the loan agreement was concluded out of mutual need and mutual benefit. Unless the UK can cooperate, world trade cannot be restored and expanded.

### American Troops Rise Up in Various Places, Demanding Demobilization

[Report from this newspaper] According to a broadcast from San Francisco on the 13th, U.S. Chief of Staff Eisenhower declared at a press conference in Toronto today that the demonstrations by U.S. troops in various foreign countries show that they do not understand the importance of their mission in the occupied countries. The occupation of Japan and Germany is extremely important for the future peace of the world. U.S. troops around the world are continuing to demonstrate, protesting the slow progress of the American demobilization effort. In the China theater, General Wedemeyer recently praised his subordinates for their deep understanding of righteousness and for not taking such actions. However, even before his words had finished, 600 officers and soldiers immediately demanded to return to their country. General Wedemeyer has scheduled to talk to these officers and soldiers in detail on the 14th.

[United Press, Frankfurt, 12th] General McNair, commander of the U.S. forces in Europe, personally advised his troops today not to take further demonstrations, so that the number of U.S. troops participating in the demonstrations in the German occupation zone tonight has been reduced.

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Millions of American soldiers returning from overseas have applied for admission to universities, and universities are overcrowded. Currently, 125,000 veterans are studying at universities with government assistance, and another 207,000 are applying for admission.

[Associated Press, Seoul, 13th] It was announced here today that U.S. troops in Korea have collected 2,100 yuan in 40 hours, preparing to place an advertisement in "The Washington Post" to protest the slow progress of the demobilization effort.

[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] MacArthur ordered today to immediately lower the service point scores of his troops. The passing score for soldiers has been lowered from 50 points to 48 points, and those who have served for three years and two months can now return to their country. The passing score for officers has been lowered from 70 points to 68 points, or those who have served for three years and eleven months can return to their country. All army personnel in the Pacific under MacArthur's command will be handled in accordance with this order. According to MacArthur's declaration, his intention seems to be to ensure that no ship returning to the United States has an empty cabin when possible. Qualified officers and soldiers will be concentrated first and returned to their country in order according to their service point scores and the convenience of transportation and replenishment.

### Coup d'état in Haiti

Dictatorial President Overthrown

Vietnamese Revolutionary Leader Expresses Determination to Fight to the End, Says He Rejected Bribery from a Certain Party

[United Press, Vietnam, 12th] The Vietnamese revolutionary leader, President Minh of the "Viet Nam Republic," told reporters today: "A certain party bribed me with 2 million Vietnamese currency, asking me to give up the struggle for Vietnamese independence. I not only rejected it, but also announced that the people under my command are already prepared to fight, hoping that the United Nations will uphold justice and stop the bloodshed. We will devote all our efforts to guerrilla warfare. In the past, we used broadswords and earthen guns to resist Japan, and we will do the same in the future. Freedom cannot be given by others, it must be won by ourselves. The Vi Ning army is poorly equipped, and the air force only has two small planes and no pilots, which is not enough to withstand a single blow, but freedom will eventually come. World public opinion is sympathetic, so we are not isolated and will definitely fight to the end. I am determined to fight the French ruling class, not the French people. The Chinese occupying authorities have not interfered in the revolutionary government." At the same time, a French spokesman said that if Minh's so-called bribery refers to France, it is absolutely false.

### The Government and Communist Party Representatives' Four-Stage Talks: Shao Lizi and Zhou Enlai Report to the Third Political Consultative Conference

First Report by Shao Lizi

Chairman, distinguished guests: The full text of the meeting minutes has already been published. My report will only address key points, explaining a few points regarding the doubts about the talks from various social sectors: First, people often ask, did both sides in the talks have sincerity? My answer is: Yes, they were sincere. Second, people often ask if the talks were not public, besides the published reports, were there any secrets? Were there any important issues not disclosed? My answer is: No. Even if one or two points were not included in the meeting minutes, there was nothing that could not be made public, and it could still be made known to the public. Third, some people see that the talks lasted so long, yet no real solutions were reached, and ask if the representatives on both sides were not fulfilling their responsibilities, or even intentionally dragging out the time? My answer is: No one dared to be lazy, and no one dared to deliberately delay. Fourth, some people may even ask: After the meeting minutes were published, the problems could not be resolved, is it because both sides intentionally refused to compromise, resulting in a stalemate? My answer to this is: On certain points, there was indeed a refusal to compromise, both on the government's side and the Communist Party's side. This is because: (1) The difficulties were caused by the fundamental differences that have existed for many years, and (2) the positions of the two sides are fundamentally different, and each has points that cannot be conceded, though there were indeed many concessions made. The public mainly asks about these three or four points.

Below, I will provide a comprehensive explanation within this scope: Mr. Zhou Enlai has already explained that since the War of Resistance, the Communist Party has always recognized the Three Principles of the People, recognized the Kuomintang as the leading party, and recognized the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek. This remains the case today, which we greatly admire. As for the government, it has been determined since the first day of the War of Resistance to unite the strength of the entire country, and at the same time recognized the Communist Party's increased role in the War of Resistance. Although unfortunate events gradually occurred later,

President Chiang has consistently decided to resolve the Communist Party issue through political means, and has repeatedly declared this decision to the national citizenry. Once the War of Resistance ended, he sent telegrams several times inviting Mr. Mao Zedong to Chongqing. Mr. Mao had never come out before, but this time he came to Chongqing. These are certainly the most sincere expressions. After Mr. Mao came to Chongqing, President Chiang and Mr. Mao had several talks, which were very frank, and everything that needed to be said was said. Our talks were conducted in this spirit. From Mr. Mao's arrival in Chongqing to the publication of the meeting minutes on Double Ten Day, our talks can be divided into four stages:

First Stage

The initial four days of continuous talks were the first stage. At that time, the Communist side had an idea to first cultivate a good atmosphere for the talks, and the government side agreed, because there were too many unfortunate events in the past. Without a good atmosphere, it would be very difficult to discuss various specific issues. The government's initial intention was to resolve the issues as quickly as possible. Mr. Xue Ting said yesterday that he had advocated resolving the issues within ten days. However, another view was that haste makes waste, so it was also a good idea to first cultivate the atmosphere and then discuss practical issues. During those four days, we fully exchanged opinions.

Second Stage

Starting from September 4th, we discussed practical issues, and we began to find that there were very difficult situations to resolve, namely items nine and ten in the meeting minutes. Item ten, the issue of local governments, was ultimately not resolved. Item nine, the military issue, had a decided solution in the meeting minutes, but there were many difficulties in the process, and it still needs to be genuinely resolved. From September 4th, everyone saw that the issues were not easy to resolve, and believed that cultivating a good atmosphere was still very important, and that we could not rush to solve the issues. From the 4th to the 21st, there were a total of eight meetings. This can be said to be the second stage. Sometimes we talked every day, sometimes we talked every other day. September 10th, 11th, and 12th, we talked every day.

Third Stage

Originally, the communique could have been issued on the 21st, but because the Communist Party insisted on their position on the issue of local governments, no agreement was reached, and as a result, the communique could not be issued. At that time, the situation almost caused the talks to run aground, but we were unwilling to truly run aground, because this was a matter of national safety and even world peace, so negotiations began again on the 27th and continued until October 5th, with a total of four meetings. This can be said to be the third stage.

Fourth Stage

During these four negotiations, the two sides again fully exchanged opinions, but there were still some points on which agreement could not be reached, and Mr. Mao, because the days of delay had been quite long, had a need to return to Yan'an immediately. President Chiang had said earlier that Mr. Mao could return to Yan'an at any time. According to the situation at the time, the communique almost still could not be issued. As I said just now, we are very grateful for Mr. Zhang Wenbai's final efforts in publishing the meeting minutes. The few days before the meeting minutes were announced can be said to be the fourth stage. (To be continued)

Second Report by Zhou Enlai

At the Third Political Consultative Conference, member Zhou Enlai reported on the course of the talks between the government and the CCP representatives as follows:

Chairman, distinguished guests: The history of the KMT-CPC talks is very long, lasting nine years. During these nine years, I participated in almost all of them, except for a very short period. Today, the War of Resistance has been won and the era of peace has begun. I do not want to report here on the situation of the KMT-CPC talks during the past eight years of the War of Resistance. I only want to talk about some of the guiding principles in the KMT-CPC talks during those eight years. Before the start of the War of Resistance, between 1936 and 1937, the CCP representatives and the government representatives at that time had talks. The central issues discussed were the same as today, which were peace and democracy. The difference was that at that time, it was about stopping the civil war and uniting to resist Japan, while eight years later today, what is required is to stop the internal strife and unite to build the country. Before the War of Resistance, the goal of stopping the civil war and uniting to resist Japan was achieved, which led to the launch of the July 7th Incident. Therefore, when I report here, I have the same belief that we will definitely be able to achieve the goal of stopping the internal strife and uniting to build the country.

Over the past nine years, I have participated in negotiations and made the same request twice, and both times it has been achieved to stop the civil war. Although on the one hand, I am filled with emotions, on the other hand, I feel that having achieved the goal twice, first and foremost for the sake of the Chinese people, I personally feel a little comforted. However, no matter what, it is always extremely unfortunate that our country and nation have gone through such twists and turns twice. Based on this, I feel that regarding the report on the negotiation process during the War of Resistance, it is only necessary to mention one point to illustrate. The principle of the initial negotiations was to stop the civil war and unite to resist Japan, so the negotiations after the War of Resistance became protracted were mostly limited to solving local problems, such as the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region issue, and the recognition and organization of anti-Japanese troops behind enemy lines. At the same time, demands for the people's freedoms and rights were put forward. At that time, the government also made some responses, but because the differences of opinion were still far apart, no solutions were reached. In the last period, which was in 1944, the CCP again proposed solving the overall problem, that is, at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Third National Political Consultative Conference, Delegate Lin Zuhan, representing the CCP, proposed the idea of a coalition government. After the Political Consultative Conference, there were several more discussions, but the government felt that this idea would shake the legitimacy of the government, so it was not accepted. The existence of these problems caused the disputes to continue, which also laid the roots for the unfortunate civil war that occurred after the victory of the War of Resistance.

After the victory of the War of Resistance, a new opportunity came. Mr. Chiang telegraphed Mr. Mao three times to invite him, and Mr. Mao accepted the invitation. Immediately, the new negotiations after the War of Resistance began. The principle of the negotiations during this period was to move from general topics to specific issues. After Mr. Mao came to Chongqing, the government appointed Mr. Wang Xue Ting, Mr. Zhang Yue Jun, Mr. Zhang Wen Bai, and Mr. Shao Li Zi as representatives. The CCP appointed myself and Comrade Wang Ruofei as representatives to begin negotiations. (To be continued)

### Zhou Enlai Reports to the Political Consultative Conference: Lessons Learned from Experience (Continued and Concluded)

The second part is about how the ceasefire will proceed. Mr. Zhang Yuejun spoke very specifically, regarding the scope of authority, the organizational structure, and the scope of the agreement. I would like to supplement a few relevant issues. Article 4 of the ceasefire agreement establishes a military mediation executive headquarters, which has four tasks:

First, to cease all conflicts within the national scope. The complete cessation of conflict means that from Hainan Island in the south to Inner Mongolia in the north, from the northeast in the east to Suiyuan in the west, all places where there are conflicts should cease. To deliver this order, not only do we need to exchange telegrams, but we also need to send personnel to notify. For example, Hainan Island has been blockaded for seven or eight years. There are military conflicts between the guerrilla forces led by the CCP and the government forces. In other parts of Guangdong, military conflicts have also occurred between the troops led by the CCP and the government forces. Also, in other places, after the regular troops led by the CCP withdrew, the government troops clashed with the guerrilla forces led by the CCP. Also, there are conflicts when the government troops enter the areas where the CCP is active. All of this should be stopped. In these places, the military mediation executive headquarters should send people to monitor. The executive headquarters should set up many stations, many groups, to go to various places. However, whether it is a station or a group, the three parties should send people to act together and agree unanimously to seek solutions. The plan to stop all conflicts before the 13th can be implemented quickly. The three parties of the Beijing military mediation executive headquarters are scheduled to go to Ping on the 13th of this month. We hope that within this month, stations or groups can be sent to all conflict locations to stop all conflicts.

Transportation and Postal Services Must Be Restored First

Second, to restore all transportation, first of all, it is necessary to restore railway transportation. This is due to the stagnation of military conflicts. Also, there are many that were blockaded during the War of Resistance. Not only is walking difficult, but postal and telegraph services are also often obstructed. Therefore, the three-person meeting should restore all land, sea and air transportation, and the obstacles to postal and telegraph communication should also be removed. This is the true restoration of transportation. True freedom of transportation can be seen in the third paragraph of the ceasefire order.

Third, the third task of the executive headquarters is the issue of accepting surrender. There are still nearly 200,000 enemies who have not completely disarmed. The main areas are in North China, and there are also some in eastern China. In the government-controlled areas, and in the areas surrounded by the troops led by the CCP, the enemy's weapons must be disarmed. This is also something that the executive headquarters must ask about. Fourth, how to send the enemy prisoners who have been disarmed back to their home country, and what transportation lines to take, are also things that the executive headquarters must ask about. These four items are related to the ceasefire and also to the Allied countries, so the military mediation executive headquarters must ask about them. If this is done, not only will all military conflicts stop and transportation be restored, but also the surrender issue, which is one of the main causes of the civil war, will no longer exist.

Regarding matters outside the scope of the executive headquarters' work but also related, such as military movements as mentioned by Mr. Zhang Yuejun just now, it is also necessary to report to the executive headquarters, so that the executive headquarters can discern and avoid excuses and misunderstandings. This point should also be supplemented. The ceasefire order was authorized by the government to Mr. Zhang Yuejun, and the CCP authorized myself to sign it. At the same time, it was announced to the outside world, and also

Chairman Chiang and CCP Chairman Mao Zedong both issued orders. Last night, Mr. Zhang Yuejun told me that Chairman Chiang had already issued an order to notify all troops. I received news from Yan'an this morning that the order had also been issued last night. According to our agreed time, all conflicts should cease.

Reorganize the Army to Permanently Eliminate the Civil War

The third part is about how to eliminate the civil war. This is the main problem to be solved by this political consultative conference. I personally would like to explain one point. Because Mr. Zhang Yuejun just mentioned his hope that after the ceasefire, the three-person military sub-group meeting would be convened quickly to discuss the reorganization issue, the army should be reorganized, the entire Chinese army should be reorganized, and the CCP army should also be reorganized, in order to achieve the goal of nationalizing the army. This has already been decided. As for how to eliminate the civil war, that is not included in the scope of discussion of the three-person military sub-group. I think this is one of the issues to be discussed at the political consultative conference. In this regard, we have the following hopes: (1) To eliminate the civil war, to restore transportation, there is a principle, that is, conflicts of opinion among all parties in the country, conflicts of opinion between parties, all those that are political in nature, should be resolved by political means, and should never be allowed to develop into military conflicts. Domestic issues should be resolved by the government. Chairman Chiang has stated several times that even the problems of the world should be resolved by political means, let alone domestic problems? All domestic problems should be resolved by political means, which is the reason for convening the political consultative conference. However, we have a concept about this issue, that since domestic problems can only be resolved by political means at present, then people with different ideas and different opinions, except for criminals or those who violate general laws and can be dealt with according to law, there is no way to exclude or eliminate them for any other political reason. This principle must be established.

(2) Regarding the military inspection group, it should be organized by fair people selected from the National Political Consultative Conference and the Political Consultative Conference. If this can be done, we will surely be told many valuable opinions by both sides and by the whole country. At the same time, it will definitely be of great help in deciding how to eliminate the plan for civil unrest. (3) We feel that those enemies who still carry weapons and massacre the Chinese people after surrendering should be regarded as war criminals and punished. (4) We believe that specific measures should be decided for disbanding the puppet army. This is a principle that both sides agreed to in the meeting minutes. We hope that the government will set up measures as soon as possible. Those puppet troops who participate in the civil war and provoke internal strife should be severely punished.

The Communist Army is Determined to Reorganize

(5) The army reorganization plan is very important to our peace and national construction. In the future, it can be incorporated into the peace and national construction plan for discussion, so the political consultative conference needs to discuss the army reorganization issue. If we can get the agreement of all political parties, and then come up with several plans, under this plan, the troops led by the CCP will definitely reorganize according to the plan. At the same time, the CCP has promised to reorganize into 20 divisions, and we will definitely be able to discuss this in the three-person sub-group meeting to make the national army embark on the path of nationalization. I can represent the CCP delegation, and I can also represent the Chinese Communist Party, to guarantee that this matter can definitely be done. The above five points are our current opinions on eliminating the civil war. As for the fundamental method of eliminating the civil war, it is the issue of political democratization. The scope is very broad, and we want the gentlemen of the conference to discuss it carefully. (Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th)

### Entering from America's Back Door: Sightseeing in New York and Washington

#### By Zhu Jiarang, Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, from New York

The post-war period still felt like wartime. The trains from Canada to New York hadn't yet restored sleeper car services, so everyone had to sit up overnight, eyes wide open. As a result, many people took advantage of the opportunity and lay down, propping up their feet, creating a chaotic and smoky scene, quite similar to the third-class night trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou line. Passport and luggage checks were all done on the train, so there was no more hassle upon arrival, which was not a bad method. Usually, entry procedures into the US were quite troublesome, but this time I entered through America's back door, so health certificates and quarantine certificates weren't even questioned, making it extremely easy.

As day broke, the train sped along within the US. Looking at the vast, flat fields, this was a uniquely blessed, resource-rich, and fertile land. In the past five years, it shouldered the great responsibility of being the arsenal of the democratic countries, and it shed blood and sweat, fighting valiantly in every corner of the world. Now, it had turned the tide and saved the planet. As a Chinese person, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and respect.

At eight in the morning, the train arrived at New York's Grand Central Terminal, and I began to experience American life. The station was larger than London's Victoria Station, with the train platforms all underground, a novel design. On the station walls, there were large American flags, a form of civic education.

High One Hundred and Two Stories: The World's Tallest Skyscraper

This world-renowned city of New York, located at the mouth of the Hudson River in the eastern US, is like our Shanghai, with its own Huangpu River. But in terms of grandeur, Shanghai naturally pales in comparison. Especially the skyscrapers here are unparalleled. We used to look at pictures and sometimes think they were made of toys, but now that I'm here, I know it's not a dream but a reality. Shanghai's International Hotel and its thirteen stories are far behind. The so-called high-rises here are generally over forty stories. The Rockefeller Center, including the RCA Building, is seventy stories and eight hundred and fifty-three feet tall, considered very high, and attracts many tourists to the roof for sightseeing every day. The fast elevators make your ears pop, but it ranks only fourth. The tallest is the Empire State Building, with one hundred and two stories and one thousand two hundred and fifty feet. Next is the Chrysler Building, with seventy-seven stories and one thousand and forty-six feet. The third tallest is the Wall Tower, which has fewer stories than Rockefeller Center, but is taller in height. The Times Square area is just a long triangle, and its height used to be famous, but now it seems too inadequate. The flashing lights of the top news stories around the roof no longer reach very far.

Six Million Phone Calls: Average Daily Total

New York City is actually an island on the Atlantic coast, but now Greater New York has five boroughs, including its surrounding mainland. According to statistics, Greater New York is thirty-six miles long and sixteen and a half miles wide, with a total population of seven million six hundred and seventy thousand. With such a large world-class city, the complexity of its culture and the noise of its traffic can be imagined. Someone made some interesting statistics about New York: according to the Bibles printed by the New York Bible Society, there are eighty-three languages ​​used by the city's residents, so New York City has at least that many languages, truly a place where "people from all directions gather," reaching its peak. According to statistics, New York's water pipes are four thousand five hundred miles long, sewers are three thousand miles long, subway tunnels are five hundred miles long, and there are about one million nine hundred thousand telephones, with no less than six million calls every day, because on average, one hundred and seventy-five people are using the phone every second. The dynamics of people are also amazing: according to the estimate in 1942, two hundred and ninety million people came and went here by train or ship every day, so there are hotels and restaurants everywhere. As for hotels, there are more than five hundred, with one hundred and twenty thousand rooms. The above figures may be only one or two years old, but today it is full everywhere, and finding a hotel is as difficult as climbing to heaven. This problem is still very serious.

Country Folks Entering the City Won't Become Lost Sheep

The core area of ​​New York City is on this rectangular island. The waterfront is full of docks, and eighty-thousand-ton ships can easily sail into the Hudson River and dock. New York's prosperity is actually caused by the harbor, so President Sun Yat-sen's plan to move Shanghai to the Wusongkou had its geographical necessity. Because the terrain is a long island, the layout of New York's streets is more systematic than any other city. Perhaps Americans value numbers. Their city streets, except for a few, are uniformly numbered. The long ones are called Avenues, and the horizontal ones are called Streets. The numbers are clear, and you can tell the location at a glance, so even if country folks enter the city, they won't become lost sheep. However, although the city's streets are block-shaped, there is also a "diagonal road" that runs straight through the heart, piercing north and south, which is the famous and colorful Broadway.

Snow Thick, Wood Leaves All Bare: The Whole City is Full of Light and Heat

Seeing New York after arriving from Europe is simply too happy. People there are short of water and coal, eat less and wear less, and are hungry and stingy, but that will never be passed on from Paris and London. First of all, the neon lights are dazzling, and every place is brightly lit. The fire heats every house so that it is steaming hot. Even though it is winter, the snow is thick, the trees are bare, and it is still warm. This city has both light and heat. The United States contributed greatly to this war, but in this city, it is simply impossible to see any war. High-rise buildings, people from all countries are enjoying themselves, and there are crowds of people on the road. Eating, drinking, and having fun, US dollars are dancing. What can't you do? The materials consumed in this city every day must also be an astronomical figure. Not to mention anything else, let’s talk about newspapers. They are published several times a day, and the paper is always a large stack. The New York Times has as many as thirty-five or six pages. Those who are used to a piece of paper in China and Europe can't hide it in their bags when they get it, and instead find it cumbersome. And with so many newspapers and long articles, everyone is busy, who can read them all one by one? So after a quick glance, they are sent into the trash can. It's a pity that so much effort and hard work are wasted with just a flash in front of people. Paper is not uncommon in the United States. Paper for wiping faces, paper for drinking water, don't know how much is wasted. But sometimes I think, a country with such a large production capacity must have a lot of waste in order to keep the machines running and the workers can have "full employment". Otherwise, if they were to be frugal, capitalism would panic.

Seeing is Believing: The White House Looks Like an Ordinary Residence

I also had the opportunity to go to Washington. Although trains were added during Christmas, departing less than an hour apart, it was still crowded with people. Among them, naturally, there were many soldiers returning home recently. The car passed through Philadelphia and Baltimore and arrived in four hours. The scene here was obviously very different. The streets were wider than in New York, and there were more trees on both sides. Although there were many tall buildings, they were not like New York's "twin peaks piercing the clouds," making the "a line of sky" annoying. The trolleys rolled slowly on the rails, and the pedestrians were much quieter. This is a very ideal and beautiful residential area.

But Washington is ultimately a political headquarters. Its hustle and bustle is not in the business field, but in the buildings of each institution. The State Department and the Treasury Department are giant buildings on the left and right sides of the White House. The famous White House, however, looks like an ordinary middle-class residence. The house is indeed white, but it is short and small, which is unexpected. Moreover, it is adjacent to the commercial area and movie theaters. There is no big sign at the entrance, and no armed guards. A flagpole stands on the lawn, which is considered to indicate the location of their head of state. The government agencies seem to be very large, with the War Department being very big. Its glorious mission has now been successfully completed.

Washington has a Unique Style: Simple, Bright, and Elegant

Washington's scenic area, from the Lincoln Memorial directly to the Washington Monument, is a center, but these buildings are simple and bright, without any formalities. Inside the Lincoln Memorial, there is only a Lincoln statue, and nothing else. The Washington Monument is simply a towering stone shoot, the most memorable is the Capitol and the Library of Congress.

The US Congress, although not as quaint as the British one, is beautifully decorated and is often open to the public for visits, which is its characteristic. The building is roughly rectangular, with a dome hall in the middle, dividing the Senate and House of Representatives into two, each with chambers and offices.

The Library of Congress's collection of books, after the destruction of the Berlin Museum, is probably the world's largest. The original large building was not enough, and now another one has been opened, with many specially equipped individual reading rooms, and external sounds cannot disturb them at all. The library's catalog cabinets are already vast, and the richness of the books is staggering.

Thirty Chinese Books Presented to Marshall to Encourage Him

The library's organization has an Oriental Group China Department, and the collection of thread-bound books is no less than tens of thousands of volumes, managed by Chinese staff. This time, when Marshal Marshall was ordered to come to China, the Oriental Group selected thirty kinds of relevant Chinese reference books to give to Marshal Marshall to take with him. The library's exhibition of the original draft of the US Declaration of Independence and the original draft of the Constitution is very valuable, and all management is new and reasonable.

Washington's position after the war is still becoming more important day by day. The Secretary of State is running around, and Truman's weekly press conferences are no less than a barometer of international affairs. Moreover, American social problems, like those in Britain, are also precarious. The General Motors (G.E.) and General Electric (G.M.) labor strikes are still in a "tug-of-war" state, and the national electrical workers are brewing a general strike in January next year, which is really hurting the government's brains. American public opinion is also mixed. For every thing, it is inevitable to say good or bad. The US military is stationed in our North China, originally to disarm the Japanese, but now if ten newspapers, they are calling for it to withdraw quickly, especially a "Daily Worker" with the same name as the one in London, has too little of a "friendly" tone.

### An Extremely Important Yet Neglected Group: The Nutritional Problems of Poor Students

#### By Ni Zhangqi

After the war, there were scars everywhere. Today, the central government and allied relief organizations, the provinces, and the city charity organizations, although working hard to help, there is still a shortage of monks and little porridge. Therefore, those who are neglected and have not received relief are probably not just one group. The group referred to in this article is an extremely important group, but since it is important, it is neglected, which seems contradictory.

Who is the most important group being neglected by current relief efforts? I think it is diligent and frugal students. Now, let's talk about its importance first.

Speaking of students as extremely important members, it is not difficult to talk endlessly and redundantly. Let me give a few examples to illustrate:

Sun Yat-sen was also one of the students in his youth. After graduation, he first treated patients, and then he saved the weak and chaotic country, leading the sages and creating the Republic of China. Fifty years ago, without Dr. Sun Yat-sen's leadership, or if Dr. Sun had unfortunately passed away too early, the revolution to overthrow the Qing Dynasty by the Tongmenghui Kuomintang would have been difficult to proceed quickly.

By extension, the leaders of the four allied countries in this war and many meritorious personnel who directly and indirectly contributed to the victory, if they had been physically weak when they were in school and had difficulty undertaking difficult work when they were in office, what would have been the impact on the whole world?

Thomas Edison did not spend many years in school. After leaving school, he studied diligently and was able to contribute many inventions such as electric lights and phonographs to the world. If he had been weak due to lack of wheat materials in school, or if he had died while on the path of invention, what would have been the loss to the world?

What would have been the loss to the world if other scientists such as Pasteur, Koch, Ehrlich, Darwin, and Smith had died early due to physical weakness after graduation?

The above is an analogy from historical events, which is enough to show how important the responsibility of students is and how important their health is.

Speaking of students as "a group that has been neglected," the listener may think that it is not consistent with the facts; on the contrary, there are many facts that may prove that the central government and all sectors of society pay attention to and care for students.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the free areas and the occupied areas tried their best to maintain education, establish scholarships, student loans, free places, etc., to help poor students. Last spring, the newspaper reported that a gentleman donated 100 million student loans alone, which shows that there are many enthusiastic and loving students in the society. With the advent of victory, education has been highly valued. In Shanghai alone, there are many national, municipal, or private universities, middle schools, and primary schools. Although private schools have tight funds, they continue their scholarship program. All sectors of society are still actively donating to scholarships. In terms of education, students do not seem to have been forgotten.

In terms of hygiene, students have not been forgotten either. The Health and Epidemic Prevention Department of the Health Bureau has a special department in charge of school health. The Health Bureau has also jointly organized a Health Education Committee with the Education Bureau. Moreover, the municipal hospitals are not concentrated in one area, but are scattered in all parts of the city. Students who are sick can seek medical treatment from nearby municipal hospitals; and the entrance physical examination is also undertaken by nearby municipal hospitals.

Usually, there are many students who claim to be healthy, and others also know that they are really healthy. If you listen to their heart, check their lungs, check their blood, and test their urine, you will not find any evidence of disease. Naturally, they are not within the scope of hospital relief. But if you measure their height and weight, you will know that they are below the normal standard, especially the ratio of weight to height (also known as the nutritional quotient) is surprisingly unqualified. Many of these students are too light in weight, but since they are not patients, doctors do not consider them to be patients; therefore, the research groups of the Health Bureau and municipal hospitals, and research experts, cooperate with each other, and attach special importance to this problem. Students do not seem to have been neglected.

Although it is known that the problem of students being too light in weight is serious, it is known that they are healthy on the outside but dry on the inside, and it is also known that helping them with a few taels of nutritional food every day can achieve twice the result with half the effort in the long run; but until now, the nutritional food for students has not been implemented, which is really regrettable! What I mean by forgetting and being neglected is the nutritional problem of students.

If the problem of student malnutrition is neglected, it can affect other matters that are not neglected, and all efforts will be wasted. For example, students are studying in excellent schools with the help of scholarships, and thanks to the progress of various health undertakings, they have not suffered from infectious diseases during their study period; but their weight is always too light, just like building a house on sandy land, without a solid foundation, it is difficult to support it in the event of a sudden wind and rain. Their own ambitions, and the efforts, love, and hope of all sectors of society for them, will all be in vain with their weak bodies!

Newspapers publish that the government and many charities are devoted to various relief efforts, with a wide scope, including nursing homes, nurseries, orphanages, rehabilitation centers for the disabled, vocational training centers, shelters, soup kitchens, women's training centers, midwifery centers, outpatient clinics, free hospital beds, and others. It is a pity that there is no mention of subsidies for student meals! Is this a beautiful but insufficient occasional forgetfulness? Or is it about to start this important subsidy work?

From the point of view of humanitarianism and sympathy, many relief efforts are important. Now, speaking of the importance of subsidizing students' nutritional food, it is not to put this before other relief efforts, but to ask for a comprehensive plan and not to forget and neglect this equally important issue for a long time. The author has mentioned many times that if students are physically weak and die young, then their parents, teachers, friends, government, society, and various educational works will be in vain, and if those who die young have Edison's inventive ability, the world will also suffer losses. Therefore, the importance of subsidizing nutritional food is next only to subsidizing scholarships. Scholarships have been very successful, but subsidized nutritional food has not yet been implemented. The latter is slightly complicated to implement. In addition to social enthusiasts and experts, if teachers from various schools help with the distribution, it will be able to be pragmatic and orderly. The detailed methods can be formulated by experts.

The students' three meals a day, clothing, housing, and transportation are all undertaken by their parents. Only a few taels of food rich in protein and fat are supplemented every day, and the definite effect can be seen in the long run. Calculating the cost required for each person per month, the cost is small and the effect is great, which is far better than other relief efforts.

Many poor families often cut back on food and clothing to educate their children. It is said that although the family is poor, learning is not interrupted. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, prices were low, and each yuan could buy dozens of eggs or several bottles of milk, and at that time, there was a risk of lack of nutrients in the diet of poor students. What's more, in recent years, prices have soared to hundreds or thousands of times. Many families find it difficult to maintain firewood and rice, or they fill their stomachs with two congee and one meal, or cook corn with rice. They know that the nutrients in the food are not good and insufficient, but they have no good strategy; even tofu and dried tofu are many times more expensive than meat prices before the war. Scholarships and student loans are good deeds to help them through a difficult time, and there are many economic difficulties that are difficult to describe. Without guidance and advice, they know the importance of nutrients, but unfortunately these students and their families are powerless, almost like fish trapped in a dry ditch.

According to newspaper reports, unemployed workers and unemployed child laborers can get dozens of pounds of free flour every month. But it must be known that poor, hardworking, frugal, and thrifty students will serve society and the world in the future, and their importance may not be as important as today's ordinary workers, and the cost of subsidizing a student's nutritional food is far less than the need to relieve an unemployed worker.

Modern countries pay attention to education, and at the same time pay attention to student nutrition. In countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, students who are below the standard weight can drink free milk, and the cost is fully donated by the government and philanthropists; since its implementation, it has been beneficial without any harm. Whether before or after the war, the economies of British and American students are relatively more affluent, but they have long implemented subsidies for students' nutritional food. Our country should also rise up and catch up.

The Shanghai press and gentlemen from all walks of life have cooperated to hold scholarships several times, with remarkable results, and at present, all sectors of society are working together to form a student loan committee and vigorously promote it. I believe that regarding subsidies for students' nutritional food, we should also take advantage of this opportunity to work together with all our strength and earnestly cooperate. If the results are really good after a few months of implementation, the enthusiastic donors will not be limited to the local area and the country. And this extremely important yet neglected army can also get the subsidy of nutritional food.

### Local Finance and Commerce – A Weekly Summary: Securities See the Most Intense Price Surge; Commodities Also Rise More Than Fall

In the past week, due to the beginning of the Gregorian calendar year, the local financial market in this city saw an oversupply of floating capital. Speculators seized the opportunity to launch assaults on various markets, triggering a significant price surge. Government bonds, Chinese stocks, foreign stocks, yarn, cotton, cloth, artificial silk, raw silk, knitwear, silk fabrics, flour, sugar, and other commodities all reached unprecedented high prices. However, with the issuance of the domestic ceasefire order and the continuous sale of cotton yarn by the China Textile Construction Company, along with the ongoing sale of received supplies such as oil, sugar, meat, and fish, a substantial amount of currency has been absorbed. If the authorities truly have no intention of competing with the people for profit, then this policy of selling domestic goods at high prices can indeed stabilize the people's faith in legal tender and reduce the fervor of high-price speculation.

Finance: Last week, the daily interbank lending rate for 1,000 yuan in the silver and money market remained fixed at 0.3. The unofficial rate varied depending on the institution's status and creditworthiness, ranging from as low as 0.06 to as high as 0.12. Spot gold prices were influenced by higher gold prices in the Northeast, Tianjin, Beijing, and Kunming compared to Shanghai, and the U.S. dollar exchange rate had not yet been announced. The market fluctuated slightly between 820,000 and 870,000, finally settling at 851,000 yuan, an increase of 54,000 yuan from the previous week. The U.S. dollar initially fell due to rumors of import restrictions by the U.S. and that importers were not accepting large sums, but rebounded due to buying by money exchange businesses and manufacturers. The week closed at 1,440 yuan, up 35 yuan from the previous week. Although the U.S. dollar exchange rate has not been officially announced, exporters can freely store and dispose of foreign exchange earned from foreign sales. This is currently the case for exports of raw silk, tea, hairnets, straw hats, and pig bristles. Old Hong Kong dollars were sold by Hong Kong and Guangdong traders at low prices. Money exchange businesses and securities firms bought new issues, and there were rumors of a 2:1 ratio between new and old currency. The peak reached 90 yuan, resulting in an increase of 15 or 16 yuan from the previous week.

Securities: Government bonds surged due to the ceasefire order and the prospect of peaceful unification, along with rumors of consolidation and redemption of public bonds. Banks and speculators aggressively bought in. Category C bonds reached a peak of 1,350 yuan. Securities firms and established bulls sold Category C bonds and bought Category D bonds as a hedge, causing Category D bonds to also break through the 1,000 yuan mark. As a result, prices surged by 415 yuan (Category C) to 535 yuan (Category D) compared to the previous week. Chinese stocks rose due to talks by President Song on revitalizing industry and commerce and news of the resumption of trading at the Shanghai Stock Exchange under the leadership of Du Yuesheng. Large speculators, such as Zhu and Wang, and Cantonese gold merchants bought in large quantities, particularly focusing on the popular Wing On Textile Factory stock, which closed at a new high of 1,380 yuan, a sharp increase of 400 yuan from the previous week. Other stocks, both large and small, also reached new highs. The old cultural stock, Commercial Press, rose to 51,000 yuan. Foreign stocks saw a strong surge due to rumors that Shanghai would close as a free port and that British shipping companies had signed river transport agreements. Foreigners, money exchange businesses, and yarn traders bought in large quantities. The leading stock in the sector, Shanghai Dock and Engineering Company (Hall & Holtz), was particularly sought after, once breaking through the 10,000 yuan mark, a sharp increase of 2,500 yuan from the previous week. Other real estate and industrial stocks also saw new highs.

Regarding goods and commodities, rice from Wuhu and the interior arrived in large quantities, and prices were stimulated by flour. In addition, traders from Tianjin, Qingdao, and other regions purchased thin-husked rice, pushing prices up by 1,000 to 1,500 yuan compared to the previous week. Flour was purchased by traders from Fujian, Hankou, Shantou, and Southeast Asia. No. 1 Cannon brand flour reached 4,000 yuan per bag, an increase of 400 to 500 yuan from the previous week. Among miscellaneous grains, soybeans saw strong demand from oil factories, rising by 300 to 400 yuan per shipment. Raw peanuts saw brisk sales due to the upcoming Lunar New Year, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per load. Large dried raw peanuts specifically for export reached 26,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were frequently purchased by Taiwan and Shantou traders, rising by 300 to 400 yuan per piece. Cotton cakes, used for fuel, sold for 2,500 yuan per 50-jin piece. Cooking oil was purchased by Ningbo traders and local users, rising by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per load. Flat-price vegetable oil was sold at 125 yuan per jin, but soybean oil in the market still rose to 270 yuan. Sugar was in demand for the winter and New Year seasons, with traders from Bengbu, Ningbo, Wuhu, and the North purchasing granulated and powdered sugar. Factories could not meet demand. Although flat-price medium sugar was offered at 360 yuan, it still rose by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per load compared to the previous week. Cotton textiles initially surged due to textile factories seeking supplies. 42-count Blue Phoenix soared to 1.5 million yuan, and 20-count Double Horse reached 900,000 yuan. However, the China Textile Construction Company sold 200 to 300 bales of yarn daily, and customs prohibited shipments from Hong Kong, resulting in a decrease of 90,000 to 140,000 yuan compared to the previous week. Cotton cloth saw brisk sales locally, with dyeing factories seeking white plain cloth and traders from Sichuan, Bengbu, and other regions purchasing blue cloth, pushing prices up by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan per bolt. Cotton prices rose as the China Textile Construction Company and Rongfeng Textile Factory bought in large quantities. Tongzhou American cotton reached 95,000 yuan per load. However, the yarn market slumped and American cotton imports softened slightly. Other items: tea had sales channels to foreign firms and Northern traders; soap, candles, and firecrackers were purchased by Hankou traders; cigarette prices were initially strong but then weakened due to continuous allocations and the restoration of trading by cigarette exchange businesses.

### Deformed Steel Bars Active; New Rebar Market Improves

Deformed steel bars were originally a popular item among construction hardware. Since the victory, holders of the goods believed that real sales would be strong and they could wait for a better price. Who would have known that construction work would proceed so slowly, so sales of this product were delayed for a long time. It wasn’t until recently that trading started to become busy. This is due to the purchasing of construction gangs, but ultimately the inventory is richer. Therefore, prices have not yet improved as much as expected. At present, each ton is being sold for 220,000 to 230,000 yuan.

Previously, two-part new rebar goods from this factory once rose as high as more than 500,000 yuan per ton due to a shortage of goods. Afterwards, manufacturers continued to produce products, but real sales were quite dull, so the price fell back very sharply. In recent days, a turning point has gradually appeared, with each ton being offered at 250,000 to 260,000 yuan. However, compared with the highest peak, it is still less than half.

### Dyeing and Weaving Industry Revises New Prices

The Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association's dyeing group convened a group meeting to discuss the dye price issue. The price that had been resolved before was actually because all the dyes depended on the factory numbers in this city, and there was no sufficient source of fuel. The manufacturer's taxes were increasing day by day, and it was difficult to maintain the capital. Therefore, a new price list was drawn up, which will be announced and implemented today.

### U.S. Cotton Export Volume – Market Price Weakens

[Reuters, New York, 13th] Yesterday, the cotton market opened up 1 pound, then fell 5 pounds. The market fluctuated. Afterwards, the market was quite active. Due to unfavorable news of new cotton delivery and strikes, general market prices fell slightly. There were higher hopes of short selling. The long positions are in a wait-and-see state. In addition, due to the weekend, there were few transactions. Traders are paying close attention to continuing to oppose the proposed price limit. The old cotton was slightly frustrated. The new cotton’s position was stable and it remained high at 14 pounds.

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] The export volume of U.S. cotton could reach 3,500,000 to 4,000,000 bales by the end of July of this year. Last year's export volume was 2,000,000 bales.

### China Textile Construction Company to Take Over Enemy Property Yarn Factory Today; Raw Materials Will be Provided by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration

The China Textile Construction Company, under the leadership of General Manager Shu Yunzhang, has been negotiating with the special commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for days and is preparing to take over various yarn factories originally operated by the enemy. A consensus has been reached, and it has been decided to start this morning. Those prepared for takeover include the 20 yarn factories belonging to Neiwai, Gongda, and others. The company has assigned 20 receivers to take over and manage the factories today. As for the management issues of each factory, it is said that the company will make the most of talents and hire experienced experts. Among the personnel who came to Shanghai from Chongqing, there are more than 100 experienced technicians. Unless necessary, the existing Japanese technicians retained in each factory will be eliminated. Currently, the operating rate of each factory is 250,000 spindles, accounting for approximately 32% of the total spindles (the total number of spindles in each factory is 820,000). There are at least three reasons for the shutdowns: 1. Insufficient motive power. 2. Raw materials. 3. Lack of skilled workers. However, the raw material issue should no longer be a problem in the future, as a contract has been signed with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to supply 250,000 bales of American cotton.

### Revised Industrial and Commercial Regulations; Chongqing Industrial and Commercial Groups Request; Research of the Draft is Required

The industrial sector believes that this is related to its own interests and should request to participate in this meeting. It was passed that the joint factory group should request the government to submit the draft amendments to donation taxes and industrial and commercial regulations to the industrial and commercial groups for research in advance. Some factories that continue to operate feel that it is difficult to maintain, and they intend to request to suspend the payment of interest on loans from national banks.

### Brief News

Since Bureau Commissioner Yang Bingfan became the principal of the Shanghai South Municipal Agricultural Altar Elementary School, he has been determined to improve school affairs. Yesterday, the school held a parents' meeting, which was attended by more than 500 student parents and guests. Director Zhu of the National Education Office of the Education Bureau gave a speech of encouragement.

The pre-war site of the Municipal Xicheng Elementary School was on Penglai Road in the South City. The school building was spacious and occupied a large area. During the war, it was occupied by the enemy and puppets, and it was forced to move to its current site on Sappoesai Road. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the school held an alumni association meeting. Principal Chai Zifei reported on the eight years of history and the steps for preparing for the restoration of the school. A number of important cases were immediately resolved, including sending a letter to the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police to move out of the original school site on Lai Road, and raising funds to assist the alma mater in restoring the school.

The Ministry of Education believes that there is a great shortage of nationally designated textbooks in the recovered areas. It has specially invited representatives from Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, and other companies in Nanjing to discuss solutions. Representatives from each company will go to Beijing to attend the meeting within days. It is said that they will present the actual situation here and request the Ministry of Education to forward it for appropriate handling.

Private primary and secondary school principals in this city will hold a meeting at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge at 2:00 p.m. today to discuss important issues such as tuition fees, salaries, and loans. A reception for the press will be held at 4:00 p.m. on the ninth floor. No notices will be sent. Principals from each school can attend on time.

Daxia University Shanghai School has now decided to move the three colleges of liberal arts, sciences, and education back to the original site on Zhongshan Road in this city for classes in the next semester, and will also accept boarders. The colleges of law and commerce will remain at the current site on Jing'an Temple Road.

Primary school teachers in this city are living in poverty. It has been decided to launch a charity performance to raise a relief fund for teachers. A preparatory committee has been established and is actively planning and promoting it. It is expected to be implemented within the next week.

More than 100 students from Nanjing Provisional Second Middle School went to the Ministry of Education a few days ago to request improvements in their meals. The school principal, Shen Zumao, feared trouble and rushed to persuade them. Deputy Minister Hang personally met with them and agreed to increase the students' food expenses by 500 yuan per month, for a total of 2,500 yuan. Principal Shen then led all the students back to school.

The Shanghai Radio Station Federation, in order to enlighten the public and popularize electrical education, will hold lectures by celebrities, scheduled three times a week, broadcast in rotation by each radio station. The first speaker is Gu, Director of the Education Bureau, which will be broadcast by the National Radio Station starting at 6:00 p.m. today. At that time, all entertainment programs on all radio stations in the city will be suspended and broadcast simultaneously in order to spread the message widely.

Since coming to Shanghai, Zhengzhong Bookstore has been actively promoting its business. In addition to publishing six new books every week, it also prints the latest standard textbooks for schools at all levels in large quantities. In order to facilitate the use of books by the education community in the next semester, it has also printed a detailed list of textbooks, which is widely distributed for selection.

The Art Education Research Association is organized by music educators and labor-art teachers from elementary and secondary schools in this city. It was approved and registered by the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Education in the 28th year of the Republic (1939). Later, due to the deteriorating environment, the association's affairs were forced to stop. A few days ago, the executive committee members Jiang Danshu, Zai Yachen, Xu Xiyi, and Song Shouchang held a meeting to discuss a plan to restore the association. It is said that the meeting place will be temporarily located at Xiaoguang Middle School on Linsen Middle Road. The communication offices are located at Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road and Singapore Elementary School on Singapore Road. Any labor-art teachers from elementary and secondary schools in this city who wish to join the association can contact the above addresses to obtain a charter.

Chongqing News: On December 23 last year, the Shantang in Hao Rice Market Street suffered a fire, which affected the nearby China University. The Dezi Hall girls' dormitory was completely destroyed. The school held a school affairs meeting to discuss the aftermath and decided to allocate 300,000 yuan from the school to provide emergency loans. Based on the reported damage, students were given loans ranging from a maximum of 10,000 yuan to a minimum of 2,000 yuan. The chairman of the school board, He Chengjun, and Xu Yuanquan, inspected the disaster situation and donated 500,000 yuan as relief funds. The school closed on the 5th of this month and will move back to Wuchang in mid-April.

### Yesterday's Lease Period Production League; Qingbai Lives Up to Expectations; Wins a Big Victory Over the Soviet Union Seven to One; Jewish and British Navies Each Draw

There were two matches in the first division of the football league yesterday. At 10:00 a.m., there was a match between the Jewish and British Navies. The two sides were evenly matched, with each drawing two goals. At 2:30 p.m., the Chinese elite Qingbai team played against the Soviet Union. The weather was fine and warm, so there were many spectators. As a result of the match, Qingbai was able to cheer up and defeated the Soviet Union by seven to one.

The British and Jewish Teams Fought Fiercely Without a Winner

After defeating Qingbai last week, the Jewish team had Bo Shang general Fu En join the team yesterday, with great ambition. However, the British Navy also dispatched its elite troops to compete on an equal footing. In the first half, Jewish player Donas broke the Jewish goal first. Soon after, British Navy player Panki returned the favor, making it one goal each in the first half. In the second half, British Navy player Davidson forcefully scored. The Jews stepped up their efforts. In the end, Fu En scored, making it a tie again.

Qingbai Cheered Up

Defeated the Soviet Union Greatly

In the afternoon, in the game between Qingbai and the Soviet Union, the former had Qin Bida, Li Yichen, Fei Chunhua, and Gao Baozheng join the team yesterday, which greatly boosted the morale of the army. After taking the field, Qingbai still had an image of unfamiliar cooperation. It was not until 25 minutes later that Fei Chunhua tried to shoot. Espu received the ball and lost it again. Li Yichen rushed over and shoveled it in, making the first record. In less than ten minutes, Xiao Fei hooked in. Li Yichen headed it in again, making it two to zero in the first half. In the second half, Qingbai showed even more vigor. The Soviet Union became more and more chaotic as the war progressed, allowing Qingbai to do whatever they wanted. In ten minutes, Wu Qixiang was injured. Qin Bida served as a defender and Huang Shijie served as a goalkeeper. Not long after, Li Shoyou broke the enemy's goal, and Li Yichen added to the glory, leading by four to zero. Soon after, Soviet Tie Funi hit someone and was sentenced to a penalty kick. Lazy Niu sent the ball in, making it five to zero. Qingbai did not tire of scoring. Li Shoyou and Li Yichen each scored another goal, making it seven to zero. Finally, Soviet Mai Qi shot and hit the goal, resulting in a score of seven to one.

### Hopes for the Shanghai Textile Industry

— Zhang Mengzhao

The world is in a new era, revolving with the new times! Every second, every minute, it is constantly changing into new forms! "Elimination" for those who retreat! "Survival" for those who advance! This is the "Law of Natural Selection!" No one can escape this law. The writer has been involved in the textile industry for over seventeen years, and has devoted himself to it. On this New Year, I humbly wish to contribute my humble thoughts.

It cannot be denied that in the past, the Shanghai textile industry seemed like a heap of loose sand, lacking cohesion and unity. Before the War of Resistance against Japan, the Japanese yarn and cloth factories had an absolute advantage in terms of technology, production and sales, management, and economy! On the one hand, they used unequal treaties as a talisman, and on the other hand, they had government financial support as their backing! With so many spindles and such advanced technology, their yarn and cloth were popular in every poor rural area! Products such as Blue Phoenix yarn and Dragon Head fine cloth were almost household names. Everyone bought a roll, and enemy merchants absorbed the economic blood of every one of our compatriots, leaving no loophole. Some people said, "Don't we also have our own yarn and cloth factories, not too many, not too few?" Sadly, restricted by foreign unequal treaties and lacking government support, they were plagued by internal injuries, backward technology, and poor management. The loose sand could not be united, so they lay down on the side of the river and let others sleep soundly, forming a situation where the guests were more powerful than the host, and there was no cure. When the War of Resistance broke out, Shanghai, a major industrial and commercial city known as the "New York of the East," finally fell into enemy hands. At this time, it was a touchstone for distinguishing loyalty and treachery in the national industry (this is not limited to the national industry). Some factories preferred to die rather than surrender, while others surrendered and cooperated with the enemy, spinning yarn, weaving cloth, or making military uniforms, and willingly became lackeys of the enemy. This is a disgrace in the history of China's national light industry, a permanent stain that cannot be washed away by our light industry. However, I think the traitors who truly surrendered to the enemy were probably few. Most industrialists with the belief of "nation above all" and "ethnicity above all" and with a conscience, either were forced by irresistible threats, or walked on a dead end in order to desperately maintain the livelihood of their employees. However, the distinction between black and white after the dawn cannot be concealed. Loyalty is loyalty, treachery is treachery, clearly distinguished. Looking back at the various oppressions and aggressions of enemy merchants in the past, and our own頹廢 and uncompetitive behavior, we should learn from the pain. As the saying goes, "All the past things are as if they died yesterday! All the present things are as if they will be born tomorrow!" From now on, we should inspire rational "self-reflection," and from reflection, generate new and bright hopes! Devote ourselves to the reconstruction of light industry! The enemy has already surrendered! The restrictions of unequal treaties have also been lifted! From now on, our beautiful land is our own territory! We should invest in the exploration and mining of the rich coal mines, which are the lifeline of light industry, and how should we spread excellent cotton seeds and plan to increase the large amount of cotton production on the vast fields of cotton that are necessary raw materials for our spinning and weaving, and how to set up factories to manufacture textile machinery, how to install generators, create our own power, how to immerse ourselves in research on textile technology to enhance the yarn's tensile strength, high quality, and increase productivity, how to manage labor education, labor insurance, labor recreation, and labor welfare to enhance the feelings and strong unity between labor and capital! Starting from the current 2 million spindles in Shanghai's textile industry, which is supported by both the government and the people, gradually expand to 20 million spindles, 200 million spindles, and even 2 billion spindles! This is not an exaggerated hope! "It depends on human effort," and it is not difficult to "achieve one's ambition"! Even with 2 billion spindles, spreading to all parts of China, which has more than 30 provinces, and estimating the minimum population at 500 million people, it is only 4 spindles per person. Considering the huge amount of yarn and cloth consumption needed for clothing in China and the expected active yarn and cloth export trade in the future! The number of 2 billion spindles is still insignificant! How to achieve that goal? This is the responsibility of the entire Shanghai textile industry, which has a long history, outstanding position, and driving force!

### Amidst the National Recovery, All Aspects of Education in the Capital

During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the losses in education in the capital were extremely large, and it will take time to reorganize and improve them in the future. Regarding the questions you have asked, I will briefly describe the recent situation of education in various aspects:

Ministry of Education

For the recovery work, the Ministry of Education has successively sent many staff members to Nanjing to work. The ministry's address is still on Chengxian Street. In order to handle matters quickly and efficiently, the ministry has decided that all documents belonging to the education bureaus of Nanjing and Shanghai, as well as the five provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi, will be handled by the person in charge of the Ministry of Education in Nanjing on behalf of the ministry. Unless it is particularly important and must be decided by Minister Zhu, they will consult Chongqing and then proceed. In addition, official documents from the education bureaus of other provinces and cities will be sent directly to Chongqing for processing. Minister Zhu Jiahua and Vice Minister Zhu Jingnong are currently in Chongqing. Vice Minister Hang Liwu is in Nanjing, acting on behalf of the minister. Inspector Peng Baichuan was the first to arrive in Nanjing. Currently, the persons in charge of various departments are: Director Huang Rujin of the Social Affairs Department, who also serves as secretary; Section Chief Zhong Lingxiu; Assistant Xu Weizhu of the General Affairs Department; Section Chief Ma Jiyuan of the Higher Education Department; Section Chief Wang Weixin of the Secondary Education Department; Section Chief Xue Tianhan of the National Education Department; and Section Chief Zeng Shudong of the Tibetan Affairs Department. As for the administrative heads of education in Nanjing and Shanghai and the five provinces, the Ministry of Education has decided that Cheng Shizheng will remain as the Director of the Jiangxi Education Department, Xu Shaodi will be reinstated as the Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, Chen Shizhen, former counselor of the Ministry of Education and counselor of the Executive Yuan, will be transferred to serve as the Director of the Jiangsu Education Department, Wang Shaonan is currently the Director of the Anhui Education Department, and the Fujian Education Department has been changed twice since Zheng Zhenwen was promoted to a member of the Central Party and Government Affairs Committee. Gu Yuxiu, former Vice Minister of Education, will take over as the Director of the Shanghai Education Bureau, and Chen Jianru will be reinstated as the Director of the Nanjing Social Affairs Bureau.

Universities

The original site of National Central University is still occupied by military hospitals, epidemic prevention troops, and vaccine and serum guidance centers, and has not yet been completely vacated. Only a part of it has been received by the school's receiving committee, including the auditorium and the gymnasium. The medical school, teaching rooms, and affiliated middle school will be received soon. It is expected that the school can be relocated and classes can resume in the summer of 1946. However, it is said that after the school moved to Chongqing, it has more than 4,000 students, which is four times more than the 1,000 students before the war. The original school buildings are already insufficient. In addition, the President of Jinling University, Chen Yuguang, will reportedly fly to Nanjing for a week of inspection and then return to Chongqing. The reopening of the school will also be after the summer. The temporary university preparatory class sponsored by the Ministry of Education will use the buildings received by National Central University for office, classes, and accommodation. Peng Baichuan, a senior inspector of the Ministry of Education, will also be in charge of it. More than a dozen faculty members have been hired (including Chen Jieda, Jin Shuqiao, Ye Shaonong, Xue Wujing, Wu Zhengwei, etc.). There are 900 students, divided into arts and sciences groups (arts includes literature, law, commerce, education; science includes science, agriculture, engineering, medicine). It is at the level of a university preparatory course, with a study period of one year. Those who complete the course and pass can enter the first year of a regular university. The class is expected to start within the first ten days of this month. In addition, the temporary university supplementary class sponsored by the Ministry of Education will temporarily use the old Jinling University buildings for office, classes, and accommodation, and Wang Shulin will be in charge of it. There are dozens of faculty members and more than 2,000 students. According to the examination level, they are divided into grades one, two, three, and four, with all subjects in arts and sciences. However, due to the lack of equipment and talents from the mainland, the medical students will be sent to the Southeast Medical College in Shanghai for enrollment. The third and fourth grade engineering students will be sent to Shanghai Jiaotong University for enrollment. The class has been open for three weeks, with a study period of one year. All students in grades one, two, and three who complete the supplementary period and pass can be sent to regular universities according to their grades to move up one grade. All students in the fourth grade who can complete the course and pass can be considered graduates. The above-mentioned temporary university preparatory and supplementary classes are only for one year of study and are not intended to be a temporary university. Those who pass the examination will be assigned to the supplementary class for one year, while the preparatory class will require one more year of study.

Middle Schools

The three national temporary middle schools sponsored by the Ministry of Education are located in Longpanli (Principal Yu Caicheng), Sanmaogong (Principal Shen Zumo), and Zhuqiao. Each school has more than 1,000 students in each grade of senior and junior high school. In addition, the middle schools sponsored by the Social Affairs Bureau of the Nanjing Municipal Government include Municipal No. 1 Middle School, No. 2 Middle School, No. 3 Middle School (formerly Zhengshi Middle School), Girls' Middle School, Vocational Middle School, and Simple Normal School, totaling six schools. Private middle schools include Anhui, Zhongying, Zhongnan, Jinghua, Yecheng, Dongfang, and Chengmei. Anhui moved to Tunxi during the war. The principal is Yao Wencai. Because the original school buildings in Nanjing were damaged, the number of classes currently offered is not large. They still travel between Nanjing and Anhui, taking care of both sides, and are gradually restoring the whole school. Zhongying has never been interrupted and is currently under the administration of Yu Caicheng. Zhongnan, Principal Qiao Yifan, came to Nanjing and then went to Chongqing. The school suffered a lot of damage, and it is not easy to restore it at the moment. Jinghua, Principal Fu Kuanglin, is currently a teacher and is also very hesitant to reopen the school. Yecheng and Dongfang have both reopened. Chengmei has already started classes. Church middle schools include Huiwen Girls' Middle School, Zhonghua Girls' Middle School, Mingde, Yuqun, Jinling Middle School, and the affiliated middle school of Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, all of which have resumed classes. The Catholic Church also established the Lijizi Middle School in Beiting Lane.

Municipal Bureau

Because the houses of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau have not been fully recovered, it is temporarily located on Shanxi Road with the Municipal Government, which is too far from the original location of Gongyuan, making contact inconvenient. Under Director Chen Jianru, the general affairs are in charge of Section Chief Fang, school education is in charge of Section Chief Yue, and social education is in charge of Director Ji Deliang. There are three municipal middle schools for boys, one for girls, and one each for simple teachers and vocational schools. The distribution of elementary schools in the city, Xiaguan, and outside the city is currently about 60 schools. The schools that were originally run by the church and taken over by the city include Fuminfang, Guyilang, Cibeishe, Gulou, and other elementary schools. Before the war, the school buildings of Cui Baxiang, Malu Street, Huaiqing Bridge, Youfu West Street, Xiangpu Camp, Central Road, Cangding, Gaojing, Hanximen, and Nanchang Road Elementary Schools were completely destroyed and not established, so the number of schools was reduced. Social education includes the First and Second Mass Education Centers, a library, and the First and Second Central Mass Schools. The historical museum and sports field before the war were completely destroyed, and only the swimming pool at Jiulong Bridge has been recently received and opened. The selection of personnel for the positions of principals and directors of various schools and museums has been gradually adjusted, and new appointments or additional appointments have been made. After careful selection and examination of teachers, qualified teachers are employed in all schools. It is hoped that the improvement of treatment and the stability of teachers' lives will enhance the effectiveness of education. (Ann)

### Army Headquarters and Garrison Headquarters Will Soon Jointly Try Jiang Gongmei for Seven Major Crimes Involving Li Ze

[This newspaper report] Former Shanghai Military Police Captain Jiang Gongmei was accused of arbitrarily arresting people, illegally detaining vehicles, stealing materials, and extorting money while in office. After receiving repeated complaints from the people to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, an investigation confirmed the evidence. On October 12 of last year, an order was issued to disarm and disband the entire team and arrest Jiang Gongmei. While the case was being investigated, Director Chi Ping of the Chongqing Military Police Headquarters came to Shanghai to take him back for handling. Later, due to the seriousness of the case, an order was issued by the Chairman to have the Songhu Garrison Headquarters handle the case according to law.

Escorted to Shanghai for Joint Trial

The Military Police Headquarters followed the order and sent Major Zeng Jianren, along with the case files, to Shanghai by plane a few days ago. They were handed over to the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters for trial. After Director Zeng Zhaoyi quickly sorted out the case files, they were ready for trial. In order to show his seriousness, Commander Qian also telegraphed the Army Headquarters to send personnel to Shanghai for a joint trial. Once they arrive, the trial can begin. The following is a brief record of Jiang Gongmei's crimes:

Numerous Crimes Involving a Wide Range of People

Jiang Gongmei's crimes include three cases of soldiers harming the people, nine cases of arbitrarily releasing criminals, five cases of torture, one case of embezzling public property, two cases of stealing materials, and other acts of corruption, totaling seven major crimes. In addition, he is also involved in the current sensational case of Li Ze, the general manager of the New-New Company, who is suspected of collaborating with the enemy. In September, Li Ze allegedly bribed Jiang with 200 million yuan in counterfeit currency and a car.

Hidden Materials Recovered

As for the materials he secretly hid while in office, they are now awaiting reports from all parties. Part of them have been seized by the Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, including 107 large and small pieces of cotton cloth (approximately 3,000 bolts), another 432 bolts, 68 boxes of soap, 134 large and small rubber tires, 11 boxes of inner tubes, 113 pieces of cotton, 154 bales of kapok, 26 boxes of Western medicine, 133 bags of sugar, 38 boxes of screw plates, and other dyes, raw silk, matches, candles, sulfur, etc., which are considerable in quantity.

Soldiers Harming the People and Arbitrarily Releasing Criminals

The cases of soldiers harming the people include the robbery of 62 boxes of cigarettes from Yeguang Weaving Factory, extortion of gold ornaments from porters at the North Station, and robbery of cloth from Wang Xiaoquan. There are a total of nine cases of arbitrarily releasing criminals (Editor's note: The Garrison Headquarters is planning to re-arrest these criminals and bring them to justice. The headquarters has instructed us not to publish them temporarily, so we will omit them.)

Torture and Embezzlement of Public Property

The cases of torture include carpenter Shen Yunguo, An Guojiong, a staff member of the Korean Progressive Newspaper's business department, and Qu Zhonghua, a worker at the British-American Company. The embezzlement of public property includes secretly hiding three cars from the number of cars received by the team from the former enemy military police team in Shanghai South and storing them at the International Automobile Company and Liu Zhiming's place. The stealing of materials includes 27 boxes of Western medicine sealed at Xinzao Elementary School and other important materials and 27 barrels of gasoline from Fuda Coal Company. It was also found that the team never registered the names of the detainees, and when releasing criminals, they would write "Released on discussion" without stating the reasons. Therefore, it is believed that after the trial, the crimes committed will be more than this number.

### Indictment of Xiang Kangyuan; High Court Issues Arrest Warrant

[This newspaper report] Following Li Ze, Xiang Kangyuan, the manager of Kangyuan Canning Factory, was also reported by the factory's employees, who pointed out that Xiang had held the puppet position of city advisory committee member. The High Procuratorate's Office had ordered Xiang Kangyuan to be summoned for interrogation on the 10th, but Xiang himself did not appear. Only his wife submitted a statement, stating that her husband was not in Shanghai and requesting a postponement of the interrogation. However, the High Procuratorate's Office believed that the reason why Xiang was not in Shanghai was unfounded and was obviously intended to evade. Therefore, it issued an arrest warrant a few days ago, ordering the police to arrest him quickly for investigation.

### US Secretary of the Army Patterson Arrives in Shanghai Today; US Military Headquarters Prepares to Welcome Him

US Secretary of the Army Patterson is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. The US Military Headquarters is preparing to welcome him and has borrowed General Pink's office on the 16th floor of the Construction Building as a temporary meeting room.

[This newspaper report] A broadcast from San Francisco on the 13th stated that US Secretary of the Army Patterson arrived in Korea today and will fly to Shanghai tomorrow morning.

### Shanghai Students Denounce French Consul General

Yesterday, the students of Shanghai issued a declaration on the movement to safeguard sovereignty in response to the case of the French warship smuggling war criminals, stating: The French Consul General, disregarding everything, secretly transported Karkopinno from the French warship Beertin to Saigon for trial. Afterwards, he claimed that this was a local event in an attempt to reduce his own guilt. Obviously, the French Consul General's office had no sincerity in accepting the protests of the municipal government and the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and did not want to take appropriate measures to remedy the incident. We painfully recognized their true colors. We want to settle accounts. We demand that the French government apologize to our country and guarantee that the same incident will never happen again.

### Enemy Fugitive Arrested in a Spring Factory

Wang Yingxiang, the captain of the Second Brigade of the Shanghai North District Security Corps, received a tip-off on the 11th that an enemy military fugitive from the Wusong concentration camp was hiding in a spring iron factory at No. 304 Baiyu Lane, Mabai Road, Xiaoshadu Road. Captain Wang immediately ordered Captain Zhao of the Sixth Company to lead a number of corps members and police officers from the Putuo Road Police Station to the address. They arrested an enemy fugitive named Enomoto Yoshishiro on the spot, as well as three Chinese factory owners named Xu Kunyuan, Zhang Tingcai, and Chen Xiubin, and seized a large number of cloths and other materials. They took them back for interrogation. According to the confession of the enemy fugitive, he used to work as a clerk in the 3064th unit and admitted that he had cut down trees in Zhenru, Dachang, and Pengpu for military use. He asked to be sent to the General Corps for punishment according to law.

### Twenty-Four Enemy Factories Resume Operation After Takeover

Since the Economic Department's Special Envoy Office for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui sent personnel to take over enemy factories in this city, they have been actively resuming operations so that production will not be interrupted and the livelihoods of workers can be maintained. So far, the department has taken over ten machinery factories, including Tianlu Copper Smelting Plant, and fourteen chemical factories, including Shanghai Rubber Industry Society, a total of twenty-four factories, all of which have resumed operation one after another, and the results have been excellent. There are also twenty-three textile factories that have been transferred to the China Textile Construction Company and will also resume operation in the coming days.

### Criminal Court of High Court Continues to Try Traitors Today

The Temporary Criminal Court of the Shanghai High Court in Tilanqiao will begin trying a large number of traitors again this morning. The trial of Ling Guangyan will begin at 9:00 AM. Ling was a traitor who held important military and political positions in the puppet government. At 9:30 AM, the trial of Xue Youwen will continue. At 2:00 PM, the verdict of the Xu Xing case will be announced. Starting at 2:30 PM, the trials of Gu Youtang, Jiang Yougen, Shen Ande, and Zuo Ming will begin.

### Repatriation of Japanese Residents Still Requires Half a Year

[This newspaper report] In order to understand the current situation of Japanese residents in Shanghai, the reporter visited the Japanese Residents Management Office yesterday. Deputy Director Zou Ren explained the following:

There are currently 74,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai, freely residing in the four concentration areas of Hongkou and Qimei Road. The Baojia organization is perfect, and the autonomous association is in charge of everything, directly supervised by the Japanese Residents Management Office. Only more than 4,000 Japanese residents have returned to their country so far. Due to the difficulty of obtaining ships, the repatriation time will take at least five or six months. The Japanese prisoners of war in the concentration camp are completely autonomous. Although some prisoners of war are working outside, they are only temporarily dispatched. As for how to use the labor of Japanese prisoners of war to help with the reconstruction, there is still no concrete plan.

### Beijing-Shanghai Line Slow Trains Resume Operation

The slow trains No. 21 and No. 22 on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, which departed at 7:00 AM, had been temporarily suspended due to a lack of vehicles. They have now resumed operation since yesterday.

### Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Seven Other Groups Telegraph All Members of the Political Consultative Conference to Express Congratulations and Expectations

Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Local Association, and seven other groups jointly telegraphed all members of the Political Consultative Conference to express their congratulations and expectations. The original telegram read: "To all members of the Chongqing Political Consultative Conference, the country is broken and urgently needs reconstruction from the beginning. World peace depends on the stability of the Far East. The responsibility of our country is heavy and its relationship is great, unprecedented in history. The responsibility for the merits and demerits of the country rests entirely on the shoulders of the public, and the key lies in the shift of one thought. Chairman Chiang said in his opening speech that "the interests of the nation and the nation should come first, and the interests of the party or individual should come last," and "to support the government, strengthen the government, and not weaken the government," are the most reasonable sayings and the steel framework for the success of the meeting. Time will not come again, opportunities are hard to lose, and the life of the nation is in this moment. We respectfully express our congratulations and expectations with words of criticism and good advice. We hope you will consider it carefully. Signed, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Local Association, Shanghai General Labor Union, Shanghai Farmers' Association, Shanghai Women's Association, Shanghai Education Association, and Shanghai Student Federation".

### A Stroll Through the Qujiang Road Flea Market

— Pingqi

If you take the No. 1 tram to the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qujiang Road and get off, you will definitely see a large crowd of people from afar, crowded on a piece of ruins left after the war. This is the "Qujiang Road Flea Market," a place where many Shanghai people come specifically from Huxi or Nanshi to "snap up cheap goods."

There are about a hundred stalls in total, but the turnover is very high. Sometimes, the stallholders buy and sell from each other, and the used goods become like "footballs," being kicked around by people. As for the source of these used goods, it is obvious that they are all Japanese items. However, if you question the stallholders about how they acquired them, none of them ever say they bought them directly from Japanese residents' homes. The apparent value of the goods varies greatly. Some stalls only have six or seven pairs of worn-out military boots and a dozen or so coats, while one stall specializes in wooden furniture. This stall is the most elaborate because it even has a tiled shed to provide shelter from the wind and rain. They sell wardrobes, suitcases, sofas, writing desks, five-drawer chests, etc., that are not yet completely worn out, and the prices they ask are by no means lower than those of old furniture shops on Beijing Road. The most eye-catching items are the colorful furoshiki (wrapping cloths) carried by Japanese women, with their vibrant colors, quite dazzling. However, Qujiang Road is full of dust, and the afterglow of the setting sun shines down, making it clear that they have faded from their original colors!

There are also many tea sets and sake sets, but the quality is not good. More interesting are those items brought from their home country, such as the exquisitely crafted "ningyo" (dolls). There are also several small gold paper screens, about a foot high, with quite admirable carving work. Surprisingly, there are almost no books. One female customer selected a furoshiki, and the stallholder specially folded it into a small square and placed it in a flat, rectangular paper box for her. When he took out the box lid, I suddenly saw two characters written neatly on it—"National Debt"! The Japanese people bought an astonishing amount of "National Debt," and this is what the warlords and politicians are rewarding them with today!

At first, I heard that the Japanese themselves were setting up stalls, but it turned out that almost all the stallholders were compatriots. Perhaps one or two were Koreans, because their accents were a bit strange. One stallholder told me that there were several "used goods customers" who came every day. They bought cheap and then sold them at high prices in the display windows of their own shops. They are the ones who really make big money because they have a lot of capital. The stallholders, due to their limited cash flow, are often forced to sell cheaply. On a good day, they can earn tens of thousands of legal tender, but on a bad day, they can also lose money.

There is really everything at the flea market: things to wear, things to use, things for children to play with, as well as radios, gramophones, bed curtains, bedding, hats, military blankets, suitcases, electrical materials, Western-style clothing, etc. There are also two noodle stalls, with a surprisingly large number of customers and a thriving business. However, in this large open space, perhaps only these two noodle stalls have "genuine fixed prices." At the flea market, bargainers often offer three thousand, while sellers counter with only five hundred, and yet the transaction is successfully completed.

When I squeezed out of the "siege," three or four Japanese residents with white strips of cloth wrapped around their arms happened to pass by. They lowered their heads and quickened their pace. North Sichuan Road and Qujiang Road used to be the places they were most familiar with, and today's scene is like this. I would very much like to know what they think. Although the fields are "already" overgrown with weeds, I still hope they will go back soon. To be honest, Shanghai is experiencing a housing shortage, and the thousands of houses in Hongkou have been occupied by them for too long.

### Visiting the Changzhi Warship

— Shutao

The Jiangnan Shipyard has a long history, and the recent turmoil has greatly changed its appearance. There are now three docks, and the Changzhi warship is berthed in the easternmost one. There are five platoons of soldiers standing at attention on board, who will soon disembark in order. They happily went north. They are in black clothes and white hats, extremely magnificent, truly enviable. I walked up to a soldier and explained my purpose, requesting permission to board the ship for a visit. After he took my name card to Commander Chang, a young officer with a steady gait and bright eyes came out a minute later. I explained my intention again and was granted permission. He then led me to various parts of the ship for a tour.

More Than Two Hundred Officers and Soldiers on the Whole Ship

The young officer was Lieutenant Zhu Liangquan from Yangzhou, who spoke with refinement. We entered the reception room, which was neatly and simply furnished. In addition to the tables and chairs covered with white cloth, there was a small paifang (archway) about two feet high and one foot wide in the corner of the room. On the paifang was a red wooden plaque of "Mazu, the Heavenly Mother," presumably the talisman of the Japanese warship. Just as I was about to ask a question, Lieutenant Zhu began to tell me about the warship. He said that Commander-in-Chief Chen often stayed on the ship. Captain Deng Zhaoxiang and Executive Officer Cheng Fakan were both out on official business, and he was currently responsible for everything. Today, because it was a Sunday holiday, the soldiers on the port side could have four hours of rest from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, while the soldiers on the starboard side worked as usual. There were more than two hundred officers and soldiers on the whole ship, including twenty-six Japanese technicians who were in the process of handing over their duties and would soon be sent back to their country.

The Changzhi warship is the largest of the enemy ships received by the Chinese Navy. It was originally named the Uji gunboat, with a displacement of 1,350 tons. It uses gasoline as fuel and has a speed of 20 nautical miles per hour. It was commissioned on October 30, 1941 (Showa 16), participated in the Battle of Hong Kong on December 8, 1942, and was converted into the flagship of the Yangtze River Fleet in 1943. Later, because the fleet suffered heavy losses, it was converted into a escort ship. This shows that the enemy fleet had reached a dead end at that time and was bound to be defeated without a fight.

Well-Equipped with Weapons

The Changzhi warship is armed with three 120mm main guns, nine 24mm machine guns, and one depth charge launcher. In May last year, the enemy reinstalled a radar system (called "dentan" in Japanese). After the victory of the War of Resistance and the unconditional surrender of the enemy, the Chinese Navy officially accepted the Uji gunboat on September 13 and renamed it the Changzhi warship. All the equipment on the ship was undamaged. The radar had only been installed for more than four months from the time of installation to the time of surrender, so it can be said to be the most well-equipped enemy warship received.

After being received, the Changzhi warship was reorganized into the flagship of the Second Fleet of the Navy, with five warships under its command. On Double Ten Day (October 10th), it sailed to Nanjing. When passing Jiangyin, the New Fourth Army shelled the ship from both banks of the river. One shell landed fifty meters away from the stern of the ship, failing to hit it. At the end of October, it was sent to Taiwan to accept the surrender of the enemy navy, first arriving at Xiamen. Commander-in-Chief Chen Shaokuan took the opportunity to go to Xiamen and then took the Changzhi warship from Xiamen to the ports of Keelung in Taipei, Taiwan, and Magong in the Ryukyu Islands. It returned to Shanghai a month ago. Because the bottom of the ship needed to be repaired, it entered the Jiangnan Shipyard after arriving in Shanghai. After leaving the dock in the future, it may go to Qingdao or be stationed along the Yangtze River, but it has not yet been decided. Lieutenant Zhu's words came to an end. At this time, he led me to visit all parts of the ship. It didn't get used in this war, they wasted a lot of effort, and in the end they failed. That is the fate of overusing weapons.

Visiting the Wheelhouse and Radio Room

Leaving Lieutenant Zhu's room to a small room of five or six square feet, there are five compasses all around. On both sides, the Changzhi warship was originally one of the largest warships received from the enemy. Recently, it was moored in the Jiangnan Shipyard for repairs. There are more than two hundred crew members on the ship, and the weapons and all the equipment are very complete. The Changzhi warship is now a flagship, with five warships under its command. The cannons in the picture are quite powerful, formerly belonging to Captain Deng. Arriving at the commander-in-chief's room, the layout is neat and magnificent, with a long red felt table placed horizontally in the middle, with chairs on both sides and red sofas at both ends. The southwest corner is the commander-in-chief's bedroom. Coming out is the office of the captain, executive officer, and staff. Then I entered Lieutenant Zhu's room, each room having wireless broadcasting and music. Lieutenant Zhu opened a gas mask and said to me, this is also left to us by the enemy, unfortunately, there are two two-foot-long telescopes. I curiously looked through them, but the view was extremely blurry. Lieutenant Zhu smiled and explained to me that this was because of the refraction of the front glass window, so it was not clear. He pointed to the four machine guns beside him, caliber 24-M.M. The firepower is quite strong. From here, down the stairs to the front deck, there are two 12-inch main guns with a range of 15,000 meters. Behind it are four boxes of shells for emergency use, each box containing twelve shells more than two feet long. Further back is the ammunition depot, which can be taken out of the ship by machine and transferred to the ship. He pointed to the radar to show me, and then pointed to the radio room, saying that it might be more interesting inside, because the loudspeaker was broadcasting the Italian army marching song. We then walked to the radio room with excited steps. The equipment in the room is complex, with six wireless military machines, telegraph machines, telephones, and many wires, which made me dizzy. Leaving the radio room, we went to the rear of the ship to visit the depth charge, which looks like a cow's horn, the gun body is about two feet long, and its use is also very mysterious, it is the enemy of submarines.

At this time it was already two o'clock, of course Lieutenant Zhu was very busy, so I didn't dare to delay any longer and wanted to say goodbye. But Lieutenant Zhu kindly asked me to sit in the reception room, and gave me two boxes of 50-watt heat-energy food (Japanese name) for naval use, which is a kind of coconut-flavored candy. And he sincerely told me that the Chinese navy is in its budding stage, and it needs the attention and care of the Chinese people. We have such a long coastline, we face the largest ocean in the world, we have 450 million compatriots, but our navy is so weak. The Chinese navy depends on whether we Chinese have the determination to make it strong. Finally, Lieutenant Zhu hoped that everyone would not forget to build a large navy to maintain world peace forever. Just as we were talking, a messenger suddenly came in to report that Captain Deng and Executive Officer Cheng had returned. So he led me to meet Captain Deng, and after the introduction, we went to the deck to take a photo together, and then I took my leave.

### Soviet Trade Representative Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday

Commercial relations between China and the Soviet Union are now actively being restored. The Soviet trade representative, Mr. Arenikov, arrived in Shanghai yesterday.

### The Bureau of Navigation Administration Sells Cheap Coal to Ships

In order to standardize freight rates and passenger fares on various routes, the Shanghai Bureau of Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transportation has, after consulting with the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee, arranged for the sale of cheap coal to ships. The price is three to four times lower than the market price of coal. However, merchant ships on various routes must follow the following two procedures in order to obtain the cheap coal: (1) They must be merchant ships operating on routes specified by the Bureau of Navigation Administration; (2) The quantity to be issued must be approved by the National Ship Allocation Committee.

Screening of Nautical Talents

In order to screen nautical talents, the Bureau will hold nautical talent examinations in mid-next month. According to Chief Chen of the Bureau, the purpose of holding the nautical talent examinations is threefold: (1) Nautical personnel who held old nautical licenses during the eight years of the War of Resistance will have their new licenses exchanged after passing the screening; (2) Those who have made progress in nautical technology during the eight years will also have their new, upgraded licenses exchanged after testing; (3) The results of this examination will be used to determine the ability and number of nautical talents in China, so as to facilitate the allocation of work to develop China's shipping.

Jiangchang Repair Postponed

Ships on the Shanghai-Tongzhou-Qidong line were once suspended due to errands. The Jiangchang ship returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Originally, it was planned to be repaired, but in order to maintain transportation, it was temporarily suspended. It is scheduled to sail to Qinglong Port at 5:00 AM tomorrow. The Jiangding ship returned to Shanghai from Tiansheng Port yesterday and will still sail to Tiansheng Port at 7:00 AM tomorrow. It is not yet certain whether the Kaijiang Tong and Dafeng ships, which are also expected to arrive in Shanghai today, will immediately resume sailing to Tiansheng Port. The Dada ship is rescheduled to arrive in port today. Because it still needs to sail to Hankou on an errand, it is scheduled to sail upstream on the 17th. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianghan ship has already sailed to Hankou from Nanjing on an errand and will not come to Shanghai for the time being.

### Repayment of Deposits at the Puppet China Xingye Bank Begins Today

### Discussing "Making Life Artistic"

— Song Shouchang

"Making Life Artistic" is one of the three major goals of the New Life Movement. The so-called "Making Life Artistic" means filling our daily lives with beautiful emotions. In other words, our lives should feel interesting. The essence of art is beauty, and beauty can bring pleasure to humanity. Therefore, an artistic life can also be said to be a beautiful life.

Loving beauty is a noble human instinct. The natural world is arranged with beautiful environments, such as the clear breeze on the river, the bright moon in the mountains, idle flowers and wild grasses, the sound of pines and clear springs—all of these are beautiful pictures, beautiful music. This kind of natural beauty is everywhere, and we can seek interest in space and time, and feel spiritual pleasure from the stimulation of beauty. Generally, people think that reason and will determine our behavior, but this view is wrong. The driving force behind human behavior is emotion. To have good behavior, we must first have beautiful emotions, and the most effective way to cultivate emotions is through art. If our spiritual life has no connection with art, then our emotional life will inevitably wither, leading to tragic consequences in life, and all kinds of evil thoughts and improper behaviors will arise as a result.

Since art can compensate for the defects of life and relieve the pain of life, to enable the public to enjoy a beautiful life and make life more rational, the only way is to elevate the highest spiritual activity of mankind, which is art, and pay attention to the cultivation of art. In ancient China, governing the country and educating the people relied heavily on the influence of art. As stated in the "Rites of Zhou": "Nurturing the sons of the state with the Way, they are taught the six arts: first, the five physical exercises; second, the six music; third, the five archery skills; fourth, the five horsemanship skills; fifth, the six writing styles; sixth, the nine teachings." In addition, the walls around the Mingtang (Hall of Enlightenment) in the Zhou Dynasty were covered with portraits of Yao, Shun, Jie, and Zhou, as well as pictures of the Duke of Zhou assisting King Cheng, serving as a warning for the rise and fall of the state. These were all facts of using the function of art to help govern the country. Unfortunately, since the Han Dynasty, painting and music have become things for literary scholars and refined gentlemen to express their emotions and leisure interests, and have lost their educational function.

Since the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, China has been moving towards the road of national construction. In order to improve the morality and personality of the people, the New Life Movement has recently been launched again. "Making Life Artistic" is listed as the first of the three major goals, so we should use the movement of art to build spiritual life. The establishment of art museums and museums, holding exhibitions and music concerts, broadcasting music, building parks everywhere, and the artistic design of urban construction all provide opportunities for the public to come into contact with art. Other things like dramas and movies with social education significance are also related to spiritual life.

Art is not a decoration or entertainment for the idle class, nor is it exclusive to the idle class. Art should be enjoyed by the public, and through the cultivation of art, the people can obtain a beautified life, realizing an artistic life in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. However, the so-called artistic life is not a luxurious life, as long as it meets the conditions of simplicity, plainness, neatness, and cleanliness. This kind of life is the true essence of the "Making Life Artistic" advocated by the New Life Movement.

### "Accepting Fate"

— Zhong Yi

The typical Chinese view of life is a kind of extreme optimism. The characteristic of this doctrine can be said to be completely included in an idiom, which is "Accepting Fate." The saying "Accepting Fate" is of course familiar to everyone, but few people believe that these four words represent a philosophy, a doctrine, and also a "typical" national essence view of life.

We might as well observe and see how the Chinese people will cope with their environment when they are in extreme hardship and in a very critical situation? Here, I can tell you that most people will: smile leisurely and say, "It doesn't matter, just accept fate!" and let it go. Because they believe that even under the principle of "misfortunes never come singly," when fate is so bad that they are about to be "burned beyond recognition," there will always be "a way out" and "good fortune will follow misfortune!" So, "Let it go!" and "Don't rush!" are unconsciously blurted out.

Of course, in times of crisis, one has to submit to fate, but isn't it the same in times of ease? Have you heard the saying "The poor rely on the rich, and the rich rely on heaven"? It can be seen that the comfortable rich are also "accepting fate." Therefore, everywhere there are people "accepting fate"; students entering the examination hall say they are "accepting fate," farmers waiting for rain also say they are "accepting fate," and poor people who can't afford to see a doctor are even more "accepting fate..."

"Accepting fate" expresses optimism, but it is too easy to become passive. People who hope to "accept fate" should not forget a saying: "Human effort will overcome heaven"!

### Wild Fruits and Others

— Hong Ye

Wild Fruits

Wild fruits are beautiful.

I often yearn for the beauty of the simple color quality composed of those crimson berries and green vegetable leaves. I thought, how sweet it would be if I put it in my mouth and chewed it carefully!

So, I finally picked it; I admired its beauty and bit it open...

Ah! A bitter taste.

Such a beautiful fruit, but its taste is so bitter.

Youth

People are singing hymns of youth for the green life.

Cry for a while; laugh for a while; sing happily for a while; wail for a while... Youth. Imprint these active traces on the page of life; entrust it to the record of a luxurious life.

Youth is lovely; filled with light and heat.

However, when we reach the twilight of life, do we feel some emptiness of the past? Or have we trampled the leaves of the youth tree for no reason.

Remembrance

Every day, you run to the river to watch the water.

You said, "Rolling river! May you stir up huge waves and carry my friend to the Shanghai Bund."

However, the huge waves rose and fell; fell and rose again, without bringing you any news of friendship. So you were disappointed, and you declared that you would no longer silently pray to the river.

But friend, when you feel empty inside, what could be more melancholy than losing your spiritual support?

Remembrance is a kind of trouble, but isn't it more painful to stop at remembrance?

### Flying Together (4)

— Zhao Qingge

Master Mo was only forty years old, but he already looked as old as sixty. And his body was also very bad. He originally had a congenital anemia. He often had dizzy spells; in the past half year, he also had a cough; and he seemed even weaker. The reason for this was partly because his standard of living had suddenly dropped, and he couldn't bear it; partly because his mental state was not good, which affected his health; but Madam Mo strongly denied these two reasons; she said that it was all because Master Mo was too dissolute when he was young, so he ruined his body.

What Madam Mo said was not entirely without reason. Master Mo did play hard when he was young. A year ago, Master Mo was still frequently going in and out of several high-class "singing houses" in Beijing. Master Mo's large sums of money were all sent into this bottomless pit. Madam Mo knew all of this, and it was precisely because of this reason that Master Mo had a handle in Madam Mo's hands, so Master Mo always had a bit of "fear of his wife."

Speaking of it, Master Mo was still related to the imperial family! Probably his grandmother, was some kind of "princess," and he called Empress Dowager Cixi "Grandmother." Therefore, he was also listed as a member of the nobility, although the relationship was very distant.

In his youth, Master Mo was a complete playboy. Relying on a bit of intelligence, he passed the imperial examination at the age of twenty. Later, relying on some connections in the court, he served as several officials, big and small. During Master Mo's career as an official, it could be said that he enjoyed all the glory and wealth! At that time, he had no time to worry about the future. In his consciousness, this world would not belong to others.

It seemed that Madam Mo had foresight, but it was also forced by the situation. When Master Mo was at his most successful, she couldn't stand Master Mo spending all day drinking and making merry, squandering money like dirt; so she had a big fight with him, and then resolutely took her son, Bao Ling, who had just turned five years old; and left Beijing. She moved to Jingzhou City in Hubei Province, in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. This was four years ago.

Jingzhou had become a stronghold for Manchu immigrants. Therefore, Madam Mo was not lonely here. She had many relatives and friends who helped Madam Mo buy a house from the Han people—the courtyard house where she still lives now, and dozens of acres of land. Madam Mo had some masculine qualities, so she bravely built a simple home independently. She also often received some money from Master Mo to live on, but she didn't reveal any hint of seeking help or begging. She was very self-respecting. She had a strength and stubbornness that ordinary women did not have; she had no knowledge, but she understood things; she was rich in emotions, but when her emotions were hurt; she became cold and eccentric. Her heart was kind. She sympathized with people who shared her fate. She was merciless to everything she hated; even retaliating with blows!

### Friend and Foe, Plus One More

— Dan Ni

Are they friends, or enemies?

At the grand banquet, they raised their glasses and wished each other good health.

They showed the highest friendship.

But as soon as the banquet ended, they used their own vicious means to try to eliminate each other.

They are friends. They are also enemies.

### Badge of Victory

This is a V-shaped badge of victory.

The humble bronze also shines with the golden light of victory.

Who lost it?

Is the price of this badge of victory too low that you lightly abandoned it?

Child, come here, I will put this badge of victory on you! This is the badge of victory that only you deserve to wear!

### Miscellaneous Poems on the Lake

— Ruo Piao

The west wind blows over Duanjia Bridge, I remember Hong bringing wine in a gourd, the willows of Xiang are like people, they have changed now, a single boat, two are desolate.

Oars stir the withered waves and splash the water, West Lake is full of sorrow, barbarian hooves trampled idle flowers and grass, I am the first person to climb the broken pavilion.

The iron bones stand firm by the water's edge, I have been dreaming of Gushan for ten years, returning to receive the whiteness of heaven, the cloth robe flutters in the wind, the sun is not yet setting.

The sound of the bell carrying water brings the morning cold, the frost leaves of Fenglin are already slightly red, desolate crows dot the heavy lake waves, I stand at the bow of the boat with my hands behind my back, enduring the sight.

### Returning Late

— Bi Xichang

The dim sunset, pitifully red; the ruthless twilight, shrouding the earth, extinguishing the last rays of the setting sun.

I drag my heavy steps, stepping on the fallen leaves all the way, groping in the silent deep lane, not seeing a single figure, I have fallen into the encirclement of darkness and gloom, the future is full of terror and danger.

The biting northwest wind is roaring willfully again, but no one can pay attention to it.

It blows on my clear face, and I shiver, refreshing my mind. It seems to give me an enlightenment that in this cold world, I can only use my reason to ignite the fire of life and break the gray dream.

I smile knowingly, exhale a sigh, and use the warmth in my heart to defeat the current cold.

Bi's Spring and Autumn Annals

### Everyone is Number One

— Wu Renzhi

It is said that this year should be the "Year of Construction." So, teachers say education is number one, industrialists say industry is number one, the transportation industry says transportation is number one, and there are those who engage in economic reform who propose economic construction is number one, and those who advocate rural construction propose rural construction is number one... It seems that everyone is taking advantage of the beginning of the year of construction to compete for the top spot in the start of work. This seems so chaotic!

From a logical point of view, this phenomenon of "number one" is very ridiculous. I am number one, you are number one, and he is number one, and the result is that everyone is number one, which means that everyone has lost the top spot.

However, everyone is focusing on their own position, which should be said to be an excellent phenomenon.

However, true competitors at work are like long-distance runners. They don't haggle over the start, but only strive for the first arrival at the final destination.

The proposal of these diverse "×× is number one" reflects the current phenomenon of China being "riddled with holes" and "everything waiting to be done." It is also a reflection of the fact that everyone has seen this and is frantically trying to come up with ways to rescue it. This cannot be said to be a bad phenomenon either. The problem is only that in the midst of the chaos, we must not only not bump into each other, but also help each other. This is somewhat different from the long-distance runner's struggle to reach the first spot.

Everyone is striving for their arrival to be the first, and they should each have their own complete prerequisites. If we can find a common prerequisite under these many conditions, then this condition may be the real ×× number one.

What is the common prerequisite? I say it is political stability! Education, industry, transportation, economic construction, rural construction... all have to give way. Political stability is still number one!

I say that politics is not on track does not mean that the government has collapsed. On the contrary, it shows the government's huge responsibilities from now on!

### The Sanitation Problem in the West Shanghai District

— Feng Huanquan

Currently, a major pain for the common people in West Shanghai is the problem of sewage with a foul odor. West Shanghai is a concentration of poor people, especially the working class, who have no funds to rent houses, so they build shacks, forming clusters here and there. As for sanitation, it is painful to talk about. Garbage piles up like mountains, and after a long time, it cannot be piled up anymore, so it is dumped into nearby small rivers. After the small rivers are filled, the poor people build shacks in groups. What is most distressing is that landlords see this as profitable and even try to build houses. Under such circumstances, sewers have already become a serious problem, and filling rivers and building houses only makes things worse. On the other hand, the West Shanghai district has the most small factories. These factories do not care about public health, only thinking about producing and profiting. Therefore, regardless of where the sewers come from, they dump sewage, flooding the ground, making it dirty and foul, and the stench is everywhere. I will give one example, such as the foot of the wall behind a certain pharmaceutical factory on Bailinan Road, and in front of a certain textile factory, etc. The only solution for the residents there is to fill the road with bricks; but at night, there are no lights, and pedestrians often stumble; after their feet are stained with sewage, they are infected with skin rashes. In fact, most of the people in the West Shanghai district are poor, how can they afford these unexpected medical expenses? Originally, the only capital of the poor is their health, so I deeply hope that the Public Works and Health Bureau will quickly promote both curative and preventive measures simultaneously to increase the actual work efficiency. For example, unblocking the sewers is a matter of course, and the filled rivers should be improved with an overall plan. Other garbage and sewage on the ground should be cleared as soon as possible, and sanitary facilities or health propaganda should also be added to the concentrated shanty towns. I hope that this suggestion can be put into practice in a short period of time.

### Double Disaster Refugees in Northern Jiangsu Call for Aid with Winter Clothing

Editor: On March 29, 1938, enemy planes bombed Yancheng. Unfortunately, my humble home was reduced to ashes in an instant. A family of three fled to the countryside, barely surviving by teaching. For eight long years, we were fortunate enough not to suffer from cold and hunger. In October of this year, the communist army occupied Longcheng. At the same time, the place where we lived was regarded as a central location, so we were ordered to dissolve the already-established school and let the borrowed ancestral hall be used as the site of the central elementary school. From then on, our livelihood was cut off. Fortunately, local people maintained it, vacated a house to avoid the wind and rain, and provided food to fill our empty stomachs. But the days ahead are long, how can we sit and eat? Therefore, last month, we took a civilian boat to Shanghai, hoping to become self-sufficient. Unexpectedly, there were too many people at sea, and housing was especially difficult. Although I am able to eke out a living, when I think of my weak wife and young children at home, crying for food, I feel heartbroken! However, in the eight years of the War of Resistance, there are probably many others who have suffered like me. I am just afraid that they are not as miserable as I am. Now, although we have enough to eat, we have no clothes to wear. The price of cloth is so high that it is difficult to buy. I recently read in the newspaper that your column is working with the Winter Relief Association to benefit the poor. Therefore, I am writing to ask you to show your mutual assistance and charity and provide some relief within the possible range. How to provide relief, there are regulations, and I am not in a position to specify. I will listen to your decision. I have received some education and have also made some contributions in my hometown in the past. I have suffered two blows and cannot save myself. I do not want to look up to others. In such a big Shanghai, with so many people, it does not matter if I reveal my real name. However, my conscience is uneasy. According to the relief regulations in the newspaper, there is a clause for hidden poverty, and I am indeed qualified for hidden poverty. The name I have signed is false. I think it does not matter if I pretend to be wealthy. I am sending this letter in advance so that it can be included in the list. Please let me know how to provide relief. Northern Jiangsu double disaster refugee, Wu Jiangyue

Mr. Wu's situation is truly unfortunate! I am publishing the original letter in the hope that fellow villagers in northern Jiangsu will provide relief, either by donating money or giving winter clothing: This column will be happy to collect and forward it. If you are inquiring about the Shanghai Winter Relief Association, the meeting place is on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Xizang Road. You can take this newspaper and apply in person, hoping that they can find a way to provide relief. (Editor)

### A Night Soil Collector Was Injured for No Reason, Requesting the Car Owner to Provide Relief, His Family Is in Extreme Difficulty

Night soil collector Zong A'mei, who lives at No. 12 Yongkangli, Caishen Lane, Kangti Road, Yingshi Road (formerly Rue Sapey), was pushing a night soil cart at the entrance of Tireni Hospital on Fuxing Road at 3:00 a.m. on December 25 last year when he was seriously injured by a car. The car fled without a trace, leaving behind a car light and a steel bumper. He was escorted to Tireni Hospital by the US military for treatment, and was transferred to bed No. 61 of Guangci Hospital on the 28th. The injured person now has no medical expenses, his children are young, his wife is weak, and his old mother has just passed away. Daily life is difficult to maintain, and there is no way to borrow money. I pray that the car owner and driver involved in the accident will ask themselves whether their conscience is clear and compensate for the medical expenses. If there are any kind-hearted gentlemen who can help find the case, I will be deeply grateful.

### Service Briefs, Seeking Wireless Talent

Investigation of Losses of Residents in Zhabei. The Shanghai 14th District Office: "Greetings, our district has been ordered to investigate losses during the War of Resistance. We hope that residents of Zhabei who have suffered losses will come to register at our district office at No. 62 Nanxing Road after seeing the newspaper so that we can compile and forward it. We would be grateful if your newspaper would disclose this in the Social Services column. Yours sincerely, Shen Bao"

Request to Restore Street Lights. Here is something I would like to ask your newspaper to petition on our behalf. The area around No. 1125 Yuyuan Road (i.e., Wuding Road) is the throat of the residents of West Zhu'anbang. There are factories, Western residences, and day and night markets. Before the war, there were street lights installed, which made it convenient to travel at night. Since they were dismantled by thieves, they have not been restored to this day. At night, it is as dark as pitch. Not only do vehicles and pedestrians often collide, but bandits lurk in the area, and cases of looting have occurred repeatedly. The reason for this is nothing more than the failure to restore the street lights. Therefore, we appeal to the road authorities to send personnel to install and light them as soon as possible. The entire residents of West Zhu'anbang
