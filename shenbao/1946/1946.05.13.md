### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Receives Marshall, Broad Discussions on Recent Situation, General Gillem Meets with Zhou to Exchange Views

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] Today is a regular holiday, but despite the immense difficulties, Special Envoy Marshall, seeking to achieve China's unification and solidarity, has not had a moment's rest from morning till night. This morning at 10:45 a.m., Marshall personally went to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's residence on Huangbo Road to pay his respects and hold important talks. It is said that the scope of the talks was extremely broad, lasting until after 12:00 noon. Chairman Chiang then invited Marshall to lunch. In the afternoon, when Marshall returned to his residence, he had discussions with General Gillem. It is reported that Gillem met with Zhou Enlai today and exchanged views on the current stalemate. According to well-informed sources, based on various signs observed yesterday and today, negotiations on certain minor issues have made some headway (including the issue of the Communist army's garrison areas in Hubei). However, the crux of the overall situation remains in the Northeast. It is hoped that the Communist army will no longer create disputes and generate additional complications at this critical juncture. It is believed that the wisdom of this peace envoy will certainly enable him to sort out this chaotic situation and propose a relatively compromise-based new plan in the near future. What can be reassuring to the people of the country at present is that the government's approach to resolving the overall situation, such as (1) the inviolability of national sovereignty, and (2) the necessity of alleviating the people's suffering, simplifies matters and speaks with sincerity, which is in line with the wishes of the people. Furthermore, according to news tonight, the situation in northern Jiangsu is tense beneath the surface, and the situation in North China is also becoming tense again. This is a detail worthy of the most attention. All parties in Nanjing hope that the Communist army will reflect in time. It is reported that Gillem plans to return to Beiping soon.

[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] When General Gillem met with Zhou Enlai at Meiyuan New Village at 10:00 a.m. this morning, Zhou stated that the Northeast issue had been complicated by the remarks made by Chief of Staff He Yingqin at a press conference on May 9th. When reporters inquired about this with a certain important official, the response was: this is another gesture of the Communists creating complications, because what Chief of Staff He stated on the 9th was all factual, and compared with the Communists' past clamor of "expanding the civil war in the Central Plains," the truth or falsehood is self-evident.

[United Press, Chongqing, 12th] After the announcement here that representatives of the government, the ruling party, and the Political Consultative Conference will soon depart Chongqing for Nanjing to participate in negotiations, hopes for an early resumption of peace talks have increased. Dong Biwu will definitely depart Chongqing by plane tomorrow, and Zhang Bojun is scheduled to depart for Nanjing on the 16th.

[Our Hankou Office, 10th] (Delayed) After Zhou Enlai went to Xuanhuadian, when asked why the Communist Party avoided the important and dwelt on the trivial, not discussing the Northeast issue, Zhou said: "If we want to solve the Northeast problem, we must first solve the North China problem, and we must first solve the Central Plains Liberated Area problem." In general, people are quite perplexed and cannot understand Zhou's particular logic.

### Yingkou Iron Works Completely Destroyed, Restoration Will Take Five Years, Cultivated Land in the Northeast Abandoned, People's Food a Cause for Concern

[Our Beiping Office, 11th] Lieutenant General Liu Guangji, commander of the Second Military Transportation Command of the General Logistics Headquarters, recently inspected various places in the Northeast. Liu told reporters upon his return: (1) Although the Yingkou Wharf was severely damaged by the Communist army, it has been repaired and can now be used with difficulty. He saw that the five important factories were all badly damaged, and the citizens who had fled were returning one after another. Prices are not high. (2) The extent of the damage to the iron works by the Communist army is infuriating. He asked a superior engineer, if the materials and labor were not a problem, how long would it take to restore it to its original appearance? The answer was that even if the materials and labor were sufficient and American technology was used, it would take at least five years. (3) Fushun can barely produce coal, and its maximum power generation capacity reaches 200,000 kilowatts, but three of the newest generators have been removed. The current generators are two small generators, which barely supply coal mining and Anshan. If it is restored to its original scale, that power plant alone can supply two-thirds of the electricity for the entire Northeast. (4) There are still many road materials piled up along both sides of the China Eastern Railway, but there is a shortage of sleepers. The sleepers are easy to burn and there is a large demand for them. (5) Agriculture in the Northeast originally relied heavily on electricity. After the victory, due to the destruction or obstruction of power sources, as well as the tragic killing of a large number of livestock, and the inability of the people to live in peace due to the war, more than half of the cultivated land has been abandoned, and a disaster is already forming. In particular, the Northeast, which is known for its rich agricultural products, has become a problem, and if this continues, the people of the Northeast will experience hardships unprecedented in their history. At the same time, due to the lack of electricity, processing costs are particularly high.

### Economic Construction is Impossible Without China's Unity and Solidarity, General Yarnell Says

[United Press, New York, 10th] Former Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet Admiral Yarnell said today: "China cannot obtain any valuable construction unless China is united and unified."

Fortunately, China still has some capable economists and financiers who can solve this problem." However, Yarnell issued a warning, saying: China's industrialization cannot solve the problem of mass poverty. He said: "Looking at the miserable situation of factories in Shanghai, or the existence of slums in large industrial cities in the United States, one can understand this." He said: The complete development of China's industry must be based on the following three principles: (1) Factories must be far away from urban centers, that is, factories should be distributed throughout cities and villages across the country. (2) Workers should share in the profits of industry, so as to avoid labor-management struggles. Chinese industrial cooperatives are good models. (3) Workers should have appropriate housing, fair wages, and hygienic factory equipment.

After Chief Representative Gangdeng Sangpi delivered a speech, the Chairman offered words of comfort and encouragement, and instructed the representatives to convey his greetings to the Dalai Lama and the Regent. Each representative then paid the highest respect to the Chairman before exiting. At 12:00 noon today, Chairman Jiang and his wife hosted a banquet at the Lixingshe for all the Tibetan National Assembly representatives, the Dalai Lama's eldest brother, Chief Representative Kaimopa's wife, and 15 staff members. During the banquet, the Chairman and his wife inquired about Tibetan customs. A film was shot during the banquet, and a group photo was taken after the banquet as a memento. Tudeng Sangpi's speech stated: "China has resisted the Japanese aggression for many years, and countless soldiers and civilians have sacrificed heroically. Finally, thanks to the Chairman's wise leadership, victory belongs to us. The Dalai Lama, the Dazha Regent, and all the monks and people of Tibet are very happy. To enhance the emotional closeness between the Han and Tibetan peoples, we have specially sent representatives to Nanjing to present local products, congratulating on the victory. Although the gifts are meager, they express the meaning of auspiciousness and boundless joy. We hope that you will accept them."

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 12th] Twenty-two National Assembly representatives from Beiping, including Li Zongren, Wang Jiesan, and Li Sicong, sent a telegram to Chairman Jiang, urging him to make a decision soon and convene the assembly. The telegram stated: "The postponement of the assembly is causing great anxiety among the people. The constitution has not been promulgated, and the foundation of the country lacks support. We have read with inspiration the Chairman's address to the representatives in Nanjing. We believe that constitution-making and governance are the established policies of the government, and the building of the nation depends on them. To procrastinate over trivial matters would disappoint the people. We have carefully considered public opinion and deeply feel that the people's will should be gathered as soon as possible, and a decisive decision must be made. We hope that you will see the situation clearly, make a decision soon, convene the assembly, and not delay it any longer. The affairs of the nation should be entrusted to public opinion, and unification can be achieved."

### Dancing is Prohibited in Kunming, but Dancing is Still Popular

[Our Kunming Bureau, 10th] Dancing is increasingly popular in Kunming, and the competition among dance halls is fierce. The investment in newly established dance halls is estimated to be between 30 million and 200 million yuan. One hall recently hired a band and two singers from Shanghai at a cost of 60 million yuan. The First Session of the First Yunnan Provincial Assembly suggested that the government ban dance halls, which was approved by the Yunnan Provincial Government and ordered the police bureau and the Kunming Municipal Government to strictly ban them. The managers of the dance halls petitioned the provincial and municipal authorities to withdraw the order, but were not approved. It is said that because the investments have not been recovered, the halls will inevitably suffer huge losses. There are plans to change the business model, and some are planning to move underground. All middle schools in Kunming now restrict students from dancing, but it is heard that some collectively climb over the walls to participate in dance parties. Some even dance in classrooms at school. As for the common social gatherings in Kunming, tea dances are still popular, with 17 pairs of men and women dancing all night, costing up to 3 million yuan.

And Sends Senior Personnel to China to Investigate Famine Areas

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced today that the Chinese government, with the assistance of American engineer Todd, has begun work to restore the Yellow River to its original course, so that 800,000 hectares of land deliberately flooded in 1938 to prevent the Japanese army from advancing can be restored for planting. Currently, 100,000 workers are working under Todd's supervision, and the food for the workers is supplied by UNRRA.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 11th] According to Dr. Guo Bingwen, Director of the UNRRA Secretariat, a group of senior UNRRA personnel will come to China at the end of this month at the invitation to inspect the disaster areas.

### The United States Adopts a New Reparations Policy for Japan's War Losses, Enabling Japan to Restore Production Capacity

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 12th] Concurrently with the arrival in Japan of American Reparations Commissioner Pauley, well-informed sources announced that Washington officials are adopting a more practical policy regarding Japan's war losses. It is heard that the new reparations policy will enable Japan to restore a production capacity, allowing Japan to begin to embark on the road to recovery, and the United States will not have to permanently take care of its livelihood. Although this policy has not yet been announced, it is understood that it will specify both minimum and maximum production capacity statistics. The maximum production capacity statistics specify what the Japanese economy cannot sustain, while the minimum production capacity statistics specify what Japan can be self-sufficient with on the four main islands. This policy will allow Japan to understand its total production and encourage the recovery of industry. The Japanese people are currently shrinking back, fearing that their industrial equipment will be used for reparations. After these statistics are specified, they can be reassured on one hand, and the control of various military production such as steel, coal, oil, light metals, and chemicals will not be relaxed. After the reparations are determined in the future, the countries applying for reparations cannot hope to immediately obtain what they want. According to experts from MacArthur's headquarters, even if the reparations settlement is announced tomorrow, it will take at least six months for the designated reparations goods to be transported from Japan to the countries applying for reparations.

### Bao Lai Writes to MacArthur, Explaining the Purpose of Compensation

[Remodeling Daily Tokyo, 12th] Bao Lai, the U.S. Compensation Commissioner, wrote to MacArthur, stating the mission of his visit to the Far East: The U.S. Compensation Committee, in November and December of last year, investigated Japan's political and economic productive capacity needs, as well as its future war-related productive capacity. In addition, Japan's demilitarization, financial control, decentralization, and democratization are all extremely important. Particularly important is the removal of Japan's war capabilities within the industrial sector to the areas it previously occupied. The purpose of this committee is to sever Japan's relationship with these areas and rebuild their economies to help Asia establish a peaceful and prosperous economic balance. The fundamental purposes are detailed as follows: (1) To study the extent of industrialization developed by Japan in Korea and Northeast China, and how these industrial activities are connected to Japanese industries, while also discovering Japanese assets in these areas that can be used for compensation. U.S. policy is to use all Japanese assets found in China (including the Northeast) and Korea for compensation to these countries. (2) In light of the changes since the armistice, it is necessary to understand the current situation in Northeast China and North Korea, and to estimate how these changes will affect the livelihoods of China and Korea. (3) Regarding the industrial capacity in East Asia and Korea, it is proposed to remove this equipment from Japan and allocate it to China and Korea. To this end, the maximum consideration should be given to China, Korea, the Philippines, and other countries that have suffered as a result of Japanese aggression, in order to complete their economic development. [Remodeling Daily Tokyo, 12th] U.S. Compensation Commissioner Bao Lai told reporters yesterday: The purpose of compensation is to remove equipment that may become a potential force for war, while equipment necessary for the economic life of the Japanese people will not be removed. Japanese assets in China (including the Northeast) and Korea will be reserved for compensation purposes to aid the reconstruction of Asia. In short, equipment used for compensation should not be regarded as occupied goods, but should be considered with the aim of reviving the entire Far Eastern economy. Bao Lai also stated that the Soviet authorities have not yet allowed him to enter the Northeast, but he believes that he will be granted permission soon.

On April 27th, the communist forces gathered more than 2,000 people, carrying more than ten machine guns, and launched a fierce attack on Zhangwanzhuang, which is 20 li away from the county seat of Donghai. The internal security squadron and the village self-defense team in the village bravely resisted in order to defend their homeland. Although the communist forces reinforced twice, they were all repelled by the defending forces in the village. Yesterday, the communist forces mobilized their troops again and surrounded Zhangwanzhuang, attacking it day and night. Zhangwanzhuang is an outer stronghold on the southwest side of Haizhou.

The fake Cao Jinsheng, who claimed to be a pilot and forged documents in an attempt to defraud, has been interrogated by the military law office of the 21st Army. According to his confession, he took this course of action due to financial difficulties, and had committed similar acts of impersonation and fraud in Zhenjiang and Wuhu. It is learned that because the suspect is not a formal military member, the case will be transferred to the county judicial office on the 11th for legal punishment.

Jiading

County Government Captures Notorious Murderous Bandit

Tan Sixi, a local thug from the western countryside of this county, engaged in murder and robbery during the Chongqing era, rampaging through the borders of Kunshan, Taicang, Jiading, and Qingpu counties. Relying on his numerous followers and ruthless methods, even after the victory, the victims were still intimidated by his power and dared not openly accuse him. Since the current county magistrate Xu Zhuyi took office, he has made it his mission to eliminate violence and bring peace to the people. News of this spread, and the family of Cui, a martyr who died resisting the Japanese, filed a complaint with the county government, accusing Tan Sixi of colluding with the enemy police and harming loyal people. County Magistrate Xu first arrested the suspect and then collected evidence to bring him to justice. It has recently been discovered that in addition to setting up checkpoints to collect taxes and extort money from the people during the local occupation, the suspect also engaged in kidnapping for ransom, colluding with the enemy police, and committing various other crimes against good people. Most infuriatingly, he was responsible for the group slaughter of anti-Japanese patriots, with as many as twenty or thirty people killed in one incident. It is reported that the county government is now issuing a public notice to the families of the victims, inviting them to provide evidence and formally file a complaint.

Suzhou

Investigation of He Peixuan Case Concluded

He Peixuan, the puppet county magistrate of Jiangyin, has been indicted. On the afternoon of the 10th, the High Court held another investigation hearing, summoning Zhang Pinquan, the former county magistrate who worked underground, as well as Qian Shilin, and three other brothers, and Wang Kairui, a neighbor, (represented by his brother Ai Ru), a total of eight people. Chen Zemin, the puppet governor of the province who was in custody, was also brought in as a witness. Chen's lower body was paralyzed, and he could not walk, so he was carried into the courtroom by bailiffs. Judge Fu Jin questioned them one by one. Zhang Pinquan and others all stated that He Peixuan was forced to take the puppet position, and that he did indeed assist in rescuing many underground comrades. Chen Zemin also stated that He had resigned four times during his tenure, but he had not approved it because there was no one in Jiangyin to succeed him. Chen confirmed that He was a sincere and honest person, unlike the scum of the earth. After the questioning, the court determined that since many witnesses had been called and the investigation of the case could be concluded. A debate hearing will be held next time, and a judgment can be made.

Measures for Controlling Rice and Grain Determined. The County Government's Department of Land and Grain previously received a letter from the County Provisional Assembly requesting that measures be taken to strictly prohibit the export of rice and prevent Shanghai merchants from coming to Shanghai to purchase rice, in order to maintain the stability of the people's food supply. The department has now drafted various effective measures to control rice and grain in the county, and has submitted them to the provincial government. Once approved, they can be implemented.

Gao Guanwu's Property Not Confiscated. Gao Guanwu, the puppet governor of Jiangsu Province, and Huang Xunjingzhai, the puppet director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, used the wealth they plundered from the people to purchase more than 2,000 mu of good farmland in the suburbs while holding their puppet positions. At that time, they used aliases and changed their names, attaching them to the landlord Shen Yigu's store for rent collection, in order to conceal their actions. After the victory, although this secret was discovered by the county government, no action has been taken. Last winter, Shen's store continued to collect rent. Tenant farmers, unaware of the situation, enthusiastically paid the rent to the store. To date, the property has not been reported to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui enemy-puppet property handling bureau for confiscation, and the county government has not taken appropriate and fair measures, which is clearly in violation of national laws and regulations. This has been exposed by the Dajiangnan Daily, a newly published newspaper in this county. The future of the situation may expand and be thoroughly investigated.

Jiangyin

Female Traitor Translator Indicted. Lin Damei, a young woman from Mencun, Wenlin Township, who knew some Japanese, served as a translator for the Japanese invaders in the puppet Xihhejing Township Office, the puppet Xiyangqiao Township Office, the puppet Zhutang Township Office, and the puppet Qingyang District Office in Cheng County from 1939 until she was dismissed after the end of the war. In December of last year, Lin Damei lived with the Japanese fugitive Rijian Tarou, hiding in the countryside. The fifth district chief sent police to arrest them and send them to the county. In addition to the Japanese criminal Rijian Tarou being sent to the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, Lin Damei was also sent to the Suzhou High Court last month. Prosecutor Gu Kejian has filed an indictment, alleging that Lin Damei willingly served the enemy. Her actions constitute a crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors.

Songjiang

Encouraging All Sectors to Assist in Opium Prohibition.

The County Government, in accordance with provincial orders, has specially promulgated post-cleanup measures to eliminate opium. In accordance with the provisions of Article 8, it is necessary to encourage autonomous organizations, schools, social groups, and public-spirited individuals to jointly organize opium prohibition associations, which will be established immediately. Inspection teams will be formed in all districts to conduct inspections at least once a week, with a view to completely eliminating opium in all areas. The Wuchang Highway Has Been Opened to Traffic. For the convenience of traffic between Lake Tai and Changxing, the First Pacification District Changxing Command has specially prepared four vehicles to travel between Changxing Lijia Port and Hucheng, with two shifts per day, and a fare of 1,500 yuan per person. The service started on the 8th, and passengers on the Wuchang route hailed it as convenient.

Hangzhou

Joint Re-survey of City and County Boundaries.

Due to the enemy's occupation for the past eight years, the original boundaries between Hangzhou City and Hangzhou County have become unclear, and the alluvial areas along the river have changed over time and environment, requiring urgent re-surveying. Yesterday, Xu Zhongwei, the head of the Land Administration Section of the City Government, and Shang Ruifen, the section chief of the Hangzhou County Government, went to re-survey the area based on the records of 1936. They first went to the coastal area east of the city. The boundary stones and archways there had been destroyed. The Dike was identified as the boundary, and the area south of the boundary belonged to the city, while the area north of the boundary belonged to the county. Then, they went to Xiaoshhe near the northwest of the city, and identified Kangjia Bridge as the boundary. The triangular area along Gongsan Road belonged to the county, and the area southwest of the city along the Hangfu Road took Liufangling as the boundary, and the main channel of the Qiantang River took Dadao Sand as the boundary. Most of the boundaries were still clear, and some needed to be adjusted with the consent of both parties before submitting them to the Ministry of Interior for approval.

Editorial

### Overcoming Our New Enemy – Famine!

In recent days, rice prices in Shanghai and other places have soared again. The Shanghai market has already jumped out of the 50,000 mark, making every person feel the threat of food shortage, especially the common people, who are in a state of panic all day long. Food is the most important thing for the people, and the food problem is indeed the most serious problem at present. "Famine" has become our new enemy. Today, no matter what aspects of politics, economy, or society, if we cannot solve the food problem, everything else is out of the question. But how to overcome this "famine" enemy? It's really not a simple question.

Shanghai is currently suffering from the threat of soaring rice prices, and various provinces and cities are also experiencing famine. Even in any corner of the world, there are large numbers of hungry people waiting for compassionate philanthropists to provide relief. According to Chen Zhima, a counselor at the Chinese Embassy in the United States, in his recent report to the United Nations: "The number of hungry people in China has increased to 30 million, and the food supply situation is getting worse. The food shipped to China by the United Nations in the first quarter of this year is only enough for the hungry people to consume for one day." Lai Jiadi, the director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, also frankly stated that he is particularly concerned about the famine in China. He said: "I think the famine in China is too horrible to bear, but I hope that people of all countries will not be indifferent to this large-scale famine and death." At the same time, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reported on the world food situation, saying that food production in the Far East and Europe is still below pre-war levels, and it is expected that the famine next year will still be serious, and 1947 may not be better than this year. From this, we can see that the food panic is not a problem of one corner or one country, but a problem of the entire world. World problems must be solved by gathering the thoughts and efforts of all mankind. China is one of the countries with a more serious world food shortage, and the Chinese people should use the spirit and strength of resisting the brutal Japanese in the past to unite with the more powerful and generous Allied countries to fight against "famine," the new enemy, and must overcome this new enemy before giving up.

The chairman of the American Relief Committee, former President Hoover, in view of the severity of the world food shortage, was ordered by President Truman to go to Europe and the Far East to investigate the food supply situation in various countries. He has already returned home to report, and it is expected that there may be brilliant plans to be announced soon. However, judging from Hoover's remarks after returning to the United States, "The danger of famine in various parts of the world is extremely great. If relief food is not delivered soon, millions of people in the areas with the most severe famine will become starving corpses," we can know that in addition to appealing to the American people to generously provide relief to the hungry people, he may not have more appropriate measures. Even this alone shows that in order to resist famine, in addition to extreme frugality and vigorous relief, there are really no other brilliant plans.

China is originally an agricultural country, and more than 80% of the national population depends on agriculture for a living. In principle, there should be no food shortage problems. However, China's agricultural technology is still backward, and it already feels a shortage of food in normal times. Moreover, it was the earliest and longest resistance war, and the war spread to the whole country. The losses suffered by the people are almost impossible to count with numbers. In the past few years, the rural areas in the occupied areas have been ravaged by the enemy puppets, presenting a fragmented and tragic scene. In the rural areas in the free areas, not only did they provide a large number of human resources to defend the motherland, but they also contributed countless financial and material resources to support the country's wartime finances and military food. Therefore, they also presented a desolate phenomenon of abandoned fields. The result of the eight-year war of resistance certainly won the victory, but it could not save the bankruptcy of the rural areas, or even accelerated the bankruptcy of the rural areas. Thirty million war refugees have no home to return to, wander in foreign lands, without warm clothes or enough food, and have become pitiful and helpless hungry people. If we cannot find a way to provide relief, they may all become starving corpses. The United Nations, at the end of the war, had already anticipated the difficulties in the world after the war and had to find a way to provide relief. Therefore, there was the organization of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the situation in China was even more serious, so the Executive Yuan added a Relief Administration to assist the United Nations in handling relief matters. However, since its establishment, its achievements have been difficult to satisfy, which is an undeniable fact. Even Lai Jiadi himself, the director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, is worried about the future of the United Nations. He frankly stated: "In the current situation, the stock of grain is not sufficient, and the United Nations cannot know how much grain it can obtain next month. If this situation continues to prolong, the United Nations will also be in danger of collapse." If the United Nations is like this, the Relief Administration is even more unnecessary to mention. It is said that the salaries of the employees of the Relief Administration in a certain province are still in arrears, so where is the energy to relieve the food shortage?

The situation of food shortage in our country is so serious, and the relief from the United Nations inevitably has a feeling of "distant water cannot save a fire." We can only first devote all our efforts to the path of "self-reliance," and then promote the common attention of the Allied countries to jointly eliminate the threat of food shortage in China. We believe that the most urgent tasks at present are nothing more than the following:

First, on the negative side, we should advocate extreme frugality and implement the distribution of grain according to population, and use the saved materials to relieve our compatriots who are dying. Judging from the living conditions of ordinary workers, peasants, and public educators, frugality is already impossible, and most of them are struggling on the hunger line, so it seems impossible to talk about frugality. However, we have also heard that a few workers are actually using the increased wages to squander meaninglessly. What's more, those who made a fortune from the national crisis during the war of resistance are obvious to everyone. They should generously provide relief to these 30 million compatriots, whether in terms of morality or strength at this time. But looking around, those corrupt and treacherous people who made a fortune only know personal enjoyment and squandering, and their extravagance is endless. They have never thought that there are still 30 million hungry people waiting to die in the country. Especially in Shanghai, a society of paper drunk gold fans, they can be seen everywhere living a corrupt and licentious life. The government does not ban it, and society does not blame it, which makes people unable to believe that China is experiencing a famine! We must not allow this situation of "red mansions smell of wine and meat, and roads have frozen bones" to exist for another day. Foreign journalists have already lamented "China is hungry, Shanghai is dancing." The capital of the National Government has recently issued an order to ban dancing, but Shanghai, this corrupt and licentious society, is still eating and drinking, singing and dancing in peace. Where does that come from! Recently, Marshal Eisenhower came to China and said, "America is willing to help those who can help themselves." This is really worth our vigilance and reflection. Our government should decisively prohibit all wasteful and extravagant lifestyle behaviors and begin to implement a frugal policy of distributing grain according to population. It is said that in the past few days, a certain telephone company bought hundreds of piculs of rice, and a certain household bought dozens of loads of rice. This unconscious hoarding of grain, as well as the rice merchants' reluctance to sell, should be severely punished. All restaurants and restaurants should strictly formulate rules to prohibit excessive consumption of grain. In terms of consumption, only by implementing frugality across the country and tightening our belts can we overcome the new enemy of "famine"!

Second, on the positive side, we should strive to increase agricultural production on the one hand, and negotiate the purchase and transportation of foreign rice to China on the other hand. We believe that if the whole country, from top to bottom, can do their best, China's grain production can be improved and increased. The two methods proposed by President Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood for improving China's agriculture, one is "land to the tiller," and the other is "agricultural mechanization," are both the most urgent and should be implemented at present. However, the implementation of these two policies first requires a good environment, that is, an atmosphere of peace and stability and a clear and capable local government, so that farmers can settle down and engage in farming. Otherwise, no matter how brilliant the ideal or how practical the method, it is still impossible to increase agricultural production. Therefore, we ask the government and the Communist Party to earnestly fulfill the "nationalization of the army and the democratization of politics." In other words, the Communist Party should immediately abandon the policy of provocation and destruction, and the government should immediately restore transportation and reorganize the army. Otherwise, it will not only be impossible to increase agricultural production, but it will also increase the severity of artificial famine, leading to endless troubles. If we can be frugal ourselves and restore domestic peace and stability, then we have full rights to ask the Allied countries with surplus grain to not only transport grain to relieve the famine in China, but also allow China to purchase large quantities of rice from rice-producing areas such as Siam and Annam, so that rice prices in our country can be reduced and the general people's food supply can be maintained.

Finally, there is one more point that is worth providing for research, that is, using scientific methods to study the minimum amount of food consumption per person and stipulate that everyone must abide by it. This will not only save food, but also maintain people's health. During the war, because of the reduction of food imports, the United Kingdom had to implement the method of distributing grain according to population. Nutrition experts designed a good method, which was still implemented in the same way after the victory and will be maintained for another five years. The United Kingdom is a rich and strong country, and it is still like this. Since China suffers from poverty and is plagued by food shortages, how can we allow the phenomenon of "unevenness" to exist in society again? Everyone only consumes the minimum amount of food, which is the best way to overcome famine!

### The Indian and Muslim Sides Insist on Not Compromising: Simla Conference Fails; Nehru and Jinnah Continue Talks Yesterday; British Side Considers Future Measures

[Our Own Report] London, 12th (Broadcast): The Simla Round Table Conference officially concluded today. Detailed results have not yet been released. However, according to a special correspondent for the BBC, the conference has failed. Although the formal meetings have ended, discussions are still ongoing.

[Central News Agency, Simla, 11th] Nehru met with Jinnah this morning for an hour. Political observers predicted after the meeting that the Round Table Conference might not be as fruitless as recent rumors suggested.

[Reuters, Simla, 12th] The Indian National Congress and the Muslim League have so far failed to reach an agreement. The Muslim League also rejected the proposal to submit the matter to international arbitration. According to informed sources, the British Cabinet representatives' talks with the Indian and Muslim factions on Sunday were inconclusive. A communiqué may be issued on Sunday explaining the failure of the negotiations. Observers speculate that the British Cabinet representatives have contacted Prime Minister Attlee to discuss measures to be taken after the failure of negotiations.

[United Press, Simla, 11th] Although the leader of the Indian Muslim League, Jinnah, and the president of the Congress Party, Nehru, are in close talks, negotiations are bound to break down. The Congress Party demands the establishment of a strong central government controlling all of India's foreign affairs, national defense, transportation, and a portion of tariffs. The Muslim League insists that areas where Muslims are concentrated must be granted independent self-governance. A spokesperson for the Muslim League openly stated their fear that if Hindus gain power, they will be politically and economically suffocated. Various plans have been proposed in the past to reconcile the two sides, but they quickly vanished.

[Reuters, London, 11th] Former British Colonial Secretary Amery said: "I am extremely disappointed to learn of the failure of the Simla talks." Conservative politician Winterton just said: "I have always known that the British delegation's attempt to mediate between the Indian and Muslim factions was impossible, so I am not surprised by the failure of the talks."

[United Press, Washington, 11th] A local figure, Tevadas, declared to the press here today that if India's opposing parties do not seek reconciliation on their own, civil war is likely to break out. But in any case, India's independence can be achieved within a few months.

### Government's Negotiations with Azerbaijan Province Break Down; Iran Faces Internal War Crisis; Tabriz Radio Station Declares "Willing to Shed Blood"; Iranian Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting

[Our Own Report] London, 12th (Broadcast): Negotiations between the Iranian government and Azerbaijan province have completely broken down. The Azerbaijani delegation will leave Tehran and return to Azerbaijan. Iranian troops are currently concentrated on the border of Azerbaijan province. The Azerbaijani authorities have ordered the provincial army to be on high alert and will fiercely strike any Iranian army that crosses the border.

[Our Own Report] London, 12th (Broadcast): The Iranian Cabinet held an emergency meeting today. Some ministers stated that if the government continues to yield to Azerbaijan, they will all resign. Iran's situation has become even more chaotic due to the entanglement in the Azerbaijan issue.

[Reuters, Tehran, 12th] The Tabriz radio station recently announced: "Negotiations between the Iranian government and representatives of Azerbaijan province have broken down." The radio station also said: "The people of Azerbaijan will never submit to the oppression of the central government. For twenty-five years, Azerbaijan has repeatedly fought for freedom. Today, the people of Azerbaijan are ready to fight against the enemies of freedom. We need peace and are willing to negotiate a peaceful resolution, but certain elements in Tehran are trying to take advantage of the situation. Our representatives argued with them on the basis of reason but were still interfered with. Our representatives are now leaving Tehran on their way back. We are also prepared to respond to any changes, but everyone should know that the fault is not ours. This is because the central government is unwilling to eliminate the elements that are destroying Persia. We now specifically announce to all countries that we are prepared for war and have ordered the National Army and the Democratic Party on the border that if any troops from the central government attempt to enter the territory, they should be resisted. We Azerbaijanis will fight them and never give up freedom and autonomy. We will match our words with our actions, and we are willing to shed blood for this."

[United Press, Tehran, 12th] An Iranian cabinet member said that negotiations with Azerbaijan province have broken down, but this was denied by a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson. At the same time, the government has sent an army colonel and a civil official to inspect to verify whether the Red Army has indeed completely

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 11th] According to sources here, negotiations between the central government of Iran and representatives of Azerbaijan have stalled. Although Soviet Ambassador to Iran, Shatskov, intervened to mediate, it was to no avail. The crux of the negotiations lies in the security issue after the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Azerbaijan province. The provincial representatives requested to automatically restore security, but the central government authorities believe it is necessary to send troops to the province to maintain security.

[Reuters, Tehran, 12th] The Azerbaijan National Army has taken over all the barracks in the province after the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops.

### French Troops Mass on the Banks of the Mekong River; Bombarding the Siamese Border; Siam Asks Britain and the United States to Protest to France

"Reuters, Bangkok, 12th" The Siamese Foreign Minister confirmed that French troops bombarded Nakhon Phanom on the Mekong River on the Siamese border on Wednesday night, and machine-gunned Thai rice paddies. Public and private buildings in Nakhon Phanom suffered considerable damage, and many residents were injured, two of whom are beyond hope of rescue. The Siamese side did not take retaliatory action, but has ordered the residents in the two districts to evacuate. After an emergency meeting, the cabinet ordered the Foreign Minister to ask Britain and the United States to resist resolutely if such incidents occur again. It is reported that the French side has concentrated heavy troops on the banks of the Mekong River. So far, no other incidents have been reported. The Siamese government and the British and American embassies have sent personnel to inspect the border area. The cause of the incident has not yet been determined. It is said that the French army first crossed the border to demand the return of weapons of French people who had fled into Siam due to the Vietnamese unrest. French planes had previously dropped leaflets instructing these French people to return to Vietnam. The Siamese defense forces are more than thirty miles away from the scene of the incident.

### French-Vietnamese Conference Ends Without Result

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 12th] The French and Vietnamese authorities recently issued a joint statement stating that the preparatory meeting held in Dalat on the 11th has ended. After more than 20 days of discussions during the meeting, the French and Vietnamese sides failed to reach a complete agreement on issues such as Vietnamese foreign policy, the status of Cochinchina, the Vietnamese monetary system, trade between France and Vietnam, and the use of French in Vietnamese schools. Representatives from both sides believed that the gap in opinions was too wide to bridge, and continuing the meeting would not resolve the issues, so they hastily announced the closing of the meeting on the 11th. Both parties agreed that all unresolved issues would be discussed again at the Paris conference at the end of this month.

### Grasping Human Relations, Peace Will Be Guaranteed; Tolerance and Understanding Will Prevent War From Occurring; President Truman Delivers Speech

[Reuters, New York, 12th] President Truman, while receiving an honorary doctorate of law from Fordham University here yesterday, stated that grasping human relations is the only way to prevent the atomic bomb. He briefly stated that after an atomic war, there would be no civilization left. The first sentence of the UNESCO charter is "Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed." Therefore, we must eliminate ignorance to prevent the world from suffering another disaster. Knowledgeable people would never hate each other because of differences in religion, language, customs, or race. Therefore, education is the foundation of international understanding and world peace. Knowledgeable Americans would never be unconcerned about people from other countries. They know that attitudes of exclusivity and dictatorship are based on selfishness. From past experience, despotism and dictatorship will never stop at our borders. The lessons of World War II and the atomic bomb make us deeply aware that we cannot survive without working hard. There is only one way to defend against the atomic bomb, which is to grasp the science of world human relations and cultivate an attitude of tolerance and understanding. After carefully studying this relationship, we will realize that Hiroshima is not the end of human civilization, but the beginning of a new world.

### US Asks Britain to Cede Three Pacific Islands; to Establish Naval Bases

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 11th] A New York Times diplomatic correspondent announced today that the United States has notified Britain that it wants to secure its sovereignty over three small islands in the Pacific: Christmas Island, Funafuti Island, and Canton Island. The first two islands belong to Britain, and the latter is jointly owned by Britain and the United States. According to the correspondent, there should be no difficulty in the British government ceding these islands. The current issue is the dispute over other bases in the Pacific. Some people in the United States advocate increasing the number of islands controlled by the United States in order to establish a string of interconnected bases. If Britain cedes these islands, these people will achieve a decisive success. However, this is the view of the Navy Department. As for the State Department, it advocates the establishment of a common defense system, with the United States, Britain, China, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand responsible for protection.

### Tokyo Communists Lead People; Raising Red Flags; Breaking Into the Imperial Palace

[Remodeling Daily, Tokyo, 12th] Residents of Setagaya Ward, Tokyo, held a ward residents' meeting today, with about ten people participating. They shouted slogans such as "Brothers and sisters are starving to death," "Food should be managed by the people," "Smash the reactionary forces," and "Establish a people's republic." Communist Party Central Committee member Nozaka Sanzō personally attended and spoke, saying that the people are about to starve to death, but landlords and officials are hoarding rice in their warehouses. This matter should be asked of the Emperor. After the meeting, the crowd split up and marched to protest in the city. One team of 113 people, led by Communist Party member Iwata Hideichi, went to the gate of the Imperial Palace, demanding to enter the palace. It was finally decided to meet with officials from the Higher Palace Office and the Ministry of the Imperial Household. The crowd then raised red flags and entered the Imperial Palace, creating an unprecedented event in Japanese history. After the crowd entered the palace, they demanded to see the Emperor's dining room. The palace officials then led them to the Chrysanthemum Leaf Restaurant. The crowd, seeing that the room was narrow and dirty, said that it was not the "Emperor's dining room" and questioned the officials endlessly. They finally admitted that it was the staff canteen. The crowd was in an uproar and declared that they would send representatives to hear the Emperor's reply at 2:00 PM on the 14th, and then left.

### Miss Panda "Union" Arrives Safely in London by Plane; China to Find Her a Mate

[Reuters, London, 12th] Miss Panda "Union," born 17 months ago and weighing 80 pounds, arrived in London by plane from Calcutta last night and settled in a yellowish-gray iron cage in the Lion House of Regent's Park Zoo. "Union" is the fourth panda owned by the London Zoo and the only panda in Europe. The zoo's original panda, "Ming," died several years ago.

Despite the long journey, "Union" is in good spirits and very lively. Outside the iron fence where "Union" lives, there are three bundles of bamboo shoots, a pile of vegetables of various colors, and a bowl of oatmeal, which is "Union's" food. Her room is equipped with a tree trunk with three branches for her to climb, as well as a sunbathing platform and a small bathtub.

According to the defendants, the Potsdam Declaration stipulates that war criminals who violated international law after the start of the war should be prosecuted, but the charges listed in the indictment include deaths caused by Japan's theft, and they are also accused of group murder.

### Old Dutch Soldier Who Captured Churchill; Unwilling to Meet Churchill

[Reuters, Amsterdam, 12th] A "New York Times" correspondent said that an old Dutch soldier who participated in the Boer War, Olton Zil, now 79 years old, captured Churchill in 1899. Zil still expresses anti-British sentiment, so he is unwilling to meet with Churchill during Churchill's visit to the Netherlands. During the German occupation of the Netherlands, Olton Zil traveled all over the Netherlands under the banner of the Dutch Nazi faction as "the person who captured Churchill" and also went to Germany to do similar propaganda. His son has been arrested for assisting the secret police.

### Bevin Returns to London for Instructions; Italian Reparations Issue Still Not Agreed Upon by Four Powers; Rumors that US Agrees to Annexation of Saar Region to France

[Our Own Report] London, 12th (Broadcast): British Foreign Secretary Bevin returned to London by plane today for instructions and is scheduled to fly back here tomorrow morning to participate in the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. Molotov, Byrnes, and others jointly participated in the European Victory Celebration today and were in good harmony. The French Interim President also delivered a speech, praising the contributions of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union during the war and expressing hope that the three powers will continue to strive for peace.

[United Press, Paris, 12th] The Four Power Foreign Ministers held another secret meeting today, lasting two and a half hours, to try to break the deadlock on the reparations issue. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov indicated that if the Four Powers could reach an agreement on the Italian peace treaty issue, he would be willing to set the date for the 21-nation peace conference without waiting for the complete resolution of the Balkan peace treaty issue. The Four Power Foreign Ministers also held a brief discussion on the Balkan and Finnish peace treaty issues at today's meeting. Although the meeting did not produce new results, Molotov indicated for the first time that these peace treaties were secondary issues.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] The Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference continued today, but little progress was made because the representatives of each country were waiting for instructions from their respective governments. The meeting also discussed the issue of Italian reparations, but no agreement was reached. Byrnes reportedly spoke in favor of the Soviet Union's demand that Italy pay 100 million lire to the Soviet Union, but this should be offset by the following items: (1) Italian assets overseas, (2) , (3) Two merchant ships, (4) Four Italian warships. In addition, an interpretation was given to the term "war booty." Anything seized by a country can be called war booty. The ships to be given to the Soviet Union can only be regarded as , not war booty, which led to a dispute with Molotov.

(Another Telegram) Information has recently been received from the United States: Washington has decided to agree to the proposal to annex Germany's Saar region to France, but has not yet formally notified the French government. It is generally believed that when the German Saar issue is brought up for discussion, France will suggest that it be resolved together with the German peace treaty.

### Transfer of Tripoli to Italian Trusteeship; Arab Tribes Strongly Oppose

[Reuters, Tripoli, 12th] The Arab tribes of Tripolitania seem willing to launch a revolution to resist the transfer of the area to Italian trusteeship. The British Military Headquarters in Cairo has reported this situation to London. At the same time, British authorities and Arab leaders have taken preventive measures to prevent violent reactions. After news of the Tripoli issue at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference reached here, 25 Arab leaders representing all sectors gathered at the British military government here and expressed their determination to sacrifice themselves to fight for the independence of Libya. The president of the Jewish Congress, Hadi Ziz, has also taken a consistent stand with the Arab tribes.

[Reuters, Cairo, 12th] Arab League Secretary-General Azzam said yesterday that if Tripoli is handed over to Italian trusteeship, we will not hesitate to fight. We have fought with the Italians for nearly 20 years and will never allow them to return. If the British support the Italians, we will also fight the British. Moreover, dividing Tripoli and Cyrenaica will damage the local economy, and we will never allow it. Arab countries may be placed under UN trusteeship when their strength is not yet sufficient, but we will never allow Italian trusteeship.

[United Press, Cairo, 11th] According to reliable official sources, the Egyptian government has submitted a memorandum to the Paris Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference requesting the return of Qirabak to Egypt. Qirabak is located on the border between Egypt and Libya and was ceded to Italy under the 1925 Italian-Egyptian Treaty.

### Details of the Theft of Mussolini's Remains; Miniature Landmines Placed Outside the Tomb Door; Digging Work Lasted One Hour

[Agence France-Presse, Milan, 11th] Details of the theft of Mussolini's remains have recently been obtained by a reporter from the Lombardo Post from one of the thieves. It is said that the thieves originally planned to launch the operation on the night of April 25, but unexpected circumstances forced them to bring forward the execution by two days, because they heard that a certain extremist faction was also planning to do so. They first placed German-made miniature landmines outside the tomb door to prevent police interference. The tomb was difficult to excavate because it had been trampled on, and the soil was hard. It was not until they dug to a depth of five feet that they saw the coffin. At first, they planned to carry it away, but when they opened the coffin and saw that the corpse had not decayed, they decided to wrap it in waterproof cloth and leave. The work took one and a half hours to complete.

### Stalin Received the Most Letters? Truman Received Even More? People from All Corners of the Earth Appeal to the American President for Help - Complaining, Requesting Money, All Sorts of Things

[United Press Washington, 11th] It is said that Marshal Stalin received more letters than any other important person in the world, and this news reached the ears of State Department officials, making them somewhat unconvinced. They said that President Truman received the most letters.

Every day, from all corners of the earth, pitiful letters arrive, all stemming from the famine and poverty that occurred after World War II. Almost every letter begins with: "Dear Mr. President..."

"I myself do not ask," wrote a Greek mother, "but my little daughter has a lung disease and is dying. She needs good, clean food and fresh milk to have a chance to live..."

Another letter was sent from fifty-six orphans who used to live in a large house on the banks of the Apennine River in the Italian war zone. Their letter begins: "Glorious Mr. President: Bombs destroyed our home, and now [caretakers] look after us. But we only have one set of tight-fitting clothes, and we need something to cover us at night and more food during the day..."

There was also a letter asking President Truman to find two American military officers who had briefly stayed and played with the orphans and given them military rations and three military blankets when they were stationed in the Italian peninsula during the campaign.

U.S. State Department officials estimate that they receive about two hundred letters from abroad every day, but in one month this year, the total number of letters received reached 11,000.

Every morning, a large group of State Department officials gathers mail written in their specialized languages, engages in translation work, and formulates appropriate responses.

"Dear Uncle Truman," wrote a six-year-old Hungarian girl, "I am very sick. My ears have been inflamed for six weeks, and my head has been severely injured. Many children in America have relatives and receive gifts, but I have no relatives, only you—dear Uncle Truman. Please give me some gifts, and I will be very happy..."

Mrs. Truman also received many letters.

A Dutch father wrote, "Until now, we have not received a shoe ration coupon." He didn't know how he could get "walking shoes" for his two little girls, "Olga and Loscong." He enclosed a photo of the children and wrote, "We feel a bit uncomfortable receiving these things as gifts. We can't pay foreigners yet, but could you be their 'aunt' and send them some shoes, and we will repay you in the future?"

Some letters, at least because of the distance across the ocean to Europe, seem quite amusing from here.

Other letters were sent from a group of young girls asking for a group of Hollywood movie stars to be sent to their city "to give speeches and tell us about Hollywood life."

There are also requests for loans, requests for scientific equipment, and even requests to become American citizens. Some simply ask Truman to thank the Americans who liberated them. These letters are answered by the relevant government departments based on their content.

### 50,000 People in Rome Hold Anti-Monarchist Demonstration; Four Italian Elders Form Anti-Leftist Coalition

[United Press Rome, 11th] Romans today held a large-scale anti-monarchist demonstration, drowning out yesterday's cheers of royalists celebrating the new monarch's ascension to the throne. Approximately 50,000 demonstrators gathered in the People's Square and marched to the government building. The government entrance was guarded by police machine guns. The demonstrators marched past the police in orderly fashion, shouting "Down with the King!"

[Agence France-Presse Rome, 11th] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi recently declared at a Social Democratic Party meeting: When the Italian people hold a referendum early next month, they will not only choose between a monarchy and a republic, but will also decide a broader question: whether the people are prepared to shoulder the increased responsibilities of a republican system.

[Agence France-Presse Rome, 11th] New King Umberto arrived at the Quirinal Palace this morning, where a large group of soldiers wearing medals and veterans of past campaigns expressed their loyalty to the new king. He originally intended to go to the Quirinal Palace to pay respects to the new king, but the new king decided to meet with him at the Quirinal Palace. The new king stayed in the palace for fifteen minutes, and all the soldiers expressed their solidarity for the king's mission.

[Associated Press Rome, 11th] Four of Italy's most prominent political elders have formed a lay association, an anti-leftist coalition, to cope with the national election on June 2. The four elders are Orlando, Nitti, Bonomi (all former prime ministers) and De Gasperi. In a jointly signed declaration, the "Four Giants" stated that the alliance they formed is the "National Democratic Alliance," and its first target is Prime Minister De Gasperi's right-leaning Catholic Party, and the second target is the mixed electoral organization of the Socialist and Communist parties.

### Franco's Followers Active in South America; Various Countries to Present

[United Press New York, 12th] The Security Council Subcommittee of the United Nations organization investigating Franco's Spain will receive documents within a few days detailing the activities of agents of the Franco regime in various South American countries. According to sources in Mexico City, Mexico will present evidence next week proving that Franco's Spanish Falange Party is engaging in [sabotage activities] in several South American countries. In addition, Spanish Republican sources stated that the Spanish government in exile has obtained "important documents" regarding the activities of Falangist members in the Western Hemisphere and is currently preparing a memorandum on this matter for submission to the subcommittee. A U.S. spokesman stated that the U.S. State Department is expected to submit a comprehensive report this week, but it is not yet known whether it will prove the activities of Falangist members in South America. The U.S. spokesman also indicated that the U.S. report will include documents proving that Franco actively colluded with the Axis powers during the war.

### French Second General Election Launches Campaign; Communist Party Power Determined to Be Difficult to Rise; De Gaulle Abandons Political Life

[Reuters Paris, 12th] The campaign for the second French general election after liberation began over the weekend. The Communist Party first convened a mass meeting on Friday at the Winter Sports Arena in Paris, with more than 10,000 people attending.

The Socialist Party headquarters announced that former Prime Minister Blum, now serving as a special envoy in the United States, does not intend to participate in the election. Although General De Gaulle has been strongly urged by the conservative "Republican Freedom Movement" to make a comeback, De Gaulle has refused. De Gaulle also refused to participate in today's victory celebration in Paris and lingered in the cemetery of former Tiger Prime Minister Clemenceau.

[United Press Washington, 12th] The Inter-American Defense Board, formed by military representatives of 21 Western Hemisphere countries during the war, has formulated the Inter-American Defense Plan. A report was released today disclosing the details of the plan. Its main feature is the unified management of civil aviation bases throughout the Americas, for the joint use of military aircraft from the 21 countries, as well as other military and naval bases. The scope extends throughout North and South America, for use in the event of an attack by enemies outside the Americas.

### Rescuing the Industrial Crisis; Preparing to Convene a Production Conference; Wages Increase, Imported Goods Flood the Market; Enamel and Leather Industries Also Headed for Complete Bankruptcy

The city's industrial sector is facing a crisis, with factories requesting layoffs and wage cuts one after another. The textile and silk garment industries are particularly severe. Recently, the trade association requested permission from the Social Affairs Bureau to reduce employees. Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian specifically requested the municipal government to convene a production expansion conference as soon as possible to promote production and rescue unemployment. This proposal has been approved by the Municipal Government's Municipal Affairs Conference and is being prepared immediately. It is understood that participants will include representatives from the Executive Yuan's Shanghai-based agencies, the Resources Committee, China Textile and China Silk companies, the Bankers' Association, the Chamber of Commerce, labor unions, and farmers' associations.

According to enamelware manufacturers, during the occupation period, the main raw material (iron sheet) of the enamelware industry was requisitioned by the puppet regime under the pretext of recruiting scrap iron. The entire enamelware industry was forced to a standstill. As a result, countless businesses went bankrupt, resulting in significant losses. After the victory, it was initially planned to resume work immediately, but due to the unstable domestic political situation, traffic obstruction, unsmooth raw material sources, weak capital of various factories, and turbulent labor unrest, the enamelware industry still has no production to speak of. Since the opening of foreign exchange, foreign goods have poured in, and domestic enamelware has been severely hit. If this continues, the enamelware industry will inevitably head for complete bankruptcy, and there will be no place to gain a foothold in the export market. Therefore, it is hoped that the government authorities can provide support to save the enamelware industry from its demise.

According to a leading figure in the city's leather industry, since the victory until January of this year, business was particularly prosperous due to lower market prices. However, most of the purchases were made by Allied personnel, so from March 1 of this year, all workers demanded a wage increase. After the labor unrest was resolved, prices rose repeatedly, wages increased, and costs increased. Allied personnel were also transferred back to their countries, purchasing power gradually weakened, and business plummeted. Leather goods shipped from Bengbu, Wenzhou, Nanjing, and other places were priced only equal to the cost of labor in Shanghai, so merchants were happy to ship them to Shanghai for sale, and even more orders were placed to South America, Argentina, Uruguay, and other places because their costs were low. If transportation improves this autumn, the market will be filled with foreign goods, and the leather workers in this city will all be unemployed due to lack of work. In addition, before the war, many of the city's leather shoes and other products were shipped to Southeast Asia, but currently, due to excessively high costs, they cannot be shipped. The trade association is actively organizing a guild to concentrate its strength to cope with the crisis ahead.

### U.S. Military Headquarters Relocates

### Pilot Management Committee Sets Up Two Offices

[This Newspaper] Pilots are very important for guiding ships into and out of ports. Even Yangtze River vessels require pilots to navigate. The city currently has two districts: 1. The Shanghai-Woosong District: Foreign ships coming to Shanghai must wait for pilots to board the ship at Tongsha to navigate into the port, and pilots must also guide them out to the mouth of the Wusong River. 2. The Shanghai-Hankou District: The Yangtze River route between Shanghai and Hankou. In addition to the captain, each vessel must hire a pilot familiar with the Yangtze River waterway. Therefore, the pilots are very important for the navigation of ships, and their skills are no less than those of the captain. Before China regained its navigation rights, the piloting (that is, pilotage) rights in the Shanghai-Woosong District were also seized by foreigners. Since the victory against Japan, various countries have abandoned their navigation rights, and pilotage rights have also been recovered. There are approximately 300 pilots in the city, of whom those from Zhejiang are the most, those from Hubei are the second most, and those from Guangdong are the least. The Ministry of Communications attaches importance to the Pilot Management Committee and has set up offices in various ports for nearby management. The Shanghai-Hankou District Pilot Office is located at A9 Bund, with the Shanghai-Woosong District Pilot Office attached. Qin Zhuru, director of the Shanghai-Hankou District, has arrived to take office. The Shanghai-Hankou District Pilot Association, organized by pilots, has also been established, with Feng Qianzhen as chairman, Wang Mingguang as director of the General Affairs Section, Wang Ander as deputy director, Neng Zhangfu as director of the Business Section, and Zhang Chunfa as deputy director. Most of the companies have hired permanent pilots, so there is a great shortage of temporary pilots, and the association is adjusting this situation.

### Director-General of UNRRA China Region, Kiser, Suddenly Resigns; The Reason is Opposition to Changing the Mission of UNRRA in China Region

General Rooks, personal representative of UNRRA Director-General LaGuardia, announced yesterday that Kiser, Director-General of UNRRA China Region, has resigned from his post. The reason for his resignation is opposition to the proposal to change the mission of the China Region. Another report: The Director-General of UNRRA China Region, in a statement upon his resignation, said: "General Rooks, personal representative of UNRRA Director-General LaGuardia, has completed the recent consultations with me (Director-General Kiser of the China Region). General Rooks, in view of the current changes in the situation, believes that the policies and work procedures of the China Region should also be changed accordingly, so he conducted this consultation with me. Because I disagree with Mr. Rooks's proposed changes in policies and work procedures, I have submitted my resignation. The Director-General has now appointed Mr. Ray to temporarily assume my duties until a successor is determined. The Director-General has also asked me to continue working in the China Region for a short period of two or three months, serving as a consultant, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the work of various departments of this branch. I am very interested in UNRRA's China program, so I have expressed my agreement, and my personal wish to return to the United States immediately will also be temporarily suspended. We had previously considered the issue of transferring Colonel Olmsted, director of the headquarters group of this region, to the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, because his talent and experience can be fully utilized at the "Relief Administration." At the same time, this change was originally proposed by Messrs. Jie and Li of the Relief Administration and approved by President Song. Colonel Olmsted has now been transferred to the "Relief Administration." He will cooperate with Liu Hongsheng, director of the working group of the Relief Administration, to help him complete the arduous task of building railways, waterways, and highways, and accelerate the implementation of the Chinese government's relief plan."

### Labor-Management Disputes Unresolved: Western-Style Clothing Stores Continue to Be Vandalized; Police Headquarters Urges Both Sides Not to Overstep Boundaries

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the labor-management dispute in the Western-style clothing industry in this city, the labor side, due to the management's procrastination in negotiations, has aroused the indignation of some workers. They have been posting slogans on the streets for days, causing conflicts with the management, resulting in the vandalism of some stores in recent days. The victims include Peiluomeng, Yuchangxiang, Royal, and Wang Rongkang on Nanjing Road; Taixing and Xinhua on Daxin Street; and Tianxiang, Xingxing, and Jingxing on Linsen West Road. Among them, Peiluomeng suffered the most damage, with customers' custom-made new clothes being splashed with ink, making them difficult to clean, resulting in losses exceeding ten million yuan. At Xingxing, four people were injured during the conflict. At that time, several dozen workers who caused the trouble were arrested by the police substations in various districts.

Yesterday morning, the workers' union, in order to prevent the situation from escalating further, sent representatives to visit the trade association to negotiate, but without results. It was also reported that Yuchangxiang on Nanjing Road, Wuxingchang, Yongxing, and several other stores on Chengze Road were vandalized. After the incident, the bureau sent personnel to the scene to suppress the situation, but the workers who caused the trouble had already fled.

Police Sent to Suppress the Scene

Tracing the cause of this incident, the workers' basic wages have been negotiated and resolved. The crux of the matter lies solely in the issue of rice subsidies. The prolonged negotiations have led to this situation. Now, the labor union has stated that it will do its best to prevent conflicts and avoid escalating the unrest, and is seeking solutions. At the same time, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters believes that the workers' actions are overstepping the bounds, causing repeated incidents, and severely affecting social order. In order to prevent the situation from escalating, they have advised both sides to agree on: (1) The arrested workers will be released through negotiations by the Garrison Headquarters; (2) Both sides will continue negotiations, setting a final deadline of 6:00 PM on the 14th; (3) During the negotiation period, workers must not engage in any further incidents that overstep the bounds. Therefore, the outcome of the incident will depend on the negotiations in the next two days.

Tram Workers Continue Mediation

[Our Newspaper's Report] The labor-management dispute at the British Electric Company will continue with negotiations at the Social Affairs Bureau at 9:30 AM today. During the negotiations on the 11th, only the issues of sick leave and retirement were resolved. The sick leave arrangement is that workers who are hospitalized will receive full wages, and medical expenses will be borne by the company, but only for six weeks. Beyond this period, with a doctor's certificate, it can be continued. As for those who are sick and not hospitalized, full wages will be paid, but the company will not be responsible for medical expenses. Regarding injuries sustained on duty, the arrangements will be handled in accordance with the agreement of the Electric Power Company. The retirement benefits require a minimum of fifteen years of service to be eligible.

Today's discussion will focus on increasing basic wages and the reinstatement of over two hundred unemployed workers. Among them, the latter is the most difficult issue for both sides to reach an agreement on. The workers insist that the first batch must reinstate one hundred workers, but the company believes that there is currently no need for so many, and will only reinstate six workers for each additional tram car. This stalemate remains to be resolved in the coming days.

Regarding the workers' request to retroactively pay bonuses from 1941, a responsible person from the Social Affairs Bureau stated that this is not legally justified and is similar to increasing basic wages, so they intend not to accept this request.

### Collecting Evidence of Enemy Crimes in War Zones; Hoping the Public Will Actively Report; The War Crime Investigation Team Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday with Relevant Agencies in This City

[Our Newspaper's Report] The War Crime Investigation Team, jointly formed by the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan, led by Team Leader General Chai Zishang, arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 10th. From the next day, they began their work, visiting the military court, war criminal detention center, port headquarters, garrison headquarters, city government, and local court in this city. Yesterday morning, they convened relevant agencies at the Garrison Headquarters to hold a joint meeting to discuss the investigation procedures. Those present included Liu Shifang, President of the Military Court of the Third Front Army; Military Judge Lin Wopeng; General Xie Haoling, Commander of the Shanghai Port Transport Command; and General Long Zuoliang; Tan Yulin, Chief of Staff of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters; Wu Hanchao, Director of the Staff Office; Song Siyi, Director of the Shanghai Command Post of the Jinghu Garrison Command; Jiang Gongliang, Director of the War Criminal Detention Center; Huang Liang, Chief Prosecutor of the Local Court; Yang Zhuoying, Secretary of the City Government; Chief of Justice Jiang Wenhe of the War Prisoner Office; Section Chief Zhu Zonghai of the Police Bureau; Wang Yanyun of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police; and members of the investigation team Ma Zhizhen, Deng Liangshi, Tang Biaomin, Yang Jueyong, and Claude Han, Prosecutor of the Far East International Tribunal.

Discussed Procedures and Raised Various Inquiries

First, Ma Zhizhen reported on our country's procedures for handling war criminals, followed by reports from representatives of various agencies on the circumstances of their handling of war criminals. Liu Shifang raised inquiries stating that the military court faced the following difficulties in handling war criminals: (1) The central government has not clearly defined the standards for sentencing, which makes it difficult to make judgments; (2) The military court has only twenty personnel, but the number of cases to be tried is too large, resulting in insufficient manpower; (3) The facts of the crimes listed in the war criminal lists submitted by various parties are too simple to be used as the basis for prosecution. He also said that the methods for handling war criminals are not unified throughout the country, and suggested convening a national meeting on handling war criminals to seek a unified approach. Later, Military Judge Tang Biaomin of the Military and Political Department gave separate replies, and said that according to the procedures for handling war criminals, only those who are reviewed and included in the war criminal list by the central government can be arrested. However, according to Article 4 of the War Criminal Handling Regulations, local military authorities can exercise the power of emergency arrest based on people's accusations that have been verified. Later, representatives of various agencies asked questions to Claude Han, the representative of the Far East International Tribunal, and made suggestions to the central government, requesting the investigation team to relay them. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM. The team is scheduled to fly to Hankou this morning to investigate war crimes, and will also fly to Fuzhou, Taiwan, Guangzhou, Guilin, Hengyang, Changsha, Nanchang, Zhengzhou, Beiping, Tianjin, Xuzhou, Nanjing, and other places to try the twenty-eight major Japanese war criminals and punish them with the crimes they deserve.

Departing for Investigations in Various Districts, Expected to Last Only One Month

In order to clarify its work and mission to all sectors, the team hosted a tea party for the local press at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 2:00 PM yesterday. During the meeting, Commissioner Yang Jueyong, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reported that the work of repatriating Japanese prisoners and residents is nearing completion, but the work of arresting and trying war criminals is not yet satisfactory and needs to be strengthened in the future. At the same time, the Allied Headquarters, because our country has been fighting the war for the longest time, eight years, and the people have suffered the most, sent three prosecutors and one secretary from the International Tribunal at the end of March to assist our country in organizing the war crime evidence investigation team, which was established on April 9. The team's mission is to supervise the handling of war criminals in various places, direct the search for evidence of crimes, and conduct on-site interviews to gather facts about the enemy's atrocities in various battlefields. However, the scheduled date is only one month, and the work may not achieve the ideal perfection. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the press will provide more assistance and arouse public attention to report as much as possible.

We Have the Right to Demand the Extradition of War Criminals Related to Us

Subsequently, Commissioner Ma Zhizhen, the representative of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, reported that the local court in this city has received a total of 30,600 cases of enemy atrocity registration from November last year to April this year, and the total number nationwide is about 140,000 cases. However, most of the informants failed to provide the names of the war criminals, making investigation difficult.

### "Liberated Zone" of Northern Jiangsu Hopes for Government Relief, Residents Displaced and Fleeing

Yesterday, the person in charge of the Jiangbei Sojourners' Service Society in Shanghai told a reporter: Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, in the "liberated zone" of Northern Jiangsu, there are still 20 million people trapped in a dark hell, struggling daily between life and death. Currently, tens of thousands of male and female refugees are flocking to the Yangtai Highway and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, supporting the old and carrying the young, a truly tragic sight. According to reliable surveys, the number of Jiangbei refugees gathered in Shanghai has already exceeded 30,000, mostly from areas such as Jiancheng, Funing, Dongtai, and Xinghua. In their hometowns, a "three-all" policy is being implemented: "all able-bodied men are conscripted," "all food is plundered," and "all intellectuals are killed." No one is safe from the jaws of the tiger. Here is a brief account of the actual situation:

Liberation Situation

Since the Communist Party captured Huangqiao in the autumn of the 29th year of the Republic (1940), they began to invade the Northern Jiangsu region, using the name of resistance against Japan to plunder food, expand their territory, and appoint Communist county magistrates in various places, forcibly conscripting "militia." After Japan's surrender, the Communist army, the "New Fourth Army," seized cities with military force and weaponry, capturing a large number of enemy weapons and officially declaring the area a "liberated" zone. The first step was to implement a "cleansing" policy, searching for traitors and so-called "Nationalist spies." Anyone with a little capital, knowledge, or reputation was arbitrarily slandered, severely punished, or had their property confiscated to replenish military funds. Furthermore, they enticed local thugs and hooligans to organize "militia backbone units," called "military participants," and ordered other civilians to farm the land and comfort the families of the "military participants." In addition, they organized "peasant associations" to implement "25% rent reduction" and "women's associations" to implement "dedication movements." The 25% rent reduction they implemented had to be calculated from the 26th year of the Republic (1937), forcing landlords to retroactively pay rent. Those unable to pay had no choice but to sell their land and property to barely cope. In terms of currency, the "New Fourth Army" established the "Huainan Bank" in Northern Jiangsu, wantonly issuing "resistance currency." The "resistance currency" was divided into "new resistance" and "old resistance" notes, and the value was extremely chaotic. Furthermore, the area of circulation was limited, and civilians were unable to distinguish between them, causing immense suffering.

Youth Exodus

In the liberated zone, young men and women not only lacked freedom of speech, thought, publication, assembly, and association, but also lost freedom of residence and movement. Those who previously leaned towards Marxism have now awakened and seen through the foreign trickery, and are forced to flee to areas such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang and Yangzhou. Because they have no travel expenses and no companions, their journey is extremely difficult. Now, around Nanjing and Shanghai, there are nearly 200,000 of them, often unemployed and without schooling, enduring constant suffering. For example, this semester, Jiangzhong Middle School only recruited 100 new students, but over 1800 applied. The large number of young people without schooling is evident. Recently, Northern Jiangsu is again forcibly conscripting men, with eight men conscripted from each household. It is expected that an even larger number of young people will flee.

Hope for Understanding

Before the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the entire population of Northern Jiangsu lingered under the iron heels of the invaders, barely surviving and enduring the suffering of human hell. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Communist Party took advantage of the situation to invade, seize cities, and plunder territory, wantonly ravaging the area, truly giving people a sense of being unable to laugh or cry. The general populace believes: (1) Since the Communist Party claims to be a political party, it should cherish the people and not manipulate them for political struggles, and should not implement communism through "terrorist policies." (2) Northern Jiangsu is close to the capital, yet there is a difference between heaven and hell between Jiangnan and Jiangbei. How can the government bear to ignore these hundreds of thousands of people? How can the Communist leaders turn a deaf ear and allow their subordinates to commit such atrocities? The only hope at present is that the Nationalists and Communists can reach an understanding, and that the government will send Nationalist troops to Northern Jiangsu to take over and relieve the people from their suffering. At the same time, we hope that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will quickly allocate a large amount of relief funds and transport them to Northern Jiangsu, so that the general populace can rebuild their lives.

This year, the province plans to send approximately five or six students abroad, so the fund must be at least 10 million yuan. In addition to the original fund of 15 million yuan, an additional 8.5 million yuan must be raised.

### Students of Zhejiang Medical and Pharmaceutical College Petition in Nanjing

Demanding Prompt Payment of Overdue Public Funds

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou] Zhejiang Provincial Medical and Pharmaceutical College moved to Eastern Zhejiang during the War of Resistance and re-established in Linhai. All books, instruments, and practical training equipment were preserved intact. This time, the relocation funds received were only 4.2 million yuan, which barely covers transportation costs. Moreover, the original campus in Hangzhou was completely destroyed during the enemy occupation and is difficult to restore. Therefore, classes can only continue to be held in Linhai. The school also experiences delays in the disbursement of funds from the Ministry, sometimes going half a year between disbursements. However, rice prices in that area are the same as elsewhere and are increasing daily, resulting in significant losses. The public funds for publicly funded students have not been received since December. The students are extremely anxious. Therefore, the school's student union has sent representatives, including Wu Weiyou, to Nanjing to petition the Ministry of Education directly, demanding the prompt payment of overdue public funds and requesting that future disbursements be made in advance. They also requested an increase in relocation and reconstruction funds. The representatives passed through Hangzhou on the 10th, asked Director Xu of the Department of Education for instructions and assistance, and took a car to Shanghai on the 11th to transfer to Nanjing.

### Shanghai Branch of the Society for Life Education Established Yesterday

Social Bureau Sent Personnel to Provide Guidance

[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai branch of the Society for Life Education held its inaugural meeting yesterday (12th) at 2 p.m. at the Xin Zha Road Elementary School in the city. More than 200 people attended, including Tao Xingzhi, Huang Yanpei, Xu Xiaotian, Ma Xulun, Ni Wenzhou, Guo Moruo, Chen Yisheng, Chen Heqin, Zhou Jianren, Zhang Yiqu, Shi Jianqiao, Ge Yihong, Li Chucai, Tian Han, Yu Zhijie, Shi Dongshan, and Wang Shaojun. The Social Bureau sent personnel to provide guidance.

Chen Heqin Speaks

Chairman Chen Heqin gave an opening speech, briefly describing the movement of life education. The movement began in the eighth year of the Republic (1919). At that time, Mr. Tao Xingzhi gave a definition: life education is the education of life, using life to educate, and education for the needs of life. Mr. Tao personally translated the definition of life education into English in the manner of President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address: Life education means an education of life by life and for life. This was conceived and became an organized movement when Xiaozhuang School was established in the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927). The first movement of life education was the rural education movement, which aimed to train one million rural teachers as the center of rural reconstruction and farmer service. After the January 28th Incident, the "big classroom, little teacher" system proved effective and was promoted throughout the country, beginning the popular education movement. In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), when Japan invaded North China and the national crisis became more urgent, the national crisis education movement was launched to awaken the masses with the power of mass education to jointly solve the national crisis. After Japan surrendered, we entered the era of the democratic education movement. We must popularize democratic education throughout the nation and jointly create a democratic China. He then introduced Huang Yanpei, Guo Moruo, Shi Jianqiao, Tian Han and others to speak.

Tao Xingzhi Speaks

Next, founder Tao Xingzhi delivered a speech, expressing his admiration for Huang Yanpei, Shi Jianqiao and others who have dedicated themselves to education. Guo Moruo advocated that "life education" should be changed to "life learning," and Tian Han advocated that the "life" in "life education" should be "democratic life," which he felt was particularly adapted to the times and expressed his acceptance. Finally, he encouraged everyone with three words: "humility," to humbly obey the people, "learning," to learn what others have not yet, and "contribution," to contribute to culture for the public good, for the benefit of all. According to the report issued by the society, the society aims to explore and promote the most reasonable and effective new education principles and methods, and to promote "the enlightenment of self-awareness, the cultivation of creativity, the popularization of education, and the improvement of life." There are currently more than 2,000 members, scattered throughout the country. The headquarters is in Chongqing and will soon be relocated to the capital. The society has recently formulated a one-year plan as follows: (1) Mobilize members across the country to promote the popular education movement in their local areas. Hold two popular education research meetings; (3) Hold twelve popular education and education lectures; (4) Establish ten popular education experimental zones in key locations across the country; (5) Contract 500 schools scattered across the country to pilot the small teacher popular education system; (6) Publish 20,000 copies of the popular education bi-monthly, with 10 copies available in each of the 2,000 counties; (7) Publish 1 million copies of the "Common Words for All Ages" textbook, totaling 4 million volumes; (8) Publish 100,000 copies of the "Common People's Library," with 100 copies in each, totaling 10 million volumes; (9) Publish 10,000 to 100,000 copies of the "Common People's Daily"; (10) Publish 100,000 copies of the "Small Teacher's Guide"; (12) Publish 100,000 copies of the "Biography of Mr. Wu Xun"; (12) Compile a set of songs for Wu Xun's education; (10) (3) Compile a Wu Xun dance book; (14) Compile a Wu Xun play; (15) Compile a Wu Xun film; (16) Organize ten Wu Xun song and dance teams. Then, all members passed the charter of the society and elected 25 directors and 9 supervisors, until around 6 o'clock.

### Educational Facilities Plan for Jiangxi Province, Year 35 (Part 2)

Increase Teacher Salaries

In Year 35, the regulations stipulate that the minimum monthly salary for principals of central national schools is 100 yuan, the minimum monthly salary for teachers is 90 yuan, the minimum monthly salary for principals of national schools is 90 yuan, and the minimum monthly salary for teachers is 80 yuan. Principals and teachers of all central national schools will receive living allowances and public grain in accordance with the standards for county-level civil servants. Principals and teachers of all national schools should also receive living allowances and public grain in accordance with the standards for county-level civil servants in rural central national schools. However, if the living allowance and public grain are insufficient, the living allowance for Year 35 must not be less than half of that of county-level civil servants. The public grain will be temporarily provided by the rural towns and villages according to age, with monthly quotas of 2 *shi* of study grain, or 1 *shi* and 6 *dou*, or 1 *shi* and 2 *dou*. In accordance with central regulations, the above-mentioned monthly salaries, living allowances, and public grain should all be included in the county's total budget for expenditure. The regulations on preferential treatment for primary school teachers should be earnestly implemented so that they can serve with peace of mind.

Intensify Research and Guidance

The Provincial and various Normal Guidance Area National Education Research Associations should intensify research and guidance work, and universally establish county, city, township, and town education research associations. The original Educational Work Teams in the recovered areas will be renamed National Education Demonstration Areas, located in the ten counties of Nanchang, Xinjian, Jiujiang, Xingzi, Hukou, Pengze, Anyi, Yongxiu, Ruichang, and Dean, to promote the advancement of national education.

Broadly Raise National Education Funds

In Year 35, the regulations stipulate that the recurrent expenditure for each central national school should be at least 37,860 yuan, and the recurrent expenditure for each national school should be at least 14,300 yuan. Temporary expenditures should also be included in the county's total budget to ensure realistic figures. According to reports from 45 counties including Nanchang, a total of 7,060,690,645 yuan has been raised for the national education fund. Counties that have not reported or have not raised the full amount will be ordered to report and raise the full amount. A national education fund grain donation campaign will also be launched, with 200 *shi* per school, and the public school properties will continue to be investigated and used to the greatest extent possible to supplement national education funds.

(B) Secondary Education

The general principles of secondary education in this province are to rectify the academic atmosphere and improve standards. Provincial middle schools should strive to enrich their content and rectify their academic atmosphere to set an example for local middle schools. County middle schools must ensure stable funding and sound teaching staff to serve as the cultural center of the county. Private middle schools will be strictly supervised, and the standards for establishment will be raised to prevent indulgence, so that both public and private middle schools can cultivate outstanding talents for advanced studies and pillars of society to fulfill their mission. Based on the above principles, the important facilities for secondary education this year are as follows:

Divide into Nine Middle School Districts

(1) "Adjust Middle School Districts": In order to closely integrate politics and education, the province is divided into nine middle school districts according to administrative regions, and all public and private middle schools in the province are evenly distributed within each district to promote the balanced development of secondary education in various regions. (2) "Establish Additional Provincial Middle Schools": This year, the middle school class of the Provincial Yichun Normal School will be separated to establish the Provincial Yichun Middle School, and the Ningdu County Middle School will be reorganized into the Provincial Ningdu Middle School to realize the plan of having at least one provincial middle school in each administrative region. (3) "Raise Funds to Build School Buildings and Enrich Equipment": Since the Anti-Japanese War, schools have undergone relocation, and the original school buildings and equipment have been damaged. In addition to continuing to petition the central government for post-war rehabilitation funds, we will also lead the school building movement to seek self-reliance and regeneration. The school buildings of various county middle schools mostly borrow public houses or rent private houses, and the equipment is mostly simple. We should urge them to quickly repair and strive to enrich them. (To be continued) The association invited more than 300 teachers from various schools. Later, due to rain, the director and guests did not attend. The representative Cao Guochen delivered a speech, and then a movie was shown to add to the fun. No ceremony was held. It is also heard that 50% of the donations will be presented to the teachers of various private schools by the association itself.

### China Race Walking Association Actively Prepares to Resume

The China Race Walking Association is the only race walking group in this city. It has a long history. Starting in the winter of 1931, under the leadership of Cheng Yize, Shi Youhui, and Lu Yutian (deceased), it organized five public Chinese race walking competitions in Shanghai. The enthusiasm of the participants and the fervor of the audience are still vivid in people's minds. Due to the war, the members were scattered, and the association's affairs were suspended for many years. When the Shanghai International Race Walking Competition was held, the association won the championship for six consecutive years, opening up the glory of our country in the international race walking arena. At the 1936 World Games held in Germany, the association selected Zhou Yuyu, Cai Zhengyi, Zhang Zaojiu, Zheng Chengshan, and others to attend the competition, and the results were satisfactory. Now, the original committee members of the China Association, Zhang Zaojiu, Zhou Yuyu, Xu Aichen, Lu Wenxia, and others, are reiterating the previous proposal and intend to rise again. A preparatory meeting will be convened in the shortest possible time to discuss the resumption of association affairs.

### Gold Market Rebounded Last Week, Rice Price Problem Serious, Public Bonds Active, Stocks Weak

The financial market was relatively stable at the beginning of last week. Gold hovered for quite a long time. On Saturday, due to enthusiastic buyers from other ports, the price suddenly rose. Chinese and foreign stocks experienced many twists and turns in the middle, and ultimately reported softening compared to the previous week. The overall price fluctuations were tight. Foreign currencies followed gold's movements. However, rice prices rose sharply. The top white rice has broken the 50,000 mark, and the trend is quite serious. The relevant authorities are currently striving to remedy the situation, but the effect is yet unknown. The details of each industry are recorded below.

Gold: Under the control of the Bank of China at the beginning of the week, the trend was sluggish, hovering around the 1.6 million mark. On Saturday, a surge occurred due to the return of buyers from other ports. The black market rose to 1.73 million. The Bank of China's gold allocation price also increased to 1.67 million. The black market closed at 1.71 million.

Foreign Currency: The trend of US dollars is based on the rise and fall of gold. On Monday, due to a slight increase in gold, US dollars saw 2,330 yuan, then retreated to 2,220 yuan. From Monday to Friday, it fluctuated within a small range. On Saturday, due to the rise in gold prices, it saw a sharp rise, reaching a maximum of 2,340 yuan, and finally stood at 2,310 yuan. Hong Kong dollars changed little throughout the week, and the trend was sluggish. The closing price on the weekend was 410 yuan, 20 yuan lower than the previous weekend.

Unified Bonds: The unified public price fluctuated and was uncertain, presenting a situation of sudden rise and fall. Initially, rumors of principal repayment were beneficial, and the market rose sharply. Later, upon hearing of a lottery, the market fell. Among them, double illusions were controlled by speculative giants. Type C rose from 6,400 to over 7,000 yuan on Tuesday, and then fell to 6,700 on Saturday. On Thursday, it was heard that the lottery for principal repayment would be held on the 10th, and confidence was shaken, falling to as low as 6,100 yuan. On Friday, it was heard that the lottery date had passed, and speculators became active again, with Type C rising to 7,300 yuan. On Saturday, some people sold out, and the market was idle, falling to 6,400 at one point, and finally returning to 6,800-6,900 yuan. Types A, B, and D were at 4,700-4,800 in the middle, and Type E saw 5,000 yuan. On Saturday, Types A and B were at 4,200, Type D was at 4,000 yuan, and Type E was at 4,400.

Stocks: Chinese stocks initially showed hesitation at the beginning of the week, then showed a downward trend. The market stabilized slightly at noon, and the results were lower than the previous weekend. On Tuesday, a slight setback was initially reported, then large investors pulled up the market, and the market rose. Mei Ya took the lead in being popular, yarn factories followed suit, and the small three heats were also brought up. On Wednesday, Nongkai was extremely stable, but later, large investors secretly released, and the price could not be sustained. On Thursday, market news was confusing and volatile. Yarn factories and Mei Ya fell to the 54,000 mark. The worst decline among the three small heats was Jingfu, breaking into the 300 yuan mark from 425 yuan. Many unpopular stocks were also soft. On Friday, the process was weak first and then firm, and the hot stocks rose more than yesterday, while the unpopular stocks were mixed. On Saturday, hot stocks fell, and unpopular stocks rose and fell. Foreign stocks were affected by the decline in Chinese stocks at the beginning of the week and were weak, especially the decline in Yi Yarn. On Tuesday, confidence turned prosperous, and all rose, with Yi Yarn and Yinglian rising the most. Small stocks and Huidong were less impressive. On Wednesday, due to small stock bonds, confidence was unsustainable, and prices fell except for Huidong. On Thursday, due to the sharp decline in Chinese stocks, confidence was weak, and the decline continued. On Friday, large stocks improved slightly, and small stocks fell again. On Saturday, except for paper and Asia being flat, the rest showed a downward trend.

Food: At the beginning of the week, the rice market situation was that arrivals were strong, the price of the place of origin fell, and sales were sluggish, all down 1,000-2,000 yuan. Flour was slightly better, up 100-200 yuan. Miscellaneous grains were consistently firm. Oil shops were quite interested in advancing, up about 1,000 yuan. The sugar market was idle, and medium sugar fell slightly by 500 yuan. On Tuesday, rice rose about 1,000 yuan and 500 yuan for Jing rice due to less arrival due to rain, and the promotion of various shops was not weak. Flour turned weak and fell by 300-500 yuan. In terms of miscellaneous grains, soybeans were soft by about 1,000 yuan, raw kernels were slightly popular. Edible oil was congested due to arrival, and the market was flat at first and then weak, with crude oil and soybean oil falling by 4,000-5,000 yuan. The sugar market was mostly sluggish due to tight credit and sluggish sales. On Wednesday, rice, except for Yinyuan and Yangxian, fell by 1,000 yuan due to the higher base the day before, and the rest rose slightly, and the market gradually became normal. Flour continued to decline due to more sales, down 500-600 yuan from yesterday. Soybeans were mixed, raw kernels were stable, and the edible oil market was mediocre, with slight ups and downs. High-end sugar was stable, but other industries were discouraged due to sluggish sales, and the market continued to soften. On Thursday, the arrival of rice was particularly small, and the shops were quite prosperous, continuing to be firm. The flour market was stable, and soybeans and raw kernels both rose in miscellaneous grains. However, Pudong soybean fell slightly by several hundred yuan due to its inferior quality. Edible oil retail sales became active, and the situation was thriving. The sugar was not supported due to the lack of customer sales and the wait-and-see attitude of the industry. On Friday, the price of rice rose sharply due to the small number of arrivals. The largest increase was 5,000 yuan for white you. The flour was also about 10% higher, and the miscellaneous grains had mixed fortunes. The supply of edible oil was less than the demand, and the market was 3,000-4,000 yuan better than yesterday. The sugar was depressed due to the lack of customer sales. On Saturday, the price of rice reached a new high, once approaching the 50,000 yuan mark, and the market rebounded slightly later, but it was still 2,000-3,000 yuan higher than yesterday. Shops were more interested in purchasing flour, and the price rose rapidly by more than 2,000 yuan. Miscellaneous grains and edible oil also launched a rise. Sugar was more stable.

Spot Yarn: In the past week, the situation was very mediocre at the beginning of the week. After entering, Tianjin merchants were keen to purchase fine yarn due to the increase in gold. The demand for 20 and 16 yarns from Guangdong and other inland merchants was also not limited. However, the demand for 42 fine yarn was greater than the supply, and the situation was very vigorous. The rise of each of the following 32 yarns was limited. The highest for the entire week was 1.94 million for the 42 yarn at the weekend, and the lowest was 740,000 for the ten yarn double cat. The difference between the highest and lowest was 200,000 per page. In terms of count, the 42 blue was the most, with a surge of 290,000 compared with the previous week. The rest of the yarns only rose by 50,000-60,000 or less.

Cloth Market: During the week, customers’ sales were flat, and there was no change in the market. The situation was completely circling. In the middle, because Fangjian signed a contract with the three major companies to set up a sales office, it caused public anger in the industry, and the market transactions were completely stopped. After the efforts of the association authorities to mediate, the series was resolved on Friday. This week, the situation of grey light twill was popular. It was used for making children's clothing and umbrellas. It rose by 5,500 yuan from the previous week, and the rest of the brands were on the original plate.

Cotton Market: During the week, Fangjian Company purchased the most, and in addition, private yarn mills such as Shenxin No. 1, 2, 5, and 9 and Jiafeng Fuan Dasheng also had considerable needs. The industry was not lonely with each other, and the market price also rose accordingly. As a result, the price of each cotton was about 3,000-5,000 yuan higher than the previous weekend.

Silk and Satin: In the past week, the price of No. 120 Tianqiao silk was quite stable at the beginning of the week, and fell by 50,000 yuan on Wednesday and 80,000 yuan on Thursday. On Friday, the price returned to the original state of Wednesday. No transactions were made in the market on the weekend, and the asking price was similar to that of Friday. During the past week, foreign banks had very few transactions, and Yuanmao and Jardine Matheson entered 78 to 80 points, with prices ranging from 350,000 to 370,000 yuan. The ups and downs of user silk were very small. Compared with the price on Monday and the weekend, it was about 50,000-60,000 higher. The price of Meiya quilt satin was the smallest at 1.05 million yuan and the largest at 1.11 million yuan on Tuesday afternoon. The smallest grid crepe was 3,550 yuan and the largest was about 3,800 yuan.

Other: As for other industries, there were also many fluctuations. The prices of daily necessities such as soap fell more than they rose. The fixed price was 53,000 yuan on Monday and 40,000 yuan on Saturday, a sharp drop of 13,000 yuan for the whole week. The removal of foreign candles was sluggish, and the market was stable. The prices of matches rose and fell suddenly. On average, the prices of oranges and other goods fell by 10,000-20,000 yuan, and sugar fatigue has not ended, with an average of about 5,000 yuan for return shipments.

### Livestock Market Closed, Pig Sties Resume Business

[Reported by this newspaper] The pig sties in this city are mostly located in the Xuejia Port and Wusong areas of Nanshi, and there are quite a few of them. All pig vendors transport goods to Shanghai, and they are first put into the sties for sale. The tasks they undertake are: (1) Unloading imported pigs, (2) Tying feet and weighing, (3) Cutting hair to identify the owner of the number, (4) Feeding, (5) Health care. In the event of injury or death, compensation must be paid in accordance with the regulations, (6) Transportation. Because of these conveniences, the passengers are happy to do so. During the enemy and puppet era, they intended to collect money and set up a so-called livestock market, luring the pig sties to join. The pig sties were unwilling to cooperate and all closed down automatically. Now that the market has been ordered to be cancelled by the municipal government, each sty has resumed business and jointly submitted a request to the government for filing.

### Sales of Woolen Fabrics Gradually Narrow

Recently, the sales of woolen fabrics have narrowed because the people in various places are hoping to receive the goods. Except for the necessities, they are all waiting for each other. Therefore, people inside and outside the industry are timid, and the road of customer sales and this street is walking narrower, and the business of tailors has become deserted.

### Timber Market Returns to Flat

The timber market returned to flat after the continued arrival of foreign pine, and the market had a large number of sales, so the market was soft and tired. Now, due to the increase in gold prices, the sellers intend to wait and see and have stopped selling, and the price has stabilized, and various goods have also tended to return to flat.

### Seafood Transactions are Quiet

Recently, the trend of seafood groceries has been flat and tired, and the appetite of customers and this street is still rare. The newly arrived goods such as shark fins, sea cucumbers, raw powder, and prayer vegetables have not risen, but the source of water and feet has increased, and the cost has increased, so they cannot fall, and the trend is firm.

Goods such as Xiang-produced mushrooms and kelp slices are rarely available due to the lack of smooth ships, and they are more popular than actual sales, and the prices are rising.

### The Difficulty of Independence for the Longan Industry: The Industry Still Advocates Independent Organization

[Reported by our newspaper] There are a total of fifty-four businesses in Shanghai specializing in longans. Their operations involve purchasing longans and shipping them to Shanghai, then reselling them to various ports, or wholesaling to the preserved fruit and sandalwood longan industries. Forty years ago, there was already an organization. After obtaining approval for filing, and after the victory, the governing authority, believing that there should not be more than two organizations within one industry in the same region, ordered a merger with the preserved fruit or sandalwood longan industries. However, the longan industry maintains that due to its different nature, it should remain an independent organization.

### White Tung Oil Weakens Again

Due to the apparent upward trend of various commodities last week, sentiment for white tung oil was somewhat buoyed, and sales prices at various firms in Shanghai once increased to 72,000 yuan. However, after only a few days, news from Hankou indicated that the market remained sluggish, still only around 51,000 yuan. Although there seemed to be activity on the Zhejiang Railway, it was only a flash in the pan and did not last. Shanghai naturally could not remain isolated, and the selling price fell back to 70,000 yuan. Furthermore, export sales remained elusive. Although there were sporadic transactions, the total, when calculated in foreign exchange, was still forced. The cost of delivery in Shanghai, including the iron drums, was only about 74,000 to 75,000 yuan, which was not very profitable. Recently, domestic sales have also weakened, selling for only 68,000 yuan. If exports are not strong, adjusting prices to facilitate exports is the only hope for development.

### Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Assets: Total Reaches 50 Billion

The Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau has entrusted the Jianghai Customs to publicly auction off a large quantity of silk fabrics, pigments, chemicals, spices, metal goods, etc., that have been taken over and confiscated. The viewing of samples began yesterday at the Customs warehouse office, and the deadline for bidding is tomorrow (the 14th). Bidding will close at 5:00 PM on the 15th, and the bids will be opened publicly at the Customs at 1:00 PM on the 16th. It is reported that the bureau disposed of various materials worth 21.6 billion yuan last month and expects to reach 50 billion yuan by the end of this month. Two-thirds of the warehouses cleared out, totaling approximately 1,000, will be cleared by the end of this month.

### Reopening of Commercial Banks: Original Supporting Documents Required

[Reported by our newspaper] Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated supplementary measures for the restoration of commercial banks in the recovered areas, many banks and financial institutions have applied for resumption of business or continued operation in accordance with these measures. However, most of the supporting documents submitted are photocopies. The Ministry of Finance, considering the difficulty of verification, has telegraphed various provinces and cities, requesting that original documents be submitted in the future for review.

### Factions in the Scrap Iron Industry: Each Establishes its Own Trade Association

[Reported by our newspaper] The local scrap iron industry is divided into three groups. One group deals in steel bars, scrap iron, etc., specializing in imported steel bars, foreign ingots, foreign squares, foreign plates, etc., mainly used for construction and machinery manufacturing. The second group is the hardware scrap industry, whose goods for sale are scrap hardware materials collected from glass shops, copper shops, and tin shops, and then sold to hardware shops for melting and reprocessing. The third group is the miscellaneous iron industry, whose goods are scrap iron from various factories, sold to iron shops to manufacture agricultural tools. The first two groups have already established their own trade associations. The miscellaneous iron industry was previously initiated by Chen Rongkun, Zhang Luchao, and others, who were fortunately ordered to join the associations of the first two groups. Now, considering that the operations of each group are indeed different, it has been approved to organize independently, with Zhang Luchao and six others as preparatory members.

### A Brief Discussion on Business License Tax

— Zhu Shangyi

Shanghai's financial difficulties have led to the introduction of a business license tax. The business license tax is a type of control tax, meaning that businesses subject to control must pay the tax to obtain a permit and cannot operate without authorization.

Analyzing the various businesses listed in the tax law as subject to license tax, there are generally two categories:

1. Those belonging to the category of luxury goods.

2. Those belonging to the category of unnecessary consumption or superstitious items.

For those not explicitly listed but subject to control, business license tax may also be levied with the approval of the Ministry of Finance.

However, the so-called "subject to control" has its clear boundaries. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance's approval for control must be based on the prerequisite of "subject to control." Otherwise, it would be inconsistent with the original intention of the control tax and would appear to be merely a business registration fee.

The Shanghai business license tax originally included thirty-three categories and was subsequently increased by five categories with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, totaling thirty-eight categories. Whether all of them are "subject to control" is theoretically questionable. For example, if Western medicine can be controlled, then the affiliated medical colleges and medical laboratories would fundamentally have a problem. If the barbering industry can be controlled, then Chinese pharmacies may have to stop selling hair growth medicines. As for the control of the woolen and Western clothing industries, the reasons are even more difficult to explain. As for the photography industry being considered a luxury or unnecessary item, it is unclear why national identity cards still need to use photos.

That orders may not change laws is an inviolable principle of a country ruled by law. Therefore, levying a tax on businesses that should not be controlled, regardless of whether it has been approved, is not entirely legal. Even if "taxes adapted to local conditions are, in principle, permitted to be levied," they "should be submitted by local governments to the local legislative body for approval before being submitted to the central government for approval and implementation" to be legal! Reading Executive Yuan's Instruction No. Jie An Ding Zi 3783 states: "The biggest reason for the current financial difficulties of local autonomy lies in excessive spending, excessive central government mandates, and excessive burdens of military requisition and conscription, making it impossible to cope with legal revenue." It is known that the difficulties of local autonomy have their own underlying causes. If we do not quickly find a fundamental solution and only address superficial issues, seeking more revenue from entertainment taxes, banquet taxes, and business licenses, I fear the effect will be limited, and in the reorganization of the tax system, it will only make matters worse.

### On the Eve of the Restoration of Qiantang Bridge and Aviation Education: Visiting the Fighters of the Blue Sky

— Hangzhou, December 11 Communication, Zhu Mincheng

The officers and soldiers of the Jianqiao Chinese Aviation Officer School in Hangzhou are returning east from Kunming using various means of transportation. Graduates of the Jianqiao Aviation School established immortal historical records in the past eight years of air combat. In the autumn of 1937, the school moved west and finally established a school in Wujiaba Village, Kunming, to continue training students. In the last three years, due to the difficulty of supplying aircraft gasoline domestically, the school, with the assistance of the United Kingdom and the United States, established a branch school in Lahore, India, for the initial flight training of aviation students. After completing the initial flight training, they were sent to the United States for intermediate and advanced flight training.

Sixty Stearman Aircraft Fly a Long Distance

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Aviation Officer School was ordered to move back to its original site in Jianqiao, Hangzhou, from Kunming and Lahore, India. Recently, the reporter visited the Jianqiao Aviation School and saw that the school was being rebuilt from ruins, with workers busy non-stop. Aircraft were lined up on the green grass airfield. In the officers' quarters, the reporter found Instructor Mao Zhaopin, whom he had met in Liangshan, Sichuan. He was originally the squadron leader of the Third Air Group, fighting over the skies of Henan, Hubei, and Hunan, and had achieved many combat victories. Later, he was injured and transferred to the position of instructor at the Aviation School. Chief Instructor Cao Chaojue told him that this time he flew a Stearman aircraft from Lahore, India, through the Himalayas, Hump, and Savage Mountain, to Kunming and then to Hangzhou. This long-distance flight can be said to be a good example of adventure and difficulty in the history of aviation education. Sixty aircraft participated in this mission. The following is a record of the collective return of the Aviation School's aircraft from abroad, to preserve historical records.

The Stearman aircraft is made in the United States. It is used by the United States as a primary trainer for training pilots. It has two wings, two seats, and low horsepower, with a speed of 85 miles per hour. The fuel capacity allows it to fly for three and a half hours, and when fully fueled, it can fly a range of 300 miles, with an altitude limit of 12,000 feet. Before and for five years after the war, the Chinese Aviation School used Fleet primary trainers. In 1943, the Aviation School implemented aviation education in Lahore, India, and began using Stearman aircraft as trainers.

As a result of three years of use, only 90 or so of the Stearman aircraft remain complete and able to fly. These 90 or so aircraft have each flown more than 700 hours. Some of the aircraft engines are nearing overhaul time (the engine can be used for 2,000 hours, after which it must be overhauled). After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Aviation School was ordered to move back to its original site in Jianqiao, Hangzhou. Before the new trainers arrive from the United States, this batch of half-old trainers must be transported to Hangzhou for teaching purposes. Therefore, the Aviation School authorities decided to have the aircraft flown back to China from Lahore in northwestern India by the school's instructors.

A Hazardous Test Flight: Altitude of 25,000 Feet

The air route from India to China is one of the most difficult in the world. The worst section is the Himalayas, the Hump, and the Savage Mountain in northern Myanmar and western Yunnan. The altitude of these mountains is over 15,000 feet. There are very few airfields between these mountain peaks. After flying out of Tingjiang on the Hump, it is only possible to land at Myitkyina and Bhamo (both in northern Myanmar). If these two airfields cannot be found, then there are only two options: parachute or crash into the mountain. Because the fuel is limited, there is no chance to fly back.

In order for the aviation students returning to China and the students recruited domestically to have aircraft to learn to fly, the Aviation School decided to have all the flyable aircraft flown to Hangzhou by the school's instructors. The instructors are all veteran pilots who have experienced many battles. People known for their skills are unwilling to decline the opportunity to use their skills. Although what is needed this time is not simply flying skills, but also the courage and determination of the instructors to dedicate themselves to this adventurous flight. These young veteran pilots did not hesitate. Although the wreckage of 700 crashed aircraft and the bones of Chinese and American personnel on the Hump and Savage Mountain were haunting their minds, they said: "Once we decide, we will implement it. We will each try our luck."

First Test Flight: Cao Chaojue Describes His Experience

On November 12th last year, Cao Chaojue, along with mechanical sergeant Lü Kangxi, flew a Stearman, and Guo Shousong and Zhu Ruopeng flew another. The two aircraft took off from the Lahore airfield in India, starting this voyage and embarking on an adventurous test flight. Cao Chaojue said:

"Our flight this time was all about luck, because the situation at the stations ahead was unclear, and there was no weather forecast along the way."

We talked about this thrilling information in a room full of wind and rain, as if we were in this flight.

"After leaving Lahore, the first stop along the way was Ambala, the second stop was Delhi, the third stop was Agra, and the fourth stop was Cawnpore. After arriving at Cawnpore, the aircraft of Guo Shousong, who was traveling with me, developed a problem and stopped for repairs. From then on, I flew alone in one aircraft. The fifth stop was Allahabad, the sixth stop was Gaya, and the seventh stop was Bhagalpur. After landing at the Bhagalpur airfield, I found that no one was in charge at all, and there was no fuel to add. Seeing that the wind was blowing towards the next stop, Lalmonirhat, I ate a meal at the home of an Indian doctor nearby and then took off eastward. Fortunately, it was a tailwind. The fuel had not run out when flying to Lalmonirhat. Otherwise, I would have had to make a forced landing in the wilderness. The American troops had withdrawn from the Lalmonirhat airfield. After refueling, I continued to fly. When I arrived at the ninth stop, Tezpur, it was already 9:00 PM. In the Indian weather, 9:00 PM is like dusk in our country and it is still possible to fly. Tezpur is an American military base. I stayed here overnight. By this time, I had been flying for two days.

"On November 14th, I took off and flew to Chabua near Tingjiang. I heard that the American troops at the Myitkyina airfield would withdraw on the 15th. Although it was already 2:00 PM, I decided to fly over the Hump to Myitkyina at the foot of Savage Mountain, so as not to delay until the next day and not be able to refuel the aircraft at Myitkyina. Fortunately, I did not encounter bad weather during this flight. When I arrived over the Myitkyina airfield, I saw several fires below. I knew that the American troops were burning the remaining supplies after the battle. After landing, no one paid attention to me. The American soldiers were hurriedly preparing to go home tomorrow. They were too lazy to care about other people's affairs. I had been flying for a day and it was the third day of flying. Food and lodging could not be solved, so I had to sleep hungry on an empty desk in the office overnight.

"On the 16th, I could not find any aircraft fuel everywhere. I found a car driver who helped me find a barrel of car fuel on the ground. The Stearman aircraft has low horsepower, and car fuel can also be used. After taking off from Myitkyina, I saw a British aircraft that had made a forced landing in the wilderness due to damage, waving a white cloth to ask me to notify the next station to rescue it. I arrived at the Bhamo airfield and immediately informed the people at the station to rescue the British aircraft. However, the tail wheel of my aircraft was damaged. I walked to the American motor depot seven miles away. After negotiating for a while, they sent someone to repair the tail wheel. After it was repaired, I took off.

"Although it was November, it was very hot in Bhamo. I felt even hotter after running back and forth. When I took off, I was only wearing a khaki shirt. I originally planned to land at the Baoshan airfield in Yunnan. After circling over the Baoshan airfield twice, I saw that there was no one below, so I flew straight to Yunnan Yi. From Baoshan to Yunnan Yi, I climbed onto the Yunnan plateau. The weather was cold, and I was shivering from the cold. After landing at the Yunnan Yi airfield, the station chief, who was my classmate, covered me with silk cotton quilt strips and I fell asleep. The time was 4:00 PM. I was really cold and hungry. That night, I had a good meal and slept soundly. On the morning of the 17th, I landed at the Wujiaba airfield, the site of our school. From India to Kunming, the total distance was 2,400 miles. I flew over one station at a time in five days. When I arrived at the Kunming airfield, the American and British troops were very surprised: How could a small yellow grasshopper that China had never seen fly from the sky? They came to ask where I came from. I told them that I had come from the foot of the Hump in India. The British and American officers were all stunned, gave me a thumbs-up, and thought we were risking our lives. If it were the United States, they would rather transport the aircraft by ship or car than risk flying like this."

I was naturally concerned about the Stearman that was being repaired in Cawnpore. It just so happened that squad leader Zhu Ruopeng arrived. He said with a smile:

"Chief Instructor Cao took the mechanic away, making the two of us rush to repair the aircraft ourselves in Cawnpore, and then hurry to catch up station by station. We finally arrived in Kunming safely."

Cao Chaojue and Zhu Ruopeng are both from Guangdong. Eight years ago, the two of them were flying fighter planes in the army and fighting in Jurong, Nanjing. After their two aircraft successfully completed the test flight, they decided on the eastbound flight of a large formation of Stearman aircraft back to China.

### Large Squadron Flies East: Arrives Safely in Kunming from India

Cao Chaojue had been in Kunming for a week, yet rumors still circulated in Leh, India: "Chief Instructor Cao is missing." It was believed that Chaojue and his small "Grasshoppers" [referring to Stearman aircraft] had perished in the Hump or the Savage Mountain. The obstruction of telegraphic communication was the root of these rumors. After Cao Chaojue returned to Leh with Education Director Liu Muqun, Steadman's success in crossing the Hump gave all pilots confidence. The large squadron's eastward flight began immediately. The first batch, led by Section Chief Tao Weisheng, consisting of twelve Stearman aircraft, took off from Leh, India on December 11th of last year and arrived safely in Kunming on the 17th. Subsequently, they took off from Kunming this year, passing through Luoping, Bose, Liuzhou, Guilin, Hengyang, Hankou, Anqing, and Nanjing, to Hangzhou. This Kunming-Hangzhou route is 1,600 miles long and can be reached in three days. Although Section Chief Tao Weisheng's twelve Stearman aircraft encountered dangers along the way, they relied on their piloting skills and leadership abilities to finally land safely and completely at Hangzhou Jianqiao Airport.

Following this, the second batch of Stearman aircraft, led by Lai Senquan, flew back from India, also with twelve aircraft. The third batch was led by Zou Huanzhang, with twelve aircraft. The fourth batch was led by Zhou Dingyi, also with twelve aircraft. The fifth batch was led by Cao Chaojue, with ten aircraft. In total, sixty aircraft arrived safely in China, with Kunming as their first destination. However, losses were slightly incurred on the journey from Kunming to Hangzhou. Instructor Wang Yinruo crashed into a mountain and perished in Luoping due to weather conditions. On May 7th, this reporter, representing Director Jianpu of the Political Department of the Aviation Committee, visited and consoled this group of flight instructors who had made the long journey back to the country at Jianqiao. First, I saw Miss Shui Jingyan, the fiancée of Instructor Mao Zhaopin, in the instructor's dormitory. Miss Shui can be said to be an aviation enthusiast; she happily introduced the instructors she was familiar with to me. I then met Instructor Li Jingchong and his wife. We were not as formal as people meeting in official circles, and we spoke frankly. Soon, Mao Zhaopin returned from Hangzhou, and he introduced me to Chief Instructor Cao Chaojue, who piloted the first Stearman aircraft back to the country. Chief Cao, a native of Guangdong, smilingly recounted his first flight back to the country. He is short and stout, with missing front teeth. He has been flying for fifteen years since graduating from aviation school and has taught countless aviation students. He has spent half his life in aviation and can be said to be a true patriot. These people, both young and old, are not like the experts in general society who seek high prices for private gain. You can tell from his ruddy complexion that he is intimately acquainted with the sun, wind, rain, and Guanghan Airport. Soon, Instructor Yu Yaoting joined us. He is from Jiangyin, Jiangsu, and flew B-25 bombers in the first squadron, second flight, in operations in Liangshan, Zhijiang, and other places. During the Japanese retreat from Guiliu towards Wuhan, he often took off from Zhijiang to dive-bomb and strafe Japanese troops. Instructor Yu is tall; heavy bomber pilots are often of this stature, related to the cockpit seat. Jiang Hanyin was a valiant general of the fifth squadron. He also talked about a time he made a forced landing in Dongxingyuan, Yuanjiang, Hunan, and then about his last mission, an attack on a Japanese airfield in Hengyang, where they collectively shot down seventeen enemy aircraft. Finally, the reporter also saw Squad Leader Zhu Ruopeng, the pilot of the second single-engine Stearman aircraft to test-fly back to the country. A native of Guangdong, tall in stature. As I was leaving, I also met Instructor Yao Quanli. I hadn't seen him in seven years; his hair was already balding, but he was still as energetic as ever. I only know a portion of the list of sixty Stearman aircraft pilots, including Hou Chen, Liu Muyu, Huang Weiran, Jiang Hanyin, Yao Quanli, Zou Huanzhang, Yang Deguang, Li Guoan, Wu Yougan, Zhang Shuben, Ye Zhao, Wang Longshu, Yu Yaoting, Chen Jiekang, Zhang Yisheng, Zhou Dingyi, Wang Jindu, Liu Zizhong, Shi Tongxin, Liang Huisheng, Gao Shaojie, Zhou Xun, Mou Zhouhai, Zeng Tianpei, Pan Guoying, Yu Jiansheng, Ye Nianyun, Ren Chongdao, Liu Fujie, Zhu Ruopeng, Guo Shousong, Lai Senquan, Li Jingchong, Tao Weisheng, Mao Zhaopin, Cao Chaojue, and the mechanic Lü Kangxi.

The Skies Over Hangzhou's Jianqiao Will Become Active This Month

The instructors worked hard to fly the Stearman training aircraft from India's Leh Airport to Hangzhou's Jianqiao Airport. Except for Instructor Wang Yinruo, who crashed into a mountain along the way, fifty-nine aircraft arrived safely. More than fifty can currently be used. The Aviation School's primary training equipment will not be a problem until the new American shipments arrive. Although the buildings at Jianqiao Aviation School are being repaired, the airport is complete, and fuel supplies are not a problem. Aviation students have also arrived in Jianqiao by plane from Leh, India. Therefore, from May 15th, educational flights, which had been interrupted for eight years, will resume in the skies over Hangzhou's Jianqiao.

A New Spirit in the Air Force: Determination and Action

The first phase of Jianqiao before the war cultivated air force cadres for the eight-year War of Resistance. Many young men died in aerial combat or in enemy territory, and many were injured or disabled. Most of them became the backbone of the air force in various units. Although the skies and airport of Jianqiao are in a corner of the southeast, their spirit has enveloped the entire country and extended to America in the New World. The second phase of Jianqiao has begun. Signaled by the courageous return flight of sixty Stearman aircraft, the spirit of the Chinese Air Force is: "I have determination, and I can act!"

### The So-Called Liberated Area

— A Communication from Northern Jiangsu on the 2nd. Ai Pin

When the autumn wind of last August dispersed the smoke of war from heaven and earth, the world was about to present a scene of peace. However, in China, on the map of post-victory China, the smoke of war still lingered in various places. If it is said that they are fighting for "democracy," then they should respect the word "democracy." However, in reality, they are making it impossible for the common people to return home or make a living. Under the slogan of "democracy," the common people seem to be superfluous, as if they deserve to die.

In Northern Jiangsu half a month ago, those who abandoned their homes and fled south were members of the educated class. Now, even the laborers and "poor scholars" most favored by the Communist army are also flocking to the south of the Yangtze River. In Shaobo Town on the Grand Canal line, where the Nationalists and Communists meet, in addition to the countless people traveling by land, there are more than 300 fast boats on the river, specializing in speculative business of transporting refugees. More than a thousand people a day flee from various counties in Northern Jiangsu to Zhenjiang, numerous as crucian carp crossing the river. The reason they painfully abandoned their homes and willingly became refugees is not without cause. Naturally, they are not accustomed to the various "democratic" policies of the "Liberated Area." Let me describe some of the dynamics in the "Liberated Area" of Northern Jiangsu.

"Loving the People" Slogans Are Pasted All Over the Streets

After the victory of the War of Resistance, whenever the Communist army captured a city or town, the first step was to issue a public notice to reassure the people. The important wording was that the general public had suffered greatly from the ravages and destruction of the enemy and puppets during the War of Resistance, and that their "democratic government" had come specifically to "liberate" them. The second step was to paint slogans, using ingenious artistic fonts, writing on the walls of streets and alleys: "Support Chairman Mao, implement new democracy." "Abolish one-party dictatorship," "The New Fourth Army is fed by the people, the old Central Government wants to eat, the puppet army robs to eat, and the Japanese fight to eat." Regarding slogans punishing traitors, there were: "Big monks [metaphor for "Han traitors"] don't run away, little monks don't slip away, if the monks run away, the temple can't run away!" In the bustling streets, huge paintings were drawn with the words: "How will we live in the future?" Below was a picture of Chairman Chiang's head, indicating that the "Jiang" in "future" was a substitute for the word "Chiang." Then, on the upper corner of the other side, countless New Fourth Army soldiers were drawn waving to the bewildered and helpless people.

Making Every Effort to Punish Traitors

At the same time, propaganda workers were divided into groups to work, on the streets, in the alleys, in every corner. They gathered the nearby coolies and poor people in one place and said deeply moving words with great kindness: "...We are here to liberate you... We know that you had to stop working during this counter-offensive, and of course, the losses of the past few days should be compensated by us," pointing to bags of white rice: "These are specially brought for you, come on..." A group of poor laborers, seeing the grains of rice that could fill their stomachs, could not help but show joy and delight. Then, the propaganda workers also reveled triumphantly. "We have plenty of rice, and we have a large amount of white rice to distribute to you, as long as you can report who in this street or alley has ever been a traitor, has ever done evil..." This was the propaganda about punishing traitors. The method for reporting landlords and capitalists was the same, but the opening line was: "What do you think is the most unfair thing in the world...? It is the inequality between rich and poor, the rich deserve to live, the poor deserve to die..." Using many common facts to arouse the inequality between the rich and the poor, the bud of class struggle grew in the hearts of every poor person. Of course, this was an opportunity for the poor to vent their anger. After they raised their heads, the educated class was squeezed out by the "working class." But now, they are also finding it difficult to feel secure and are fleeing to the south of the Yangtze River in droves.

Confession Meetings: Full of Jokes

After the traitors and "rich" were identified and arrested, "confession meetings" were held. They had to use their own mouths to confess their past faults in front of everyone, without concealing anything, otherwise they would be severely punished. Let me describe a joke from a "confession meeting":

Once, a "confession meeting" was held in a certain town, chaired by the district head. Among them was a stylish middle-aged woman, known as an "outstanding figure of her generation," whose self-confession was quite amusing: "I have loved stealing people since I was a child. I have stolen more than a dozen people so far. Among these dozen, there is a district head..." The district head was stunned and didn't know whether to laugh or cry, staring blankly at this "heroine." The "heroine" continued shamelessly: "Why are you staring at me? Are you still trying to deny it? That day, didn't you and I open a room together at the...inn?" The whole hall burst into laughter.

Putting on Flax Sacks and Cursing Oneself

As for punishing traitors and the "rich," simply putting on a flax sack was not enough to atone for their crimes. The People's Court would set up a high platform in a large, empty square. On the platform were the staff and the criminals, and below the platform were tens of thousands of people. First, the crimes were proclaimed from the platform, and then those below the platform supplemented what was missing. Then, those on the platform would ask those below: "The New Fourth Army is the most reasonable. There are thousands of unreasonable arguments, but only one reasonable one. We are a democratic government, and how to punish them is up to you, the people..." Those subjected to public trial were mostly sentenced to death. It was said that the verdicts were prearranged, or that staff members mixed among the crowd to create a false impression and bewitch the public, in order to kill people under the guise of the people. Thus, the "Liberated Area" was nothing more than a plundering of public opinion.

Fields Abandoned, Nine Out of Ten Houses Empty

Under the lament of "Rather fight to the death than flee," the innocent people of Northern Jiangsu have taken out of the enviable "Liberated" under the name of "Liberated Areas." The reason why laborers and poor people also want to abandon their homes is: "There is no work to do there. All day long, you eat me, I eat you. Families are scattered in several places. The rich have their families ruined, and the poor also have their families scattered. Our lives are extremely simple. We sell our labor for money to support our families, and the family lives in harmony. But now we can't, now we can't..." It is said that in the area from Huai'an to Jieshou Town, farming is taken by those who eat to be wiped clean, and no one wants to farm again. Some have labor, and they go everywhere to get food, so they put down their farming tools and go. There is land but no one to cultivate it, there are houses but no one to live in them. As for immovable property, transactions have been rare for a long time. Now there is a local saying: "Buying fields and buying land is bullshit, selling fields and selling land is venting anger for the family." In elementary and middle schools, only a dozen or so students are left in each school, which is only for decoration, which shows one aspect of the nine out of ten empty houses.

Recruiting Strong Men, Draped in Red

In the "Liberated Area," the strong men who join the army are the supreme and most respected. On the first day of joining the army, officials from the authorities will personally come to pay their respects and give a grand banquet, using a "sedan chair" like those used for small gatherings in the south of the Yangtze River, for the strong soldiers to sit in and be carried. They are draped in red like Wu Song parading the streets, parading through the streets, alleys, villages, and fields amidst the noise of gongs and drums and music.

When a son joins the army, the father is called "Old Grandpa Recruit" by everyone, and all the comforts of the family are provided by others. If there is no field, the landlord will offer a field. If there is no house to live in, someone will build one for you. Others will farm the field for you, and you can sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor. If a huge disaster befalls you, as long as someone joins the army, everything will turn into an island of safety.

According to the "Military Service Regulations," participation is voluntary, but there are cases of village chiefs being forced to wear "paper turtles" for failing to promote military service vigorously enough.

Are you still saying that you are "fighting for the people"? Then let the reporter tell you that the people have been fought to the brink of death. Please stop! (May 2nd)

### Please Let Everyone Judge! The Problems of the "Liberated Areas" Established by the Communist Army

To the Chief Editor: In recent days, the issue of the Communist Party has reached a point where it is necessary to distinguish right from wrong. Politically, a truthful examination must be made to assess the value of the Communist Party. Many such articles have already been published in Shanghai. I, as a farmer, am hard-working and resistant to hardship, with no capitalist or feudal inclinations. At the same time, I am also an educated person engaged in rural primary school education, pure and upright. After the July 7th Incident (1937), I went into hiding, and after 1940, I continued to live in seclusion under Communist rule. What I have seen and heard can serve as valuable reference material for the authorities. Having come to Shanghai this spring, I can also be said to have escaped. The following text is submitted for publication. Respectfully, [signature].

The New Fourth Army, led by the Communist Party, arrived in northern Jiangsu Province in the autumn of 1940. At that time, northern Jiangsu was troubled by enemies, puppets, and bandits. The New Fourth Army first captured bandits and established political power. County magistrates and district chiefs continuously posted notices, and the people, after being oppressed for a long time, indeed expressed welcome. Many educated youths, driven by anti-Japanese and patriotic sentiments, resolutely joined, and there were quite a few of them. Naturally, the Communist Party, relying on its propaganda and organizational skills, emphasized that resistance to Japan was non-negotiable, and step by step, it penetrated all aspects of society, cultivated its own strength, and represented the Communist Party as representing the interests of the proletariat, workers, and peasants. In front of the bourgeoisie and gentry, it also stated that the Communist Party was implementing the "Three-Third System," that is, the composition of the political power consisted of one-third workers and peasants, one-third petty bourgeois progressive youth, and one-third big bourgeois enlightened gentry, taking into account the interests of all classes. Little did they know that the other two-thirds, without party backgrounds and without party superiors who could guide politics, were not still subject to the Communist Party's control? This is the first point. The second point is that there was no standard for so-called large and small bourgeoisie. Some families had ten or eight mu, or twenty or thirty mu, or seven or eight mu, or hundreds of mu of land, or previously had thirty or twenty mu, but now, after the children divided the property, they only had ten or eight mu, or even less than that. All of these were acquired by good people through hard work and savings, and most of them were inherited from their ancestors. It can also be said that this is the minimum source of food and clothing for the backbone of the Chinese society. Without this source, how can they live? The Communist Party did not care about these, and generally said that they were the bourgeoisie, arbitrarily listing them as objects of struggle. It seemed that the reason why the lives of workers and peasants were so painful and unhappy was all because of these fellows. They even said that resisting Japan was the first priority, and overthrowing "capitalists" was the second. Alas! Should all these people be called capitalists or landlords? There is also a third point. The Communist Party advocates democracy, with the minority submitting to the majority. Naturally, there are more poor people and more uneducated people in society. How can there be more of them when raising hands at meetings? But we must ask: When Sun Yat-sen launched the revolution at the end of the Qing Dynasty, no one agreed with him. Only one pair of hands of the pioneers and visionaries were raised!

The Communist Party has many theories that are "seemingly correct but actually wrong" or "overcorrecting." They do not know what "too much is as bad as too little" means, nor the meaning of "a slight deviation can lead to a great error." Under these circumstances, there is no way to reason clearly. There are countless names such as: Farmers' Resistance Association, Workers' Resistance Association, Merchants' Resistance Association, Women's Resistance Association, Youth Resistance Association, Teachers' Resistance Association, Children's Corps, Apprentice Teams, Mediation Committees, Rent Reduction Teams, Preferential Treatment Associations, Plowing Teams, Mobilization Committees, Militia Self-Defense Teams, Backbone Teams, Guerrilla Teams, Independent Regiments, Patrol Teams, and so on. Countless committee members, directors, secretaries, chairmen, section chiefs, group leaders, subgroup leaders, squad leaders, platoon leaders, company commanders… Most of these people are illiterate or have only a superficial understanding. They mostly cannot understand the purpose of each association or the title of a certain position. Therefore, "once power is in hand, orders are issued." They are bustling and making every effort to cause trouble for themselves. They may have some merits, but resistance to Japan contains blind resistance to the central government, and revolution hides irredeemable destruction. They only care about the goal and do not care about the means, and the goal is so confused and distorted!

We believe that in such an incomplete Chinese society, only cooperation can bring new life. It is absolutely impossible to divide it into many classes and teach them to fight each other. This is suicide. For example, when the Workers' Resistance Association is successfully organized, the first step is to increase wages. Millions of hands are raised. When the employer cannot afford it, they mobilize their own family members to work, and the workers lose their jobs or work less. If the employer is a teacher, they have to abandon their pens and ink and engage in labor. The children of workers and peasants will have no place to study. Is this progress for society? Of course, we hope that everyone can have a happy life, but this cannot be achieved overnight. It requires multiple creations and cooperation. In northern Jiangsu, what has the Communist Party created besides many empty names, new buzzwords, and boring and tiring organizations? How much has it created in terms of local and substantive construction, such as schools, factories, roads, and bridges? They must argue that the Communist Party has not reached the construction stage. But let me ask, with the one-party dictatorship of workers and peasants, ignoring other cultural figures, engineers, and scientists, who can cultivate and create construction? This is deceiving yourself and others!

We also oppose the real big landlords and capitalists. However, we must distinguish between them and not label those who only have the minimum source of material life as the bourgeoisie and overthrow them all. If all these people are overthrown, will it immediately become a communist paradise, with Chairman Mao providing food and clothing? This is absolutely impossible! For example, among the tenant farmers in the Farmers' Resistance Association, there are also those who cultivate ten or twenty mu of rented land. Now the rent is reduced to a very low level, and there are many other preferential treatments. Renting land is equivalent to freedom, and the propertyless become propertied in an instant. Should they be overthrown again? If they are not overthrown, then those who were overthrown before were too wronged. We believe that Sun Yat-sen's ideal for the Principle of People's Livelihood is to ensure that there are no extremely rich or extremely poor people in society. In other words, everyone is "well-off," and everyone is able to live as a middle class. This is the truth, the truth that the intellectual masses recognize, and we should strive to achieve it.

The Communist Party also has a trick. On the surface, it claims to implement the Three Principles of the People, but internally, it promotes "New Democracy." I have also seen propaganda materials for this doctrine. Apart from coining names such as New Three Principles of the People, Old Three Principles of the People, Revolutionary Three Principles of the People, and Non-Revolutionary Three Principles of the People, nothing was gained. The Communist Party also innovates and promotes New Democratic education, New Democratic culture, etc. The Communist Party also says that we will first implement New Democracy, then Socialism, and then Communism. The portraits hung at important gatherings are those of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong. Later, after the Japanese surrendered, I occasionally saw portraits of Sun Yat-sen and President Chiang. The author spent five years under Communist rule and finally could not figure out what the Communist Party's political ideals were and what specific steps were being taken.

The winter schools, summer schools, or autumn schools run by the Communist Party are their social education. From the textbooks used in school education, they certainly point out that the central government is autocratic, and the leader is a dictator. They also deny everything about others. Only they themselves are good, and others do not resist Japan or revolt. The Communist Party also thoroughly denies Confucianism, believing that Confucius's doctrines such as propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are the protectors of the autocratic bourgeoisie. Their Chinese textbooks are all propaganda; "history" is also colored with red eyes, and many important historical facts are not mentioned. They only talk about the beauty of primitive communist society, and later enlightened rulers and virtuous officials are all autocrats or those who help autocrats; "geography" only talks about where the Communist army has bases and where the liberated areas are. They believe that education must serve progressive politics, and the value of education itself will be reduced to zero. Just imagine, what kind of state will education and culture reach after several years under Communist rule? This is truly frightening!

In the Communist democratic areas, anyone who has even a slight source of food and clothing is a sinner. They are attacked at meetings, have their workload increased in public service, pay heavier taxes than others, and always suffer in mediation committees. Appealing to county and district governments is even more unfavorable to you. Only when everyone is reduced to being propertyless can they raise their heads and eyebrows and gain the trust of the authorities, and they can handle "official affairs" and speak "official language." Therefore, the name "mud-legged people" became very popular for a while!

### "Hot Spring Village" Turns into a Gentle Village - A Pair of Bright Eyes in Taipei

— Our newspaper's 6th dispatch, Special Correspondent Mu Yun

Beitou and Caoshan are a pair of bright eyes in Taipei.

Beitou is the only hot spring county, surrounded by mountains on three sides: Datun, Qixing, and Shaomao, while the other side is a vast plain. Because it is a sulfur producing area, there are hot springs everywhere. The hot springs have three types: earthy springs, acidic springs, and sulfur springs, with temperatures ranging from 50 to 68 degrees Celsius, which can treat neuralgia, skin diseases, malaria, diabetes, and gynecological diseases. It was discovered by a German named Horry during the Guangxu period (late Qing Dynasty), and later Hirata Genkichi, a Japanese, was the first to open a business. The Japanese spent a lot of energy and money in the hot spring area of ​​Datun Park, which transformed it into the prosperous scene it is today. There are more than 30 hotels, which attract tourists from the city with their exquisite decorations and "hot springs that never stop at night."

Caoshan is located in the embrace of Qixing and Shaomao Mountains at an altitude of 400 meters, with a lower temperature of 8-9 degrees Celsius than Beitou. It is purely a summer resort. The hot springs here are generally better than those in Beitou, without a strong sulfur smell, but the surface prosperity is far less than that of Beitou.

These two places have the same characteristic, which is the beauty of the tourist lodges scattered on the mountainside, painted green. Especially in the early morning and evening, when the fog has not dissipated, the shadows of the verdant tropical plants make people love them even more. There is a quiet beauty here, as well as the beautiful youth, like a beautiful prose poem, or a poetic mood.

The Taipei County Government has established a Hot Spring Management Committee here. The sixteen hotels that were taken over and several hotels in Caoshan and Yilan are all managed by the committee. The current method of renting is divided into four types: A, B, C, and D. The highest monthly rent is 6,000 yuan. However, due to the chaos of the takeover, some have been occupied by various agencies as clubs, and some that are open are empty. It is said that there is a black market for renting, with the highest price reaching tens of thousands of yuan. Recently, the general prices have soared, but on Saturday nights, nearly a thousand civil servants enjoy lavish nights here, with more than 500 women providing them with revelry. The cost for each person is equivalent to half a month's salary for a small civil servant—500 yuan!

This kind of indulgent lifestyle is a good contrast to the lives of civil servants who are worried about not having rice for dinner. However, the old owners of the hotels who benefit from it are afraid that this will prolong the bad social atmosphere brought by people from the mainland! Hot Spring Village is now a "gentle village" throughout the country!

### Shrine Pilgrimage

The Japanese who came across the sea had to first worship the Taiwan Shrine.

The "sacred area" of the shrine occupies the southern foot of the vast Datun volcanic group of Jiantan Mountain, facing Zhongshan Park. Passing through Zhongshan Bridge, one is shaded by huge wooden pillars. The hinoki trees, nearly two arms wide, make it difficult to see the top when you look up. This is the gate of revelation for the shrine. It is also the object of remote worship for the "servant of the emperor." Now, however, a large slogan "Practice the Three Principles of the People, Follow the Teachings of the Premier" is hung high.

People naturally feel that times have changed. Even the area of ​​the "gods" who were "respected" in the past has changed its appearance. Here are enshrined "Ōkuninushi," "Ōnamuchi," "Sukuhikona," and "Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa." These invaders who robbed Taiwan by force were worshiped as "gods" by their warlords and worshiped by their descendants. The government advocates turning the shrine into a public education hall, but after the reporter's investigation, I deeply feel that this special feature of the change is not easily accepted by the people of the province.

Following the stone road on the slope, walk towards the front of the shrine. The stone lanterns "donated by" various groups of invaders, the broken-eyed bronze bulls squatting there, are still symbols of the development of agriculture in Taiwan. Looking out from the green, the clear stream of the Keelung River, the bridge of the Tamsui River, and the white sails are surrounded by green hills. Breathing in the natural atmosphere of the basin under the suffocation of "god."

The front of the shrine should be stationed by the National Army. The large pillar for applying lights is broken, the bell pavilion has disappeared, the money box in the courtyard is empty, and a large pile of god boxes are lined up beside the tightly closed gate. Chaotic knife marks are drawn on the camphor wood pillars. There is no one, no shadow. We are like a desolate ancient temple. The monthly festival on the 28th is gone, and the grand festival on October 28th has become even more distant.

Stepping out of the shrine, we saw a monument to the "martyred" police at the foot of the mountain, soldiers who served the "imperial country." Forty years ago, they were slaughtered by righteous "bandits." The island's nationhood is clearly reflected here. There is also an old 33-caliber mortar, a souvenir from the siege of Lushun in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. It has not been eroded too much by the wind and rain, but it has repaid its blood debt.

The realm of gods and humans, manipulated by the invaders, is where the "gods" have also disappeared.

### On Industrial Construction

— Lin Han

Following the victorious end of the war, the first arduous and urgent task is nation-building. Whether our country can truly become a modern nation-state, truly escape the status of a semi-colony, and leap to become one of the five great powers, the issue lies in whether we can complete industrialization within a short period and lay the foundation for nation-building. The unequal treaties have been abolished, victory has arrived, and consequently, the task of maintaining peace has become heavier! Whether our country can shoulder this heavy responsibility depends on whether we have the strength to manage peace and maintain security. The first phase of economic construction principles announced by the government at the end of the lunar year before last was formulated in response to this need and as a path for construction. The particularly important aspects of these principles, as Minister Weng said: First, economic enterprises other than those solely operated by the government, including postal and telecommunications, military industries, minting, major railways, and large-scale hydroelectric power plants, can be operated by the people. The government's activities should focus on practical and necessary state-owned industries. Many large enterprises, such as petroleum mines, steel mills, and shipping, which are beyond the capabilities of private individuals, can still be solely operated by the government or jointly operated by the government and private individuals. Other economic development welcomes the efforts of private enterprises. Second, regarding the regulations for welcoming foreign investment: no restrictions are placed on foreign investment. For all Sino-foreign joint ventures, except that the chairman of the board of directors must still be a national, all other regulations deemed inconvenient by foreigners are completely abolished. The Chinese government, in participating in state-owned enterprises, only exercises administrative supervision rights and only exercises the rights of shareholders in the company's daily operations, without interfering. Special discussions on related matters are briefly summarized to benefit those involved in industrial construction.

The goal of economic construction is industrialization, and its structure is a planned economy. "Because industry and politics are interdependent, their success or failure are mutually causal. In the past, industrialists often lacked a national perspective and rarely studied national policies and laws, while those engaged in politics did not fully recognize the importance of industry and did not know that supporting industry was their responsibility. Therefore, industry and politics became disconnected, and the difficulties of industry increased. Therefore, if we want to complete the country's industrial construction, we must promote the connection between industry and politics." (See Chairman Chiang's speech at the Industrial Construction Planning Conference). Therefore, in the future, under the leadership and support of the government, the industrial sector should work closely with the government, and all its plans and work must be in line with government policies in order to achieve the overall industrialization of the country.

The issue of state-owned and private enterprises in industrial construction has already been clearly stipulated in the economic construction principles. All enterprises with monopolistic characteristics and those that private capital cannot operate are state-owned. The remaining light and heavy industries related to people's livelihood are highly expected to be developed by private enterprises. The two are related and proceed in parallel, and there is no conflict. Now, because there are still a lack of clear and detailed rules for state-owned and private enterprises, state-owned enterprises have superior special conditions and are suspected of competing with private individuals for profit and打击 private enterprises. This point deserves great attention. As for the question of which should be established first, light or heavy industries, heavy industries are necessary for national defense and related to security, while light industries are indispensable for enriching the country and benefiting the people. Both are necessary to be called a modern country; however, the establishment of heavy industries is not an easy task. The Soviet Union's three five-year plans, with painstaking efforts, endured hunger and cold for more than ten years to succeed. Our heavy industry must be established, our strength must be concentrated, and we must be prepared to suffer for one or two decades! As for the establishment of light industry, in principle, it is up to the private sector to work hard, and the government provides guidance and assistance. The industrial sector itself must not engage in extra-legal profit-seeking (such as hoarding and speculation), and all floating capital must be converted into capital for industrial construction. The focus of heavy industry is on transportation industry and national defense industry, while the focus of light industry is on the textile industry, food industry, and daily necessities industry. Under the conditions of industrialization and export, the standards of these industries must be established in order to become industrialized in name and in reality.

The capital issue of industrial construction is also the capital issue of economic construction. According to Professor Wu Qiyuan's opinion: "Economic construction is a construction that uses a large amount of capital. The amount of capital, the structure of capital... all have a great impact on economic construction. In the first phase of economic construction, the first issue related to capital is the amount of capital. This quantitative issue includes both the amount of capital required and the fundraising. The amount of capital is limited by the relationship between supply and demand, on the one hand, based on the requirements of nation-building, and on the other hand, based on the country's economic strength. In the Soviet Union's first five-year plan, the annual capital for economic construction was fifty times the US dollar. Some people, based on China's pre-war economic situation, believe that we can raise about 200 million yuan of capital every year as the minimum investment for economic construction. However, it is estimated that the annual capital amount can be listed as 2 billion US dollars, a total of 10 billion US dollars in five years. Because China's economic construction must be completed within two or thirty years after the end of the war, the capital of industrial, mining, and transportation industries should be close to 80 billion US dollars after the completion of economic construction, so the total capital for economic construction should be no less than 100 billion US dollars. Regarding fundraising, China's annual national income before the war was about 10 billion US dollars (Professor Clark's estimate of 20 billion is too high). China's annual national savings before the war were 700 million US dollars. The average annual central financial expenditure before the war was about 300 million US dollars. The total amount of legal tender issued was about 400 million US dollars. The national bank deposits were about 1.4 billion US dollars. The annual capital inflow before the war was only 100 million US dollars. Remittances from overseas Chinese were less than 110 million US dollars. From this kind of figures, it is not easy to raise 2 billion capital every year, but the situation is different from before the war: (1) The recovery of the Northeast is extremely helpful for the fundraising of economic construction capital. (2) The international situation has changed, China's international status has been improved, and foreign capital can be easily borrowed from friendly countries and international institutions (such as the International Bank). (3) War reparations. These three aspects of change can make it easier for us to raise funds. One fundraising method is: (A) National capitalists account for 2.1 billion, (B) The government accounts for 1 billion, (C) 3 billion is taken from war reparations, (D) Foreign capital accounts for 4 billion. The source of domestic capital is national savings, and the ways to increase it are national production and conservation. The fundraising methods for foreign capital are roughly: 1 (A) The surplus materials of the United States and Britain after the war can be used for economic construction in various countries. According to Gu Chunfan's estimate, the surplus materials after the US demobilization can be used for economic construction in backward countries, totaling 27 billion US dollars. The surplus materials of the United Kingdom can be used for economic construction in backward countries, and the amount must also be considerable. The United States and Britain have a part of the disposal of this kind of materials that can be used to lend to China and other countries. (B) Borrowing loans for indirect investment or directly participating in operations. (C) International Bank loans. (D) War reparations." (See Yu Dagongbao Weekly Thesis) However, in fact, the national economy has been greatly damaged due to the suffering of the war, especially the losses of farmers. In addition, coupled with disasters and epidemics, we are not optimistic about the post-war income surplus and accumulation of the Chinese people; and the situation in the Northeast is special, and all industrial and transportation equipment has been destroyed or dismantled by the Soviet Union and the Communist army. The help that the Northeast can give to economic construction in the ideal situation has been greatly devalued. Regarding foreign capital, according to Gu Chunfan's observation during his trip to the United States: "The disposal of surplus materials in the United States... has newly formulated disposal bills, and the principle is to sell the materials quickly at a good price and not disturb the market; the most important heavy industry and chemical industry can hardly be disposed of without the consent of Congress, so we cannot overly expect surplus materials to be beneficial to us. Foreign investors are all taking a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for the clarity of China's politics and the stability of the order; and Americans doubt that although the Chinese government and people say that they welcome foreign capital, the narrow national thought of protecting national capital is often expressed or seen in legislation. They doubt whether China welcomes foreign capital? Generally speaking, Americans are not very interested in investing in China. On the contrary, American businessmen are looking for markets in China. At present, most of the investment from the Americans is direct. If we want to hope for their loans or sell Chinese stocks and bonds in the United States, the time is not yet ripe." (See Yu Dagongbao) However, due to the promulgation of the economic construction principles and the recent changes in the domestic situation, such as the mediation of the cessation of military conflict, political agreements, and the government's upcoming reorganization, etc. (although such mediation and agreements have problems at the moment, we can firmly believe that the country must and will be united and unified), will all increase the interest of foreign investors, make their investment at ease, and increase our international status and credit.

The materials for industrial construction are the resources and equipment for industrialization. According to Mr. Wu Jingchao's research on forty-four materials that are closely related to people's daily life. Our country can have a surplus of eight types: silk, soybeans, rapeseed, coal, tungsten, tin, antimony, and salt; there are twenty-eight types that can be expected to be self-sufficient: rice, wheat, cotton, hemp, sugar, cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, mules, wool, leather, wood, rock oil, molybdenum, manganese, magnesium, mercury, aluminum, sulfur, nitrate, potassium, phosphorus, mica, refractory materials, fluorite, lime, and gypsum; those that cannot be self-sufficient are rubber, iron, nickel, chromium, copper, lead, and zinc. The most serious of these is that the total output of iron is less than 1% of the world's total. In terms of equipment, our country's existing equipment is extremely poor and backward, and is not worth mentioning. The solution to the material problem, on the one hand, urgently needs to expand the source and production; on the other hand, it should import a large number of machines and the raw materials that are lacking from friendly countries.

The talent problem is also a basic problem of industrial construction. Industrialization is mechanization, and there must be a large number of technical and management talents. As Dagongbao said: "In the early stage of the Soviet Union's implementation of the five-year plan, it hired a lot of foreign engineers. Judging from the trend, we will also need to rely on foreign personnel to participate in industrial construction in the future, but in any case, we must have a large number of second- and third-rate industrial talents and cooperate with foreign engineers, gradually learn, and lead." This is a very correct statement. Our country's lack of talent is undeniable; what is urgently needed in the future is technical cadres. How to train this kind of talent is of course the responsibility of the education authorities. However, the production plants widely recruiting apprentices and setting up technical schools is also a very effective method.

In summary, we can know that our country's industrial construction capital is not sufficient, and the environment is also unfavorable. The long and arduous journey requires us to work hard! At the time of the turning point of the country's destiny, the time is urgent, short, and precious. We hope that we can rise up and strive to seize this once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity, give up everything, and vow to work hard to build a modern new China.

### Art and Industry

— Wang Ying

In the materials provided by the United States Information Service, there is an article on advertising paintings and industry, the original text is as follows:

"The Christian Science Monitor recently published an article stating that the 'Modern Advertising Art Exhibition' currently held in Philadelphia proves that the industry can invite professional artists to create advertising designs for their products to promote business because the industry's products can be presented to readers in a new way in various magazines and newspapers with the help of artists. According to the newspaper's report: There are a total of ninety-seven advertising art works exhibited in the Philadelphia Art Alliance since February 21. The earliest one is from 1937, and the latest one is from 1945. It illustrates that the industry has come to a good opportunity. However, the Monitor pointed out that the number of companies currently commissioning artists to depict beautiful advertising paintings of products has also greatly increased.

During the war, various ministries and departments of the government, compelled by the needs of the war, recruited important artists to produce propaganda paintings such as public bonds and recruitment. On the other hand, advertising companies also took the principle that wartime advertisements should be as simple and short as possible, so they also abandoned complex painting methods. The Monitor also said: The Philadelphia exhibition proves that daily necessities will be beautifully presented in newspaper and magazine advertising columns.

French artist Fernand Léger has two works participating in the exhibition. He once commented on the relationship between modern art and industry, saying: 'Industrialists will increasingly need the works of artists. In order to assist the industry, we have been able to establish a new relationship between art and industry. This relationship is of course based on social interests: it will open up a road for thousands of people to appreciate contemporary art.'"

What Léger said is not wrong at all, because there is indeed a very close relationship between art and industry. Loving beauty is the nature of human beings. From the packaging of goods to the advertising pictures published in newspapers, all must include artistic elements, otherwise it will only be an appearance and cannot have a close relationship with the influence of ordinary people and the entire social life.

Many emerging countries, especially the United States, made extensive use of art as a good tool for propaganda during the war. In fact, when construction begins, it is even more necessary to use art. Therefore, in the future, China can make extensive use of art in construction work, so that propaganda can be more effective, and the industry should also attach importance to art, so that the two can work together to produce the expected results.

However, when it comes to this point, everyone feels the lack of talent. For the sake of future construction, cultivating art talent as soon as possible is also a matter of urgency.

### Production Tidbits

According to rough estimates, 10% of U.S. agricultural products are damaged by insects.

The origin of the almond tree is subtropical China, Persia, Syria, and Asia Minor.

Soybeans are now the magic agricultural product of the United States, 13% of the cooking oil is made from soybeans, and it is also the only livestock feed with the most protein.

Coal, which used to be considered only a source of heat and energy, is now an important raw material for synthetic wool, synthetic rubber, etc., and may be the main source of fuel for automobiles in the future.

Gasoline can be manufactured using natural coal gas in a factory near Texas; this factory uses 65 million cubic feet of natural coal gas to produce 5,000 barrels of gasoline and 1,000 barrels of diesel fuel every day.

The fog machine, which was invented to cover military operations, has now been used to spread insecticide powder on crops in the fields.

Before sandpaper was invented, shark skin was used as an abrasive.

Dried eggs, which were invented for wartime applications, may be widely used to make ice cream in the future.

Dolomite found in northern Chile has very useful properties. Dolomite can be used to make cement (HydarnlicCement) for hydraulic construction.

### Introduction to Business Administration

— Xu Baiyi

Responsibility to Society

A manager must strive to ensure that the quantity of goods he manufactures meets the quantity required by the market, that is, not to produce too much, because overproduction will create a depression. When the United States in 1919, the production volume of manufacturing plants exceeded the actual quantity required by the market, so all the goods were shelved on the way of sales or placed on the shelves of retailers, no one bought them, or these goods existed in the hands of hoarders, hoping to increase prices for profit, resulting in an unprecedented market depression in 1920.

Therefore, for the sake of the welfare of the entire market, never overproduce, and production and sales must be balanced at all times. A manager must always consider the following questions as the basis for his decision-making on all matters:

1.  Is it necessary to find ways to obtain working capital (such as borrowing mortgages, etc.) to increase production?

2.  How to formulate the annual sales budget, which must take into account how the purchasing power of the general public in the market is? How is the general economic strength? If the purchasing power of the general public is very weak, but we are manufacturing an aristocratic commodity? Then we are bound to be unable to sell it.

3.  Should the purchase of raw materials be bought immediately? Or wait for a while, and also consider the quantity to be purchased, because buying too little is not enough for application, and buying too much will reduce working capital.

4.  How should the increase in wages be handled? Because this point has a close relationship with the cost of goods, but on the one hand, it must also take into account the general standard of living and the general trend?
