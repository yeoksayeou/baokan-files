[Our Changchun Dispatch, 6th] The military situation in the Northeast seems to be becoming tense. After the Communist army's unfavorable attack in Fulongquan, they recently captured Xifeng in the southeast of Siping and are besieging Xi'an. Their intention seems to be to take Xi'an to put pressure on Siping and threaten transportation to Changchun and Shenyang. However, military observers say that this is nothing more than a pipe dream.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 5th] According to military sources, the Communist army in northern Liaoning has launched a large-scale offensive in the past week, targeting Xifeng, Xi'an, and Dongfeng.

However, it is reported that the National Army in Rehe has made considerable preparations.

According to people who have just returned from the Northeast, the preparations of the two armies have reached a considerable stage.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] (1) The Communist army in the Meihekou area has increased its forces by two brigades on the 5th.

In addition to repairing the derailed locomotive, repairs are being actively carried out. Furthermore, a railway bridge 133 kilometers east of Siping was destroyed by the Communist army on the night of the 5th and is currently under repair.

Saying Zhou Should Bear Responsibility for the War

### China's Transportation Launches a Pioneering Initiative: Machinery and Construction of the Fuzhou-Xiamen Road; Director of the Fujian Construction Department Comes North to Negotiate and Leaves Shanghai to Return South

[Our City News] Zhu Daijie, Director of the Construction Department of the Fujian Provincial Government, sought instructions from the Central Government and consulted with the UNRRA headquarters regarding the reconstruction of the Fuzhou-Xiamen highway and other construction matters in the province. After a month of efforts in Nanjing and Shanghai, progress has been made. The UNRRA authorities sent engineer Jia Ruixin to the province in June of this year to survey the Fuzhou-Xiamen highway. He conducted a precise inspection and measurement of the entire highway, believing that the road is related to the prosperity of the central and southern provinces,

and it is worthwhile to expedite the construction of a perfect highway. The UNRRA authorities in China have agreed to supply 230 units of road construction machinery, mountain opening machinery, stone crushing machinery, and transportation vehicles, as well as the necessary fuel (including engine oil, gasoline, etc.). The CNRA has agreed to allocate a huge amount of flour to be used as wages for road construction workers. As for other miscellaneous equipment and management costs, estimated at about 3 billion yuan, Mr. Zhu has prepared a plan and submitted it to the Ministry of Transportation for approval. Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei also attaches great importance to the construction of this road and has summoned Mr. Zhu twice to inquire and discuss. He expressed gratitude for UNRRA's agreement to allocate various road construction machines. Because China's highways are all built by manpower, many are simple and do not meet modern highway standards. The Fuzhou-Xiamen highway will be the first highway in China built with machinery, which is a unique highlight in the history of China's transportation. Minister Yu has agreed to subsidize half of the road's budget, 1.5 billion yuan, and has also agreed to allocate an additional several hundred million yuan for the required cement. The remaining funds will be raised by the Fujian Provincial authorities. The National Highway Administration is also very willing to assist in the success of this road and has instructed Cai Shichen, the head of the Third Mechanical Highway Corps of the bureau, to cooperate with Mr. Zhu along with the technical personnel of the entire corps. It is reported that Mr. Zhu is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow to return to Fujian to organize the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway Construction Committee.

### What I Saw in Xuzhou

— Special Correspondent Hang Zhou, Xuzhou, September 25th, from Our Newspaper

After the center of the war in Northern Jiangsu shifted north, I arrived in Xuzhou. Xuzhou is located at the intersection of the Jinpu and Longhai Railways. It is a historically famous military stronghold. It had a heroic Battle of Xuzhou during the Anti-Japanese War and is now the location of the Pacification Headquarters. General Xue Boling commands an army of 500,000 here to cope with the communist army's offensive and inflict necessary blows.

The Jinpu Railway is much more deserted than the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. On the special express train that departed at 8:40 p.m. on September 22, there were very few first-class passengers. In the second-class carriage, one person occupied a long bench and lay comfortably for ten hours. When I opened my eyes at dawn, it was the destination.

Wind, Sand, Grapes, Pears, Pomegranates

In Xuzhou, you can see the northern atmosphere. The wind and sand kiss the earth. In autumn, the ripe grapes tempt people's appetites. After the opening of the Xuzhou-Bian section of the Longhai Railway, Dangshan pears were transported in large quantities, costing 500 yuan each and tasting fresh and sweet. Added to this are the pomegranates from Xiao County. These delicacies on the Shanghai people's menu can be enjoyed universally here.

The north is simple. It is rare to see women in fancy dresses on the streets of Xuzhou. Housewives all wear blue cloth cheongsams, don't perm their hair, and wear cloth shoes. The roads are quite wide, and although there is wind and sand, there is very little garbage. The houses are quite neat. The office of the Pacification Headquarters is now in an ancient style, but it is magnificent inside and has various modern facilities.

Everything in Xuzhou can be said to express "Military First". Local administrative personnel put aside other work and devote all their energy to three things: repairing roads, compiling baojia; purging the countryside; in addition, there is also conscription. The Pacification Headquarters governs the entire area of Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui provinces and a part of Henan. This year, it will conscript more than 80,000 soldiers, which has been largely completed. "What difficulties did you encounter in conscription?" The answer from Feng Zigui, the administrative commissioner of the ninth district of Jiangsu Province, was beyond my expectations. He said: "The difficulties are actually less than during the Anti-Japanese War, especially in the recently recovered areas. The people's property has been fought over, and after gritting their teeth, they are quite willing to become soldiers."

Teng Jie, the director of the political department of the Pacification Headquarters, told me another thing: "There are no bandits in Xuzhou anymore, thieves are being purged, and refugees have been separately accommodated and relieved, so there are no beggars either." Beggars, it seems, are rarely encountered. An old man with white hair followed me for a while, saying, "Sir, I am going back to my hometown tomorrow. I need some travel money!"

The business community is very depressed, with the exception of the money industry, hotels, restaurants, and bathhouses.

This is an abnormal phenomenon, mostly caused by military and political personnel coming and going and those waiting to return home. These people live in hotels and have no place to spend their money, so they buy gold rings, gold bracelets, gold bars...

General Talks Candidly

General Xue Boling is the key figure here. On the night I arrived in Xuzhou, Mr. Xue hosted a group of reporters and expressed his views on the current situation. He first talked about the Battle of Huaiyin. Like the Battle of Siping Street in the Northeast, it defeated the main force of the communist army in Northern Jiangsu. The situation has completely changed. There should be no major battles in the future, and there is a chance to clarify the situation.

Huaiyin is the old nest of the communist army in Northern Jiangsu, and Heze, Jining, and Linyi are the main bases of the communist army in Southern Shandong. Except for Linyi, Heze and Jining have also been recovered by the army. Therefore, the communist army in Southern Shandong is shaking. He showed a very optimistic meaning when he said this.

"The communist army likes to fight but cannot fight." He continued: "They have never formally fought against the Japanese army in the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, and the strategies and tactics they use are outdated." He gave an analogy, "The communist army is like a mouse, like a mosquito, that's all."

"All revolutionary parties take the welfare of the people as a prerequisite, while the Communist Party takes the bankruptcy of the welfare of the people as a prerequisite. Such a party cannot be regarded as a revolutionary party, and it does not even have the qualifications of an ordinary political party."

"For the sake of the people, the government must save them from fire and water! When the national army recovers a place, the people there welcome the national army with a degree of fanaticism. This can be testified to the world: which side does the Chinese people's hearts lean towards!"

Mr. Xue vigorously promoted Sun Yat-sen in politics, believing that no political theory from ancient and modern times at home and abroad can surpass the Three Principles of the People; in military affairs, he vigorously promoted Sun Tzu. Mr. Xue has a unique study of "Sun Tzu's Art of War". The reception was conducted seriously for two hours. Mr. Xue's senior staff all attended the reception but did not express their opinions.

Xuzhou Executive Group

What exists disharmoniously in this city is the communist party representative of the Xuzhou Executive Group of the Military Mediation Department and the Transportation Group. A total of twelve people live in a semi-new small western-style house behind the Farmers Bank. The leader, named Wang Shaoyong, previously served in the Shandong communist army. He was a colonel and wore a set of homespun military uniforms. When I went to visit them, they expressed their depression to me. But when I went to visit the government representative, Lieutenant Colonel Liu Yongfang told me everything he had seen and suffered in the communist area. The distance between what the two sides said was so far!

One of the communist party representatives, Mr. Sun Gongfei, once served in the national army. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, during the Battle of Shanghai, he fell behind and encountered the communist party's troops, so he joined the communist army. This was a very accidental opportunity. In the end, he stated that he was an old roughneck and could not speak well.

Colonel Wang Shaoyong is a very eloquent person. He said that he has always been in the countryside and is not used to coming to the city, but his words show that he is a shrewd person. He used "very clear" and "haven't heard" to answer certain questions.

In any case, people's smiles and hatred are unfolding with the military evolution, and the displaced refugees can return to their hometowns.

Editorial

### Consoling Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies

Mr. Li Dijun, the envoy for consoling overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, will take a special plane from Beijing to Hong Kong today to fly to the Dutch East Indies to console overseas Chinese. Before his departure, Mr. Li told reporters that the task of this trip is to represent the government in expressing commendation to overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies for their service to the country, and to represent President Chiang in consoling overseas Chinese who have suffered during and after the Japanese surrender. He also intends to investigate the various damages suffered by local overseas Chinese before, during, and recently. More than two million overseas Chinese from our country reside in the Dutch East Indies, and over the years they have cared for and supported the motherland in many ways. This time, after enduring the ravages of war, the damage suffered by overseas Chinese has been extremely severe. In addition, the Indonesian government has deliberately excluded overseas Chinese after the war, and has recently promulgated harsh regulations prohibiting the retention of cash and prohibiting Chinese letters. There are many such regulations, and countless innocent people have been brutally massacred in recent months. At this juncture, our government has specially sent an envoy to express condolences, which is enough to show our government's concern for overseas Chinese. As Envoy Li heads south, we offer a few words to send him off and also to tell our overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies.

China and the Dutch East Indies have been in contact for a long time. The countries of Srivijaya and Java have paid tribute several times, as recorded in history books. From the Ming and Qing dynasties to modern times, Chinese people have gone to the Dutch East Indies in an endless stream. Even today, our overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies are still a major part of the national life of the Dutch East Indies. Since the Dutch East Indies fell under Dutch rule, the homeland of the Indonesian people has long ceased to exist; fortunately, the Dutch government has worked hard to govern, and the development of the Dutch East Indies' resources and political facilities cannot be considered slightly better among the generally ruled people, but after this war, even Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands' enlightened declaration cannot suppress the rise of national sentiment. The so-called Indonesian Republic movement has emerged. Until today, the situation in the Dutch East Indies is still chaotic. Our overseas Chinese have already suffered greatly during the war in the Dutch East Indies and during the subsequent Japanese occupation period. In addition to sympathy, we express our deep condolences.

We do not want to comment on the political situation in the Dutch East Indies here. As Envoy Li said, the situation in the Dutch East Indies is quite chaotic. There are three governments controlling the Dutch East Indies: one is the Allied government, mainly led by British troops, one is the Dutch East Indies government led by the Netherlands, and the other is the Indonesian government organized by Indonesians. Under these three regimes, it is imaginable that our overseas Chinese residing in the Dutch East Indies have suffered all kinds of damages. In Java, Sumatra, and other places, anti-Chinese acts have been seen frequently in recent times, leading to bloody tragedies. Regarding this tragic case, we hope that Envoy Li will investigate in detail, demand that the Dutch East Indies authorities severely punish the perpetrators, give the relatives of the dead and injured the compensation they deserve, and ensure that the same thing does not happen again. In order to ensure the rights and interests of our overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, and at the same time for the future of the entire Dutch East Indies, we sincerely hope that the situation in the Dutch East Indies can be clarified as soon as possible. As for all kinds of discriminatory laws against our overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, we should argue on the basis of reason and demand their abolition, which goes without saying.

### U.S. President's Statement Aiding Jews

At a time when the issue of Jews and Arabs in Palestine is inextricably intertwined, President Truman suddenly issued a statement advocating for the immediate large-scale relocation of Jewish refugees to Palestine. He also supported the establishment of a Jewish state in appropriate areas of Palestine and opposed the plan to divide Palestine between Jews and Arabs.

This statement is very abrupt and, in fact, seems impossible to implement. It is abrupt because Truman did not consult with the United Kingdom beforehand. British Prime Minister Attlee, upon receiving notification, immediately requested a delay in its release, but this was not accepted. In reality, it is unworkable because the United Kingdom advocates for the division of Palestine between Jews and Arabs under joint rule and is determined not to relinquish its own ruling power to allow the establishment of an independent Jewish state. As for the immigration issue, the UK is using all its power to prohibit it, unwilling to offend the Arabs and create a stalemate. The British government is unlikely to accept President Truman's approach in the short term.

It's not just the British government that opposes it; the Arabs will oppose it even more. Arabs have lived in Palestine for hundreds of years and have long considered Palestine their own land. Moreover, Jews are superior to them in terms of knowledge and wealth, and Arabs have no chance of competing with Jews. Racial animosity and economic rivalry are the fundamental problems between the Jewish and Arab communities in Palestine. President Truman has not come up with any solutions to address these fundamental problems. Suddenly announcing his willingness to assist Jewish immigration and establish a Jewish state is, in fact, unfeasible.

Of course, if President Truman is truly determined to implement his statement, he must send a large U.S. military force, estimated by experts to require fifty thousand troops, to escort the Jews into Palestine and station them there for a long time, helping the Jews resist the aggression of the Arabs and the Muslim League. Such a move is not only something President Truman is unwilling to do, but even if he were willing, the U.S. Congress, government officials, and the majority of the people would oppose it. As a result, it would still be impossible to implement in reality.

These are all very common facts, and it would be ridiculous to say that President Truman didn't see them. But why would he suddenly issue this impossible statement? Based on our speculation, President Truman's move is mainly aimed at gaining the sympathy of Jewish constituents at home, rather than sincerely resolving the dispute over the Palestine issue. Since the purpose is domestic politics rather than diplomacy, whether it can be implemented diplomatically is irrelevant. What President Truman needs at the moment is to make a gesture of sympathy towards the Jewish community at home in order to win their support. The statement is just a gesture. If it encounters obstacles after the statement and cannot be implemented, the responsibility will naturally fall on the UK and the Arabs. President Truman will be successful regardless.

Regarding President Truman's political style, we have another strong piece of corroborating evidence. According to recent reports from American journalists, the truth about Wallace's speech has become clear. President Truman has always disagreed with Wallace's foreign policy. Since Wallace delivered a speech regarding the Iceland negotiations in March of this year, President Truman has forbidden him from discussing foreign policy again. However, in early September, because of the New York mayoral election, President Truman felt it necessary to win over left-leaning elements, so he not only specifically approved Wallace's speech but also stated to reporters that he approved Wallace's "entire speech." Later, it caused a great uproar at home and abroad, which he had not anticipated because he was then completely focused on domestic party strife.

The political influence of Jews in the United States cannot be underestimated. Although their numbers are not large, Jews have the ability to control government positions, news organizations, congressional seats, and especially important businesses. Jews around the world, no matter in which country, tend to go to two extremes: one is to become major capitalists or academic leaders in society by virtue of their intelligence and opportune moments, and the other is to become proletarians with no opportunities and gain a leading position among workers. Therefore, Jews have political influence on both the left and the right. If the ruling party in the United States hopes to win again in the next election, it seems that it must make great efforts, and everyone admits that President Truman's appeal is far inferior to that of Roosevelt. Although many postwar diplomatic and political measures are partly due to adverse circumstances, they have given the opposition party an opportunity to severely criticize. President Truman seems to be aware of this crisis and is therefore trying his best to win over the masses at home. This explanation, even if not entirely correct, is at least largely close to the truth. Because, according to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 4th, "The reason for this is that someone in New York has published advertisements attacking the government and the Democratic Party for failing to handle this matter properly." There is no doubt that the advertisements in New York were published by American Jews.

The domestic politics of a country often affect its foreign policy. In modern European history, the rulers of a country have sought to consolidate their own positions by exaggerating the threat of future wars to their own people. Twenty-five years ago, the British philosopher Russell had already bitterly criticized this in his book "Roads to Freedom." Today, the authorities in many countries around the world continue to exaggerate the threat of future wars to their own people, and the reason for this is no different. This may be very clever from the perspective of maintaining their power, but setting off a cannon does not necessarily take into account the consequences, and it is ultimately not a sustainable solution.

### Thoughts on the Partial Reorganization of the British Cabinet

The long-rumored partial reorganization of the British cabinet was finally announced the day before yesterday. Although the changes in cabinet members are limited to the ministers of the Navy, Army, and Air Force, this reorganization is of great significance.

First, the addition of a Ministry of Defence to the British Cabinet, unifying the UK's military structure, with Naval Minister Alexander taking office as Minister, is a major innovation for British defense. This move by the UK has been rumored for a long time. Chief of the General Staff of the Army, Field Marshal Montgomery, visited Washington earlier this month to study the American military organization, indicating that the UK would cooperate with the US militarily in the future. Therefore, in the eyes of nervous people, the establishment of the Ministry of Defence is tantamount to preparing for a "future war." In fact, based on the experience and lessons learned from World War II, unified command of the Navy, Army, and Air Force is an indispensable factor in strategy. Therefore, the unification of military institutions today is a common trend in countries around the world. Therefore, when the British government declared that this reform was the result of forty years of natural development in the British military organization, it was undoubtedly a sincere statement.

Second, the British cabinet reshuffle has brought in several promising young and talented individuals, injecting a lot of new blood into the British government, to avoid it being too old and difficult to promote. The sudden promotion of McNiel to Minister of State shows that the Labour government has a style of attracting young people into the cabinet. Regardless of its political achievements or external criticism, the current Attlee cabinet is still the most dynamic cabinet in the world.

Third, after Germany surrendered in May last year, the United Kingdom held a general election, and the Labour Party won an unprecedented victory and formed a new cabinet. At that time, the country was riddled with holes, and reconstruction was not easy. Although there were some new achievements in domestic affairs, its foreign policy still could not completely break away from the style of the Conservative Party. On the other hand, the Conservative Party was very dissatisfied. The current situation of the Labour cabinet feels as if it is on a narrow path, getting narrower and narrower.

Fourth, after this reorganization of the British cabinet, although some young people have been promoted, most of the veteran Labour members remain in the cabinet, and there will be no changes in general policy guidelines. The focus of the Labour Party's program remains on nationalization policies to improve the economic life of the people. No matter how the Conservative Party opposes it, the Labour cabinet will never change its position or line.

Fifth, the Labour Party's policy guidelines are, in principle, mostly endorsed by the people, but in practice, it often lacks the spirit of moving forward courageously and is inevitably indecisive. However, when we study the reasons for this, it is indeed due to the current environment. After the war, the material difficulties in Britain are left aside. In terms of its diplomacy, Foreign Secretary Bevin has put in a great deal of effort in how to find a way out of the current difficult situation. We believe that the British are the most shrewd and calculating, especially in the intricate international situation. British foreign policy often shifts imperceptibly, while consistently maintaining its consistent policy of maintaining the balance of power in the world. Whether it's old or young, conservative or progressive, the British are still the British, and the British government is still the British government. Despite the fact that the center of gravity of the postwar world seems to be between the United States and the Soviet Union on the surface, the British government's actions still have a significant impact. This point, in particular, must be deeply understood by the Chinese.

### Wang Maogong Arrives with Instructions, Severely Suppressing Grain Prices in Suzhou and Wuxi, The New White Limit is 54,000 Yuan, Absolutely Cannot Exceed, Grain Merchants Request for Increased Freight Profits Rejected

[Report from Suzhou, October 6th, by our newspaper] Suzhou Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong, under the order of Premier Song, to suppress grain prices in Suzhou, specially arrived in Suzhou from Wuxi at 4 pm on the 6th, leading his secretary Zhou and retinue, staying at the Garden Hotel. After a brief rest, at 9 am he ordered County Magistrate Lu to convene the leaders of the local gentry, business associations, and grain associations at the hotel for an emergency meeting. Mr. Wang announced two principles regarding the grain price issue: (1) First, to maintain a balance between Suzhou and Wuxi prices, (2) to ensure that Suzhou rice prices are lower than Wuxi, with the new top-grade white rice temporarily set at a maximum of 54,000 yuan, not to be exceeded. Mr. Wang ordered the grain associations to hold their own discussions first, with the lower, the better. At 4 pm, Mr. Wang visited the county government, convening the chief commissioners of the two districts, the county government, the police bureau, and the heads of departments and offices at the county level for instructions, individually inquiring about the work of each unit in detail. In addition to encouraging the spirit of creativity in politics, Mr. Wang also gave instructions on six points for the future: (1) Establish security, complete the compilation of baojia and land registration to consolidate the foundation of governance; (2) Implement the new county system, improve the autonomous organizations at all levels, to prepare for remote governance of the people; (3) Pay attention to transportation construction; (4) Complete the collection of land tax in kind, ensuring it is collected by December 15th; (5) Suppress grain prices, it must be done to maintain 54,000 yuan as the highest limit; (6) Promote the conscription system, and the quota of 980 must be recruited in full. The instructions ended at approximately 6 pm. Because past efforts to suppress grain prices have had extremely minimal effects, the reporter stationed in Suzhou made a special trip to visit Mr. Wang again to make inquiries. He was told that this time, the decision to set the maximum price for new top-grade white rice at 54,000 yuan has been personally discussed with County Magistrate Lu, who must insist on it. Currently, the grain associations have reported that after discussions, they plan to add 3,000 yuan for transportation costs and 2,500 yuan for profits, which Mr. Wang has decided to reject. If rice merchants comply outwardly but secretly transport rice, they will be dealt with decisively, and so on. Mr. Wang is scheduled to return to Zhenjiang at 12:30 am on the 6th.

Apricot Blossoms Welcome the National Army

[Report from Xuzhou, October 5th, by our newspaper] After the recapture of Huaiyin, there were two legendary stories. On September 19th, when the National Army entered the city, the apricot tree planted in the home of Wang Shicheng, a resident near the residence of Li Yimang, Chairman of the Suwan Border Region Government, suddenly blossomed with flowers covering the branches. When the reporter went to see it, several remaining flowers were still visible. Also, the garden of the guesthouse established by the Communist Party is now the headquarters of the 74th Division. On the night that Zhang Lingli, the division commander, moved in, the epiphyllum in the garden blossomed, as if to express welcome. According to records, apricot blossoms bloom in February, and the epiphyllum blooms irregularly, which is seen as an auspicious sign.

### Suppression of Bandits in Southern Jiangxi Mostly Completed

(Report from Nanchang by our newspaper) Last year, the Communist Party in northern Guangdong instigated chaos, and there were also stray soldiers and scattered bandits in southern Jiangxi. Dayu, on the border between Jiangxi and Guangdong, became their center for gathering followers. Initially, they committed burglary and robbery, and intercepted merchants. Later, they actually set up checkpoints to collect taxes, spreading to the borders of Hunan, Guangdong, and Fujian. Subsequently, the provincial government sent Song Xiangcheng, deputy commander of the Security Office, to lead security teams to garrison southern Jiangxi and coordinate with Hunan and Guangdong provinces. In Dayu, Xinfeng, San'nan, Yongyu, and other places, many bandits were killed. The remaining forces were broken up into smaller groups and fled into the deep mountains. The bandits in Dayu have been mostly cleared. As for the bandit groups in eastern Jiangxi, such as Guangfeng and Dexing, they have been suppressed by security teams several times, but they flee here and there. Currently, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces are jointly carrying out a final campaign.

Soliciting Fair Methods for Levying Income Tax

Income tax is the obligation of the people, and the government's method of collecting it should also have a reasonable standard. It should not be self-contradictory or vastly different, so that it can demonstrate trustworthiness. A comparison of the old and new regulations for salary income tax is studied as follows:

Previous Practice: Income below 100 yuan was exempt from tax, and income of 100 yuan was taxed at one jiao, which is one-thousandth.

New Practice: Tax is levied starting from an income of 51,000 yuan. However, this amount is based on the fact that businesses and industries pay salaries according to the city's cost-of-living index for August, with a basic salary of only 11 yuan. For a basic salary of 100 yuan, the salary paid according to the cost-of-living index is over 450,000 yuan. According to the new rate, the income tax payable is about 20,000 yuan, estimated at a little over 65 per thousand, which is 65 times higher than the previous practice of taxing 100 yuan at one-thousandth. Even if the income of civil servants in the city is calculated at 200,000 yuan based on a basic salary of 100 yuan, the income tax payable according to the new rate is 4,790 yuan, also estimated at 24 per thousand, which is 24 times greater than the previous practice.

Previous Practice: When the income was taxed at 190 yuan, 1 yuan and 9 jiao was 1%.

New Practice: According to the practice of businesses and industries issuing salaries based on the August cost-of-living index and giving discounts to high salary grades, someone with a basic salary of 190 yuan would have an income of over 700,000 yuan. According to the new rate, the income tax payable is about 55,000 yuan, accounting for 8%.

Previous Practice: To be taxed at 8% of income, the income must exceed 1,000 yuan.

New Practice: According to the above calculation, for those with incomes exceeding a basic salary of 190 yuan, the tax levied is 8% or more, even approaching 10%.

From the above brief comparison, it can be seen that the income tax levied on the salaried class is much higher than the old practice, which is harmful to vitality. This is because the majority of the salaried class are middle and lower-level cadres in society, not profiteers or high-ranking officials. They have no share in war profits, victory profits, or acquisition profits. For the past eight years, the income of the salaried class has been insufficient to provide adequate food and clothing. They have been struggling to make ends meet, with a hundred holes and thousands of sores. They have not yet recovered. Now, the general income is nominally 200,000 yuan, but its purchasing power is actually only 40 yuan. Suddenly, they have to pay this income tax, which is vastly different from the past, and also cope with the new taxes added in the city, as well as the heavy cost of children's education (please do not forget that in other countries, the government bears this burden). The income of the salaried class, who are struggling to make a living, is greatly reduced, making it difficult for them to survive. It is also said that starting from April of this year, the arrears will be recovered according to the new rate, which will be even more unbearable. The fairest and most reasonable method is to calculate according to the old tax rate based on the basic salary, and then multiply it by the percentage of the income. For example, for someone with a basic salary of 100 yuan, tax should be levied at one jiao according to the old practice. If their income is multiplied by the cost-of-living index, then the one jiao should also be multiplied accordingly. If civil servants have a different multiple, it should also be multiplied accordingly. Would that not be the fairest? I would like to speak out for the salaried class. (Fan Zhengbang)

Soliciting Opinions on the Designation of Regional Names

After the victory of the War of Resistance and the recovery of the concessions, the Westernized street names in the former two concessions have been completely changed to Chinese names. However, given the vast area of Shanghai, although the former street names were lengthy and complicated, long-term residents of Shanghai were able to remember and identify them without much thought due to historical and customary reasons. Now that all the names have been changed at once, it is really difficult to say all the street names, large and small, in Shanghai one by one. Therefore, the general public still calls them by their old names, and both the new and old names are used randomly in writing letters, just like the solar and lunar calendars. In particular, when selling tickets on trams, the conductors also announce the stops by their old names. I personally saw a passenger ask a conductor what the new name of a street was, and the conductor replied, "I don't know the new street names."

I believe that in such a large city, there seems to be a lack of a regional name designation between the "city" and the "street." Although "Hongkou," "Zhabei," "Nanshi," and "Great World" can be considered regional names, some are historical old names, and some are named after events or objects. The municipal authorities have never clearly stipulated, for example, where "Hongkou" ends to the east and where it ends to the south, north, and west. There are also no detailed boundaries. It is also not stipulated whether the divisions of autonomous organizations and the jurisdiction of police sub-bureaus are considered formal regional names. Furthermore, the boundaries of each district have not been clearly and detailedly demarcated and announced. It is really not easy for citizens to recognize and identify a large pile of street names in such a large city area. Therefore, the abolished names such as "British Concession" and "French Concession" are still used in daily life.

Apart from the difficulty of remembering street names, the lack of regional designations and names seems to be a shortcoming in the entire municipal organization and facilities. I suggest that the municipal authorities should implement the following immediately: (1) Officially demarcate the regional boundaries of the city area, stipulate the names, and announce them. (2) Notify agencies, organizations, schools, stores, post offices, and individuals to include the regional name when writing addresses on letters. (3) Arrange with cartographic publishers to print Shanghai city maps with different colors for each district. In this way, the memory and identification of street names can be narrowed down, and familiarity will be established over time, and municipal facilities will also be improved. What do you think of my humble opinion? (Ping Ming)

Questions Regarding Penalties for Paying House Tax Late

Editor: I am a resident of Zhaofeng Villa. At noon on September 18th, I received a house tax notice, which required payment by September 18th. Thirty-odd thousand yuan is not a small amount, and I had to plan how to raise it. When I paid it on the 20th at the designated location on Kainar Road, I was penalized one-tenth of the amount for late payment. When I argued with them, they said, "We only know how to collect money according to the bill. If you want to appeal, go inside." I didn't understand where "inside" was and didn't dare to venture there, so I had to accept the penalty and return. The more I thought about it, the more I felt that the person in charge must have sent out the notice long ago, and the person delivering it must have been delayed. I hope that the authorities will pay attention to this when collecting taxes next time and prevent similar incidents from happening, otherwise, the people will suspect that the authorities are intentionally trying to make extra money!

### The Resumption of Telecommunications in Various Counties of Jiangsu: 677 Kilometers Now in Operation

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang News] Before the War of Resistance, Jiangsu Province had provincial long-distance telephones covering more than 50 counties, totaling more than 3,000 kilometers in length, and the length of telephones in various county townships was about 57,000 kilometers, which was extremely convenient. During the War of Resistance, all were destroyed. After the victory, in order to unify telecommunications, the Central Government planned to construct them through the Directorate General of Telecommunications, but due to difficulties in labor, materials, and financial resources, it repeatedly instructed the provinces and counties to provide assistance. After the recovery of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, in order to stabilize the situation and according to its needs, it ordered the commissioners and county heads under its jurisdiction to requisition labor and materials to cooperate in the construction, and a total of more than 3,800 wooden and bamboo telephone poles were requisitioned. It is now learned that the provincial government is actively developing the work of pacifying Jiangbei, and the need for telecommunications is particularly urgent. In order to ensure that the counties strive to cooperate, it has designated this as the top priority. For example, in Nantong alone, more than 1,800 telephone poles have been collected within 20 days, and a telephone engineering emergency repair team has been organized to assist the communications troops in carrying out the construction. As of now, a total of 85 locations in various counties have been connected, totaling 677 kilometers in length.

A resident surnamed Jing, who lived next door to Li, was familiar with Li's daily life. Li had two children, and his wife worked in the Municipal Party Committee. The menu for each meal was very rich, and the relationship between the couple was harmonious, with no quarrels heard. Li spent his free time enjoying poetry and books. He once wrote a poem about Jiuhua Mountain, praising Li Zicheng of the late Ming Dynasty. Before the retreat of the Communist army, Li convened a meeting of the people and said that he was determined to live or die together with Huaiyin, but not long after, Li quietly left. Li is from Chongqing, in his forties. Currently, his government is located in a village in Lingxiang.

[Our Newspaper News] London, 6th, Broadcast: At 3:00 PM today (i.e., 11:00 PM Shanghai time), the Paris Peace Conference held a plenary session to make a final review of the drafts that have been reviewed by the various committees.

### The Soviet Union Raises Old Issues; The Issue of Foreign Troops Stationed in the Territory of Non-Enemy Countries; Requests Inclusion in the Agenda of the United Nations General Assembly

[Agence France-Presse Success Lake, 5th] The issue of a member state of the United Nations organization stationing troops in the territory of a non-enemy country has been requested by the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly for inclusion in the agenda of the next General Assembly. The Soviet application is contained in a letter to Lai Yi, which reads, "I am instructed by my government to request you, in accordance with Article 11 of the United Nations Charter, to include the issue of the stationing of troops of member states of the United Nations in the territory of non-enemy countries in the agenda of the second part of the first session of the General Assembly."

[United Press Success Lake, 6th] The selection of the permanent site of the United Nations organization will be one of the major issues when the General Assembly of 51 countries reconvenes on the 23rd of this month.

At the last General Assembly held in London, San Francisco lost to New York by a vote of seventeen to twenty-two. Now, it seems that the call for San Francisco as the new site is the highest, and Geneva, which is supported by the Soviet Union, is also likely to be elected.

### China Considers Joining the International Refugee Organization

The funds are shared by the participating countries. The original proposed total budget was US$200 million, but the number agreed by the 18 countries has now been reduced to US$160 million. If my country participates in this organization, the originally scheduled allocation was US$4.75 million (excluding the repatriation fee for Soviet Overseas Chinese), and it may have been reduced somewhat now. Our government is considering it, and if it decides to participate in the General Assembly, the candidates for the delegation may be proposed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

### Churchill Reiterates the Eight Major Platforms of the Conservative Party; Developing Foreign Trade, Opposing State-Owned Industries; His Views on Reconciliation with the Soviet Union Coincide with Bevin's

[Agence France-Presse London, 6th] The leader of the Conservative Party, former Prime Minister Churchill, delivered a speech at the party's annual conference today, reiterating the eight platforms of the Conservative Party as follows:

(1) Upholding Christianity and resisting all attacks on it; (2) Defending parliamentary government; (3) Ensuring national security from foreign aggression and maintaining the security of maritime trade; (4) Maintaining the absolute independence of the judiciary from any form of interference and oppression; (5) Reforming finance and ensuring strict management of national expenditures; (6) Defending and developing imperial trade, without which Britain cannot survive; (7) Supporting all measures to improve national health and social conditions; (8) Supporting free enterprise and opposing controlled trade and state-owned industries.

Accuses the Government of Hesitation and Indecision

[United Press British Blackpool, 5th] Churchill delivered an important speech at the Conservative Party National Conference here today, contrasting the shrinking territory of the British Empire with the expansion of the Soviet Union's power. He also criticized the Labor government for its hesitation and indecision and its lack of a policy plan for the Palestinian problem. He also darkly predicted that millions of people in India might suffer and bleed. Once India is lost, Burma will immediately fall into the same fate, and the population of the empire will be reduced to a quarter of what it has always been. At the same time, the Soviet Union has absorbed tens of millions of people into its rule, and its national power is still expanding. According to Churchill, although there are many domestic and foreign policy problems in Britain, given his leisurely life, he could have enjoyed the forests and springs. He often thought this way a few months ago, but today, he feels that the situation is extremely serious, and the situation in the future is even more worrying. Therefore, he has decided that as long as his mental abilities are sufficient to support him and he has the trust of the people, he will move forward bravely and be willing to be the first to take the lead. Churchill expressed general agreement with Bevin's policies and is willing to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union. His views are also the same as Bevin's. However, he fiercely attacked Prime Minister Attlee's India policy, saying that India is vast and populous. After independence, it will soon secede from the British Commonwealth and become a not very friendly foreign country. The unity created by British rule in India will quickly disappear, and the suffering and bloodshed of millions of people will be immeasurable. According to my plan, India should be given full dominion status, including the right to leave the British Commonwealth entirely. Churchill finally said with emotion that things like this are endless and happen almost every day. A giant ship is gradually sinking in the calm ocean, and those responsible should do their best to make it float, but instead, they open the bottom door to accelerate its sinking. This will leave a permanent mark in history.

### American Super Fortress Successfully Circles the Arctic; From Honolulu to Cairo via the Arctic; The Journey of 10,000 Miles Takes 39 and a Half Hours

[Agence France-Presse Cairo, 5th] The wars of the future will be centered on the Arctic. It is still questionable whether giant aircraft can fly freely in the Arctic climate. American aviator Colonel Irvine piloted the "Dream Boat" super fortress aircraft yesterday to test this. It departed from Honolulu, took the "Great Circle" route via the Arctic, and came to Cairo, braving all kinds of dangers. It arrived here at 7:56 AM today, taking 39 and a half hours. Although this flight did not break the recent non-stop flight record of the Navy aircraft "Langui", it has proved that it is possible for giant aircraft to fly across continents via the Arctic.

[Our Newspaper News] London, 6th, Broadcast: The American Army B-29 giant bomber that flew over the Arctic landed in Cairo today, but Zhu could break the record previously set by the American Navy.

[United Press Cairo, 6th] The US Army giant aircraft "Dream Boat" completed its long march across the top of the earth at 8:02 AM today (4:00 PM Shanghai time on Sunday). This test cost the US government US$3 million. However, the records obtained by the crew are of great value to the authorities' plan to send aircraft to regularly fly over the ice zone. The aircraft was commanded by Colonel Irvine and had a crew of ten. When it took off from Honolulu, it carried a record-breaking weight of 144,000 pounds, including 77,352 pounds of gasoline.

### New Hormones

Discovered by American Biologists

[Associated Press Berkeley, California, 5th] Experimental biologists at the University of California announced today that Professor Evans, Director of the Experimental Biology Institute of the University of California, and his assistant, Dr. Lee, have discovered a "growth hormone" that can develop young rats into giant rats.

[Our Correspondent] London, 6th - A broadcast reports that The Sunday Times states that Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations have now completely stalled, and some Soviet representatives have left London to return to the Soviet Union.

[Central News Agency, London, 6th, United Press] The Sunday Times reports that Anglo-Soviet trade talks have reached a deadlock, and some Soviet experts are returning to the Soviet Union because British manufacturers are almost unable to deliver the machinery and electrical equipment ordered by the Soviet Union within two years.

### Truman Advocates Establishing a Jewish State, Britain Firmly Opposes, Saying it Will Harm the Palestine Conference

[Associated Press, London, 5th] President Truman's request for the immediate and large-scale immigration of Jews to Palestine has been personally answered by British Prime Minister Attlee. This was confirmed today by the Foreign Office, which implied that the tone of the note was quite firm, but its contents will not be made public. According to a Foreign Office spokesman, President Truman's move was abrupt and perplexing to Britain. Britain, as the sole administrator of Palestine under the mandate, has no obligation to accept advice from the United States or other outside countries. Meanwhile, in Washington, White House sources claimed that President Truman and Prime Minister Attlee have exchanged secret telegrams on the Palestine issue, but their contents cannot be announced.

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] A White House spokesman said today that President Truman's recent statement on the Palestine issue has created a "delicate" situation. According to sources at the British Embassy in Washington, all news regarding the issue is being exchanged directly between Truman and Attlee, or relayed through the US Embassy in London. However, those responsible have confirmed that the British government disapproves of the statement in the strongest terms and views the possible repercussions with great concern. President Truman's move not only undermines the London Palestine Conference but also risks reigniting new and intense actions by Jewish extremists.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 5th] The Arab Higher Committee for Palestine announced tonight that it will respond tomorrow to President Truman's statement advocating the immediate admission of Jewish immigrants into Palestine.

### The Rope Used for Goering's Execution Was Made by a British Factory Owner; Papen and Two Others Remain Under House Arrest

[Associated Press, Seoul, 5th] The Korean National Police Agency announced today that riots in southern Korea have been ongoing for four days, with 59 police officers killed, 60 injured, and 100 missing.

### The Luxurious Life in America (Part 1)

— (Translated by Yu Jing)

The Privileged Class Spends Money Like Water; Demand Exceeds Supply of Scarce Goods

America's wealth is increasing daily, and past methods of calculation can no longer measure America's money. The American people and property have not become as depressed as generally expected. Statistical curves have all risen. People's needs have surged, food to eat, clothes to wear, books and movies to see, cars and airplanes to ride, buildings to live in, everything is lacking. The entire country is filled with needs, frantically attacking all kinds of stores. No matter what goods are displayed, they are sold out immediately. Mink coats costing $15,000 and men's watches costing $1,000 sell as well as scrambled eggs and spareribs.

The current prosperity is abnormal, completely different from the "prosperity" of peacetime. The market is full of wealth but lacks goods. In fact, the quantity of goods produced is already higher than in the past, but it still presents an unusually scarce phenomenon. Meat, bread, butter, milk, sugar, and lard are all scarce. Lumber, coal, steel, X-ray tubes, sacks, cranes, greenhouses, and lead pipes are also lacking, as are train and plane seats, hotel rooms, and even talent: pharmacists, merchants, veterinarians, carpenters, gardeners, telephone operators, painters, and cooks.

Needs are endless, everyone has money, and no one is going bankrupt. All kinds of businesses are booming. In March of this year, department store sales were equivalent to 263% of the average sales from 1936 to 1939. The New York Telephone Company's classified telephone directory is the largest in history. The number of airline passengers next year is expected to be equal to the number of train passengers in the previous five years. In 1929, the number of workers was 46 million, and now it is only 53 million.

How can these phenomena be explained? In summary, they can be explained in four aspects. There is also a not very reliable speculation, which is that the United States is about to suffer a cyclical panic. When America's wartime production stops, a drastic economic change will inevitably occur. An economist in Washington predicted that the United States will have eight million unemployed, but this panic is only a mystery. The lack of materials has already arrived, and at the same time the lack of labor is becoming increasingly apparent. First, Years of Hard Labor, People are Exhausted

Experts only estimate the material panic, and omit the lack of people. The war suddenly stopped, and people relaxed. Everyone hopes to change the environment and recuperate. The soldiers who went on expeditions have returned home, women have stopped working, many people have changed their professions, many people are traveling and sightseeing, many people are on vacation, many people are being transferred, and many people are practicing sports. In short, there are few producers and many consumers. It can be said that the entire United States is on strike. Workers in various industries have a month of strike leave. American factory manufacturers are surrounded by many people asking for goods, but his factory is stopped due to the strike. This phenomenon is very common.

Let us imagine that in the four and a half years of the war, the American people worked hard with great work efficiency, lacking enjoyment and without vacations. Now that the war is won, who would be willing to cheer a few times and then grab the tools to do hard work? If we understand the drastic changes in American life after the war, the current phenomenon is not surprising.

Economists cannot create a chart to prove that the current situation is a reaction to psychological fatigue, nor can they use an index to calculate how much time Americans need to recuperate, increase enjoyment, and improve entertainment. This is the focus of the current American economic problem.

### Coincidentally, Two Tragic Car Accidents: A Train Crashes into a Large Truck at the Fuxing Road Intersection in Western Shanghai, Six People Killed and Fourteen Injured; A Tram Crashes into a Small Jeep on the Bund

[Our Correspondent] Yesterday morning at around 3:00 AM, the night was deep and the autumn rain was drizzling. A train, No. 805, departing from the Shanghai Meigen Road freight station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, collided violently with a ten-wheeled truck (No. 12434) belonging to the Executive Yuan Automotive Assembly Plant, fully loaded with workers, at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Fuxing Road in western Shanghai. It is reported that the truck was carrying 20 workers and was speeding across the railroad tracks at the time, first crashing into a wooden fence in the dark and then stopping across the tracks. The train was traveling from east to west and was unable to brake in time, causing the truck to be torn in two. The truck driver died instantly. All the other workers in the truck were thrown out of the vehicle for more than ten yards, suffering injuries of varying degrees. Only one person was uninjured. After hearing the news, nearby police officers urgently summoned ambulances to the scene and sent them to the Gongji, Dagong, and Red Cross hospitals for treatment. Among them, five people died due to their injuries being too severe, either on the way or upon arrival at the hospital. Including the driver, a total of six people died tragically. Twelve people suffered minor injuries, and the other three suffered the most severe injuries and are still in critical condition, with their lives in danger. After the accident, the North Station also received a report immediately and dispatched cranes, cleaning vehicles, and small engineering mechanics to lift the damaged vehicles and clear the railroad tracks. Traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line was halted for half an hour as a result. The issue of responsibility for the accident is currently under investigation by all relevant parties. After hearing the news, the families of the victims rushed to the scene of the accident, crying incessantly, and the situation was very tragic. It is reported that the Executive Yuan will provide generous compensation.

[Further Report] As of last night's deadline, of the seven injured being treated at the Red Cross Hospital, one named Shen Guoquan died. The names of the remaining six are Jiang Aqi, Chen Qiangsheng, Xu Yuxiang, Chen Ruisheng, Shan Haosheng, and another whose name is unknown because he was too seriously injured to speak. Those sent to Gongji Hospital for treatment were Liu Xiangru, Yang Wenxing, Feng Genbao, and Zhao Yunbai. The names of the four injured at Dagong Hospital are unknown.

[Our Correspondent] Cases of Jeep accidents occur every day. Yesterday, following the tragic train accident, another tragic accident occurred at the intersection of the Bund and Beijing Road at 1:30 PM, in which a small Jeep crashed violently into a tram. It can be said that this was a tragic coincidence. As a result, a US Navy sailor driving Jeep No. 15734 was thrown out of the vehicle and hit his head on the No. A-54 electric pole there, causing his head to bleed profusely and rendering him unconscious. The Jeep he was driving was also severely damaged. The driver's platform of Tram No. 17, which was hit, was slightly damaged, but fortunately no one was injured. After the accident, police officers urgently summoned an ambulance to send the injured to the hospital for treatment, but traffic was blocked for an hour as a result.

### Reconstructing the Qiantang River Ferry: A Fundraising Committee Has Been Established; Shen Honglie Reports on Construction Projects to Fellow Zhejiang Natives

[Our Correspondent] Shen Honglie, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, and Zhang Qiang, Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, along with Directors Ruan Yicheng and Pi Zuohuan, came to Shanghai from Hangzhou on the 4th. In the following days, they contacted various parties regarding the post-disaster relief and reconstruction work in Zhejiang Province. Yesterday afternoon, they had a luncheon with Speaker Pan Gongzhan at the City Council, where they discussed various matters. In the afternoon, they also reached an agreement with Executive Yuan Executive Director Liu Hongsheng. Last night, they were invited by Wang Xiaolai, Chu Fucheng, Xu Jiqi, Ma Wanche, and others, and gave a brief report to their fellow Zhejiang natives at the dinner. The main points were that the Changxing Coal Mine suffered significant losses during the war and it is a pity to stop production. It has been agreed to reorganize the new company with a capital of 2 billion yuan and will start replenishing equipment, with the goal of resuming coal production in seven months. For water conservancy projects, an agreement has been reached with the Relief Administration to use the work-for-relief method, which can be actively implemented. The fishermen in the Dinghai fishing grounds live in extremely difficult conditions, and a request has also been made for the allocation of timber for the construction of fishing boats. The repair of the seawall project is being carried out by Mr. Mao Yisheng, but the funding is still insufficient. This seawall is of great importance to the coastal and riverine areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Since the Qing Dynasty, it has been regarded as a major national policy and compared to river engineering. It is definitely not something that one province can handle alone, and it is hoped that the central government and overseas compatriots will pay attention to it together. In the future, it is also planned to establish a Zhejiang Provincial Economic Rehabilitation Committee, and it is hoped that the power of officials and people can be gathered to restore vitality to the post-war wounds. That evening, the committee members of the Fundraising Committee for the Reconstruction of the Qiantang River Ferry were appointed and dispersed.

### Internal Affairs Department Chief Ha Xiongwen Arrives in Shanghai, Discusses the Extreme Shortage of Architectural Talent; Two Suggestions to Solve the Housing Crisis

Mr. Ha Xiongwen, Chief of the Internal Affairs Department of the Ministry of Interior, has been inspecting the architectural industry and various projects in major recovered cities for several months. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday for official business. A reporter made a special visit to inquire about the general situation of China's construction engineering and Mr. Ha's observations on the architectural situation in various recovered cities over the past few months. According to him, China's construction engineering has always been considered backward. The lack of architectural engineers is the main problem at present. Domestically, only a few universities, such as National Central University, Chongqing University, and Sun Yat-sen University, have architecture departments. The number of talents produced each year is very small. With the urgent need to develop the construction industry, this talent is not sufficient to meet the demand. During this inspection of major recovered cities, he promoted the organization of urban planning committees in various cities. So far, Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places have been established. The eight major cities in the rear, Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Kunming, Guiyang, Guilin, and Hengyang, had planning committees established during the war. Those still being organized include Qingdao, Guangzhou, Hankou, Nanchang, and other places. In addition, public works committees have been established in major cities, which are jointly composed of institutions such as engineering, public utilities, health, and land administration. In recent years, the chief officials of local governments have paid special attention to engineering and public utility undertakings. This is indeed a major change in Chinese administrative history. Mr. Ha believes that the most gratifying and exciting thing he has gained from the inspection is this point. Because the backwardness of China's construction industry really depends on the wise local government to give practical assistance.

In addition, when discussing the serious housing shortage in various places, Mr. Ha believes that except for the densely populated city of Shanghai, other places are not as serious as imagined. Mr. Ha believes that to solve the above-mentioned difficulties, only two methods can be adopted: First, incentives. Encourage construction. If there are those who automatically build apartment residences, they will be exempted from various taxes, government loans, and access to building materials, etc. Second, compulsory measures. Using political power, it is stipulated that new factories and schools must have sufficient dormitories, otherwise they will not be registered or filed. In this way, the housing shortage problem can be gradually resolved. Mr. Ha came to Shanghai this time to attend the annual meeting of the Chinese Institute of Architects. Mr. Ha is a member of the association and was elected as a standing director of this session.

### City Government Sells Materials Case: Relief Review Shows No Errors; Head of Investigation Team Zhang Zhiben to Go to Capital in Days

It is reported that the Audit Office has prepared a report on the initial investigation results. Cash income and expenditure: More than 3 billion yuan was sold during Mayor Qian's tenure, and more than 1.2 billion yuan was sold during Mayor Wu's tenure. In addition to most of it being used for staff salaries and allowances, it was also used for municipal measures. Currently, there is only 30 million yuan left. The accounts are generally accurate.

### News Veteran Luo Guofu Builds a Defense Line; He Hopes Others Will Bring Him News, But He Doesn't Reveal Even a Drop of Water Himself

[Special Report from this Newspaper] Luo Guofu, the new General Manager of TASS in China, is a fat, cheerful, and humorous figure.

Before visiting him, I had quite high expectations of "harvesting" something. I wanted to get some opinions and views on the world and China from this leader of the Soviet news agency, who has a considerable history in China and has spent the last few years in the United States and Britain. However, after talking with him, I completely failed. Luo Guofu is indeed worthy of being a "veteran" in the news business. He appears so experienced and alert, and his defense line is so solid that, to put it concretely, "not even a drop of water can seep in." However, on the other hand, he uses witty and humorous words and subtle and interesting actions to make the atmosphere very harmonious and relaxed.

I had heard that Luo Guofu could speak fluent Mandarin, but he spoke to me in English, claiming that he had forgotten Chinese after being away from China for many years. I asked him what his impressions were of returning to Shanghai. He said that he had only been here for five days and had not had time to think about it. I asked him what his opinions were on the current situation in China. He said that this should be reported to Moscow and he did not want to publish it to the press. I asked him what his views were on Britain and the United States. His reply was that it was when the war had not yet ended, and the situation should have changed now. In all the short ten minutes of conversation, the only thing he told me was that the Soviet Union had started another even greater five-year plan, and the Soviet Union, in his view, was "bigger." (Soviet is Bigger)

I gave up the plan to seek other "harvests" and just wanted to take a photo of him as a satisfactory end to the visit. He laughed and said, "I'm not a movie star, no need!" But he finally agreed to my request. He went to the hanger to put on his jacket, tidied his tie, and in the pose of a movie star on camera, he jokingly asked, "Am I handsome?" I laughed, but when the camera was aimed at him, he caused me to laugh uncontrollably with even more humor. He said, "Will any young girls see my picture and like me? Do you think so? Do you think there is any hope?" He said it so naturally and calmly, but in this interesting scene, I seemed so clumsy. I couldn't think of any equally humorous words to answer him for a moment, and only stuttered, "There is great hope, great hope! You still look very young!" This was not just a fabricated compliment, he did look very young, the only difference was that he was a little fat. He continued, "There is great hope? My son is already older than you!"

The conversation ended in a pleasant atmosphere. He smiled and saw me out the door, patted me on the shoulder and said, "I hope you don't ask me for news, on the contrary, I hope you bring me some news!"

### Love Sea Turns into Sea of Bitterness: Man and Woman Commit Suicide by Poisoning Together

[Report from this Newspaper] In Room 10 of the World Hotel at the intersection of Ninghai West Road and Xizang South Road, a pair of male and female travelers committed suicide by poisoning together at about 8:55 yesterday morning. The man filled in the circulation book with the name Yu Yuangang and the woman's name Wang Caiying, both 21 years old and from Hangzhou. This was discovered by the waiter, who reported it to the Taishan Police Station. They were immediately sent to Nanyang Hospital for emergency treatment. After the doctor gave them injections and gastric lavage, they were saved and their lives are expected to be safe. It is reported that the male and female protagonists are both using pseudonyms.

### Posing as Technicians, Japanese Residents in China Are Reluctant to Leave; They Live Comfortably, Do Evil, and the War Criminals Management Office is Ordered to Investigate

[Report from this Newspaper] The War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense has recently been assigned the responsibility of managing Japanese residents in China and will conduct a detailed investigation of the tasks of all Japanese residents in China. Those who are not necessary will still be repatriated to their country. Since the victory, in addition to the large number of enemy residents in China who have been successively repatriated to their country, there is still a small number of them who have remained in China under the name of technicians. Including their families, the number is about 3,000. The retention of these Japanese residents in China was initially based solely on a certificate from the employing agency, so the situation is quite complicated. Among them, many are indeed technicians, but there are also those who have no specialized skills and, due to other intentions, are reluctant to leave this land and are active in certain miscellaneous agencies that issue certificates. Since the abolition of the Japanese Residents Management Committee, there has been no unified management agency for these Japanese residents. They are only restrained by the employing agencies themselves, and there is a lot of negligence and leniency, resulting in some living comfortably and others doing evil. And the real technicians also have their work unable to be carried out due to various reasons such as the employing agency's own lack of funds or equipment. Although they have been retained, they have been idle for several months and have been wasting food. Recently, in view of this, the authorities have ordered the War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense to manage them uniformly and to conduct strict investigations to prevent abuses.

### Mobile Hospital: Two Routes of Mobile Clinic Vehicles Provide Free Medical Treatment to Employees

[Special Report from this Newspaper] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration has added a kind of mobile clinic vehicle on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines since September 23, traveling to various stations along the way to provide free medical treatment to those employees who are dedicated to railway work and their families, as well as the road protection security team that protects the safety of the two lines.

This kind of mobile clinic vehicle is a mobile hospital, just like the hospital ships drifting on the ocean during World War II. They bring safety and happiness to people, and the red cross on the car body is a symbol of kindness.

There is one mobile clinic vehicle on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines respectively. Dr. Tang Huimin is in charge of the Beijing-Shanghai line, and Dr. Bi Baoluo is responsible for the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. They are both experienced and familiar with the situation at each station. There are also two nurses and one worker to help on each car.

Although the mobile clinic vehicle is just an ordinary iron-covered vehicle refitted, the internal equipment is quite complete. Almost all kinds of major internal and surgical instruments and medicines are available. The inside of the carriage is all painted white, half of which is the clinic and dispensing room, and the other half is the dormitory and kitchen.

The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration has always paid great attention to the medical and health problems of employees. It has successively established railway hospitals in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Qishuyan, and established clinics in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Changzhou, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, and Xiaguan. The clinic in Hangzhou is preparing to be expanded into a hospital.

As for the mobile clinic vehicle, it is to supplement the shortcomings of the railway hospital and clinic. It is attached to the Shanghai Railway Hospital.

On the Beijing-Shanghai line, it departs from the North Station at 7:30 am on Monday and stops at Kunshan to start service; on Tuesday in Wuxi, on Wednesday in Danyang and Longtan. It returns to Kunshan on Thursday, Wuxi again on Friday, and Danyang and Longtan again on Saturday. It returns to Shanghai on Sunday to replenish medicines. It goes out to serve again on Monday morning. The time spent in each place for diagnosis and treatment ranges from two to three and a half hours.

As for the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, it is in Songjiang on Monday and Thursday, in Chang'an on Tuesday and Friday, and at the gate on Wednesday and Saturday.

The mobile clinic vehicle. Since it started serving, it has seen more than a thousand patients. Among them, those suffering from malaria and enteritis are the most! The employees of the two lines all hope that there will be more mobile clinic vehicles in the future.

### Strive for Freedom of the Press! An Open Letter to Commander Xuan from Reporters of Various Newspapers

Reporters from various newspapers in this city have many difficulties in covering news from the Garrison Command, and even cannot get in. Although they have negotiated many times, it is still ineffective. Therefore, the whole body decided to first send a letter to Commander Xuan, asking for improvement and issuing reporters' entry and exit permits for interviews. The original letter is as follows:

Mr. Tiewu:

We are reporters from various newspapers in this city covering military news. We have unanimously decided that it is necessary to publicly state our request to you. We believe that in this era of freedom of the press, we should serve the society and the people with the heavenly responsibility of news reporters. There is no reason to obstruct and block our interviews. Since you have concentrated the leadership of military and police public security agencies, we have always stood on the side of justice and advocated and promoted various virtues of eliminating violence and maintaining peace, so as to promote its success. We never thought that the Garrison Command would restrict and obstruct our freedom of interview.

I remember that during the tenure of Commanders Qian and Li, guest passes were issued to allow us to freely enter and exit the Garrison Command and go to various places for interviews at will. After you took over, you gradually abolished it. Now we cannot even enter the gate of the Garrison Command. According to the guards, if a reporter is allowed to enter, he will be beaten with fifty military sticks. We do not understand what misunderstandings you have about us, nor do we understand whether this practice is ordered by you or a trick played by others? Commanders Qian and Li once publicly said to us: "The Garrison Command will never close its doors and welcomes reporters to come and give advice at any time." From this point of view, why do you disagree with the enlightened methods of Commanders Qian and Li? We really do not understand. In order to strive for freedom of interview, we have to express our firm opposition and serious protest.

We hope that you can accept our request and issue us entry and exit permits so that we can freely interview. It is true that the Garrison Command is a military agency and has some confidentiality, but the Garrison Command does not have to disclose the part related to military secrets. If there are places where military secrets are published, we reporters are willing to be subject to legal punishment. According to your opinion, it will affect the office if reporters enter and exit freely. Our opinion on this point is to request the Garrison Command to set up a reporter reception room in various places. When we come, we can not go to the office, but meet with the directors of various departments and below in the reporter reception room. At the same time, we also ask you to spare half an hour of time each week to meet with us once. This is our lowest requirement.

As for the news release method implemented by the Garrison Command for a period of time, it is completely in the nature of a bulletin, which is not necessarily what readers like to hear and see. We do not have to specially issue bulletins on behalf of the Garrison Command. We demand that in addition to the bulletins issued to us, we are also allowed to interview freely. This is an obligation and a right for us.

This letter is published simultaneously in national newspapers. We sincerely ask you to publicly answer it. Xu Kailu of Central Daily News, Huang Zhangcai of Peace Daily News, Hu Daozhang of Republic of China Daily News, Zhou Haiping of Xinwen Bao, Jiao Chao of China News Agency, Chen Yinshan of Qianxian Daily News, Zhao Zhicheng of Central News Agency, Peng Junyi of Daguan News Agency, Zhu Zheng of Zhengyan Bao, Shen Yonghui of Yishi Bao, Zhang Shaofu of Dazhong Evening News, Kang Ziyan of Shenshi News Agency, Yang Jiuqing of Qiaosheng Bao, Xu Shoulian of Shen Bao, Cai Fa of Huadong News Agency, Yu Jinhao of Huamei Evening News, Zhu Youci of Ta Kung Pao, Wang Ping of Wenhui Bao, Chen Shiqian of Zhonghua Shibao, Cai Ji of Southeast Daily News, Tang Hai of Xinmin Bao, Zhang Weiwen of Da Wan Bao, and Lu Youluo of Li Bao respectfully on October 6.

### Gangsters Open Fire on Zhongshan Road: Patrol Team Bravely Pursues and Captures

[Report from this Newspaper] The patrol team of the Lijiawan Police Substation under the jurisdiction of the Xinjing Branch of the Shanghai West Police Bureau was patrolling on Zhongshan Road at about 2:00 am yesterday when they encountered three or four suspicious people. They immediately shouted for them to stop. Just as they were about to step forward to check, one of them took the lead and fired a shot, then turned around and fled. The patrol police bravely chased after them and fired several shots in succession, chasing them closely. Finally, they captured one person, Liu Jianping, and seized a live pistol. The rest escaped. They were taken back to the substation and transferred to the Xinjing Branch for interrogation.

### Joint Factory Furnace Explodes: All Chemicals Burned

[Report from this Newspaper] A fire broke out at the United Chemical Factory at No. 5, Lane 324, Haifang Road, at 1:30 pm yesterday. Because the chemicals piled up were all flammable, it was out of control. In addition to the factory and all the chemicals being burned down, it also affected the upper floors of the house at No. 3 next door, causing heavy losses. When the firefighters were putting out the fire, firefighter No. 229 was also burned in the head. The fire was extinguished at about 3:00 pm. It is said that the cause of the fire was due to the furnace being overheated and exploding.

### City Ferry's New Ship Repaired: Hosted a Tour of the Huangpu River Yesterday

The City Ferry Company's No. 6 (formerly Jiangsu) ferry, which took more than four months to repair, has just been completed and is scheduled to join the Beijing Road to Wusong route starting today. At 2:00 pm yesterday, various circles and news reporters were specially invited to visit and tour the Huangpu River.

### Letter to the Editor

Yesterday, I read the article "Soldiers Stationed in the Factory Tease Female Workers, Get Angry, and Shoot" in your newspaper. It is not in line with the facts. Please check and correct it accordingly. It was found that not long after the case occurred, an officer was dispatched to the factory to investigate. According to the accountant Lin Chucai and foreman Zhang Menghui, the worker Bao Xingcai (your newspaper mistakenly wrote Pang Shuncai) is from Ningbo, Zhejiang, and Guo Lanxiang is from Jinhua, Zhejiang. The report that they are siblings is not true. However, Bao and Guo have been very close in private, and Guo Lanxiang's behavior is also improper. She often jokes with male workers. Therefore, Guo Xilong, a guard of the fourth company, intervened. Bao Xingcai refused to accept and gathered dozens of workers to beat the guard. The guard was outnumbered and fled to the room to escape danger. Unexpectedly, Bao Xingcai led the workers to swarm and chase after him. During the fight, the guard Guo Xilong lost his freedom and accidentally triggered the gun, which went off and injured Bao's right leg. I hope your newspaper will grant a correction.

### Gunfire Flies in Tongfu Lane: Daytime Robbery; Arrested After Failure; Police Officers Surrounded and Captured Three Robbers

[Report from this Newspaper] At noon yesterday, three armed robbers suddenly broke into the home of Lan Hongquan at No. 27, Tongfu Lane, west of the Grand Theater on Nanjing West Road, and robbed. They first monitored the male and female servants of the Lan residence, and then searched arbitrarily. At that time, the Municipal Police Bureau and the Xincheng Branch under its jurisdiction received a report. The director of the branch, Zhuo Qingbao, personally led police officers to the scene and dispatched police officers to form an encirclement around the lane. One of the robbers was carrying the loot out the door and was captured. The other two robbers, knowing that they had failed, fled to the roof to escape and opened fire to resist arrest. Branch Director Zhuo rushed into the alley, pointed his gun at a robber on the roof and fired a shot. The robber fell down in shock and was injured and captured. Two fake pistols were also seized. The original loot was abandoned in the alley and was also recovered. Subsequently, the police officers conducted a strict search in the lane, and another fleeing criminal was also arrested. The gang of robbers dared to break in and rob in a busy area in broad daylight. It is heard that the police bureau will severely punish them.

### Answering Readers' Legal Questions

(1) Unilateral Divorce

Chen Rongqing asks: I am originally from Xinghua. In the winter of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, I was persuaded by a matchmaker to marry a Zhu woman in Dongtai County. Ten months after the marriage, I fled to Suzhou due to the war. I repeatedly sent letters home, but received no reply. Now I have learned from relatives and friends that the woman has remarried and destroyed our marriage certificate and proof items. May I ask how to sue according to law? Please give me an answer.

[Lawyer Fu Kuangling replies] Since there is no marriage certificate and no witness to prove it, if you file a lawsuit in court, the judgment will have no basis and you will inevitably lose the case.

(2) Husband's Abuse

Yang Xiu asks: My wife's younger sister, Lu Chaofu, is 22 years old and the same age as her married husband, Hu Deqiu. The two families exchanged children for raising since childhood. At the age of 19, they held a wedding ceremony without a witness. The couple's feelings were harmonious at first, but unexpectedly, after the death of the man's father, he did not engage in proper business, but specialized in gambling and had affairs. His mother also did not discipline him. Moreover, the man's aunt often instigated her nephew to humiliate him for various reasons. The woman's virtue is known to all in the neighborhood. Her husband not only does not listen to advice, but also uses fists and feet, often leaving her covered in bruises. Recently, he has intensified his abuse and drove the woman out, not allowing her to enter the door. The woman could not bear the abuse and complained to her parents, who went to reason with him many times, but her husband avoided seeing them. She wants to divorce her husband, but is prevented by her parents' old-fashioned teachings. I do not know what kind of procedures should be used to allow both parties to divorce? Please advise.

[Lawyer Fu Kuangling replies] If it is as stated in the letter, the man's behavior has constituted a condition for the woman to request a divorce. If the two parties cannot agree on a divorce, they can request a divorce from the court. As for the parents' obstruction, there is no legal constraint.

### A History of the Changing Fortunes of Shanghai Women's Fashion

— (Special Feature from This Newspaper)

It's already deep autumn. In the city, people are indifferent to the changing seasons, but women in the city seem particularly sensitive, as they've already shed their silk dresses and tried on new outfits. Shanghai is, after all, a big city, and women's clothing changes with each passing day, with new styles emerging constantly. Isn't it comparable to Paris and Hollywood? This year, the windows of fashion stores are filled with even more European and American wool fabrics, making the interest in tailoring new clothes particularly strong. In this season of "when the west wind blows, make winter clothes," let's talk about the "vicissitudes" of Shanghai fashion these days.

Hu Die: A cheongsam without a waistline now feels not very attractive. Just looking at the lace, there's a sense of "congestion" around the neckline.

### The Fashion Trend: A Major Change After the Opening of the Seas

The rise of fashion is only a matter of the last hundred years or so. A hundred years ago, people had the concept of "make one piece, pass it down for three generations." Often, mothers, daughters, and daughters-in-law would wear the same piece of clothing in turn, regardless of body length or size, whether it fit well, and even less about the material or style of the garment. Since one piece of clothing could be worn for so long, people didn't mind spending extra effort and using wide embroidery and dense edging to show its beauty. Fortunately, women at that time had plenty of leisure time and didn't mind spending a little more time. At the same time, during the imperial era, the attire of titled women was stipulated in law. Even ordinary clothes had considerable restrictions on materials, and styles could not deviate from their status. This was a major reason for maintaining the unchanging styles of women's clothing. After the opening of the seas, foreign materials were imported in an endless stream, dazzling people. Because of the large quantity of imports, the trend became more widespread. Before the Opium War, foreign goods were limited to feather gauze, wool, and the like. Later, there were more and more patterns, and foreign silk, satin, and cotton were much cheaper than domestic silk and satin, and foreign cloth flooded the market. With materials readily available, concepts gradually changed. There was no need to pass down a new garment for generations. Clothes came in different sizes, and the dimensions should fit better. Many time-consuming and labor-intensive edges and borders seemed too cumbersome, and sewing methods also became simpler. At the same time, the import of foreign decorations made styles change even faster. All of these factors contributed to the trend. Shanghai, due to its mix of Chinese and foreigners, took the lead and became an authority on fashion. The so-called "Beijing style" and "Suzhou style" have declined. The "Guangdong style" and "Hong Kong style" of the South can also be said to be a branch of Shanghai. In the last hundred years, Shanghai has been the headquarters for manipulating Chinese women's attire.

### The Evolution of Clothing: Trying on Foreign Clothes in Photo Studios, Bras Overthrowing Corsets

Before the cheongsam became popular, women wore two-piece outfits, also made of foreign materials, with similar styles. At this time, the real fashion was called "foreign attire," which was completely Western-style clothing. However, it was limited to children's clothing and hats. Although women occasionally wore it, it was only to dress up as a "foreign girl" in the lens of a photo studio. It was rarely seen worn on the streets. It could be seen in places like Shanghai and Hong Kong, but absolutely not in the interior. Later, the trend of studying in Japan became very popular, and Japanese clothing also captivated fashionable women. The popular clothing at the time was narrow and long, with no patterns on the skirt, and its color was dark. Matching it with a watch, oval small blue glasses, and a leather bag and silk umbrella was the most fashionable thing to do. This was introduced by students returning from Japan, indicating that she was a woman with "civilized" ideas.

At that time, the so-called fashion had little impact on daughters of wealthy families, but there were many bizarre and strange outfits in the brothels. At one time, pockets were made on both sides of the trousers, and tassels hung below the pockets. From a distance, it looked like the eyeglass case hanging from the waist of an "old scholar." The straight-front vest, which was originally a Manchu decoration, was also popular for a time after the Republic. Famous courtesans even had a small electric light attached to the collar button, with dry batteries stored in their bosom. When turned on, it emitted a radiant light, making their gaze captivating, which can be said to be beyond imagination.

Bare chests and arms were originally a Western custom. In China, even naturally developed breasts had to be bound. After clothing styles became smaller, corsets replaced the previous bellybands, tightly wrapping the chest, which hindered women's health and affected breastfeeding. However, gradually adopting Western customs, corsets were overthrown and replaced with bras.

### About the Cheongsam

The popularity of the cheongsam is only a matter of the last twenty years. It started to become popular in Shanghai and gradually flowed into the interior, and now it has become the only clothing for women. However, today's popular cheongsam is only a slight imitation of Manchu attire, and it is very different from the real Manchu cheongsam. According to a record in the "Notes on Shanghai Travels" published in the fourteenth year of the Guangxu Emperor (1888): "In a corner of Yangjingbang, people from all directions gather, and clothing colors change at any time... Women occasionally imitate Manchu attire, which feels refreshing." So, sixty years ago, Shanghai women already had Manchu attire, but it was only an occasional attempt.

The cheongsam has been popular for twenty years, and its length and sleeves have changed countless times. Sometimes it was so long that it dragged on the backs of the feet, and one had to lift the clothes up with each step. Even the young ladies who were idle all day long couldn't bear the hardship. In order to be beautiful, they had to become slaves to their clothes. Later, it gradually became shorter, and now it is almost at the knees, causing the old gentlemen and elders to shake their heads, thinking it was harmful to public morals. The length and size of the sleeves also varied. In recent years, summer clothing has been almost sleeveless, but winter clothing still has long sleeves. However, many modern women still expose their jade arms outside in the cold winter. In China, where heating is not very common, it is somewhat unbearable even indoors. Now, narrow sleeves have been changed to large sleeves, and the west wind blowing in from the cuffs makes it even more unbearable in cold weather.

A Long Vest

At one time, it was popular to add a long vest to the outside of the cheongsam. This was a variation of the Manchu vest. It is said to have been created by the movie star Li Minghui. Someone saw a letter from Li Minghui, which read: "My new clothes have already been made. A long vest and a thin gauze cheongsam. The vest is worn alone over the cheongsam, which is both fashionable and generous. This is my new invention, and no one else has worn it. Would you like to come and see it?" As a result, women imitated it, and it became a fashion trend. Later, it gradually changed its shape. Although the outside was a long vest, the one worn inside was no longer a long cheongsam but a short jacket. Some even made a line of stitching on the shoulder pads to pretend to be a long vest. And it was more tailored than a long vest, so it became one and two, two and one, and could not be restored.

Overseas Chinese Love to Wear Cheongsams

Women wearing cheongsams are not only popular in China but also spread to the United States. A letter from overseas Chinese in San Francisco said: "Currently, Chinese people everywhere use American equipment, but American women love to wear Chinese cheongsams. Chinese women should consider this an unparalleled honor." This was still the case in the 24th and 25th years of the Republic (1935-1936). It is a pity that the War of Resistance against Japan soon broke out, otherwise, it could have been used to promote the sales of domestic silk. Fashion expert Zhang Shuying said: The cheongsam has many advantages and has the same effect as Western clothing. Therefore, the spread of the cheongsam overseas is not accidental.

### Evolution of Clothing Over the Years of the Republic

What exactly is the change in women's clothing over the years? On February 23, 1936, the Guangzhou women's community held a performance of the evolution of women's clothing over the years of the Republic, which shows the general process of evolution:

Year 1 of the Republic (1912): Old-fashioned wedding dress, crane ceremonial dress, smooth hair with hairpins, jacket and skirt.

Year 2 of the Republic (1913): Saddle collar, narrow sleeves, eight-panel skirt, swallowtail hairpin.

Year 5 of the Republic (1916): Shirt and skirt ceremonial dress, smooth hair with hairpins.

### From Clothing Stores to Fashion Companies

In the past, clothing stores were the only places to sew fashionable clothes, and women were the major customers of clothing stores. The faster the changes in clothing, the busier the clothing stores became, and the more prosperous their business was. Clothing stores were distributed throughout Shanghai. According to estimates in 1940, there were 2,000 clothing stores in Shanghai, with 40,000 tailors. Including their wives and children who depended on them for a living, there were about 200,000 people in total, which was not a small number. The signs of clothing stores often included the words "Su Guang," which meant that the styles of clothes in Suzhou and Guangzhou were the most fashionable. They were also divided into Suzhou and Yangzhou groups according to locality. Usually, one or two shop assistants plus a few apprentices were enough. The number of people depended on the scope of their business. In the past few years, because of the high cost of living and few jobs, the clothing store business was very quiet. After the victory, those coming from the rear inevitably had to add some clothes, and scissors and needles were seen busy.

Women's outerwear has evolved from silk capes to woolen coats, as mentioned above, and fashion companies have risen in response. Women's coats were initially made by those who specialized in making men's Western suits, and gradually became a specialty of women's clothing. Now, there are many such fashion companies in Shanghai, especially in the Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road area, and the Xiafei Road is also a concentration area of fashion companies. There are also many on the Fourth Horse Road and Hubei Road. The first company to design, pattern, and sew for Shanghai ladies was Yunshang Fashion Company. The founders were all famous figures in Shanghai, such as the socialite Tang Ying, the famous lawyer Jiang Yiping, and the artist Jiang Xiaoyun. Tang was responsible for external publicity, and Jiang was responsible for design and patterning. But soon it was transferred to others, and now Hongxiang Company is undoubtedly the giant.

Mrs. Gu Weijun: Looking at this sketch, you probably wouldn't think that this is the internationally famous Mrs. Gu Shaochuan, would you? Do you think the neckline of her collar is a bit too big?

### Various Coats: American Yellow Wolf, Sable, A Foreign Light Coat Costs 40 Million

In the cold winter, women often added a cape made of silk. Around 1927-1928, they imitated Western women and changed to wearing coats. The trend spread gradually, and now it is extremely common, and the cape has been completely forgotten.

The initial popularity of coats was only to replace capes for warmth when going out. Later, the styles gradually became more complicated. In addition to winter coats, there were also lined coats for spring and autumn, single coats for when the weather was initially warm or newly cold, and even a white silk coat could be added on summer nights to harmonize colors and increase beauty on top of a long cheongsam. So, these coats were generally decorative items rather than items for warmth.

Fur coats are the warmth items of noble women. Gray-backed sable used to sell for a staggering price per coat. Initially, domestic products were used, transferred from the Northwest through Peiping, and then shipped to Shanghai in boxes. Later, foreign goods were gradually imported. Russian gray-backed sable, American sable, and German rabbit fur were all treasured. German rabbit fur was mostly collected in China, shipped back to Germany, modified by chemical methods, and then shipped back to China. It is said that American sable is also made from Chinese yellow wolf fur, but this year, according to people from Hongxiang Company, the highest-priced fur coat is made of American yellow wolf fur, costing 40 million yuan a piece. Is it one and two, or two and one?

Wool rope was initially used to weave underwear. I don't know who came up with the idea of wearing it on the outside as a coat, and it was actually popular for a while. But it was not as comfortable as wool, so it was not loved by noble ladies and was not very successful.

### Fashion's Moral Crime? The Lewd Thoughts of Rogues!

In April 1936, the ancient Peiping and Guangzhou, which was the earliest to be contaminated with Western customs, successively implemented bans on strange and exotic clothing to rectify public morals. Strange and exotic clothing encountered unprecedented misfortune. So-called strange clothing and fashion are inherently different. Fashion has been popular for a while, so naturally there is no so-called "strange." However, the strange clothing banned by the authorities was one and the same with fashion. As a result, fashionable women had to hide in their boudoirs and temporarily live the life of a young lady in the eighteenth century.

Is fashion a moral crime? This is very difficult to explain. According to the Guangdong provincial authorities: "Whether the folk customs are simple and pure is closely related to clothing. As the ancients said, protecting treasures teaches theft, and dressing up teaches licentiousness. The clothing of women, although not taking the wide robes and large sleeves of the past as beautiful, does not take the strange shapes of bare chests and arms today as fashionable. Therefore, there is a ban on strange and exotic clothing." What they call strange and exotic clothing actually refers to summer clothing, "Light gauze and silk, muscles are visible, needless to say, and women seek coolness, sleeves do not reach the elbows, collars do not reach the chest, and below the elbows and above the chest are openly exposed."

From May 5th, the Guangdong provincial authorities had female training officers from the Public Security Bureau conduct guidance in the streets and had moral discipline patrol teams inspect clothing. Anyone wearing clothing that violated the standards was immediately corrected. Those who did not comply had a bowl-sized blue stamp placed on their clothes. As a result, fashionable women suddenly disappeared. But at that time, licentious men took the opportunity to make fun of fashionable women, and a "squeezing women" trend occurred in the market. Women in Guangdong Province were deeply dissatisfied with the authorities' measures, considering them an insult, and jointly requested their cancellation. They also expressed opposition to the established standard clothing. At this point, the authorities realized that they had acted too hastily, and the ban gradually relaxed and was finally abolished in an imperceptible manner. At the same time, during the execution of the inspection, those sitting in cars sped by, and the inspectors were actually unable to exercise their powers.

In addition to Peiping and Guangzhou, the banning of strange and exotic clothing has also been implemented in inland cities. Shanghai is worthy of being the fashion center, and the authorities did not ban it. It is difficult to determine to what extent fashion has to be strange to hinder public morals. For example, what Guangzhou banned was bare chests and arms, but in recent years, the summer cheongsams of women not only do not reach the elbows but are shoulder-length, not to mention bare feet, and the toes are painted with nail polish. Then, is hindering public morals going to be further advanced? But compared to Western women, it is still backward. So, this is a question of openness or non-openness. As for the so-called public morals, it is just rogues indulging in lewd thoughts.

### Choosing New Clothes: Pay Attention to Four Key Points: Inappropriate Colors Can Turn You into an Old Hag

A fashion style, once worn, will quickly spread and soon become popular. Blindly following fashion is a common mistake made by women in the city. They think that everything new is good, without asking whether the style is suitable for their age or whether the patterns match their status. Wearing new clothes is actually an eyesore.

How do you choose clothes? In the past, Mrs. He Jing'an of Zhejiang University proposed four key points to consider when tailoring clothes. First, it must be based on the wearer's attitude, that is, it must show their identity after wearing it. It can be divided into the noble school, the sports school, the spoiled school, the mother school, the comedy school, the mysterious school, and the fun school, and so on. Second, the clothes should fit the body. The length and size of each part of the body are different for each person. When tailoring, you must examine the beauty and ugliness of each part of the wearer's body to make the beautiful points more obvious and the ugly points hidden. Third, consider the wearer's occupation. In the past, the clothes of noble women and prostitutes were the most novel, but there was still a clear distinction between them. Later, they began to blur the lines, and this point should be paid the most attention. Fourth is the age of the wearer. Younger people should wear bright colors, and older people should wear solemn colors. If a woman with wrinkled skin and white hair wears delicate clothes, won't she become an "old hag"? On the other hand, if a young person wears the clothes of an older person, it will reduce their charm. Even young people and middle-aged people are different, and the situation is even more different before and after marriage.

The color and pattern of the clothes should be based on psychology. People with tall figures look even taller when they wear clothes with vertical stripes, and short people look even shorter when they wear clothes with horizontal stripes. Stripes can cause a visual illusion. Solid-colored clothes are suitable for petite people but not suitable for fat people. Fat people wearing solid-colored clothes will only make them look fatter. Because simple colors always show a shadow next to them. Colors are divided into light and dark. Light colors are more delicate and are worn by young people. The higher the age, the darker the color should be.

Where are the Winter Clothes?

Noble women are planning the styles of their new clothes this year. Stores are already lined with various silks and wool fabrics. Even though a suit costs millions or tens of millions, there will be no one who doesn't ask. But ordinary citizens find it quite difficult to deal with cloth costing thousands of yuan per foot and clothes costing tens of thousands of yuan a suit. In today's soaring prices, it is difficult to maintain even the lowest standard of living. The meager income of a month is not even enough to buy firewood and rice, so how can they talk about adding new clothes? So, new clothes are prepared for the rich, and let them decorate the prosperous city.

### Port Restrictions on Hardware Exports to Guangzhou Cause Vehicle Prices to Soar
[Guangzhou Shipping News] The Hong Kong government's restrictions on hardware exports have recently become even stricter. Hardware and metal equipment in this city, such as automobile parts and bicycle (i.e., pedal bike) parts, are extremely expensive. According to Hong Kong travelers, bicycles in Hong Kong are not expensive. Brands like "Customer Road Brand" and "Zili Pu Brand" bicycles are worth less than 200 Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to about 140,000 in national currency. Currently, in this city, they are worth more than 400,000.

### Production Loans Tightened, Industrial, Mining, Agricultural, and Salt Loans Continue as Usual
The Four Allied Branches recently announced a sudden tightening of general loans, leading to some criticism. According to the authorities in charge, loans for necessary industrial, mining, and transportation production projects will continue to be handled as ordered. Agricultural and salt loans already in progress are also being handled as usual because banking operations have been established. However, production loans for other departments will be tightened across the board, following the instructions of the head office.

### The Current Situation of the Hongye Brick and Tile Factory in the Capital
By Feng Ku
The construction industry in our country made rapid progress before the war. Among the materials needed, besides cement, steel, and wood panels, bricks and tiles were the main items. In the past, enthusiastic industrialists purchased mountain land in the suburbs of the capital, outside Zhonghua Gate and Heping Gate, and used the mountain soil to organize brick and tile factories, or small-scale brick kilns, numbering several dozen.

When the Japanese invaders occupied the capital in the winter of 1937, they established a blockade line north of the railway outside Heping Gate and stationed troops in the major kilns, causing these kilns to close down one after another, resulting in heavy losses. Now that victory has been achieved for a year, both public and private buildings in the capital have been destroyed, making it difficult to rebuild. The sales of bricks and tiles are sluggish, and the fuel (coal) needed for the kilns cannot be supplied in a timely manner. Currently, the smaller kilns remain closed. The larger ones are struggling to recover. Apart from the Jinghua factory outside Zhonghua Gate, the Yihe Dong factory outside Heping Gate, and the Tianjin Three Kilns, which require separate investigation for further details, the current situation of the Hongye Brick and Tile Factory in Huangjiawei outside Heping Gate is briefly described as follows.

Founding Figures The Hongye Brick and Tile Factory was initiated and organized by General Gu Mosan and others around 1933 and 1934. Many investors were military and political figures. If the war had not occurred and the Japanese invaders had not destroyed it, the development over the past nine years would have been considerable.

Kiln Structure The factory site is located on a mountain slope northeast of Heping Gate (named Huangjiawei). From a distance, it looks very grand, with a chimney as high as 800 feet, standing straight into the sky. The internal structure is modeled after German kiln factories. Inside are 34 doors, each with a small hole (covered with a coin) for adding coal. The entire kiln is heated by fire dragons. The smoke passes through the fire dragons and exits through the chimney. The green bricks and tiles are placed inside the kiln door, which is sealed with mud to prevent ventilation. They must undergo a very high temperature for a certain period before being taken out as finished bricks and tiles.

Convenient Railway The factory previously used a single-track railway about three miles long for transporting raw and finished bricks and tiles in and out of the factory. Manual transportation would have been very inconvenient. The railway ran north to the factory and south to the vicinity of the Jinghu Railway. Dozens of sheds were built on the left side of the road for workers to manufacture brick blanks.

Machine Theft The raw materials for the factory's bricks and tiles were local soil, which was very sticky. They used to be manufactured with German machinery, which could produce about 40,000 brick blanks and about 60,000 tile blanks per day. Before the Japanese invaders surrendered last year, they secretly stole and sold all the machinery, resulting in incalculable losses. When the factory resumed operations in April this year, they tried to track down the machinery, but to no avail. They have now resorted to the old method of hiring workers to manufacture brick blanks by hand, but they cannot manufacture foreign-style tile blanks.

Demolished Houses The factory had over a hundred rooms for manufacturing brick blanks on the left side of the railway south of the factory. After the Japanese invaders moved in, they demolished over seventy rooms. The office buildings and workers' dormitories on the right side of the railway, facing south and east, looked intact from the outside, but upon closer inspection, all the partition walls had been altered and repaired. The doors and windows, and glass, had been completely demolished.

Current Work Status The workers are divided into three groups: blank making, firing, and transportation, totaling over two hundred people. Each group has an assistant to manage the workers. Most workers are paid in goods. Blank-making workers who make about 2,000 brick blanks per day are paid about 150,000 yuan per month. Transportation workers are paid about 200,000 yuan per day. Other workers, such as those who tend the fires, are paid daily and work in two shifts, day and night. Nine-tenths of the workers come from various counties in northern Anhui. This year, they suffered from both floods and locust plagues, and the spring harvest was poor, making it impossible to make a living. About twenty people come from Taixian and Huaian counties in northern Jiangsu.

Current Profits The cost of producing 10,000 finished bricks is about 500,000 yuan, and they are sold for over 1.2 million yuan, with a profit of more than double the cost. Unfortunately, the construction industry is still in a slump. So far, the capital has not been able to launch large-scale projects. Otherwise, the development of the kilns would be difficult to predict.

### President Wu Youxun of Central University May Rescind His Resignation
### Likely to be Succeeded by Jiang Tingfu
[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Central University is scheduled to start classes on November 1st, with classes for the third and fourth grades. It must be in the latter half of the month. Freshmen will start classes as late as December. President Wu Youxun is currently on leave, and his resignation may be rescinded; it is said that he will be succeeded by Jiang Tingfu.

### Statistics on Guangdong University Students Show Law Students Account for the Largest Number
[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 6th] According to recent statistics, there are 10,894 students in Guangdong Province's four universities and five colleges. Among them, law students account for the largest number, with 3,746 people. Next is literature, followed by commerce, engineering, science, and agriculture. Medicine has the fewest students, with only 500 people.

### Entrance Examinations for Returning Students from Six Universities in Sichuan to be Held Before the 15th
[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] More than twenty representatives of returning students from six universities in the rear, including Sichuan University, Chongqing University, Yunnan University, Guizhou University, Guiyang College, and the Medical College, petitioned the Ministry of Education regarding transfer requests. The Ministry of Education has ordered universities in the Nanjing area to hold a special transfer examination. Previously, Central University, Jinling University, and the Social Education School held a meeting to establish a joint enrollment agency. The student representatives from the six universities recently went to the Ministry of Education to request five points: (1) Expedite the examination, (2) Please exempt the entrance examination for freshmen (except for the transfer examination, exempt the so-called entrance examination for freshmen, because the entrance examination for freshmen also requires testing various courses from high school graduation). (3) Please conduct a screening process, not a freshmen examination process. (4) If they fail the examination, please order the schools to allow them to attend as auditors. (5) If they cannot be admitted, please have the Ministry of Education issue travel expenses to return to their original schools to continue their studies. The Ministry of Education replied yesterday (the 5th) that regarding the expedited examination, President Tang of Central University has reported to the Ministry of Education that the transfer examination for returning students from the six universities in the rear will be held before the 15th of this month. The remaining issues, and the issues related to point (2), are because Central University, Jinling University, and other universities still hold freshmen entrance examinations in addition to transfer examinations for transfer students. Although Vice Minister Hang expressed leniency, each school has firmly established rules that cannot be broken, and the Ministry of Education is not in a position to forcibly change the established rules. This matter is difficult to meet the students' requests. As for the auditing issue, because schools have canceled this system after the war, it is also feared to be difficult to handle.

### A Contest of Endurance and Stamina
### Qunsheng Defeats Hualian by Six Points
### 47-41 Tense Situation in the First Half, Only One Point Difference
### Qunsheng Wins Nine Out of Nine Games in the Second Half
[Our Dispatch] The Qunsheng basketball team continues to maintain its winning record with nine wins out of nine games. Last night, in an extremely tense situation, they defeated the local champion Hualian team again. The result was 47 to 41, with Qunsheng winning by only six points. In the first half, Qunsheng led by only one point with 23 to 22, which shows how fierce and tense the competition was. The enthusiasm of the audience last night remained undiminished. The gymnasium was packed, with more than 5,000 people. People started lining up to buy tickets as early as 2:00 p.m., and the gymnasium was full by 5:00 p.m. To promote sports, the China Electric Power Second Factory was specially invited to send personnel to the factory to film newsreels, which added a lot of color to the competition. The fans could not be turned on due to power issues.

### Awarding Ceremony Held
Before the match, Hualian presented a banner as a memorial. During the break, Qian Dajun, chairman of the Municipal Sports Association, presented a golden statue on behalf of the Basketball Committee, which was received by the captain of the Qunsheng team. The local sports reporters' association also held a flag presentation ceremony yesterday, with Qunsheng and Hualian each presenting a banner to commemorate the occasion. Qian Dajun, chairman of the Sports Association, was also invited to present the banners.

### Zhenzhong Performs Excellently
Although Hualian lost last night, their performance was much improved compared to before, especially Li Zhenzhong, who was outstanding. He directed the offense skillfully and had very accurate long-range shots, scoring the most points. Unfortunately, his stamina was insufficient. Wu Chengzhang was young and strong, and individually he was no less skilled than the Qunsheng players. In the first quarter, Hualian led by one point with 8 to 6. In the second quarter, the score fluctuated, and they were close to each other by one point. Hualian failed to maintain this situation in the second half, which was a pity. Qunsheng, on the other hand, was slightly flustered due to the tension in the first half, and their play was disjointed. They gradually gained momentum in the second half, and the fourth quarter was smooth sailing. Their skilled passing and offensive performance earned cheers and applause from the audience.

### Hualian Suddenly Takes the Lead
The match last night was played in four quarters, with Wang Shoufang and Hong Lu serving as referees. The visiting team still used the five-tiger lineup of Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, Chen Jinzhi, Chen Jinde, and Yang Renhui. Hualian sent out Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Wu Chengzhang, Bao Songyuan, and Kong Guangyi. As soon as the whistle blew, the battle began. Zhenzhong's first shot bounced off, and Qunsheng also had no chance to score. After a long scramble, Jinzhi dribbled and shot, but Akong fouled him. Jinde scored on two free throws, opening the scoring. Then Chengzhang followed up under the basket, tying the score at two each. Jinde scored again, and Wenzhang jumped up and shot. With the score at five to two, Hualian called a timeout. As expected, Wenhua fouled, and Zhenzhong made two free throws. Jinde made a free throw, and Zhenzhong scored a clean shot, tying the score at six each. Qunsheng called a timeout, Zhenzhong scored again, and the first quarter ended, with Hualian taking a one-point lead at eight to six.

### Score Fluctuates Wildly
After a short break, the game resumed, and Jinde scored first with an open shot, tying the score again at eight each. The situation fell into fierce fighting, and the score fluctuated wildly. Hualian led with 13 to 10. At this point, Zhenzhong left the field and was replaced by Liangxiong. The lineup loosened, and Wenzhang, Renhui, and Wenhua scored three consecutive points, suddenly taking a lead of 16 to 10. Hualian had no choice but to call a timeout. As expected, it was effective. Adi and Liangxiong each made wonderful shots, and Wenhua and Jinde also had clever moves, each showing their talents. At the end of the first half, Qunsheng led by only one point with 23 to 22.

### Hualian Overtakes Again
After the break, Qunsheng still used the old lineup, while Hualian rested Xuechong, and Zhenzhong returned to the field. Renhui and Chengzhang both fouled twice, each scoring one point. Akong and Jinde followed suit, also scoring one point each. Zhenzhong then scored a long-range shot, and Hualian took a one-point lead with 25 to 24. At this point, Qunsheng gave a loud shout. With their stamina being sufficient, Hualian gradually became weaker in terms of strength, and with bad luck, Qunsheng quickly scored to make it 36 to 26. Hualian was defeated during this period. One minute before the end of the third quarter, Zhang Yuyi

### Qunsheng Quickly and Steadily
In the final quarter, Hualian used all their remaining strength to launch a full-scale counterattack. Qunsheng combined speed and stability. There were many fouls in the last three minutes, but Qunsheng won the ball and gave up shooting. Hualian also sacrificed one point and made a long-range shot. Amidst the repeated graduation cheers of Akong and Wen Hua, Li Zhenzhong scored a long-range shot. The bell rang repeatedly, and the scoreboard showed 47 to 41, with Qunsheng defeating Hualian by six points.

### Glorious Achievements in the Southwest Campaign
### The Conquering Basketball Team Arrives in Luzhou
### To Make Their Debut Before the Double Tenth Festival
The Sixth Regiment of the Army Transportation Corps Conquering Basketball Team, a group of ten people, led by Lieutenant Colonel Wu Zhuoming, the team leader, left Beijing by car at 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday and arrived in Luzhou at about 4:00 p.m. They immediately checked into Room 102 of the Xiang Sheng Hotel. The team departed from Luoyang on the 13th of last month. They stayed briefly in Dengzhou and competed once with Dengzhou. They then went to Hankou, where they played four games and won all of them. On the 2nd, they left Hankou by the Lingyun and arrived in the capital at about 8:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. They will stay in Luzhou for two weeks. Team leader Wu met with Qian Xucang, chairman of the local Basketball Committee, yesterday to discuss plans to make their debut on the 9th (Wednesday), first playing against the Lianghua team and guiding Sheng to return to Luzhou for a match, but this still awaits a final decision by the Basketball Committee.

The Conquering Team, after returning from India in victory, was first invited by various circles in Luoyang to have friendly matches with teams from South China Province and Xunguo, laying the foundation for victory. Then, they were transferred to the Northwest with the country, passing through Chongqing, and were warmly welcomed by countless audiences. They fought continuously with more than ten teams, including Central University, the Central Political School, Central Cadre, Qixiong, Hanyu, Lianghua, the Fourth Motor Battalion, Tianjian, and Chongqing University, and won every time. They were not arrogant or impetuous. Although they only had seven brave generals, they were tall and strong, lived a regular life, and were willing to endure hardship. When they arrived at Baoji, they participated in the Thirteenth and Twenty-ninth Youth Day Championship Basketball Tournament and were invincible. When Xi'an heard the news, they invited them to participate in the basketball game to raise funds for the Sports Association, and performed with teams such as the Military Headquarters, Business School, Shishou, Xiyou, Xijing, Shiyou, and Lions, winning all fourteen games. They departed from Luoyang on September 13th to visit Luzhou, passing through Zhengzhou and having a small match with Zheng Lian. After arriving in Hankou, they played four games against Wanxing, Youlian, the Air Force Headquarters, and the Wuhan United Team, all achieving brilliant results.

### Performance Items for Youth Sports Activities Determined
The Shanghai Youth Hall is scheduled to open on the Double Tenth Festival and to hold the first Youth Sports Activities Performance on that day. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., a group meeting was convened at the hall and decided on several major cases as follows: The performance time is scheduled from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on the Double Tenth Festival.

### Table Tennis League Concludes
### General Championship Won by Huxing
The inaugural Shanghai Table Tennis Tournament held its final at 6:00 p.m. the day before yesterday in the basketball room of the Municipal Gymnasium. More than 3,000 spectators attended, and the enthusiasm was high, a rare spectacle for a table tennis tournament. Chen Linsheng, Chen Jimao, Li Longbiao, and Hu Jiankun served as referees for the two matches. In the first match, Huxing Jingwu met. Wang Youxin, Fu Qifang, and Lu Hanjun of Huxing were like fierce tigers, unstoppable. Jingwu lost five consecutive matches and was completely defeated. After Huxing defeated Jingwu, they then fought Guangdong to win the championship. Guangdong relied on their main player Ouyang Wei to defeat Li Zongshi, the all-around player from Huxing. However, the team members were not as good as Huxing's average. After that, all four groups failed, and Huxing ended with a score of 6-4, winning the overall championship of this league.

### Atlantic City: A Surge of People
### The Annual Selection of the Queen
[New York Shipping News, September 20th, Our Newspaper] By Mao Shuqing, Special Correspondent in the United States
Just two weeks after the Shanghai Miss Election, Atlantic City in the United States, with its beautiful scenery, is experiencing its annual frenzy season, the election of the "Miss America" for 1946.

People flooded into this seaside summer resort like a tide. It was already shortly before the Mid-Autumn Festival, but in the United States, they still call it "Midsummer." The American summer ends on September 20th. Their calendar is based on the crystallization of experience accumulated by many Chinese people, isn't it? On the day the Queen's election was announced, the sun was still shining like fire on the blue sea.

The election lasts for a week. Before the scheduled election date, the "Queens" of each state and special city arrive in Atlantic City one after another. For more than twenty years, the annual Queen's election has been held in Atlantic City. It is said that several capitalists who initiated the "beauty contest" love the scenery of this small city, so they decided on the good fortune of this "sacred place". This was my first time going to Atlantic City from New York. I can't say that the small city is "unlovable". It is quiet, elegant, with hundreds of summer resorts, upscale theaters, and entertainment facilities, as well as a natural blue sea. Someone once proposed to set up the new agency of the United Nations in Atlantic City. Later, they felt that it was not as convenient as New York, so it was shelved.

### Participation in the Election is Limited to Female Students
I didn't arrive in Atlantic City until the day before the announcement and it took a lot of effort to find a hotel. I didn't see the beauty pageant parade of the "Misses". It is said that this year's was more exciting than in previous years. Their procession crossed the streets of Atlantic City, and the audience surged in like crazy. Those who liked to "judge" began to predict: Chicago's girl is too small, Illinois' girl is too weak, Tennessee's girl is too tall... Like gamblers who bought lottery tickets, everyone had a draft in their minds. No one in the audience didn't expect their inner lottery ticket to win.

Old men and old women also crowded to watch the excitement. They put on their "old-fashioned glasses" and couldn't help but sigh: "They are all top-notch good girls, all beautiful!"

That's right, none of the fifty contestants were not beautiful. If they weren't beautiful, they wouldn't be elected as representatives of each state and special city. The strictness of the preliminary elections in each state is no less than the national final election. According to the election law, only American female students who are studying are allowed to participate in the Miss America election. Before the preliminary election, female students in each city and town who think they meet the standards of "beauty" voluntarily sign up. There are hundreds of people who sign up for the preliminary elections in each state. Then, the first step is a medical examination. Misses with lung diseases, like Lin Daiyu who "spit green phlegm", will be eliminated in the medical examination, no matter how beautiful they are. The second step is to look at the height and width, and whether the numbers of obesity and weight are symmetrical. Those whose body is too long and thin and exceeds the limit of "slim", or whose body is short and fat and exceeds the limit of "full", will be eliminated in the second step. The third step is to look at the appearance and skin. After the preliminary election and re-election by aesthetic experts and physical examination doctors, most of them have been eliminated.

### Eleven Misses Participate in the Final
### Showcasing Their Skills on Stage
I went to Washington in mid-August. Mr. Lin Qizhi, the secretary of the embassy, ​​invited me to see a movie. Inadvertently, I happened to encounter the final election in Washington, D.C. There were eleven Misses in the final election. Each of them showed off their "formal dress", "casual dress", and walking posture on stage. The so-called formal dress is wearing a long-sleeved dress, like an ancient Chinese beauty. The so-called casual dress is showing the thighs and bust, showing the so-called "curves" of American women. Then, everyone does some entertainment, singing, dancing, or playing the piano. See the extent of the crowd's applause, which one do they like? There are nine judges, four of whom are local news reporters, one music expert, one aesthetic expert, and two others who are probably "celebrities" in Washington, D.C.

In the preliminary and final elections in Washington, the judges almost completely followed the extent of the crowd's applause. That day, Miss Jennie Carlson wore a black gauze dress, a farmer's hat, and sang a very "naughty" song: "Do it, just let it be!" She grabbed the edge of the hat with both hands, stretching her head, which was very lovable. At least, in the eyes of Americans, they loved her very much. As a

On Bureaucracy  Shao Fu
Jiang Tingfu's departure from the position of Director-General of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) has sparked much discussion. The promotion, transfer, and appointment of personnel by the administrative authorities are subject to their own considerations, and we do not wish to comment on them. However, the fact that a group of his senior cadres in the CNRRA resigned one after another after his departure demonstrates that we are still some distance from the rule of law, due to the feudalistic idea of "a new dynasty with each new emperor" in human governance.

Let us imagine, can the CNRRA still function as an organization with the departure of such a long list of senior officials, from deputy director-general, directors of various departments, chief secretary, director of personnel, secretaries to executive officers? What can it accomplish? We dare not say this is sabotage, but we believe it will at least affect the progress of the CNRRA's work. Because, even if the newly appointed Director-General brings a large number of so-called core members, it is unknown how long it will take to become familiar with the actual situation of each department's work. Relief work prioritizes time, so who suffers from this wasted time? And who should be responsible?

If Mr. Huo Binshu were to take office with only a single horse and a bedroll, like Mr. Gu Chunfan, the Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, wouldn't he be at a loss?

If cliquism centered on individuals, as well as the concepts of "cadres" and "core members," are not eradicated, we dare to assert that China's political future will not be able to make great progress.

Random Thoughts, Shouting for the Unsung Heroes  Shengjie
Although I am not a hero who has been on the battlefield for a long time, I am indeed a soldier who has traveled across half of China. For eight years, I have lived a military life. I have also been praised by millions of people and have received many glorious titles. However, things are different now, and many things are heartbreaking! Therefore, I have left the army and returned to school.

I think victory should not dilute the bloody memories of the past eight years. "Demobilization" should not completely forget the vanguards who were once praised by everyone! Even if the early end of the war was due to the atomic bomb, does the atomic bomb completely erase the flesh and blood of the "soldiers"?

In the short year since the victory, the fate of the "soldiers" has been like stray dogs on the street, ignored and scolded. Since the downsizing and reorganization of the army, a large number of officers have lost their jobs and have no way to make a living. Consequently, those who once fought on the battlefield are now begging on the streets. In Changzhou, some major and captain-level officers even put their commissions and medals on the road, asking passers-by for money. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, there has been no greater injustice than this!

Later, relief measures came, and the Officers' Corps was established. It was willing to accommodate demobilized officers, but the registration procedures were not only troublesome, but the review was even more strict! Often, many officers use the "severance pay for those laid off" to maintain their hotel living, but the efficiency of the registration work is too poor. As a result, these "soldiers" wait until they can no longer afford the hotel expenses, and the review has not yet been completed. Therefore, suicides and deviant behaviors are often heard of. The public is very vague about these inside stories. All they see is that soldiers refuse to buy tickets on buses, and all they emphasize is that soldiers refuse to buy tickets for movies. But you also think about it: why are they like this? After fighting for eight years, they are left with nothing. Watching a free show is certainly "illegal," but if we think about it, we shouldn't attack them too much!

As for the honored veterans, they are also equally miserable! A letter about honored veterans begging was published in "Free Talk" the other day. Everyone should be moved after reading it. They lost their legs and arms fighting against the enemies of the country, but because times have changed, no one pays attention to them anymore. Does this era, does this society, have no rationality left at all?

Speaking of the treatment of soldiers, a general gets 250,000, which is not even as much as a worker in a bank. At the very least, officers only get 40,000 or 50,000. Soldiers are even more pitiful, with squad leaders getting no more than 10,000 or 20,000, and privates getting less than 10,000. How will they live, how will they survive? We really can't bear to describe it any further!

Even if the senior officers and generals are comfortable, countless soldiers are still supporting the War of Resistance. Their names are not seen in the newspapers, and their names are not seen on the medal lists. They are the unsung heroes who directly contributed to the War of Resistance. Those who sacrificed are gone, and those who are alive receive only coldness and contempt. There is such injustice in the world, it is really speechless!

I am not shouting for soldiers because I was once a soldier myself, but because I am a Chinese and I feel threatened, I dare not remain silent; I want the government to come up with a solution! I want the public to look at us with "serious" eyes!

Corruption, Get Out of Schools  Yu
During the summer vacation, I attended summer classes at school. More than 30 of my classmates were graduating students from a famous private university in the city. One night, I learned a secret:

These out-of-town students came to study through the arrangements of a student surnamed Fan from the Department of Political Science. The school stipulated that each person pay 30,000 for each subject, but this student was not polite and added 10,000. For more than 30 people, two subjects each, he easily pocketed 600,000 or 700,000. Coincidentally, one student paid late, and this matter was exposed. However, there was an even stranger thing later. I personally saw a student come to the school to inquire, but the accountant in charge refused to answer immediately and instead went to discuss it with that student. Because I was not in that school, I did not hear the outcome, but it can be seen that the incident did not escalate. I have to admire his ability to control the situation. This is one thing.

This semester has already started. At the end of September, the dormitory elected a dorm head. There were six candidates in total. The dorm head reported to the school that he was elected with five votes. But I clearly know that among the six people, one abstained and one was out and did not participate, and the elected candidate did not vote for himself. Where did the five votes come from? I announced it to the students, but everyone was unwilling to speak out because of "friendship." This is another thing.

Are these two things trivial? From this, can I see that the darkness of China's future is just beginning? Will this student from the Department of Political Science not engage in corruption when he enters the political arena? Will this student who did not pursue the matter because of "friendship" not engage in corruption? I am really surprised that these students usually scold corruption and those who protect corrupt officials, but they cannot see the facts in front of them, or they see them but do not care. I would like to ask: educators who run schools, are these trivial matters worth paying attention to?

Schools are ideal institutions and should not be so dirty! We can't help but shout: corruption, get out of schools!

Movie Theater Owners, We Appeal to You  Li Wei
We are the "early to rise and late to bed" working class, we are civil servants, office workers, students...

We have to work during the day, and after a day's fatigue and a week's hard work, we hope to get some "enjoyment" and "spiritual comfort"; therefore, we "patronize" your "treasure shop."

"Every night show and weekly holiday, the ticket price is 3,000, 3,500, 4,000." Why increase the price? Three thousand yuan can pay for two days of meals. How can "poor scholars" dare to "indulge"? And the time is 9:15, and the show ends at least 10:45. When we get home, there are no trams, and we have already paid a considerable sum to you, and we have no money to take a rickshaw.

Therefore, we appeal to you:

1.  Increase the proportion of ticket prices a little. Sell the best seats for more money. The rich don't care about spending 10,000 yuan, but the poor have to think about spending 1,000 yuan. Averaging this proportion will not be more disadvantageous to you than it is now. It will still be full.

2.  Start the show earlier! Open and close the late show earlier. Your "staff" can also "rest" earlier, and we can also have a "ride" and save on rickshaw fare, so we can "patronize" one more time!

Movie theater owners: do the math!

American Style  Liang
American ethics and China have obvious differences. Even based on their usual calling habits, one can gain a deep understanding.

If you go to America for the first time, you must understand how they like to be addressed. At first, of course, you can use titles like "Mr.," "Dr.," "Mrs.," "Miss." But if you see them often, you should no longer use these titles. Even if you are addressing their "wife" or "lover," you can just use their first name. Otherwise, you are deliberately distancing yourself from them.

Americans often use a part of their first name to address others, to show intimacy. For example, Johnson is called Jon, Robert is called Rob, William is called Bill.

The strangest thing is that students can directly call their teachers by their first names, and children can call their fathers by nicknames. Therefore, President Roosevelt's letters to his subordinates used "Dear X" to indicate that he was very formal.

Their personalities are full of vitality and freedom, which is different from our country in terms of content. However, this only applies to America in its youth. If you treat England, France, etc. as America, that would be terrible!

The Tiger of Eastern Zhejiang, Tian Xiushan  Mishan
A hero stumbled and became a prisoner.

Flipping through the Shen Bao of the 1st of this month, I saw the news of "The Bandit Tian Xiushan. Hangzhou Trial," which made me recall "Tian Huizi," who was once prominent in Shanghai. People in the Songjiang and Qingpu areas are no strangers to the name "Tian Huizi," and they also have a good impression of him. When the enemy occupied Jiangnan, Tian Huizi led thousands of brothers to launch guerrilla warfare in the Songjiang and Qingpu areas. Of course, general guerrillas inevitably "demand from the people" in the local area, but Tian Huizi's troops were different from other troops that "wandered without fighting." After all, they fought quite a few battles and established some meritorious services. They could be considered "taking from the people and using it for the people." The common people were quite afraid of "Tian Huizi's" reputation, and also quite respectful. Since he was later transferred to eastern Zhejiang, there has been no news of him for a long time, and people still occasionally mention: "I wonder how Tian Huizi is now"?

The news in the newspaper gave them the answer: "Tian Huizi" became a robber and has been arrested by the authorities. The "anti-Japanese hero" in the minds of the people of Songjiang and Qingpu has now become the "heinous" "Tiger of Eastern Zhejiang"! And 5,000 people in eastern Zhejiang knelt down and begged the authorities to execute Tian Xiushan!

In fact, based on the merits he established during the War of Resistance, he would not have to worry about his future after the victory. However, he did not do a good job and actually led his brothers to rob and rape. Today, he is reaping the consequences!

Odds and Ends  W.W.
Many people have this question: who is raising prices?

Many people have this dream: kill all the petty crooks!

However, time flies, and it's been more than a year, the question is still a "?", the dream is still a "dream"!

"Ten-yuan notes" and "five-yuan notes" cried to each other; after a while, they said: "We are old, useless."

Hundred-yuan and thousand-yuan notes are not like before, and they also sighed: "Born in sorrow, died in -- still in sorrow! Like gold, only Citi gauze is rising step by step..."

They were all dejected, with a thin face, and the "rumor" of US dollars came, how many notes "fell"!

It's almost the fifteenth of the month again, but I don't see any silver ingots calling.

They want to awaken the masses to worship Buddha together, but Buddhism is boundless, why need mere paper objects? Paper drunk with gold, only seen in the human world; what crime should be committed for bribing Buddha? Only when someone buys in can someone sell out, but this is a meaningless act, wasting idle funds, harming oneself and others, it can be stopped!

Overseas Tidbits, Inside the White House  Yu Qiang
The White House is not just an office building, it is a symbol of American unity.

In 1792, the White House was completed based on the draft by James Hoban. President Washington left office too early, and the first person to spend his presidential life in the White House was the second president of the United States, John Adams.

Now, open the doors of the White House and tell you about some of the rooms with special historical significance.

The Monroe Room
The Monroe Room is a monument to another era. When Mrs. Herbert Hoover was the First Lady, she moved the original furniture to the Monroe Museum in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and replicated the beautiful set that is now on display. Here, President McKinley signed a joyful national peace treaty, ending the brutal Spanish-American War.

In the daily life of the President of the United States, the Monroe Room has long served as a clear boundary between the trivial household chores on the second floor and the busy state affairs on the lower floor. Today, it is President Truman's living room, but it is eternally dedicated to James Monroe.

The Green Room
On May 17, 1910, the US Congress passed a bill establishing the National Commission of Fine Arts to review all changes to the White House. Before that, the character of this informal reception room changed at any time with the interests of each owner.

President Jefferson dined here, enjoying delicacies and chatting with close friends. During the reign of James Monroe, gold nuggets clinked and banknotes rustled on the indoor card tables. Later, the scholarly John Quincy Adams "entered the palace," and the Green Room became a quiet reception room, with white embossed curtains, a mahogany desk, and a beautiful Brussels carpet. When President Cleveland took office, the Green Room was not quiet again, and it became a music room.

The Blue Room
It is generally believed that the Blue Room is the most beautiful room in the White House. In the 1880s, when the United States was prospering and changing, that unstable situation was reflected in the history of the Blue Room. Initially, it was called the oval drawing room, and soon became the oval reception room, the circular room, and the blue oval salon. Today it is the official reception room of the country.

The Blue Room has a romantic history: Cleveland, the only president to be married in the White House, read his marriage vows to Frances Folsom in this flower-filled room. In the same room, the democratic President Jefferson could not stand the etiquette of bowing to guests, so he broke the tradition of Washington and Adams and went forward to shake hands with them, regardless of whether they were politicians or commoners.

The East Room
For more than a century, American presidents have held their most important social gatherings in the magnificent East Room. In 1800, the East Room was still an unfinished new house, and Mrs. John Adams, the President's wife, used to dry clothes here.

When the large mirrors in the East Room were covered and the walls and sconces were covered with black gauze, those were two unforgettable days: sad people lined up in solemn rows to look for the last time at Lincoln's painful face and Franklin Roosevelt's weary face.

This year's Miss California (standing at the highest point)

Joke  Sha Zhou
A Chinese person giving a speech in Chinese said, "I have two bi fang (that is, metaphors), one bi fang is in China, one bi fang is in a foreign country." The Chinese audience all understood it as "I have two farts, one fart is in China, one fart is in a foreign country," and they all covered their noses.

A foreigner lived in China for more than ten years and regarded China as his second hometown. He often said to Chinese people, "Don't treat me like a foreigner, treat me like a family member," meaning treat him like a Chinese person.

In a certain university entrance examination, the physiology question was "The function of the kidney." A certain student could not think of the answer after much deliberation, so he answered, "The function of the kidney is great! The most obvious function is that it can be used to stir-fry kidney flowers." It turned out that this student usually loved to eat stir-fried kidney flowers, but he knew nothing about the real function.

Humor  Wang Wu
"Punish corruption!" "Investigate him!" Everyone is saying.

Yes, everyone is saying it, and the corrupt officials themselves are also saying it, and they are passionate and full of fallacies, which are as clear as the sun and moon!

"Beware of pickpockets!" "Catch the pickpocket!" Everyone is shouting.

Yes, everyone is shouting, and the pickpockets themselves are also shouting, and they are indignant and full of injustice, which is witnessed by gods and men!

This is: I first realized what humor is.

News Figure, Jiang Tingfu, who recently resigned  Fan Fu

(Editor's note: Jiang Tingfu, who recently resigned, has already been introduced in this newspaper. This article writes from another angle. Let me say it again, it seems repetitive but it is not.)

Mr. Jiang Tingfu, Director-General of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, recently resigned. Mr. Jiang, who came from a scholar specializing in history, entered the political arena eleven years ago. Recalling that in 1935, when he first left his position as the head of the Department of History at Tsinghua University to join the government, he publicly stated: "This time, Tingfu is devoted to politics, only to work hard and not to be an official, and to handle government affairs in the spirit of science. My hope for politics is: internally, I hope that all construction can benefit the people; externally, I hope to promote friendly relations between countries under the conditions of preserving national independence and sovereignty."

The above statement shows that Mr. Jiang is indeed good at rhetoric.

History Professor
Mr. Jiang is a native of Baoqing, Hunan, born in the late Qing Dynasty in the twenty-first year of the Guangxu reign. He studied in a private school in his hometown in his early years. At the age of eleven, he entered Mingde Elementary School in Changsha. According to Mr. Jiang himself, during his studies at the school, he was most impressed by the speaking style and eloquence of the principal, Mr. Hu Zijing. Soon, he was admitted to Yizhi School in Xiangtan, which was run by American missionaries. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, the school was closed. Mr. Jiang was too young to join the revolutionary movement, but he was unwilling to give up his studies, so he decided to study abroad. In 1912, he went to the United States and entered a middle school as a work-study student. After graduating, he entered Oberlin College in Ohio and graduated in 1918. After graduating, he traveled to France for a year, returned to the United States, and entered the Graduate School of History at Columbia University, where he received a doctorate. After returning to China, he successively served as a history professor at Nankai University and Tsinghua University.

From 1935, he entered the government service and served as the ambassador to the Soviet Union, and inspected the provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, etc. Before this resignation, he served as the Director-General of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

Hard Studies
Mr. Jiang is a serious scholar, and there are no interesting anecdotes that can be used for entertainment. On the contrary, he had a moving experience of hard study during his studies in the United States: when he was studying at Oberlin College, the Hunan Provincial Government's funding for studying abroad was cut off halfway, so Mr. Jiang had to live in the same house with other Chinese students who had government funding. Those who had money paid for it, and Mr. Jiang had no money, so he had to contribute his labor and was responsible for cooking and cleaning. He really endured several years of hardship.

Mr. Jiang has now resigned. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration under his leadership has often been attacked by all walks of life and has been called the "Relief Headquarters," trapped in a situation of being besieged on all sides. Perhaps due to environmental and transportation factors, the mission of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has not been as successful as desired. However, we hope that Mr. Jiang will not be afraid of difficulties and will do as much as he can with his ability. In the past, Mr. Jiang once said: his political hope internally is that all construction can give the people real benefits. At the very least, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration should do this.

History is long, and Mr. Jiang is a history expert. He must know how to leave a little brilliance of his personal life in eternal history. We look forward to it!

### The Hidden Pain of the Gauze Industry: Insufficient and Unsuitable Yarn Allocation; High Cotton Cloth Costs, Making Affordable Prices Difficult, as the Main Reasons for the Persistence of the Black Market

[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, the market price of cotton cloth has shown a slight stabilization, but the foundation remains firm. Moreover, it is heard that prices in Tianjin are rising again, which will stimulate another round of price increases. The Cotton Cloth Trade Association, due to the mayor's great attention to price stabilization, is actively seeking adjustments. It is reported that the association's pricing committee includes Dong Jiufeng, Pan Shihao, Gao Aizhou, Wu Zairong, Wu Yangsun, Wang Shenfu, Ding Fang, Ding Dafu, Wang Cai, Zhou Rongsheng, Yu Huilong, Yao Yu'en, Hao, Sun Zhaoming, and Bainian, among others. They will divide into groups for tasks, investigations, and price negotiations. Yesterday, the association held its autumn sacrifice at the South Public Office, attended by over three hundred people. Responsible members of the council requested veteran members of the industry to uphold justice and work together, which was agreed upon. However, given the rising costs, merely using price restrictions as a measure to suppress prices is not only putting the cart before the horse and futile, but also an act of self-deception that may further fuel the rampant black market. Many members of the industry also recounted the losses suffered from being forced to purchase gauze by the enemy and puppet regimes, expressing deep regret over the government's failure to allocate supplies. They pointed out that most cotton cloth merchants currently lack both capital and inventory. The government suspects that some people are hoarding cotton cloth, but those with such capability are not legitimate cotton cloth merchants. According to a certain authority, pure weaving factories are also making meager profits. If yarn factories believe that the current black market price of yarn cannot be reduced, then cloth prices will be difficult to suppress.

The Cost of Cotton Cloth

Furthermore, it was pointed out that the current selling price of medium-grade twelve-pound fine cloth is around eighty thousand yuan. Its cost, based on twenty-count yarn at 2.1 million yuan, is 63,000 yuan for the yarn, and 15,000 yuan for labor, food, starch, factory taxes, etc., totaling 78,000 yuan. If depreciation and interest are added, it barely covers the cost. It was also stated that the joint sales of cotton yarn have recently been nominal. How much yarn is actually allocated to cloth factories at the official price of 1.55 million yuan has drawn widespread attention. Although the yarn allocation can be clearly made at the official price, the quantity is limited, like a drop in the bucket. Weaving factories can only use it to slightly lower the cost of yarn. It was also stated that the Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association's member factories have over 18,000 looms. However, the yarn allocation company only allocates a few hundred bales of yarn every other day and must rotate this allocation with various cotton product reproduction industries. The raw materials needed are insufficient, which is why there is no concern about a lack of outlets for black market yarn.

The Amount of Yarn Used for Dyeing and Weaving

It was also stated that with 10,000 looms in operation, more than 300,000 bolts of cloth can be produced each month, requiring about 80,000 bales of yarn. Some factories, because they are allocated yarn every other day, randomly register multiple brands. However, weaving factories can effectively be allocated only one or two brands. When applying, they fear losing the allocation, so they apply for one or two bales of each brand. But the yarn they receive, due to the count and twist, cannot meet their immediate needs. Thus, they have to take it to the black market to exchange for other types of cotton yarn. Factories with thin capital, if they need two types of cotton yarn to weave a certain batch of cloth, but only receive one type, may even sell it and buy other yarn to meet their needs. This has been frequently observed in the cotton yarn market. The yarn allocation company is closely monitoring this matter.

The Reason for Resale

The company is closely monitoring this matter. Currently, the responsible members of the Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association have clarified the situation with the responsible members of the yarn allocation company. The yarn allocation authorities also clearly know that although cloth factories occasionally sell allocated yarn, they simultaneously buy black market yarn. They believe that the outlet for black market yarn is ultimately practical factories. However, they believe that such buying and selling violates the principle of allocation and urge rectification. The other day, a dispute arose in the yarn trade association market due to the Xin Guang Underwear Factory selling yarn allocated by the yarn allocation company. In fact, Xin Guang uses a lot of yarn every day. In addition to the small amount of allocation from the yarn allocation company, they also have to search and purchase from the market and do not regard reselling yarn allocation as a means of making money.

The Pain of Yarn Trading Firms

The supply of cotton yarn is controlled by the yarn commission, and the activity of the black market remains the most discussed topic within the Hehe Guli Yarn Trading Firms Association. According to those familiar with the details, yarn trading firms are also one of the industries weakened by being forced to purchase gauze by the enemy and puppet regimes. The yarn allocation company does not allocate to this industry, so people in the industry inevitably feel that the allocation is unfair. Since private yarn factories joined the allocation, yarn trading firms, due to their historical ties, have fortunately not been abandoned. Therefore, the place where their goods circulate is still the market. Moreover, those in the cotton product reproduction industry who are searching for yarn, because private yarn factories are even more difficult to obtain yarn from, have turned to concentrate here. Thus, there is an appearance of prosperity on the surface, but the situation is no longer what it used to be.

### Xu Letian, Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, Discusses the Shanghai Coal Allocation Situation: 86% Supplied to Public Utilities; South American and Annamese White Coal Expected to Arrive in Shanghai This Winter

[Our Newspaper's Report] Xu Letian, Chairman of the Shanghai Region Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, recently met with our newspaper's reporter and provided detailed answers to questions raised by the reporter regarding the committee's recent situation. The details are as follows. He stated: At the beginning of the government's recovery, all major mining areas in the country were destroyed by the Communist army, and there was very little coal stored throughout the country. The total production is less than 30% of the main usage. At the same time, transportation is extremely difficult. If the government had not centralized management and supported production, the public utilities, railways, ships, and various industries in the southeastern provinces would have completely stopped long ago. If the mines had no government authorities and sound organizations such as this committee to assist them with all their strength, they would have stopped production long ago due to lack of materials and economic exhaustion.

Sixteen Ships Transporting Coal

Currently, the committee leases a total of sixteen ships for transporting coal. Branch offices are set up in Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places. The main source of coal transportation is the coal mines in Qinhuangdao in the north. They can transport 130,000 to 140,000 tons per month. In the south, it is the Keelung coal mine in Taiwan, which can transport 40,000 to 50,000 tons per month. Coal mines in Huainan and East China can also transport a small amount of coal. Under the extremely unfavorable conditions of transportation and commerce, the committee's transportation capacity can still reach over 100,000 tons per month. The supply area, in addition to Pingjin, is almost entirely allocated by the committee. In terms of production, we are doing our best to support the mines in increasing production. We are using the mine timber obtained from barter trade with Japan to mine as much coal as possible. The current Kailuan Coal Mine's daily coal production has increased from 5,000 tons to 12,000 tons. The daily coal production in Keelung, Taiwan, has also increased from 500 tons to 3,000 tons.

Northeast Coal May Come Next Spring

What is currently hoped for is that the two major coal mines in the Northeast, Fushun and Xinqiu, can also be restored to coal production soon. However, limited by the supply of water and electricity, the initial recovery will likely only produce about 7,000 tons of coal per day. However, winter is approaching rapidly, and the Northeast itself also needs coal urgently. It is expected that only next spring can the surplus be supplied to the southeastern provinces. It is estimated that roughly 60,000 to 100,000 tons can be supplied per month. When the Northeast region resumes mass production and the political situation improves, the national coal shortage problem can be easily solved.

The Allocation Price Has Remained Unchanged

Currently, 86% of the coal allocated by the committee must be supplied to public utilities, railways, ships, etc. in the southeastern provinces. The prices of the remaining 14% of the coal supplied have remained unchanged. For example, the coal supplied to the Shanghai Electric Power Company is still over 30,000 yuan per ton. The coal supplied to the Two Railway Bureaus and power plants in the southeastern provinces is still 50,000 yuan per ton. The committee has to bear a purchase cost of 20,000 yuan. Although there was a slight surplus in the past due to the different supply prices of the 14% of industrial coal, it is currently impossible to make up for the loss. In Shanghai, in terms of the bituminous coal that the committee can supply and the white coal dust used by citizens for cooking, since March of this year, after the committee used effective measures to suppress the price, it has been unable to rise again.

Reasons for the Recent Increase in the Price of White Coal

The reason for the high price of white coal blocks used for home heating on the black market is that the Zhengtai Railway was cut off, and Shanxi coal could not be transported out (it has recently been restored to traffic, but due to insufficient vehicles, only a small amount has been transported out). The Mentougou Coal Mine was flooded. There was a panic in North China for coal used for home heating. Therefore, the authorities in North China prohibited the export of white coal, which caused a shortage of white coal in Shanghai. However, China is currently conducting barter trade negotiations with Annam, exchanging our raw silk for Annam's Hong Gai white coal. Currently, Mr. Guemo, the French economic representative, has negotiated with me several times, and it is generally expected to be successful. Furthermore, South American coal is also expected to arrive in Shanghai before this winter, so that there will be no panic in the city for coal used for winter heating.

Unified Planning and Allocation: Emergency Measures

In August of this year, the committee revised the "Five Points for the Provisional Management of Domestic and Foreign Imported Coal," because domestic areas are unstable, and coal producing areas and transportation routes are often damaged. Therefore, these emergency measures had to be taken. The purpose is nothing more than to make unified and reasonable allocation and supply of coal throughout the country. The five measures are:

(1) This committee shall manage the bituminous coal and white coal imported into the Shanghai area from domestic and foreign sources, and the coke imported from domestic sources, in accordance with these measures.

(2) Bituminous coal imported from domestic sources shall be managed uniformly by this committee. If anyone transports it without the approval of this committee, this committee shall purchase all of it at the purchase price of this committee.

(3) Merchants are allowed to freely transport and sell domestic white coal and coke. However, they must apply to the competent authority at the port of export for a transport permit, and report to this committee for inspection upon import. This committee may purchase it at cost plus a profit of 5% if necessary.

(4) The import of bituminous coal and white coal from foreign sources must be approved by this committee. If anyone freely transports and imports it without approval, this committee shall purchase all of it at the purchase price of this committee.

(5) For those who have been approved to import bituminous coal and white coal from foreign sources, this committee may, if necessary, purchase all of it at the approved cost plus a profit. He stated: The large tonnage of coal transportation and the required capital are definitely beyond the reach of ordinary merchants. Moreover, merchants who transport coal will ultimately prioritize profit and sell too much to the black market, and they will definitely not sacrifice the supply of public utilities and coke professionals when necessary. Therefore, it is necessary to implement this unified planning method to make a comprehensive and reasonable allocation before the policy of coal supply is restored. As for the repurchase of inferior products, the principle is that all of them are repurchased. Moreover, the prices of the repurchases are all the same. There is no division into shares or repurchase at equal silk prices.

### Commercial Banks Offer Long-Term Low-Interest Loans: Two Conditions Required

(1) Real estate can be used as collateral.

(2) Re-discounting and re-mortgaging are permitted.

Under the current oppression of high-interest loans, the capital turnover of commerce, industry, and agriculture is not smooth, and production cannot be maintained. At this time, Consultant Putin of the Senate made a suggestion to the government to adjust the funds of industry, agriculture, and commerce. The government authorities are considering it. Xu Guozhen, general manager of Jin Cheng Bank, said: To adjust the funds of industry, agriculture, and commerce, long-term low-interest loans must be offered, but this is currently difficult for all commercial banks to do, because the amount of reserves of the first bank is too large, which affects the amount of loans. At present, among the commercial banks in Shanghai, there are not many with deposits of 10 billion. A bank with 10 billion yuan must pay various reserves of about 6 billion, and interest to depositors of 1 billion. The actual amount that can be loaned is only 3 billion yuan. Calculated at a monthly interest rate of 15%, the interest income is only 450 million yuan, while the monthly expenses of such banks are more than 500 million yuan. Under this situation of insufficient income to cover expenses, how can interest rates be lowered? Secondly, because most of the current depositors are demand deposit accounts, which require preparation for payment at any time, banks cannot offer long-term loans. At most, they can only offer loans for one month, usually for one week or even less. Under this situation, borrowers can only use the loans for speculative business except for temporary relief. If you want commercial banks to offer long-term low-interest loans, the first is to allow banks to use real estate as reserves, because the purpose of setting up reserves is to prevent the bank from going bankrupt and to use this money to compensate depositors for their losses. If so, it may not be necessary to use cash as collateral, but to use the bank's real estate as collateral, which will increase the bank's circulating funds. Second, state banks should offer re-discounting and re-mortgaging, so that commercial banks have state banks as a backing when they do not have enough funds. If so, commercial banks will have sufficient circulating funds and can offer long-term low-interest loans. Otherwise, only a few state banks will offer such loans, which will still not meet the needs of the industry, commerce, and agriculture sectors. Commercial banks must assist state banks to be effective.

### Four Batches of Raw Silk Warehouse Receipts Handled by the China Trust Bureau

Regarding the purchase of the fourth batch of spring rain raw silk, the factories had previously completed the warehouse receipts, the receipts, and the transfer procedures, and handed them over to the China Company for sorting. It is learned that this morning, it can be handed over to the Central Trust Bureau, which will send personnel to the warehouses to inspect them according to the receipts before making payments. According to this total, it is estimated to be 1,950 dan, and the fifth batch of raw silk, about 400 dan, can also be sent to the China Trust Bureau for processing within days. It is also learned that the previous purchase time was slightly cumbersome, because the warehouse transfer procedures were slightly more complicated. Now, efforts have been made to simplify the procedures and change to direct custody by the China Trust Bureau for transfer registration to save time.

### Trading of US Dollars Resumes Today; Authorities are Closely Monitoring

Last Thursday, the US dollar market conditions were greatly affected by rumors, and prices fluctuated sharply, causing great confusion in the market and stimulating various prices to jump up. The Municipal Government and important banks specially formulated three temporary measures for buying and selling US dollars, which were implemented immediately to draw up effective countermeasures to completely eliminate the black market speculation of US dollars. At the same time, the Money Exchange Trade Association also resolved on that day to suspend US dollar transactions for three days. The deadline for this suspension has recently expired. It is learned that the Money Exchange industry has received instructions from President Bei to resume US dollar trading today, but must comply with the following three regulations, namely, the purchase and sale price must not exceed the exchange rate for US telegraphic transfers announced by the Central Bank plus 5%. If anyone raises the purchase price, it must be reported to the municipal government immediately. If any money exchange shop manipulates prices, it will be severely punished. Song Ziwen, President of the Executive Yuan, personally borrowed Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance to come to Shanghai at the end of last week to discuss appropriate measures. After arriving at his residence that day, Song summoned President Bei of the Central Bank to inquire about the financial situation of the city and listen to the report.
