### The Ministry of National Defense Officially Established Today; Commander-in-Chief He Sends a Circular Telegram Declaring His Resignation; Hopes His Comrades-in-Arms Will Work Hard to Lay the Foundation for Military Construction

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 31st] The Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army officially announced its closure on the 31st. General He Yingqin, Chief of Staff and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, First Class, issued a special circular telegram to all company commanders, theater commanders, pacification directors, group army commanders, and all soldiers of the nation, declaring that he would relinquish both positions from June 1st. He also stated two matters: first, he recounted that in the past sixteen years, he had served as Minister of Military Affairs for fourteen years and eight months, Chief of Staff for over eight years, and Commander-in-Chief of the Army for two and a half years. He expressed boundless gratitude for the assistance of leaders and staff at all levels, as well as all comrades-in-arms, which enabled the smooth implementation of all plans for military reorganization, construction, resistance against Japan, acceptance of surrender, and repatriation of prisoners. He then said: The establishment of the Ministry of National Defense on the 1st is a new central military organization, and it is an extremely reasonable organization with simple organization, appropriate coordination, and solid connections. It is expected to achieve excellent results. All my comrades-in-arms should unanimously support it and work hard to promote it in order to lay the foundation for national military construction. He sincerely hoped that all comrades-in-arms would carry forward the spirit of loving the country, loving the people, taking responsibility, and observing discipline to complete the great revolutionary cause and not fail the high expectations of the Supreme Commander, Chairman Chiang. It is heard that national leaders at all levels, upon learning of General He Yingqin's relinquishment of his heavy military responsibilities, felt reluctant to part with him, as a result of their comradely feelings. Telegrams and letters have poured in from various locations, all hoping that General He would lead the Supreme Strategic Advisory Committee, praise the commander, and complete the great plans of military and national construction.

### The Chairman Summons the Heads of Beiping and Tianjin; Listens to Their Reports on Governance and Provides Instructions

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 31st] Chairman Chiang remained in Beiping today to rest and provide instructions to the local military and political leaders. In the morning, he first summoned the newly appointed Minister of National Defense, Bai Chongxi, and instructed him to return to Nanjing to preside over the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense. In the morning, he then summoned Zheng Daoru, the Chairman of Jilin Province, who had just rushed over from Shenyang, and instructed him on matters related to the takeover of Jilin. Zheng received a phone call from the Chairman's Beiping Headquarters last night, ordering him to arrive in Beiping by 10:00 AM today. Zheng arrived at 10:20 AM. He claimed that the plane had experienced a malfunction and repeatedly mentioned the danger. The weather in the Northeast has been bad for several days. Yesterday, when Chairman Chiang's special plane, the Meiling, passed Shanhaiguan, hailstones suddenly fell, and the fuselage shook violently. Madam Chiang also vomited on her way from Shenyang to Beiping yesterday. Therefore, no guests were seen earlier today. In addition, the Chairman also summoned Sun Lianzhong this morning and listened to his report for a long time. In the afternoon, he only summoned two people. One was Cai Wenzhi, the Government Chief of Staff of the Military Mediation Department, whom he summoned at 3:00 PM. At 9:00 PM, he summoned the senior leaders of Beiping City for a conversation. Because of the short time and busy schedule, the headquarters issued a message this morning, ordering all those who wish to meet the Chairman to first register at the Beiping Garrison Headquarters and wait to be summoned. This morning, the reporter saw Wan Fulin, Ma Zhanshan, Zhang Ting'e, Du Jianshi, Mu Tingfang, Fu Sinian, He Qigong, Li Sicong, Wu Juanren, Shao Hua, and others successively arriving at the garrison headquarters to leave their business cards and return to their residences to await summons. Before leaving, the reporter made an appointment with Zheng Yanfen, a member of the Chairman's entourage, to meet again at 2:00 PM tomorrow afternoon. The Chairman seems unlikely to leave Beiping tomorrow. After the reporter left the garrison gate, he saw an old woman in her seventies, the director of a certain division's field hospital, Xue, crying because her residence had been forcibly occupied. She sought to meet the Chairman and was persuaded to leave a written statement and leave.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 31st] Chairman Chiang processed official business and reviewed documents at the garrison headquarters on the morning of the 31st. At 5:00 PM, he summoned the Mayor of Beiping, Xiong Bin, and inquired about the general municipal situation, especially the work of the Health Bureau. The Chairman was particularly concerned about the appearance of Beiping City. After listening to Mayor Xiong's report, he believed that the appearance of Beiping City had improved compared to his visit last winter and instructed Mayor Xiong that the city government should cooperate with the citizens in the future and pay special attention to public health, hoping that every citizen can follow the principles of the New Life Movement and practice a neat and clean life. After summoning Mayor Xiong, the Chairman immediately led Mayor Xiong from the garrison headquarters to inspect the new urban area in the western suburbs for a week, returning to the garrison headquarters around 7:00 PM. The new urban area was planned and built by the Japanese in the western suburbs during their occupation of Beiping, designed and built according to modern urban planning. It is large in scale, but only a part was completed by the time the Japanese surrendered.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 31st] Chairman Chiang summoned the heads of the Party, government, and military in Beiping and Tianjin at the garrison headquarters at 9:00 PM on the 31st and had dinner with them. Those present included Li Zongren, the Director of the Garrison Headquarters; Sun Lianzhong, the Commander of the Eleventh War Zone; Chen Jicheng, the Deputy Commander; Zhang Bojin, the Deputy Mayor of Beiping; Du Jianshi, the Deputy Mayor of Tianjin; and Wu Juanren and Shao Hua, the chairmen of the Party Headquarters in Beiping and Tianjin.

### Personnel Receiving Anshan All Safely Arrived in Shenyang; Guan Jiyu and Peng Jiqun Go to Nanjing

### A Letter of Complaint from the Citizens of Shenyang; The Chairman Will Personally Review It After Returning to Nanjing

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 31st] The reporter paid a visit to the Chairman this morning, but due to official business, he was met by Deputy Secretary-General Zheng Yanfen. Zheng only answered questions about the Party and groups under his responsibility and the handling of confidential letters. He said that the Party and groups in the nine northeastern provinces have all been assigned dedicated personnel, but due to environmental constraints, most cannot formally operate. Only the Party and groups in Liaoning can be promoted. The Chairman set up a confidential complaint box in Shenyang this time and received more than 900 letters of complaint. After bringing them to Nanjing, they will be processed. The Chairman will personally review them one by one and then hand them over to the judicial organs. Zheng also said that many outsiders mistakenly believe that reporting to the Chairman is like "reporting to the emperor," which is incorrect. The Chairman's move is primarily to learn more about the hidden suffering of the people and seek effective relief, but it should still follow judicial procedures. Therefore, each case is handed over to the judicial organs for thorough and swift handling. The lawsuit received from Chairman Li Ping last time has not been completed by the Beiping Court. It has been ordered for the court to speed up the handling.

### National Army Arrives Near the Suburbs of Harbin; Communist Troops Retreating Towards Qiqihar

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 31st] Military News: The 7,000-strong rapid force of the National Army advancing towards Harbin arrived at the southeastern suburbs, only 11 Chinese miles away from Harbin, at dawn today and occupied two high grounds. After a slight resistance, the Communist troops retreated. According to news from the Northeast, the National Army is now awaiting orders to peacefully enter Harbin. The Communist troops have already begun to withdraw. Currently, what the Communist troops are contesting is nothing more than the following two things: (1) a matter of face. The Communist troops still intend to strive for an active withdrawal in order to consolidate morale and cover up signs of defeat. (2) A practical matter. The Communist troops seem to hope to obtain guarantees from Marshal Ma or other parties and conditionally withdraw from Harbin in order to ensure their territory north of the Songhua River.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 31st] According to a foreign military expert who recently came here from the Northeast: In the battles in the Northeast, from Benxihu to Sipingjie and Gongzhuling, the main force of the Communist troops has lost 60,000 people. Among them, those who were killed or wounded accounted for about a quarter, less than 20,000 people. Most of the Communist officers and soldiers deserted with or abandoned their weapons during the retreat. The so-called Democratic Allied Army has actually been defeated and disorganized. Captured Communist officers and soldiers said: When Lin Biao and Zhou Baozhong gave their last speech in Sipingjie and Changchun, they also publicly admitted that in the past ten years or more of thousands of battles, large and small, although there were occasional deserters, such unfortunate phenomena as fleeing before the battle, collapsing before being defeated, and dispersing after defeat will be the first time this has occurred. The morale of the Communist troops in the Northeast has almost been completely crushed. The Communist troops do not hesitate to travel thousands of miles, using coercion to hastily form an army, with soldiers having no fighting spirit and filled with complaints. It is appropriate to have such a loss. What is pitiful is that most of these tens of thousands of retreating Communist troops are innocent people from Hubei, northern Anhui, southern Henan, northern Jiangsu, southern Shandong, and southern Hebei, who were coerced and deceived, causing them to abandon their wives and children and wander thousands of miles. How can they bear it? Therefore, as soon as the Communist troops heard that the Central Government had sent personnel to various places in the Northeast to comfort and rescue the refugees, they mostly returned with their weapons. The evolution of the war situation to this point shows that the trend of superiority and inferiority has become clear, and the unification of the Northeast can be expected soon.

[Agence France-Presse, Changchun, 31st] According to responsible sources, the New Sixth Army of the National Army crossed the upper reaches of the Songhua River yesterday and arrived at a certain place a few miles northeast of Jilin City. Other units of the army are advancing along the railway northeast of Changchun, crossing Zhangjiawan yesterday and arriving at the banks of the Songhua River, about eight miles southwest of Harbin. The Chinese Communist troops are retreating towards Qiqihar.

[Associated Press, Changchun, 30th] (Delayed) According to headquarters sources obtained here today, the National Army has occupied a vast security circle, with a radius extending in the east, west, and north directions, about eighty miles around Changchun, making it impossible for the Communist troops to launch a counterattack on Changchun again. Since May 28th, Jilin has been firmly in the hands of the National Army. Occupying Dehui to the north, about sixty miles from Changchun, is a railway town, where the National Army has reached the south bank of the Songhua River. The Songhua River is twenty miles north of Changchun, almost halfway between Changchun and Harbin.

### At the American Alumni Association Meeting in This City, Sun Ke Elaborates on Legislative Procedures and Explains the Company Law and Land Law Respectively

[Report from this newspaper] Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, at the invitation of the American Alumni Association of this city, attended a dinner party held by the association at the Dadong Restaurant yesterday and delivered a speech on the spot. Those present at the dinner included Mayor Wu, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government He Dekui, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengyu, Director of the Public Works Bureau Zhao Zukang, Commander of the U.S. Forces in China Major General Gillon, U.S. Consul General in Shanghai Davis, U.S. Judge Hale Mick, etc. After the meal, Association President Smith first delivered a welcome speech and introduced President Sun's resume. Then, President Sun rose to give a speech, briefly stating: "It is a great honor to gather here today with old and new friends. I have served as the President of the Legislative Yuan for fourteen years, so today I would like to briefly express my views on Chinese legislation and legislative procedures." Sun stated: "Up to now, the members of the Legislative Yuan are still appointed by the government. Any legal bill passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government becomes law." Sun then explained the difference between "law" and "decree" and cited the new Company Law and Land Law, explaining them separately. Regarding the provision in the draft of the new Company Law that foreign companies must also be operating in their own country if they wish to operate in China, he gave a brief explanation, saying: "This provision has been removed from the promulgated new Company Law." The new Company Law includes the old laws and regulations related to company law. When discussing the Land Law, he said: "This law has provisions for land ownership and taxation. I recently heard that Shanghai is considering levying a 40% tax on real estate transactions based on their transaction price. This has caused real estate transactions to become sluggish. However, this tax provision is not fully consistent with the provisions of the Land Law, so if it is submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, it will be rejected." Sun earnestly hoped that local authorities should carefully study the Land Law before formulating similar measures to avoid causing losses to the people. Sun then talked about the legislative procedure, saying: "The National Government, the Supreme National Defense Council, the various Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan itself can all propose bills to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The Legislative Yuan currently has five committees: Legal System, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Economy, and Military Affairs. When discussing a proposal, each committee often invites those related to the proposal to attend the discussion. The Legislative Yuan has the power to pass or reject it." Sun then stated: "In the future, after the National Assembly is convened and the constitution is formulated, the members of the Legislative Yuan will be elected by the provinces and cities in proportion to their population. The number of members will be approximately five to six hundred. The future Legislative Yuan will be even more important than it is now. Most of the major national policies of the Executive Yuan must be responsible to the Legislative Yuan. If rejected by the Legislative Yuan, it would be tantamount to the Legislative Yuan casting a vote of no confidence in the Executive Yuan, and the Executive Yuan would have to be reorganized. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan under the new constitution is quite similar to the House of Commons in England."

### Optimistic about the Northeast Issue, Hoping for a Speedy Adjustment of Civil Servants' Salaries

Sun then discussed the system of party governance, briefly stating: "In the past, the Kuomintang led the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, completed the Northern Expedition, and resisted foreign aggression. During this period of political tutelage, when the party governs the country, the Kuomintang has taken a leadership position. However, all aspects of construction remain to be undertaken, and the Kuomintang cannot take everything into account at once. However, it has been working hard to complete the most important tasks. For example, the most important thing in the past fifteen years has been to resist Japanese aggression. Fortunately, a favorable outcome has been achieved. From now on, the government is determined to gradually return power to the people. Therefore, it earnestly hopes that the current domestic disputes can be resolved through political means. Resorting to force unnecessarily is not a good policy." Speaking of the situation in the Northeast, he said, "When the Soviet army withdrew from the Northeast, it informed the National Government in advance. Therefore, only the National Government has full authority to recover the Northeast. If it were to recognize the occupation of the Northeast by local troops and the establishment of their own government, it would be tantamount to recognizing that the domestic government administration has been divided and that two governments have been formed externally. Moreover, China and the Soviet Union already have a Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. According to this treaty, China allows the Soviet Union to hold half of its interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway and stipulates the joint use of Lushun Port, as well as granting the Soviet Union special privileges in Dalian. All of these provisions must be implemented after the National Government recovers the Northeast. If the Soviet Union recognizes the occupation of the Northeast by local troops and the establishment of a separate government, it would be tantamount to destroying the existing Sino-Soviet Friendship Agreement. In short, the National Government, as the only government representing China, must have absolute power to receive the Northeast." Sun believes that the Northeast issue must be resolved, but a peaceful solution should be sought. He advocates that the Communist forces should immediately find a way to make concessions to the government, and everything can be submitted to the Political Consultative Conference for discussion. He finally stated: "I am very optimistic about the future of the Northeast issue" and added, "It is expected to be resolved in the short term. I hope everyone will work hard to make it happen."

After the meeting, reporters asked Sun when the adjustment of civil servants' salaries would be decided. Sun replied, "It is still under review." When it will be decided, he could not say. He only said, "I hope it will be as soon as possible." He also said that he will return to Nanjing in a day or two.

[Central News Agency report from this city] President Sun is very concerned about the future of Chinese industry and commerce and expresses his worries, because the cost of domestic products is rising, which has led to sluggish exports and even stagnation. Sun believes that if the national finances are not in difficulty, export merchants should be encouraged and their cost differences should be subsidized to facilitate the export of domestic products. However, this is currently difficult to do. The second is to reduce production costs and stabilize finance and prices. Price increases harm the people, so future economic and financial matters should accept opinions from all parties and be discussed openly. This is a man-made problem, and I believe it can be solved by man-made means.

Editorial

### Labor Unrest and the Rule of Law

Labor unrest has been surging in Shanghai in recent months, one wave after another, affecting industrial production and social order, and the situation is gradually becoming serious. Yesterday, more than a thousand unemployed workers rioted at the Social Affairs Bureau, injuring people, damaging property, and seizing guns from the police, setting a new precedent for labor unrest. Fortunately, the authorities responded effectively and prevented an accident. However, according to the workers' claims, they have prepared coffins and stretchers, indicating that a small number of people are deliberately creating trouble and inciting tragedy. This kind of labor unrest is no longer purely economic.

The Social Affairs Bureau will convene a meeting of factory owners at the Chamber of Commerce this afternoon. Minister Gu and Mayor Wu will both be present to provide guidance. A meeting of leaders of various trade unions was previously convened, and Mayor Wu and Minister Gu both gave instructions, announcing the government's important policies for handling labor unrest. Minister Gu pointed out four principles: (1) Workers' legitimate interests should be protected; (2) Labor discipline must be rectified; (3) Labor-management disputes should be handled in accordance with legal procedures; (4) Wage adjustments should be based on the cost of living index promulgated by the municipal government, and the base wage should not be changed. If the wages of various industries cannot be paid according to the cost of living index due to poor production or business, the labor and management should negotiate, or the arbitration committee should agree on a method to reduce the wages. Mayor Wu also announced five points for handling labor unrest: (1) Strikes and slowdowns are not allowed; (2) Instigators of labor unrest will be severely punished; (3) If there are strikes or slowdowns, wages will not be paid during the strike or slowdown period, and no demands may be made in any name; (4) Those who instigate labor unrest and collect commissions will be severely punished; (5) Workers should absolutely abide by discipline. We really hope that the publication of these measures will mark the beginning of the end of the Shanghai labor unrest, but unexpectedly, yesterday, unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear staged a "full martial arts performance," which seems to have caused embarrassment to the authorities.

Those who discuss labor unrest often emphasize the economic point of view, believing that the continuous increase in the cost of living makes it difficult for wage earners to make a living. This is indeed a fair argument. However, now that the government takes into account the livelihood of workers and adopts wage adjustments based on the cost of living index, whether this policy is completely reasonable is open to discussion, but the wages paid according to the cost of living index should be able to maintain the current standard of living. Therefore, if workers are not unemployed, there should be no labor unrest. Yesterday, someone said that during the occupation period, the price of rice in Shanghai reached 800,000 yuan per picul of false currency, and the average wage of workers was about 100,000 yuan per month, which was not enough to buy one and a half dou of rice. Now, even if the price of rice is 60,000 yuan, and the average wage is about 110,000 to 120,000 yuan, which is enough to buy two piculs of rice, why is there more labor unrest than during the occupation period, and why is it getting worse day by day? Therefore, the ups and downs of labor unrest cannot be fully explained by economic factors.

Moreover, even from an economic point of view, setting wages based on the cost of living index is naturally out of the government's intention to care for workers, but there are several points that are also worth our attention: (1) Under the current situation where the cost of living index has risen to more than 4,000 times the pre-war level, workers can indeed receive wages based on the cost of living index, but civil servants, who have worked hard for the country day and night, have traveled back and forth to the rear during the war, and have endured hardships for eight or nine years, are now only receiving 50,000 yuan plus 160 times their base salary. Compared with the situation where workers' wages have increased by 3,000 to 4,000 times, Chinese workers today are no longer the people who are suffering the most. (2) The increase in wages will undoubtedly affect the rising cost of production. At present, it is difficult for the manufactured products of our country's production sector to compete with cheap and high-quality imported products. If this situation is allowed to continue, China's industry and even the entire national economy will eventually go bankrupt. (3) With wages based on the cost of living index, workers can live according to the pre-war standard, but in terms of work efficiency, not to mention progress, can it really reach the pre-war standard? If work efficiency cannot keep up with the pre-war standard, but wages are the same as the pre-war remuneration, or even higher due to the increase in base salary, can employers afford it in the long run? This kind of "killing the chicken to get the eggs" labor unrest is not only harmful to the future of Chinese industry, but even tantamount to suicide for the labor community!

Investigating the origins of this kind of blind labor unrest's crazy actions, its initial departure was based on economics, but at present it is obvious that it has political implications. Some conspirators are taking advantage of the opportunity, deliberately creating and expanding social unrest in order to achieve their political goals. Workers do not understand the role of this, or blindly agree, or succumb to the power of some instigators, so that they are directed and manipulated by a small number of people, and they themselves may be at a loss. The recent surge in labor unrest is mostly due to instigation and coercion. At Mayor Wu's reception for journalists the other day, someone pointed out that in the recent rickshaw pullers' strike, agitators sent from northern Jiangsu wielded knives specifically to puncture rickshaw tires, forcibly preventing rickshaw pullers from pulling their cars. Yesterday's editorial in the North-China Daily News also warned Shanghai workers, saying that past labor unrest in Shanghai was mostly triggered by agitators with other purposes, whose purpose was not to protect the interests of workers but to break workers' rice bowls, making it so that everyone had nothing to eat. Therefore, those who truly care for workers sincerely hope that Shanghai workers will rein in their horses on the edge of the cliff and never blindly agree with the instructions of these agitators; and hope that the government authorities will not speak casually in the future, otherwise, once the policy is announced, it must be seriously implemented and severely punish the rioters who disrupt social order.

At this point, we once again feel something deeply. Even if we take a hundred steps back or a thousand steps back and assume that strikes and slowdowns are legal, destroying stores, factory equipment, or injuring people to the point of death or injury as a result of strikes and slowdowns is ultimately not tolerated by the law. Recently, in labor unrest, there have been incidents of destroying stores and injuring people. Yesterday, even the workers stormed the Social Affairs Bureau, which is too much! Indeed, workers' unemployment is very painful, and we deeply sympathize with them. The government and society should especially strive to provide job opportunities and continue to provide relief, but in any case, they should not prepare coffins and cause deaths. We must not let this trend continue! If this trend is not curbed, then no one will be interested in industrial and commercial production, and the national law will be completely gone. This kind of violence is mostly organized and on a considerable scale. It progresses gradually, expands gradually, and is not an isolated incident of one or two people. If small problems are not blocked, they will become rivers. We hope that the relevant authorities will stop the occurrence of violence in order to maintain the people's peace and prosperity. Because violence is definitely not what ordinary labor unrest should have.

In short, the development of labor unrest in Shanghai to the current stage has become a situation where economic factors are few and political implications are strong. We should sympathize with and relieve the economic suffering of workers; but we should unceremoniously point out and correct the political blind actions of workers. Pure union members must know that if they continue to act blindly and violently, it is less about fighting for the interests of the workers themselves and more about increasing social unrest, disrupting public order, and endangering national survival. Workers are originally the cornerstone of national construction, and they must never be used as a tool to harm the country by ambitious people!

### Lin Bosheng Sentenced to Death, Face Turned Pale Upon Hearing the Sentence, Forcing Himself to Remain Calm

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The Capital High Court sentenced the traitor Lin Bosheng to death this morning. Judge Jin Shiding, Prosecutor He Zhongjin, Judge Tian Hongming, and Clerk He Fu [blank] attended the court. At 10:30 AM, Lin the traitor was brought to the court. After questioning his age, address, and residence, the sentence was pronounced in court. Lin Bosheng was found guilty of colluding with the enemy to conspire against the country, and was sentenced to death with deprivation of public rights for life. All of his property, except for what was necessary for the living expenses of his family, was confiscated. The reasoning: the defendant Lin the traitor Bosheng echoed Wang the traitor Zhaoming, resisted the established national policy of the central government, independently advocated peace, published Wang the traitor's sensational telegram, and responded to Konoe's statement. Although he was attacked by patriotic soldiers, the defendant remained unrepentant, participated in the puppet National Congress, discussed the peace issue, and then Wang and others jointly organized the puppet government, holding important party and government positions. He also participated in the Greater East Asia Youth Guidance Council with Wang. Other meetings, such as the Treaty on Basic Relations between China and Japan, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and the Joint Declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, which opposed Britain and the United States and declared war on the Allied countries, expressing the intention to live and die with the Japanese invaders, were all attended by the defendant. Moreover, as the propaganda minister in the puppet government, he repeatedly praised the Japanese invaders and slandered the central government in newspapers and broadcasts, and published anti-resistance war remarks. In his book "From September 18th to September 18th," he did everything possible to slander and slander the Supreme Commander and the national policy, shaking the resistance war and disturbing people's hearts. The evidence of his crimes is conclusive and leaves no doubt, so he is sentenced to capital punishment. After hearing the sentence, Lin the traitor's face turned pale, but he still forced himself to remain calm and said that he was willing to give up the application for a retrial, and expressed his gratitude to the presiding judge. Finally, the presiding judge instructed him, saying, "Although you do not apply for a retrial, the High Court will still apply for a retrial on your behalf according to the law." After saying this, he ordered him to be taken back into custody.

### Li Sheng Wujie's Situation at the Capital High Court Trial, Sakai Takashi Not Sentenced, Debate Scheduled to Reopen

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The Japanese war criminal Sakai Takashi was originally scheduled to be sentenced today.

The time for reopening the debate court is around mid-June. In addition, there are now more than 90 war criminals detained in the prison of the Military Tribunal. More than 30 of them have completed the investigation. The second war criminal to be tried may be Takahashi.

[United Press International, Washington, 30th Dispatch] A high-ranking naval officer who previously served as Under Secretary of the Army Department today strongly condemned the Soviet Union's obstruction of peace efforts. He stated that the hasty demobilization of the US military has weakened the United States' influence in international conferences. Former Army Department official, [James Forrestal], warned in a broadcast that "a new sinister hand may be extended, attempting to conquer the world, and we will have no peace. The great alliance that defeated Hitler's forces has now vanished, and a totalitarian force with a different symbol than the Nazi swastika has risen in its place." [Forrestal] also condemned some Americans, saying that if they had firmly maintained the strength of the US Army and Air Force at a suitable level, then "some countries that have been stubborn and difficult to negotiate with in recent discussions would be sitting at the table of peace with us." Rear Admiral [Earl E. Stone], Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, also strongly criticized America's "hasty and selfish" demobilization actions, saying that US policy encounters obstacles at every turn.

### Britain Helps France Strengthen Air Force, Two Countries Have Established Agreement

[Reuters, London, 30th Dispatch] British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, [Hector McNeil], recently declared in the House of Commons that Britain and France have now established an agreement stipulating that Britain will greatly strengthen the French Air Force, aviation industry, and naval aircraft capabilities. A "New York Times" reporter noted that this action by Britain coincides with the United States' decision to assist in arming Latin American countries. However, the Anglo-French negotiations have been ongoing for some time, and the motivation is clearly that both countries wish to strengthen the armaments of their allies. One thing to note is that the Anglo-French alliance negotiations are still at a standstill, with no new developments since the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference. According to [McNeil], Britain will provide France and French aviation schools with aircraft and equipment under the agreement, as well as radio, radar, and signal equipment. British aviation schools and instructors will also train French personnel in the use of British equipment, and French aircraft factories will be allowed to manufacture British aircraft, engines, and various parts.

### Einstein's Speech: Seeking World Peace in the Future, US and Soviet Union Must Establish Agreement, Criticizes America for Going in the Opposite Direction

[Associated Press, Chicago, 30th Dispatch] Dr. Albert Einstein delivered a radio address from his home today, stating that to seek world peace in the future, a large-scale agreement must be established with the Soviet Union. Unexpectedly, since the end of the war, the United States has gone in the opposite direction. If we want to protect the world from destruction in the future, the only hope lies in seeking peace through supranational means. We must create a world government capable of resolving conflicts between nations through judicial means. The development of political relations among countries in the year since the end of World War II has clearly failed to bring us closer to this goal. The United Nations organization, as it stands today, has neither the military power nor the legal basis to achieve a state of international security. If a large-scale agreement could be established between the United States and the Soviet Union, then these two powers alone would be enough to compel other countries to relinquish some sovereignty, so that all nations could achieve military security. Now, the United States has not only not made efforts to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union, but has even gone in the opposite direction.

### Most of Japan's Surviving Fleet is Broken and Cannot Fight, Nagato Ship Used for Atomic Bomb

[Reuters, Tokyo, 31st Dispatch] Japan's once-dominant fleet is mostly broken and abandoned. The remaining naval vessels now total 131 ships, approximately 431,000 tons, most of which have been destroyed and cannot fight.

### Emperor Hirohito Travels Lightly, Pays Second Visit to MacArthur Yesterday, Talks Last One Hour, Content Strictly Secret, Imperial Household Ministry Denies Connection to Abdication Issue

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 31st Dispatch] Emperor Hirohito today made a second sudden visit to MacArthur at the US Embassy, MacArthur's residence, for a secret talk lasting one and a half hours. Hirohito, dressed in casual clothes, left the palace at 10:05 AM and drove to the US Embassy, a ten-minute journey. Grand Chamberlain Matsudaira accompanied him, but there was no escort. Upon arriving at the embassy, Hirohito immediately spoke privately with MacArthur, with only one interpreter present, and the contents of the conversation were kept strictly secret. The Emperor's visit comes at a time of upheaval in Japan, with the people in turmoil due to food shortages domestically, and the Soviet Union repeatedly criticizing Hirohito from abroad. All of this may be the subject of this discussion. In addition, the main Japanese war criminals will be formally tried in three days, which may also be related. The Emperor's previous visit to MacArthur was on September 27th of last year, after which Hirohito's authority plummeted. Today's visit to MacArthur will likely not cause the same outrage among the Japanese people as the first time.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 31st Special Dispatch] The Imperial Household Ministry denied that Emperor Hirohito's 90-minute visit to MacArthur this morning was in any way related to the issue of abdication.

### Border Dispute Incident Between Vietnam and Siam, French Authorities Issue Statement, Saying French Troops Entered Siam to Pursue Thugs, Siam Holds Utmost Patience, Hoping to Resolve This Peacefully

[Reuters, Paris, 30th Dispatch] The French High Commissioner to Vietnam recently issued an official report stating that French troops entered Siam on Friday of last week to pursue thugs. French troops only stayed in Siam for three hours and suffered slight casualties, with three Siamese soldiers killed or wounded. The incident was caused by about 50 to 80 thugs from Laos and Annam, who gathered some Siamese people and robbed a certain place in Laos along the Mekong River, so French troops pursued them. The Siamese government seems to be instigating them, with the suspicion of disturbing world sentiments, it is said.

[Reuters, London, 30th Dispatch] The Siamese Information Office in England issued a statement saying that Siam has been accused of engaging in major provocations, but its cities and villages have been subjected to heavy shelling. British and American observers who went to the scene of the incident with Siamese representatives were able to prove where the provocation came from.

Siam maintains a patient attitude under these acts of aggression, and strictly forbids residents from resisting, hoping to resolve this extremely regrettable incident peacefully.

### Associated Press Correspondent in Soviet Union Talks About US-Soviet Relations: Soviet Side Believes Anglo-American Bloc Certainly Exists, Suspicion Increases, Difficult to Achieve Understanding

[Associated Press, New York, 30th Dispatch] Associated Press correspondent Gilbert, stationed in Moscow for five years, recently returned to the country for vacation. Gilbert's wife is Russian, and he himself speaks Russian, giving him unique and insightful observations on Soviet affairs, incomparable to those who can only scratch the surface. The following is a record of his remarks on US-Soviet relations after returning home:

Although Secretary of State Byrnes stated that an Anglo-American bloc was not organized to oppose the Soviet Union, the general opinion on the Soviet side is that such a bloc certainly exists, it was so in the past, and it is so now. No matter how sincere the words, they can never eliminate this belief. The Anglo-American envoys in Moscow are well aware of this belief in the Soviet Union and often find it difficult to cope with, so both sides try their best to avoid it. Even recently, when the new US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, [Walter Bedell] Smith, arrived, several senior British expatriates intended to go to the airport to welcome him as usual, but the person in charge said, "It won't do. We cannot give the Soviet Union the impression that we are welcoming a new baseball hitter to the ballpark." The British, with good intentions, stayed home. The fact that the British and Americans speak the same language is also an unfortunate factor contributing to misunderstanding. Russians never know what the British and Americans are saying to each other, just like spectators in a ball game who do not know what the referees and players are saying to each other. One day, the reporter saw three or five British and Americans huddled together at a diplomatic banquet in Moscow, reciting poems to each other, while several Russians standing ten feet away were convinced that they were being mocked. Another time, I heard Russians discussing a new brand of cigarettes, while the British and Americans stood asking each other, "What are they doing?"

During the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Anglo-American advisory groups were careful to avoid the Soviet Union suspecting them of any joint action. When we reporters told Soviet friends about this, they invariably replied, "Of course, you have a guilty conscience, you feel trapped." Suspicion of organizing blocs has developed to this extent.

Eighteen months ago, when commenting on this issue, the reporter sent a telegram saying, "The Russians believe there are ten anti-Soviet partnerships between the British and Americans." The censor insisted on changing the wording to "The Russians hope that the British and Americans do not have any partnership against the Soviet Union." Twelve months later, the reporter emphasized this even more, and the telegram was passed by the censor. Since former British Prime Minister Churchill delivered his speech in Missouri, if anyone telegraphed that the Russians do not believe that a partnership is in progress, I do not believe it could have been easily passed by the censor.

US Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower and Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz recently testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, saying that the land and naval forces of the Western Hemisphere must cooperate, which of course sparked new suspicions. Eisenhower said, "Anyone looking at the globe can see that the shortest air route from Europe or Asia to the United States is through the Arctic." Upon hearing this, the Russians will inevitably become more alarmed. They will ask, "Who else is in Europe or Asia besides us?" Most people will also go on to ask, "This is the shortest route from the United States to Europe and Asia, but who has the atomic bomb?" In addition, the entire Western Hemisphere collective defense plan will undoubtedly spark intense discussion among Soviet authorities.

The reporter is speaking frankly, only wanting to express the Soviet viewpoint. Today, Russians are muttering to themselves, and even openly stating, that not only does a certain country oppose and reject the Soviet Union's policies towards certain European countries, but it is now escalating things, advocating for military cooperation between the United States and South American countries. In Soviet eyes, if this is not foolish, it must be extreme hypocrisy.

### Unemployed Workers from the Rear Arriving in Shanghai Petition for Re-employment, Resulting in Riots; Five Police Officers Injured at the Social Affairs Bureau; Zhu Xuefan and Zhao Banfu Moved to Tears During Admonishment

[Our Dispatch] Private factories that relocated inland during the war successively closed down after the victory. The workers who followed the factories inland were assisted by organizations such as the Good Relief General Office and the Labor Association, and after overcoming many difficulties, were repatriated to Shanghai. Up to now, two to three thousand people have arrived successively, of which more than a thousand people have been taken in by the Good Relief General Office at the Compatriot Reception Center. Because of their contribution to war production, they demanded priority in re-employment after arriving in Shanghai. However, due to the large number of unemployed in the city, relevant authorities made various efforts, but only more than 140 people were able to find work. The picture shows a group of petitioning workers (photographed by Yu Chuangshuo).

Yesterday morning, a thousand unemployed workers from the rear gathered on the Bund, lined up, and holding flags, went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. Representatives were sent in to negotiate with Zhao Banfu, the Director of the Labor Department. A portion of the workers waiting outside also wanted to enter, but were stopped by the police guarding the door, resulting in a conflict. The workers, emotionally agitated, smashed the windows of the Labor Department and other items, seized several police firearms, and injured five police officers, causing great chaos in the Social Affairs Bureau. After hearing the news, the police bureau dispatched a large number of fully armed police officers to the scene to suppress the riot. The mounted patrol team also rushed to the scene, and machine guns were set up in front of the Social Affairs Bureau, with hundreds of police officers deployed for guard, making the situation very tense. The injured police officers were sent to the police hospital by ambulance. The seized firearms were all recovered after much persuasion. However, the workers refused to leave, and a stalemate ensued for a long time. Director Wu Xuan, who was attending a municipal meeting at the time, rushed to the scene after hearing the news. He summoned the representatives of the workers to admonish them separately, pointing out that their actions of attacking the police and seizing firearms were inappropriate. The worker representatives also took the blame and issued a letter of repentance, acknowledging that they would hand over the perpetrators. Then, Zhu Xuefan of the Labor Association and Zhao Banfu, the Director of the Labor Department, came out to address all the workers. Mr. Zhu first stated: When you initially came from Chongqing, the Labor Association was responsible for participating in the matter. After arriving in Shanghai, you still had no work and have been wandering until today, leading to this incident. I, Zhu Xuefan, am sorry to everyone. However, today's matter should be discussed in two parts: one is the issue of demanding re-employment and relief, and the other is the issue of overstepping boundaries. Regarding the issue of re-employment and relief, (1) the Gongda Yarn Factory guarantees to be completed within two weeks as a centralized reception center, (2) starting tomorrow, each person will be given a bag of relief flour, and those with families will be calculated according to the roster, (3) relief will continue until the employment problem is resolved, and a request will be made to the government to appropriately issue pocket money, (4) a mechanism for handling labor disputes will be established to be responsible for resolving the re-employment problem, (5) it is proposed to establish cooperative factories, with the government providing machinery and capital, and unemployed workers participating in work with slightly lower wages, with the surplus used as the factory's fund, and labor participating in management. Regarding the issue of exceeding boundaries, Mr. Zhu stated that he was sorry to the government in public and to Director Wu in private. Now that things have come to this, he hoped that they would acknowledge their mistakes and apologize. He and Director Zhao Banfu would negotiate. He would take responsibility for today's events, hoping that everyone would listen and return. Then, Zhao Banfu, the Director of the Labor Department, addressed the workers, stating that everyone knew whether he had been speaking for the workers since the Interim Council. And the Gongda Yarn Factory was also something he had negotiated and fought for for three days. Today, he had nothing else to say, only two sentences: first, please go back, and second, the future matters will be the responsibility of Comrade Zhu Xuefan and himself to resolve. Both Zhu and Zhao were moved to tears when advising the workers. The unemployed workers were mostly moved and followed the advice, lining up and withdrawing, shouting slogans in front of the Municipal Government on their way back to the Bund before dispersing. However, the issue of re-employment still awaits consultation and resolution by various directors and relevant authorities.

### Yuan Ludeng Sentenced to a Long Imprisonment

[Our Dispatch] Yuan Ludeng, one of the [Three Elders] of Shanghai, has been sentenced to life imprisonment after Tang Shoumin. When Yuan was brought to court at around 9:00 yesterday morning, he was still wearing a gray gown and black shoes, looking listless. Because of his hearing impairment, he had to cover his ear with his right hand to hear the court clerk read the sentence. His face turned ashen, and he nodded slightly. Judge Zhai politely said that he could request a retrial. When leaving the court, Yuan muttered to himself, asking God to know his sins, and his eyes were slightly red. His family members and children, about eight or nine people, were listening and cried to Yuan incessantly, and prayed to God together, while Yuan reluctantly comforted them, saying, "It's okay." (The picture shows the family members following and comforting him as he was being escorted back, and Yuan forcing a smile.)

As for the cases of Pi Shaozhang and Zhou Buguang, there was insufficient suspicion, and no prosecution was filed.

### Judgment in the Yuan Ludeng Case

Facts: Yuan Ludeng was the manager of the Ning Shao Shipping Company and had served as a Chinese Director of the former Shanghai International Settlement Board of Directors for many years. After the fall of Shanghai, Yuan Ludeng continued to serve as a pseudo-director and chairman of the Shanghai Pseudo-Municipal Chamber of Commerce. In September 1943, the Pseudo-Nanjing Government Executive Yuan, in conjunction with the enemy, organized the Rice and Grain Control Association, with Yuan Ludeng serving as the chairman and a member of the Pseudo-Nanjing Materials Control Review Committee, purchasing rice and grain for the enemy to supply military needs, until he resigned at the end of June 1944. In February 1942, the International Settlement, due to explosions by our patriots, was uneasy. The central area of the Settlement was divided into six districts and blockaded. The defendant, relying on the power of the enemy and puppets, organized Baojia, served as the chairman of the Preparatory Committee in February, handed it over to the Pseudo-Police Department, checked household registrations, hoping to eliminate our patriotic elements, and also served as a member of the Pseudo-New National Sports Association. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he was detained by the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission and transferred to the prosecutor of this court for investigation and prosecution.

Reasons: The defendant, Yuan Ludeng, has confessed without reservation to the various positions he held in the pseudo-government. This is consistent with the confession he made to the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, and there are contemporary newspapers that can prove it, which shows that his confession is consistent with the facts. Although he argued in this court that the Pseudo-Materials Control Review Committee and the Pseudo-New National Sports Association were both in Nanjing, and although there were pseudo-orders, he did not attend, etc., except for the Pseudo-New National Sports Association, there is no active evidence to prove that the defendant attended. Regarding the Pseudo-Materials Control Review Committee, the defendant did attend, as evidenced by the Shanghai "Shen Bao" of November 3, 1943, which cannot be refuted by empty words. According to the testimony, the chairman of the Rice and Grain Control Association was a natural member of the Materials Control Review Committee. Therefore, the records of this newspaper are especially worthy of reference. What should be investigated now is whether the defendant colluded with the enemy to plot resistance against the country, and other crimes. The Rice and Grain Control Association was an organization jointly formed by the Pseudo-National Government and the enemy Japan. In name, it was subordinate to the Pseudo-Executive Yuan, but it had five Japanese members and five or six Chinese members, two deputy chairmen, one being Chen Guoquan and the other being Japanese Ueda Kenjiro, as repeatedly testified by the defendant and supported by the fifth piece of evidence submitted by the defense counsel (Commercial Control Regulations), which clearly stated that it was an organization jointly formed by China and Japan. In this enemy-puppet joint organization, serving as the chairman is sufficient to establish the crime of colluding with the enemy. Moreover, judging from the defendant's usual statements, one said, "At the moment when the protection of the Greater East Asia War is being actively launched, sufficient food and soldiers are important conditions for establishing and protecting the country, and it has a very close relationship with the survival and honor of the Greater East Asia's future. This association bears the entrustment of the 'Central Government' and the hope of the national masses." (See "New China Daily" on October 20, 1943) Another said, "Now fortunately relying on the Allied countries to preside over the justice of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, I cannot help but admire them. Our country's supply of materials, especially the continuous supply of main food, is really our inescapable responsibility." (See "New China Daily" on January 10, 1944) A third said, "China has joined the war and is fighting on the same front with the Allied countries to defeat Britain and the United States." (See "Shen Bao" on March 31, 1945) A fourth said, "I am willing to continue to work hard, so that we can move towards the path of completing the Greater East Asia War." (See "New China Daily" on June 5, 1945), etc. and the second piece of evidence submitted by the counsel (Commercial Control Association Publication), which contains the rice distribution situation of the Rice Control Association for China and Japan, viewed in conjunction with each other, proves beyond doubt that he colluded with the enemy to plot resistance against the country, purchasing rice and grain to supply the enemy's military needs. Although it was argued that the speeches published in the newspaper were not his original intention, and the defense counsel even claimed that they were revised and proposed by Chen Binhe as proof in the twenty-second piece of evidence, it was found that this piece of evidence was published in November 1945, many days after the defendant was arrested, and was written by a private person after the fact, and was not the defendant's statement after seeing the newspaper that year, so it cannot be adopted. Moreover, the defendant's speech contains the phrase "especially the continuous supply of main food, which is an inescapable responsibility." It is consistent with the rice and grain control distribution in the second piece of evidence, which targets the military rice of China and Japan, and cannot be denied by empty words. Although it was also argued that the purpose of my taking office as the chairman of the Rice Control Association was twofold: (1) to increase the price of rice from 200 yuan per stone to 820 yuan. (2) to supply household rice, and to resign immediately if the household rice was not available, both of which were beneficial to the people. It is not known that the enemy's direct purchase of rice, paying a low price of 200 yuan per stone, would inevitably arouse the anger of the people and lead to common resistance, making it easier for materials to escape, and the result would ultimately be failure. Therefore, there was a mixed organization of the Rice Control Association, which changed the enemy's previous direct requisition to indirect requisition, acting as an accomplice of the tiger, and the circumstances were obvious. According to Article 2, paragraph 1, item 5 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, the evidence of his colluding with the enemy to purchase grain is conclusive. As for increasing the price of rice, it not only helped the enemy and puppets win over the people but also facilitated centralized procurement, both of which were acts that benefited the enemy and puppets and harmed the country, which was sufficient to increase his guilt. In addition, the provision of household rice was not only limited in quantity, but also almost "cut off." The defendant's statement was clear, showing that his procurement of grain was mainly for military rice and that he placed the people's household rice in an insignificant position, which was more obvious and left no room for denying responsibility. The defendant's organization of Baojia due to the explosions in the settlement by our patriots and the enemy's unrest was also confessed without reservation. Anyone who, during the War of Resistance, considered stabilizing order for the enemy and puppets was an act that benefited the enemy and puppets, which is self-evident. Moreover, relying on the power of the enemy and puppets to serve as the chairman of the preparatory committee, according to the provisions of Article 3 of the same regulations, cannot absolve him of the crime of plotting resistance against the country. In summary, the defendant's actions before and after not only constitute a crime under Article 2, paragraph 1, item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, but also violate the provisions of item 5 and Article 3 of the same article, which is based on a single act of colluding with the enemy. Although he has committed several crimes, he should be punished for one of the most serious crimes. As for the claim of his counsel that the defendant resigned in May 1944 and submitted a certificate from Hongqiao Sanatorium, claiming that the crime was committed before June 1, 1944, which is in line with the method of commutation, it is inconsistent with the defendant's confession in the Military Intelligence Bureau, which stated, "By the time of May, there was no way, so I decided to resign, and only achieved the goal by the end of June." This shows that the defendant's departure from the relationship of the Rice Control Association was indeed after June. Even if there was a fact of being admitted to the hospital for recuperation, it is not enough to prove that the responsibility has been resolved, so it cannot be used as a reason for commutation. The defendant colluded with the enemy to plot resistance against the country, purchasing grain to supply military needs, and the circumstances are indeed serious. He should have been sentenced to the death penalty to show a warning. However, before committing the crime, he had rescued refugees, and his usual conduct was not bad, so he was temporarily spared from death and sentenced to life imprisonment under Chinese law. All property should be confiscated according to law. Based on the above conclusions, it should be based on Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, item 1 of paragraph 1 of Article 2, item 5, Article 3, Article 8, paragraph 1, Article 9, Article 1, Article 2, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, Article 55, and Article 37, paragraph 1, and the judgment is made as in the main text.

This case was executed by Prosecutor Xia Luli attending court, May 31, 1946, Shanghai High Court Criminal Court Presiding Judge Xiao Xie, Judge Yang Ding, Judge Feng Zhidong.

### Seven Traitors Interrogated, One is a Woman Whose Husband is an Interpreter

[Our Dispatch] The High Court heard several traitor cases yesterday: (1) Shen Xiaoyan, originally a field reporter for the Huamei Evening News, later surrendered to the enemy's Southern Agency of the Marine Corps, serving as a communicator and editor.

### Military Tribunal Opens Trial of the Case of the Village Chief Who Died Tragically Rescuing an American Pilot; Seven Criminals Including the Japanese Military Police Squad Leader Rely on Denials; Deny Participating in the Murder of Monk Xue

[Our Dispatch] After the victory, the family members of Xue Heshang, the village chief of Sanlintang Binpu Township in Pudong, who tragically died from injuries sustained after being tortured by the former Pudong Military Police Squad for rescuing an American pilot, reported the case to the Third War Zone Prisoner of War Management Office. On February 9th of this year, a total of seven criminals in the case were arrested and transferred to the local Military Tribunal. After investigation, Prosecutor Gu Yongquan found the facts to be true and filed a public prosecution. The first trial was held at 10:00 yesterday morning. Due to the complexity of the case, it was temporarily changed to an investigation court, presided over by Military Judge Jiang Baolian. The first defendant, Kuboe Yasuharu, testified that before the surrender, he was the squad leader of the Special Higher Division of the Pudong Military Police Squad. In January 1945, an American pilot landed in Pudong, and the Shanghai Military Police ordered him to investigate. Later, the detachment leader Ono received an anonymous letter and learned that Xue Heshang had let him go, so he sent Hirata Kiyokazu to arrest Xue. He was released the first time because he had no confession, but at the weekly meeting of the Shanghai Military Police, it was deemed necessary to investigate Xue Heshang again, so he was arrested again and held in prison for three or four days before he died. He denied participating in the confession. The other witnesses Gunji Katayama, Corporal Omori Mitsuru, Sergeant Noma Sadaji, Private First Class Morishita Muneyuki, Sergeant Major Sasaya Tsutato, and Sergeant Hayahara Isao testified in a similar manner, denying participating in the murder. At 12:30, the court announced that it would summon witnesses to court at 2:00 pm and then conduct another hearing. At that time, the victim's family members, Xue Quangen, etc., came to court and recounted the detailed situation at the time, until 5:30 pm. The court announced that the trial would be reopened at a later date.

### Xu Jiqing Talks About Grain Loans; Verification of Grain Merchant Accounts Will Be Announced Soon; If There is Any Embezzlement, It Will Be Punished According to Law

The Grain Department's grain merchant loan program in this city, after its implementation, coincided with fluctuations in grain prices, which has aroused speculation from all sides. According to Speaker Xu Jiqing: This 100 million yuan loan is a trial program, and the generation of borrowers is purely based on recommendation methods. The total amount of grain transported by the loan merchants is about 35,000 shi or more. The purpose of the grain loan was originally to support the grain merchants' transportation capacity, in order to dredge the grain source in this city, but the result was the evil phenomenon of the rice market disturbance on April 29, so it was decided to end the trial period. Regarding the application of the loan, there are extremely detailed regulations in the grain loan method. It is heard that in addition to the Grain Administration Office sending personnel to investigate households based on the sales report, the audit committee also commissioned a credible accounting firm to be responsible for verifying the accounts of each grain merchant. It will soon be announced whether the loan merchants comply with the loan methods. As for the profits obtained by the loan merchants due to the opportunity of the sudden rise in rice prices, the audit committee will decide on the disposal methods after the account verification is completed. If the grain merchants fail to follow the regulations and embezzle, they should be punished according to law.

### Opening of Campaign Lawsuit Case: Xia Gongkai and Others Sue the City Government for Illegal Malpractice; The Court Orders the Plaintiffs Have No Right to Investigate Administrative Measures; Zhang Xiaosong Should Be Summoned to Court

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the first city councilor election lawsuit in this city opened at the District Court. The plaintiffs, lawyers Xia Gongkai and four others, Yan Cai Ding, Lu Chaohai, and Fang Zhong, were present in court. The defendants were represented by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the People's Administration Office, and Li Xuexun, Chief of the Third Section of the same office, as the legal representatives of the Municipal Government, represented by lawyers Zhang Shijian, Qin Liankui, and Chen Dingming as litigation agents for defense. After the court session began, Xia stated first: "There were four illegal aspects in this election: (1) candidates did not complete registration and public announcement; (2) all voters did not complete registration and public announcement; (3) originally, district people's representatives should have supervised the ballot counting, but in fact, there were no district people's representatives at all, and they were appointed or hired by the Municipal Government; (4) voters were elected in different districts. As for the matter of malpractice, there are Jiang Tianbai in the 16th district and Cen Zhiyuan in the 5th district who can list specific facts, requesting the court to summon them at the next hearing." Subsequently, Zhang Xiaosong and Li Xuexun gave statements of facts. Finally, Xia Gongkai pointed out that the defendants' answers were inaccurate, and he and Director Zhang argued with each other. Judge Xu then declared: The plaintiffs have no right to investigate the various administrative measures of the Municipal Government one by one. At 10:40 AM, the court adjourned and rescheduled for another hearing.

Another Election Lawsuit: Improper Handling of Spoiled Ballots

Also, in another election lawsuit, namely the case of Cao Shengzhi, a candidate in the 8th district, suing the district office for improperly handling spoiled ballots, the plaintiff retained lawyer Huang Renda as the litigation agent, and the plaintiff himself did not appear in court. The defendant was still represented by Li Xuexun. According to Huang Renda: The plaintiff received 1,648 votes, and could have been ranked as the third alternate, but more than thirty votes were invalidated due to illegible handwriting, resulting in him being ranked fourth and unable to be elected. Then Chief Li presented 404 ballots, which were inspected on the spot. The spoiled ballots only numbered fifteen. Huang Renda then requested that the person in charge of the district be summoned. The court ordered a re-hearing next Monday at 10:00 AM.

### Guangxi University Relocates to Guilin for Re-establishment; President Chen Jianxiao Comes to Nanjing to Report on His Work

[Our Newspaper Nanjing News] Chen Jianxiao, President of National Guangxi University, recently traveled from Liujiang via Chongqing to Nanjing to report to the Ministry of Education. It is understood that Guangxi University, established in 1928, was painstakingly managed by the late President Ma Junwu, with a roughly established scale and well-equipped facilities, especially in colleges such as science, engineering, agriculture, etc., which can be called the most complete university in the southwest. However, in 1944, it encountered the "Hunan-Guangxi" and "Hunan-Guizhou" wars and was relocated to Rongjiang, Guizhou, suffering heavy losses. Last year, due to the narrowness of the temporary campus in Liuzhou, there was a so-called "return to Wuzhou" movement, forming a trend, which was unfortunate. After the Ministry of Education submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, the school should still be relocated back to Guilin for resumption of classes, and Mr. Chen was appointed as the president, which was generally welcomed and stabilized the situation. Mr. Chen told reporters: (1) Guangxi University has always been known for its pure and studious atmosphere. The previous "return to Wuzhou" movement was not too bad in order, and the reports that students carried hand-held grenades, coerced the school, issued more than 10 million legal tender, beat student Li Xiulong to death and robbed public property, and went to Wuzhou, etc., were all fabrications. After repeated investigation by the author, it can be responsibly stated. (2) The school is now scheduled to resume classes in Guilin in early June, without a summer vacation, to make up for the second semester of the last academic year. (3) More than half of the original Liangfeng campus was destroyed. Although it was widely repaired, it was still not enough. The Ministry of Education and the Resources Committee were requested to allocate the former Radio Engineering Equipment Factory of the Guilin General Bridge as the campus. After several consultations, Director Qian of the Resources Committee agreed to lease it. (4) There is a great shortage of professors in departments such as Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Economics, Accounting and Banking, and Chemical Engineering. In addition to appointing a part in Chongqing, it is still necessary to recruit from all aspects. (5) The loss of books and instruments is extremely large, and it is planned to investigate and purchase some to supplement them. (6) Plans for funding and summer make-up classes, and enrollment for the next academic year are being requested from the Ministry of Education. Mr. Chen has been away from the school for three weeks, and will fly to Guilin in the next few days, preparing to do his best to develop Guangxi University to restore its former appearance. (Yu)

### Sichuan Sugar Industry Inspection Group Arrives in Shanghai; Two Sugar Factories Relocated from Taiwan to Sichuan; Demonstration Sugar Factories Established in Zizhong and Neijiang

The Sichuan Province Sugar Industry Inspection Group recently arrived in Shanghai via Chongqing and Beijing. The head of the group, Chen Rangqing, flew to Taiwan a few days ago. Inspection specialists Li An and Li Limin will also go to Taiwan for inspection. According to Mr. Li, since the introduction of Indian sugarcane varieties, the sugarcane production in the Zizhong and Neijiang areas of Sichuan Province has gradually increased, and the quality has also improved. However, due to outdated refining methods, the production volume is not high, and the production cost is also high. The current pressing equipment can only extract 50-60% of the sugar content from the sugarcane. The remaining 40-50% is discarded in the bagasse. This bagasse is not even enough for fuel to boil the sugar, falling short of the fuel needed from the hills by two-thirds. The annual sugar production in Sichuan is about 500,000 tons. During the war, Sichuan Province lacked gasoline, so molasses was used to refine alcohol as a substitute for gasoline. Now, in order to build a new Sichuan and improve agricultural and industrial production and technology, the Sichuan Provincial Government and the Sichuan sugar industry, in order to improve Sichuan sugar production, Chen and others visited the new Minister of Economic Affairs, Wang Yiwu, and the Chairman of the Resources Committee, Qian Changzhao, and the heads of the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office and Taiwan Sugar Corporation in Beijing to discuss improving Sichuan sugar. The Ministry and the Resources Committee also agreed that Sichuan sugar needed improvement. It was also agreed with the Taiwan authorities to relocate two medium-sized sugar factories from the province to Zizhong and Neijiang in Sichuan as a demonstration of sugar production. These two factories are enemy and puppet industries that were taken over, one with a capacity of 500 tons and the other with 300 tons (sugarcane crushing capacity). The Resources Committee will also invest in this machinery at a price, and in the future, in addition to the appropriation from the Sichuan Construction Department, the factory construction and operating funds for the two factories will be raised by sugarcane farmers and the sugar industry to jointly establish a government-business sugar factory. The sugar making machine is very suitable for the needs of Sichuan Province, and the efficiency of the machine is also higher than the old one. It can extract 97-98% of the sugar content from the cane, and the bagasse can also be used for boiling sugar and is more than enough. Therefore, this trip has been helped by the central government, and a detailed investigation and research will be conducted in Taiwan, and experts in sugar-making and sugarcane planting from Taiwan will be invited to Sichuan to jointly improve the process. They also intend to receive the machinery of the two factories for shipping to Sichuan after the inspection. If transportation is convenient, this machine can be used in Sichuan this winter. It is reported that the Sichuan sugar industry has recently launched a large-scale machine sugar factory.

### Introducing a Tool for Learning English

— Tong Fang

The most difficult part of learning any language is not grammar or rhetoric, but the active use of everyday words and idioms, and various special idiomatic usages. To thoroughly understand the active use of words and idioms and special idiomatic usages, one must pay special attention and careful observation when reading or writing.

A language has its own special structure and its own special usages. Unless you have a good foundation in this, you will never master that language. Chinese students often take many detours when learning English because they lack good tools for learning English, especially tools that specifically instruct on usage.

The "Dictionary of English Usage," newly published by Jingwen Bookstore, can make up for this shortcoming. The author, Ge Chuanzhen, is a self-taught English scholar and professor at Datong University. This book provides a very detailed analysis of the active use of words and idioms and special idiomatic usages in English and American languages. It provides many examples and specifically points out the places where Chinese people are most likely to make mistakes or misunderstandings. It is indeed a very practical tool for Chinese students. I remember that Dr. Lin Yutang published an article on how to learn English in the "Middle School Student" magazine during the war, which also mentioned the problem of idiomatic usages. However, few people have been willing to spend a lot of effort to compile a dictionary of idiomatic usages, so Mr. Ge's book is very worthy of our attention.

According to the author in the preface, the completion of this dictionary took nearly ten years, which shows the author's dedication. The book uses simple Chinese and clear examples to explain the correct usage of all common words, idioms, and structures in English, paying special attention to what Chinese students are prone to misuse, misunderstand, or various other problems. As the author said: "It is a unique English usage dictionary made by Chinese people for Chinese people. I say made by Chinese people for Chinese people - yes, I am Chinese, and those who use this dictionary are also Chinese. Only Chinese people (not necessarily me) can make this book or a similar book; and only Chinese people need this kind of book." From this, we can see how suitable it is for Chinese people's needs.

In addition to referring to several dictionaries and grammar books, the author also referred to many literary and non-literary books. He extracted and compared them at any time from these many books. The biggest advantage is that it is not limited by the rules of grammarians and rhetoricians, and indeed there are some places where the author's own unique insights are developed.

I am convinced that people who are learning English will be able to get a lot of help from this unique "Dictionary of English Usage."

### An Introduction to "A History of Western Philosophy" by Wu Fang

This book is based on A. Weber's "History of Philosophy" and incorporates the essence of other books, but it also contains the author's own unique opinions. In terms of historical narration, the chronology is based on the Common Era, and events related to the entire Chinese culture are accompanied by the Chinese chronology to facilitate comparison with the evolution of Chinese culture.

In terms of content, the author focuses on major events in the history of philosophy, detailing the past and neglecting the present. Modern philosophy is narrated up to Hegel. The author has his own intentions in this regard. He believes that new philosophical systems have not been established since Hegel. Although many philosophers have hoped to establish their own philosophical systems, they have not succeeded in fact. Their thoughts are at most a continuation of the philosophies of Kant and Hegel. At the same time, the author feels that the modern era is closer to us and easier to grasp, while the ancient philosophical thoughts are too far away from the present, so a detailed narration may help readers to have a deeper understanding of the distant ancient philosophical thoughts.

The entire book is divided into three parts to describe Greek philosophy, medieval philosophy, and modern philosophy, in addition to the "Introduction". From here, we can see what kind of spiritual life the people of Greece, the cradle of Western philosophy, once lived, how Greek philosophy continued to develop in the Middle Ages, and then make us realize the origin and characteristics of modern human spiritual life, how the methodology of science was established, and the current state of philosophical development.

I feel that the difference between this "A History of Western Philosophy" and other similar books is that the author's motivation for writing is to meet the needs of modern people. He believes that today's China should strive to "complete modernization". Modernization, to put it bluntly, is Westernization—"the entire cultural level created by modern Western science, technology, thought, and spirit, thereby running through everything in today's most advanced social organizations, political institutions, and lifestyles." Indeed, the fruits of modern Western culture were slowly cultivated from ancient philosophical thoughts. We must trace back to the source. This is the main reason why we must study the development of Western philosophical thoughts. It can also be said that the author wrote this book in order to meet the practical needs of the present.

Therefore, the biggest advantage of this book is that it is written from the perspective of Chinese people. We can see the personality revealed by the author - the personality of a Chinese person. In order to make this book more popular, the author often remembers the words in the "Cheng Shi Yi Shu": "When establishing words, you want to contain meaning, so that those who know virtue will not be suppressed, and those who have no virtue will not be confused." It can be seen that the author has savored his words and hopes to be as popular as possible. The book ends with thirteen annotated entries on Western philosophy entry books, which are of great reference value.

### Reading "The System and Criticism of Chinese Painting Theory"

— Wen Zhaotong

Written by Li Changzhi

Printed and published by the Independent Publishing House

A work that comprehensively studies Chinese painting theory and establishes a system is rarely seen in the domestic publishing industry. Ten years ago, Liu Haisu wrote "On the Six Laws of Chinese Painting" (Zhonghua edition), in which he pointed out the core and development of the theory of "Six Laws" in order to understand Chinese painting. It is a masterpiece after scientific organization. According to the two methods of handling academic materials defined by Werner Mahrhilz, it belongs to the historical, as for the systematic-philosophical treatment of Chinese painting theory to understand Chinese painting, in the impoverished Chinese academic world, such a thin "The System and Criticism of Chinese Painting Theory" can be said to be the only one.

The author handles the entire Chinese painting with an attitude of opposing "only can be comprehended, cannot be expressed," and he advocates the use of modern language to express it, which is very valuable.

The book's argument focuses on the art of the Song and Yuan dynasties, because the author confirms that Chinese painting reached its peak with the people of the Song and Yuan dynasties.

The entire book raises the following four questions as a concrete method for comprehensively understanding Chinese painting.

(1) The subjective problem of Chinese painting.

(2) The object problem of Chinese painting.

(3) The utensil problem of Chinese painting.

(4) The general art problem of Chinese painting.

Applying Kant's aesthetic theories: "The sublime must always be great, but the beautiful can be small. The sublime must be simple and clean, but the beautiful can be embellished and adorned." and "Older people have more sublimity, while younger people have more beauty." and Winkelmann: "From simplicity and unity, all beauty turns into sublimity." and other aesthetic theories, to conclude that Chinese painting is sublime and masculine. Although this statement is not entirely correct, it cannot be denied that it is the author's unique point of view.

In the "Conclusion," the author further affirms: "Chinese painting has great value and permanent value, but at the same time I feel that it has no future and has already passed." This is also quite correct.

However, the social reasons for the occurrence and development of Chinese painting, and the social reasons that constitute "sublime", "masculine", "great value", "permanent value", "no future", and "already passed" have not been examined. Therefore, the author can only abstractly use an aesthetic concept to compare and make judgments, which must be admitted as a shortcoming of the book.

### Introduction to Police Books Written by Zheng

— Yang Guozhen

There used to be two good sayings: "You hate to read too little when you need to, and you don't know the difficulty until you experience it." Police books have not been paid attention to by ordinary police officers for a long time before the victory: after the victory, it seems that it should not be the era of incompetent officials, and most police officers want to reform everything, so they are eager to search for police books everywhere, especially the books of Mr. Zheng Zongkai, a famous figure in the police world, are not easy to buy. Good books are only starting to feel important now, when will good people start to feel valuable? I searched for more than half a year, and finally found several Zheng's books from friends in the police world in Beijing and Shanghai, and now I will introduce them to inform friends in the police world across the country.

(1) General Theory of Police Law (First Edition and Revised Edition) - This was written by Mr. Zheng Zongkai when he was teaching at the Central Police Academy before the war. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, it was sent to the Commercial Press for printing in Hong Kong, and the content is not as rich as the revised edition. The revised edition was completed when he was the chief of staff of the Chongqing Municipal Police Bureau during the war. He used fresh and lively experience to revise and modify it, and the opinions and comments in it are worthy of readers' reference. The attached "Outline for Administrative Reform during and after the War" is not limited to the police industry, and has guiding value for the entire administrative system of our country in the future; unfortunately, he put this thing in the general theory of police, and it is not easy for big people to see it. The book is not currently distributed in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, and must be purchased from the Commercial Press on Baixiang Street, Chongqing.

(2) Theory and Practice of Modern Police - This was published by Zhengzhong Bookstore when Mr. Zheng was in Chongqing during the Chongqing bombing. The content is extensive and quite substantial; it is a pity that some of it is outdated and impractical. These things, after a long time, I am afraid that they will not be welcomed by readers, but most of the things can still be used by readers for further study, which is not a completely practical book.

(3) On Police Patrol Duty - Also the Chongqing edition of Zhengzhong Bookstore, all of which are lecture notes taken by university students. The book is helpful for the reform of police sub-bureaus' external affairs; however, most of it is taken from the United Kingdom and the United States, and it does not mention whether China should implement "police control areas." The speech is very interesting, and the speaker is indeed knowledgeable, and is by no means empty talk. The book is quite beneficial to the staff of the Supervision Office of the Police Headquarters and the staff of each sub-bureau.

(4) Introduction to Police Mobilization - This book has a large version, but the number of pages is small, which is its shortcoming. Zheng Guangsheng rushed to write this manuscript and sent it to the Commercial Press in Shanghai for publication when the July 7th Incident occurred, and then moved west with the government. Although there is nothing to recommend in the book, it is still a relatively novel one in the publishing industry.

(5) Police Officer's Case Handling Manual - This book was published by Zhengzhong Bookstore in Chongqing. There is a preface by Zhao Chen, the current President of the Capital Higher Court, at the beginning of the volume,

In which it is said: "My friend Zheng Zongkai asked me to write a preface for his new book Police Officer's Case Handling Manual. After I read it, although there are only tens of thousands of words, the content is very broad. It covers all aspects of criminal law, criminal procedure law, penology, criminology, criminal policy, forensic medicine trial, psychology, detective science, fingerprinting, and criminal investigation methods and other criminal law knowledge, all of which are outlined and summarized. Mr. Zheng is not only an authority on police science, but also worthy of being an expert in criminal law. ... "Because case handling requires it, it is naturally welcomed by ordinary police officers. The advantage of the book is that it can enable readers to learn the systematic knowledge of handling illegal police and investigating criminal cases. According to people in the police circle, many police books are not written by the authors themselves, but are written by others on their behalf; the books written by Zheng Zongkai are definitely written by himself.
