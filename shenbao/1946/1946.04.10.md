### Military Three Representatives Fly to Pingtan, Transfer to Shenyang, and Investigate the Current Situation in Northeast China On-Site; Marshall May Return to China from Geneva

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 9th] The Military Three-Person Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the Northeast armistice issue. It is reported that the opinions put forward were very specific, but no agreement was reached. The meeting could not continue today.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] The representatives of the Three-Person Meeting are scheduled to depart from Chongqing on the 10th and fly to Pingtan, then transfer to Shenyang, in order to conduct on-site investigations of the current situation in the Northeast. It is also reported that the American representative attending the Three-Person Meeting in Shenyang is General Gillem (representing Marshal Marshall), and the government representative is Qin Decun, Vice Minister of the Military Affairs Department (representing Chen Cheng). Yu Dawei, Vice Minister, and Colonel Pi Zonggan will also go. It is heard that the CCP representative will be Mr. Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Major General Chen Shiqu and Secretary Zhang Wenjin. If Mr. Zhou is unable to go, Mr. Chen will represent him.

[United Press, Chongqing, 9th] The Military Three-Person Committee decided to depart on the 10th to make a final effort. If this trip fails, China's peace will only have one last hope in Special Envoy Marshall. Mr. Marshall is expected to return to China within a few days to personally take charge of the unification work.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 9th] Major General Gillem, representative of US Special Envoy to China Marshall, is scheduled to fly to Northeast China on the 10th. Zhou Enlai and a government representative will accompany him to try to salvage the increasingly serious situation in the Northeast. This decision was made last night after Gillem, Zhou Enlai, and Chen Cheng held a three-hour meeting. Reliable sources said that the Communist Party absolutely refused to allow the National Army to use the railways, while government officials said that the National Army would not hesitate to fight to occupy the main cities in the Northeast. Judging from the current situation, the Soviet troop withdrawal process is entirely beneficial to the Communist Party, because the National Army obviously cannot take over in time. Some figures in the Kuomintang believe that the Soviet Union is deliberately helping the Communist Party.

[United Press, Shenyang, 9th] The KMT and the Communist Party have obvious differences regarding the implementation of the armistice order in the Northeast. Personnel from the Military Mediation Department stationed in Shenyang are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the Military Three-Person Committee. The CCP stated that they also have the right to take over the areas from which the Soviet army has withdrawn. The National Government stated that the Sino-Soviet Treaty stipulates that the National Army should take over the areas formerly occupied by the Japanese and restore sovereignty. In fact, at China's request, Moscow has postponed the withdrawal from Shenyang and other cities so that the National Army can arrive and prevent the Communist Army from entering.

[Associated Press, Shenyang, 9th] The executive team, which was forced to turn back on the 8th due to the destruction of highway bridges 13 li outside Shenyang, took a train to Sipingjie on the afternoon of the 9th. The team leader is Colonel Cole.

Liu Handong, chairman of Liaobei, who previously guarded Sipingjie, has fallen ill due to overwork and has come to Beiping for medical treatment. According to Mr. Liu, after the fall of Sipingjie, the Communist Army asked him to establish a Liaobei Joint Government, which he firmly refused.

The original delegation had one head and six members, two of whom had already gone to Harbin with Marshal Ma. After Dong and others leave, only delegation members Chen Jiazhen and Cao Zhihu remain here. Mr. Chen is currently also the commander of the Fourth Security Corps, and Cao is the deputy commander of the Fourteenth Air Force Region, so they cannot go together. In the future, the diplomatic center of the Northeast will also shift from Changchun to Harbin. Chen Jiazhen will be responsible for diplomatic affairs in Changchun, and Wu Shiyu, Lai Bingquan and others will be responsible for the affairs of the headquarters.

[Another Dispatch] Intermittent gunfire is often heard here at night. According to official reports, there are still many unstable elements in the suburbs of Erdaochezi and Kuanchengzi, who often engage in armed fighting with the police teams searching for them. The situation around Changchun is particularly complex and serious. More than 10,000 communist troops who previously traveled from the Chinese Changchun Railway to Bu Hai, Hala Ha, Mishazi, and other places have launched an offensive on the Jichang Line (Jilin to Changchun) since yesterday. Battles have occurred at Kalun Station, 30 kilometers from Changchun, and Longjiabao, not far away. It is feared that the situation will become increasingly tense.

### The Border Affairs Department Will Establish Four Sections; To Be Established After Returning the Capital to Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] The Border Affairs Department, which was decided to be established by the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, may be established after the capital is returned to Nanjing.

In addition, the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee, which was decided to be restored by the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, has not yet entered the preparatory stage, because the scope of the committee's administration, that is, how to delineate the boundaries between provinces and counties and leagues and banners, is still under consideration by the central government. Relevant sources here speculate that Bai Yunti may be appointed as the chairman of the committee. Ma Mingzhou, a representative of the Eastern Mongolian Autonomous Government, flew to Changchun and then to Wangyemiao the day before yesterday. After staying in Beiping for more than a month, their original demands have been discussed. After the National Government recognized the independence of Outer Mongolia, the border urgently needs to be delineated.

### The Communist Party's Newspaper Declares "Creating Chaos"; Newspapers in Chongqing Condemn It

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] The Communist Party's newspaper in Chongqing, Xinhua Daily, reprinted the editorial of the Yan'an Liberation Daily on the 6th, titled "Refuting Chiang Kai-shek." People here were extremely indignant after reading it. Almost all of the newspapers in the wartime capital today used this incident as the subject of their editorials, condemning the Communist Party's disregard for the law and its hidden malicious intentions. They all believed that this was "a signal of the Communist Party's new actions." Today's Central Daily News editorial used this phrase as its title. The newspaper stated that the insulting remarks made by Xinhua Daily and Liberation Daily against the head of state were serious criminal acts under the criminal law, and politically, they were not ordinary political actions. This was the Communist Party's declaration of treason and creating chaos. They attempted to use this declaration to incite the people of the whole country, to incite the National Government, to cause terror among the people, to create chaos, and to arouse the government's anger, in order to shirk their responsibility for treason and creating chaos. The Communist Party used the three-year rectification movement to destroy humanity and human nature, just for the purpose of today's full-scale treason and full-scale chaos creation. The newspaper continued to analyze the reasons why the Communist Party was acting so perversely regarding the Northeast issue and the Political Consultative Conference, and concluded by saying that the Communist Party's strategy was to turn legality into illegality, while the National Government's policy was to turn illegality into legality. Therefore, the Communist Party believed that today, when Northeast sovereignty was about to be recovered, the National Government Committee was about to be reorganized, the National Assembly was about to be convened, and the constitution was about to be formulated and implemented, there would be no more opportunities for treason and creating chaos if they did not rebel and create chaos at this time. They therefore rose up and issued this declaration.

Dagong Bao, under the title "Excessive Propaganda," stated that the Xinhua Daily's article used sharp language and went to extremes in its abuse and insults, which was truly shocking, and feared for the future of the country. It then pointed out the various distortions of right and wrong and the lack of factual basis in Xinhua Daily's article, such as saying that Chairman Chiang "colluded with the enemy to betray the country and compromise and surrender." The newspaper said that "this kind of propaganda will inevitably lose the support of the people."

According to experienced aviation personnel, the aircraft may have lost its way in heavy fog and crashed into the Yangtze River or the sea. If it had encountered danger over land, there would not be no news for more than 20 days.

Qin Bogu, the president of the Xinhua Daily, died from his injuries. However, as of 7 p.m. tonight, none of these reports have been confirmed. It is said that when General Dai Li had an accident, it was once rumored in Nanjing that Ye Ting was on the same plane as Dai. Now there is a rumor that Ye Ting's plane has crashed. It is heard that Ye flew from Chongqing to Shanghai to replace General Ye Jianying, the Communist Party representative in the Beiping Military Mediation Department.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 9th] The US Army dispatched a search plane today to try to find a transport plane that apparently crashed near Xi'an yesterday.

He continued that, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, other items could also be added to the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference with the consent of the member governments. He also stated that the member governments must decide whether the Ruhr and Rhineland issues will be placed on the agenda.

[Reuters, London, 9th] It is reported that representatives from the British, American, and Soviet sides of the Foreign Ministers' Conference discussed the peace treaty with Hungary in London yesterday afternoon.

### Security Council Resumes Meeting Yesterday; Soviet Representative Gromyko Prepares to Attend; Britain and the United States Oppose Withdrawing the Soviet-Iranian Issue Case

[United Press, Washington, 9th] When the Security Council meets today, the Soviet Union is prepared to attend, but it seems that the disputes between the major powers cannot be eliminated as a result. Two issues may be raised for discussion in the Security Council. One is the Soviet Union's request that the Security Council cancel the agenda item of the Soviet-Iranian case and recognize its previous actions as unprepared and illegal. Unless this request is substantially revised, the United Kingdom and the United States will likely oppose it. The second is Poland's recommendation that the United Nations agree to sever diplomatic relations with the Franco regime in Spain.

[United Press, New York, 9th] The Soviet Union's request to the Security Council to withdraw the Iranian case, unless Iran agrees to the Soviet demands, otherwise Britain and the United States are expected to firmly oppose it. Iranian representative Ardalant has requested instructions from Tehran. The Council is scheduled to meet at 8:00 PM tonight (4:00 AM Shanghai time on Wednesday) to approve the rules of procedure prepared by the committee of experts. According to the opinions of the representatives, these rules are not expected to cause controversy.

[United Press, Moscow, 8th] According to reliable sources, the Iranian Prime Minister will follow the Soviet Union's lead and apply to the Council to withdraw its complaint as a measure of cutting off the fuel supply.

[United Press, Washington, 8th] Secretary of State Byrnes met with President Truman today for thirty-five minutes to discuss the development of the United Nations Security Council.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 8th] Poland submitted the Spanish issue to the Security Council. When a reporter asked Byrnes about the US position, Byrnes replied that based on the facts presented by France, the United States believes that this issue is not within the scope of the Security Council, but if other facts prove that the issue is indeed one that the Security Council should discuss, then it will be considered.

### League of Nations General Assembly Elects Vice Presidents; China Also Elected

The Argentine representative was also nominated as Vice President, but it did not materialize due to strong opposition from most countries.

Editorial

### Purification of Shanghai Society

The teachers' appreciation movement in Shanghai has already been advocated by the mayor and promoted by society. The goal of raising 200 million yuan in donations will not be difficult to achieve in these few days. If 3.5 million citizens each contribute 1,000 yuan, it can almost exceed the target by one-fold. Moreover, if wealthy merchants and dignitaries generously donate to show more respect to teachers on behalf of their children, then the amount of 200 million yuan is really not a big deal. Therefore, what we want to pay attention to today is not the teachers' appreciation donation movement, but how to purify Shanghai society.

Recently, Shanghai has been very strange. The entire society is almost enveloped by the atmosphere of lewdness and extravagance. The poison of this trend can simply spread throughout the country, making China unable to see a bright future after victory. American reporters sent reports saying that many places in China are experiencing famine, while the entire city of Shanghai is immersed in an atmosphere of feasting and revelry. This is just a partial depiction. We won't talk about anything else. Please, citizens, occasionally look at the newspapers and publications in the city, and occasionally listen to the broadcast songs in the air. You can imagine what kind of society this has become, what kind of world this has become!

Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Wang Dungen, a senior journalist, which said in general terms, "Recently, newspapers have greatly increased, and regular publications have sprung up like mushrooms. It is a pity that they often lightly adopt falsehoods, liberally launch attacks, and even add fuel to the fire, insulting the privacy of the home. Later, when the truth is revealed and it is known that the accusations are false, they are unwilling to correct them. This is because people like to use scandalous descriptions to please readers, and dislike clearing the wronged and praising the good. Therefore, general social news often only records the first half of the scandalous rumors and does not continue to publish the results of the redress." Although this passage only talks about journalistic ethics issues, in fact, we journalists, whether running daily newspapers, weekly newspapers, or magazines and publications, under the principles of freedom of the press and freedom of speech, we should be very careful to use the freedom we should enjoy under the law. If journalists rely on this precious freedom and think that since press censorship and book reviews have been abolished, they can arbitrarily indulge and do whatever they want, eagerly seeking after flesh, sensationalism, lewd paintings, and dirty words, fearing that they will be left behind, then even if we don't want to say the trite talk of "civilization is swept away," we can't help but cry for the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press!

As for radio stations and broadcast programs, their influence on society can reach families, women, children, peddlers, and porters. This latest scientific achievement was originally the best tool for social education, and its efficiency and value should be on par with movies. If the people who hold this tool can know whether their broadcast content is good or bad, and what kind of effect it can have, and everyone carefully selects materials and works diligently, it may not be impossible to make up for the deficiencies in school education. However, the lewd and sensual songs broadcast by newly emerging radio stations, echoing each other, with decadent sounds, can be heard everywhere. This is truly a sign of national demise, and how can it be something that China, after eight years of bloodshed and victory in the War of Resistance, should have?

It is said that the Municipal Police Bureau has already noticed these publications and songs, and believes that all words, pictures, and songs that are harmful to good morals must be strictly prohibited. This is indeed a matter concerning social education that should be seriously addressed. We must know that every move of Shanghai citizens, whether good or bad, can affect the whole country. The scandalous books and lewd paintings of Shanghai can be sold to any corner of the country! The lewd songs and frivolous tunes of Shanghai can let men and women all over the country learn to hum and sing! The corruption of Shanghai society can completely corrupt the entire Chinese society! The decline of Shanghai society can make the entire Chinese society tend towards decline! We should also know that today's Shanghai should never again be like Shanghai, which has been reduced to a semi-colonial state for a hundred years. The corruption of Shanghai's social atmosphere in the past was due to the existence of concessions under unequal treaties. Now the concessions have been taken back, and the unequal treaties have been abolished. Why do we still allow the stains to remain? This is probably because we have been poisoned by the anesthesia of the enemy puppet era. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in his book "China's Destiny," pointed out the profound impact of unequal treaties. He said, "When we separately examine the customs of society, we can immediately see that where the trends of the concessions lead, the general national scale manifests its licentious and romantic behavior in disorderly bad habits; the disorganized decadence manifests its chaotic and confused phenomena." He also said, "In the past hundred years, under the oppression of unequal treaties, the daily life of the Chinese people has been mired in decadent customs and bad habits. Therefore, everyone uses their own private interests to determine right and wrong, and their own private desires to determine good and evil. ... Therefore, the cunning and playful gain power in the countryside, and the sly and deceitful run rampant in the cities, sacrificing public safety and the happiness of others for their own selfish desires." After reading these two painful passages, and at the same time looking at the popular books and publications and listening to the popular songs, we really don't know why Shanghai after the victory is still such a Shanghai that is "mired in decadent customs and bad habits," why it allows the decadent customs and bad habits of the enemy puppet era to remain in Shanghai. If Shanghai society continues to be mired in this way, it is no wonder that the monthly reward for a teacher who teaches diligently is not enough to match the worker who sweeps and wipes the table in a "foreign firm," and is even far less than what a dancing girl and guide earn in one night. Where is the justice of society? Where is the righteousness of society?

In today's society in Shanghai, not only should we use the "teachers' appreciation movement" to awaken the vigilance of citizens, but we should especially launch a broad movement to purify society, so that the smoky atmosphere of the entire Shanghai can be swept away under the bright sunshine. "The governance of a country depends on whether the people's hearts are invigorated or decadent." Today, if we look at the typical example of Shanghai for the hearts of the Chinese people, it can be said that they are indulging in lewdness and extravagance to the extreme, and also withering to the extreme! If we don't make a painful effort to scrub, eliminate the dirt, and return to cleanliness, Shanghai will have an incurable day, and China will eventually suffer and inevitably tend towards danger and destruction again! The psychology of Shanghai people seems to be close to paralysis, and the society of Shanghai seems to be all whitewashed. Erotomania and gambling can almost be used as symbols to describe Shanghai people. When we read books, watch movies, listen to the radio, watch plays, and even in street conversations, market teahouses, eight or nine out of ten are enveloped in this crazy atmosphere. By extension, those who have seized speculative capital and are doing speculative buying and selling on the black market, today government bonds and stocks, tomorrow gold and US dollars, and the day after hoarding goods and hoarding them for profit, which one is not gambling frantically? When the gambling is over and the money is won, how many do not waste and revel in eroticism?

We want to remind Shanghai citizens that everyone must not forget the glorious history of January 28th and the glorious history of August 13th. The glory of Shanghai was created by the people of Shanghai. We must purify Shanghai society today, after the glorious victory, so that there are no traces of the stains of the era of concession oppression and the era of enemy puppet rule!

[Our Newspaper's Report] At the Shanghai Tilanqiao Prison yesterday, during the time when families of traitors delivered food, as the area was crowded at 8:05 a.m., the third batch of eighty major traitors, under the strict guard of armed personnel, were transported in six large military jeeps. There was also a separate vehicle carrying luggage and supplies.

Among these eighty people, two were women, the famous wealthy widows of Shanghai before the victory, namely Wu Yu'aizhen (wife of Wu Shibaobao, the demon of the puppet secret service) and Li Yejiqing (wife of Li Shiqun, the leader of No. 76 and puppet governor of Jiangsu Province). The remaining seventy-eight people were Chang Yuqing (leader of the puppet Anqing Gang), Pan Da (director of the puppet Huxi Special Police Department), Su Chengde (deputy director of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau), Wang Manyun (director of the puppet Rural Pacification Bureau), Xia Zhongming (captain of the puppet secret service team), Tang Haian (superintendent of the puppet Jianghai Customs), Zhang Songtao (deputy commander of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Garrison), Li Kaichen (chairman of the puppet Seamen's Party Headquarters), Sun Shaokang (president of the puppet Second Special District Court), Zhang Lianfang (chairman of the puppet Hardware Trade Association), as well as Jin Hangjian, Yan Zhongcheng, Zhang Guangdou, Jiang Jingjie, Wang Zhonggu, Hu Zhanggen, Dai Wenguang, Ge Shengwen, Feng Xiangfu, Yang Yun, Ruan Xingzhou, Ha Junqiu, Gu Huanzhang, Fu Hongyuan, Lu Laisheng, Shi Jianxun, Pan Amao, Zhang Yipu, Qian Jieyi, Mao Tiemei, Zhang Jie, Chang Dongming, Wu Qingyun, Zhang Hao, Sun Wenhai, Xu Zuiren, Yang Yongrui, Qian Xiaomin, Zeng Rong, Wang Jin, Xu Shiliang, Wu Yi, Ma Suiliang, Guo Ming, Huang Fusen, Shen Junping, Rao Shu, Dai Changling, Cheng Weisheng, Lu Hui, Wen Shisong, Liu Zhenqun, Shen Fenggang, Wu Yonghua, Wu Guozhi, Wu Yiming, Lu Maochang, Tao Zhongli, Li Chunrong, Lin Yifu, Liu Bin, Cai Bang, Huang Zhifang, Sun Liangui, Wang Jian, Zhou Ding, Qu Bin, Cheng Peter, Chen Bofan, Yu Geng, Chen Guowei, Qu Yiran, Bao Wenda, Chen Wanmei, Lu Xihou, Zhao Zizhi, Huang Chuchu, and Zhao Yuntai.

### Conclusive Evidence of Crimes by Yone Mura, Former Captain of the Japanese Military Police in Changshu; Military Tribunal Completes Investigation, Prosecution to Follow

Since its establishment on the 15th of last month, the Shanghai Military Tribunal began investigations on the 20th. According to a reporter's inquiry with relevant parties yesterday, Military Prosecutor Lin Wopeng has submitted more than twenty cases for investigation of Japanese war criminals in the past month. Among them, the most prominent case with conclusive evidence is that of Yone Mura, the former captain of the Japanese Military Police in Changshu. During his tenure, the crimes committed by this criminal were too numerous to recount. Wu Tiecheng, the current Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, is also one of the informants who reported the criminal's offenses. Mr. Wu recently sent a letter to the Military Tribunal, detailing the crimes of Yone Mura. At the same time, Prosecutor Lin also summoned numerous witnesses after interrogating the criminal. The investigation has now been completed, and the prosecution will be filed soon. It is widely expected that the first war criminal to be tried by the tribunal will undoubtedly be Yone Mura, and the trial is expected to begin around the 19th of this month.

### Three Cases of Traitors Tried by the High Court; Verdict in Yang Chunting's Case to be Announced on the 16th

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the High Court tried three cases of traitors, detailed as follows:

Hong Tingyi, a native of Zhongshan, Guangdong, joined the third section of the Dongchang Road branch of the puppet Shanghai Police Bureau as a third-class police officer in August of the 33rd year of the Republic. On January 27th of last year, while on duty, he led a team to arrest gamblers at the Chunquan Tea Garden at No. 1054 Yujiamiao. He brought seventeen gamblers back to the bureau. Afterwards, Hong extorted 30,000 yuan in puppet currency from Tang Juru, who was released on bail. After the puppet police bureau learned of this, Hong was detained and transferred to the puppet special court, where he was sentenced to imprisonment. While the sentence was being carried out, the Jiangsu High Procuratorate investigated the case file and learned of this situation. They believed that Hong relied on the puppet regime to oppress the people and was suspected of the crime of treason, so they filed a public prosecution. The case was interrogated by Judge Qiu Huan ying yesterday morning. The defendant denied the extortion, and hired attorney Jiang Rong to defend him. The court ordered him to be detained for further interrogation at a later date.

Lu Jinsheng, who once served as the head of the enemy's special high-level secret service, and Gao Bolin, who served as an agent in the political section of the puppet police bureau, both engaged in extortion under the guise of their positions and received criminal punishment. The Jiangsu High Procuratorate now believes that they have violated the regulations on punishing traitors and has filed a public prosecution against them. During the interrogation yesterday afternoon, both defendants denied the extortion and serving in puppet positions. The court ordered further investigation before the next hearing.

Yesterday afternoon, a panel also interrogated Yang Chunting in the case of secretly reporting to the enemy's military police and destroying our secret radio station. He has been interrogated several times, and the victim, Ge Wanjun, and others appeared in court to testify. After the debate concluded, the verdict is scheduled to be announced at 2:30 p.m. on the 16th.

### Sunny Weather Leads to Increased Imports and Exports

[Our Newspaper's Report] Due to the recent bad weather, navigation at sea has been affected, and many foreign ships coming to China have not been able to arrive in Shanghai on schedule and have been stranded outside the port. The weather has recently cleared up, so ships have been arriving in port successively in the past two days. A total of ten ships arrived yesterday. The Jardine Matheson-managed "Greenock" is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Australia on the 11th, with little cargo and twenty-four passengers. The American President Lines' "Sea Leopard" is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong and Manila on the 14th. The "President Grant" is expected to arrive from Manila on the 6th. It is reported that there are still several foreign ships anchored outside the Wusongkou, waiting for pilots and floating docks in the port. In addition, the Dadaren Tonglianyingchu's "Jiangmin" is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong on the morning of the 11th, the "Jiangchang" will cancel its voyage to Hankou and will sail to Qinglonggang on the morning of the 12th. The repaired "Dada" is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Jiujiang on the 15th.

### Verdict in the Doolittle Raiders Pilot Murder Case to be Announced on the 13th

The trial of the case of the murder of pilots belonging to General Doolittle, which has been going on for a month, was the final hearing yesterday. The court is adjourned today, and lawyers for both sides will make their arguments tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. The verdict is expected to be announced on the 13th. Sawada Shigeru, Wakou Yusei, Okada Ryuhei, and Tatsuta Gaitsujiro, who put three innocent pilots to death, will receive a just verdict. To try this case, the U.S. spared no effort in manpower and resources, sending personnel to Tokyo to collect evidence and summoning Captain Lawson, a Doolittle air force officer who survived by the skin of his teeth, from the U.S. to Shanghai to testify in the military court. The case originated in August 1942, when General Doolittle led pilots from his Eighth Air Force on the first bombing of Tokyo. At that time, the Japanese were arrogant and invincible, and the sudden bombing of Tokyo undoubtedly dealt them a heavy blow, shaking the entire country and prompting them to seek revenge. Coincidentally, two American planes were shot down, and all eight pilots were arrested by the Japanese, imprisoned in a secret room, and subjected to torture and abuse. However, the eight U.S. Air Force personnel, despite being in distress and suffering abuse, refused to submit to the Japanese. Later, Tokyo transferred them to Shanghai to be tried as war criminals. The court immediately sentenced Captain Holmer, Lieutenant Flower, and Shiji to death, and they were immediately executed. The remaining five were released after the end of the war. Lawson personally recounted his experiences in prison, which were too horrible to bear. Today, Sawada Shigeru and others will pay for their crimes, which they deserve.

### Measures for Adjusting Tram and Bus Fares

The British and French Tram Companies and the Bus Company, citing recent high prices, jointly submitted a report to the municipal government requesting approval to increase ticket prices. After receiving the report, the municipal government instructed the Public Utility Bureau to study the adjustment measures in detail. A reporter recently learned from the Public Utility Bureau that the ticket adjustment measures have been drafted and submitted to the mayor for approval yesterday. It is expected that they will be implemented around the middle of this month. The newly adjusted ticket prices will increase by about two to three times. The highest first-class tram fare will be 200 yuan, the lowest will be 90 yuan, the highest trailer fare will be 120 yuan, the lowest will be 60 yuan, the highest trolleybus fare will be 150 yuan, the lowest will be 90 yuan, the highest Hongye bus fare will be 300 yuan, and the lowest will be 120 yuan.

### Rickshaw Pullers Strike Again Yesterday

The members of the city's rickshaw industry guild went on strike again yesterday morning. The reason is that the 1,800 to 1,900 yuan daily rent paid to the car owner, agreed upon by the Social Affairs Bureau, is considered too high, and they request that the decision be revoked and that it be calculated at 1,200 yuan per day. Yesterday afternoon, more than two hundred rickshaw pullers, led by the general manager of the industry union, went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. Because the representative of the capital side did not arrive, the bureau will convene representatives from both sides for negotiations today.

### Materials Left Behind by Japanese Nationals Entrusted to Customs for Auction

[Our Newspaper's Report] When Japanese nationals were repatriated, they left behind a considerable number of furniture, business assets, clothing, and other materials. All of these were first sent by the Japanese Nationals Management Office to warehouses designated by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau for sealing. Recently, in order to vacate the warehouses, the Handling Bureau decided to entrust the Jianghai Customs to auction off these materials, which are said to amount to more than one hundred truckloads.

### Impersonating Soldiers, Gangs Extort Money with Weapons; Wang Fu and Wu Dejiang Arrested for Extorting 200,000 Yuan Without Satisfaction

[Our Newspaper's Report] Cai Changfang, who lives at No. 143 Jiu'anli, Anqing Road Small Vegetable Market, Zhabei, and deals in old goods, had four or five hawkers with peach baskets come to sell some old paper scraps at around 2 p.m. on the 5th of this month, which were sold successfully. Before long, two men in military uniforms and armed with weapons came to Cai's house and claimed that the items were stolen from a warehouse, accused him of receiving stolen goods, and threatened to arrest him and execute him. After his partners informed him that the owner, Cai Changfang, was out and no one was responsible, they were ineffective. Later, another four or five people broke in and demanded 3 million yuan in order to settle the matter. After some negotiation, they were extorted 200,000 yuan. On the 6th, at 10 a.m., another stranger came to find Cai, but Cai was not there, and they left in disappointment. Unexpectedly, at 3 p.m., three more people came with a fierce attitude, pointing out that they would arrest the boss and execute him. After Cai's wife pleaded repeatedly, they agreed to pay another 200,000 yuan as a reward, but because they could not pay the cash immediately, they asked a neighbor, Fang Yunfu, to guarantee, and wrote a note stating that they would pay it the next day (7th) at 3 p.m., and then they dispersed. Cai could no longer endure this and reported it to the patrol team of the Garrison Headquarters Fifth District. Xu Daqin, the team leader, led team members Liu Shurong and Zhang Wenliang to rush to the scene in disguise and lie in wait near the small vegetable market, with only Zhang waiting at Cai's house. As expected, three men in military uniforms came, one of whom was armed. The armed one was guarding outside, while the other two broke into Cai's house, showed the note, and demanded 200,000 yuan. Cai's wife pretended to negotiate and paid 170,000 yuan in cash. At this time, Team Leader Xu and others rushed in and arrested the two extortionists, while the one armed outside escaped. The two criminals, along with the stolen money, were taken to the headquarters. According to the confession, Wang Fu, 21 years old, is from Kunming. The other, Wu Dejiang, 23 years old, is from Sichuan. They confessed to impersonating soldiers and using extreme means to extort money. The team handed over the two criminals to the Garrison General Headquarters yesterday for severe punishment.

### Why Did Film Actor Bai Yun Seek Death? He Took Poison and Was Saved, But Refused to Say Why

[Our Newspaper's Report] Bai Yun, a male actor who has some reputation in the film and drama circles (currently 30 years old, from Guangdong), suddenly took sleeping pills at 2:30 p.m. yesterday in Room 501 on the fifth floor of the Shanghai Guest House at No. 9 Chongming Road, North Sichuan Road, in an attempt to commit suicide. After being discovered, an ambulance was urgently called to transport him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. As of midnight yesterday, it was learned that Bai Yun was temporarily staying in Emergency Room No. 3, and his consciousness was still clear, so there may be no danger to his life. After the incident, Tang Cuncai, a police officer from the Judicial Section of the Hongkou Police Station, went to investigate. When asked about the reason for taking the poison, he firmly refused to tell the truth. When the ambulance arrived, Bai Yun himself requested that he be sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Bai Yun was once married to Luo Shunhua, the adopted daughter of Luo Jialing, the wife of Hardoon, and lived together in Hardoon Garden after the marriage. However, last year, the two divorced due to differences of opinion. It has been rumored that Bai Yun is quite close to a certain Kunqu opera actress.

### Talking and Laughing in a Garden Full of Spring; Temporary City Councilors Held a Picnic Yesterday

— Our Reporter Mai Tian

The Shanghai Temporary City Council, which has been meeting for two weeks, will successfully conclude this afternoon. After meeting for these two weeks, everyone is really a little exhausted, and the news reporters have also been busy. Yesterday's picnic at the Cherry Blossom Garden was a good opportunity for everyone to relax and adjust to the tense work of the past ten days. The picnic was hosted by the councilors themselves, who invited the heads of various bureaus of the municipal government, local leaders, and news reporters. It should have been the time when the cherry blossoms were withering, but in the garden of the Shanghai branch of the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League at No. 114 Jinshenfu Road (formerly occupied by Mitsui & Co.), the garden was still full of spring.

Cherry Blossoms in Full Bloom
As soon as you walked into the gate, you saw a white expanse. The cherry blossom branches almost touched your head, and the petals were scattered all over the ground. Tables and chairs had already been placed on the grass, covered with white tablecloths. Most of the hosts and guests came out of the council meeting. So you can say they arrived on time. Wang Xiaolai had arrived at the council at 12:10, having listened for five minutes, but he went to Jinshenfu Road, did not attend the picnic, and left. The beautiful scenery in the garden kept the photographers busy. Here they wanted to take pictures, and there they had chosen a

good shot.
At this time, everyone was no longer willing to put on the solemn face they had at the meeting, and they were talking and laughing, very lively. However, after being influenced by the meeting for more than ten days, their minds were inevitably somewhat "proceduralized", so everyone still kept in mind "propose, second", "agree, pass", "raise your hand, vote" while talking and laughing. Zhan Wenhuti was the most fond of telling jokes, and he and Feng Youzhen took turns, and were especially happy. Xi Yushu, an athlete, even came up with a few

jumping ditch performances.
Xu Jiayu, Wang Genkun, Lv Enze, and others all did their best as hosts and were very busy. In addition to the signature book placed at the garden gate, the Youth League also specially prepared a silk national party flag for everyone to sign as a souvenir. The first to sign was Speaker Xu, and the second was of course Deputy Speaker Xi. The picnic began, and more than one hundred people were seated at seven or eight tables, with three or five people at one table and more than ten people at another. Each person had two small breads, a bottle of soda, a dessert, a banana, as well as cold dishes and meat pies. While eating, they also had to "challenge", "suggest", "negotiate", "deal". The roving photographer was not willing to give up this

lively scene
and found a ladder from somewhere, climbed up a tree like "Tarzan of the Apes", and took a bird's-eye view. After the meal, it was almost two o'clock. The councilors took a few group photos, and those who had official business had to hurry, while the rest were still reluctant to leave, and lingered in groups of three or five before leaving.

### Thirty Million People Starving; Our Country's Disaster is Severe; Affected Area Expands to Nineteen Provinces

[Special Dispatch from the U.S. Information Service, Shanghai] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) announced today the results of its investigation, stating that due to the war and poor harvests, an unprecedentedly severe famine has resulted. It is estimated that thirty million people in nineteen of China's provinces are on the verge of starvation. UNRRA and the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) are, to the best of their ability within the limitations of poor transportation, rapidly transporting food into severely food-deficient areas. However, no matter how hard the relief agencies try, it is feared that nearly four million people will inevitably perish.

The famine in Hunan Province has reached the most severe level. Of the 27 million people in the province, an estimated 7 million are starving or will soon die. Millions are eating grass roots, tree bark, and even dirt to prolong their lives. According to eyewitness reports from UNRRA staff, all vegetation in the countryside has been devoured by the local people and refugees traveling to Hankou, leaving not a blade of grass. It is said that the death rate among residents is extremely high, especially among children. The situation is similar in Henan and Hubei provinces, but to a slightly lesser extent. The estimated number of people on the verge of starvation in the provinces within the former occupied areas of China are: Anhui: 1 million, Jiangxi: 2 million, Jiangsu: 3 million, Hubei: 2 million, Henan: 4 million, Hunan: 7 million, Guangxi: 1 million, Guangdong: 1.5 million, Shandong: 2.5 million, Zhejiang and Fujian: 1.5 million, Hebei and Jehol: 2 million, Shanxi, Suiyuan and Chahar: 1.5 million, and the nine northeastern provinces: 1 million. Little is known about the food situation in the Northeast. UNRRA has so far received more than 255,000 tons of food supplies, which have been handed over to CNRRA for distribution. Of these, 165,107 tons are wheat and 53,671 tons are flour. Due to the global rice shortage, only 11,260 tons of rice have been received so far. UNRRA requested the Combined Food Board to allocate 370,000 tons of rice to China in the first half of 1946, but the Board allocated less than 100,000 tons.

### Provisional Municipal Council Holds Closing Ceremony Today; Passed Review Resolutions at Yesterday's Twelfth General Meeting; Lively Discussion on the Issue of Joint Liability for Opium Prohibition

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council held its twelfth general meeting at 9:25 AM yesterday, with 27 councilors in attendance. First, Wang Genshen reported on the review opinions of the municipal government's policy and policy report, which included measures and laws that hinder citizens' freedom, such as the new law on joint liability for opium prohibition, which must be stopped separately or submitted to the central government for amendment. Zhan Wenhua also stated that the joint liability for opium prohibition should be abolished, but he strongly supported the principle of opium prohibition and other measures. Wang Genzhong added that there are no joint liability provisions for treason or collaboration with the enemy, but only for opium prohibition, which, in the eyes of foreigners, seems close to what is done in uncivilized countries. Wang Bing then said that smoking is harmful to health and affects the strength of the country. If we do not catch up, we will not be able to compete with other countries. The government has its own difficulties in adopting this approach, and parents who indulge their children are responsible for "failure to teach strictly is the fault of the teacher, and joint liability should be borne by the parents." Hou Junren asked what would happen if the head of the household smoked? Should he be reported by his children? As a result, Speaker Xu put the proposal to "abolish the joint liability law" to a vote, and the majority did not agree, and strict enforcement should still be carried out. As for other matters relating to civil affairs and autonomy, the status of autonomy should be respected and cannot be interfered with within the scope of not violating national laws. In terms of police administration, the style of the former patrol room should be reformed and the quality of the police should be improved. Social administration must stand on the position of the whole people, increase production, and eliminate labor unrest. In terms of education, literacy should be restricted and private schools should be supported and supervised. In terms of land administration, land rights should be equalized, and land and houses occupied by the enemy and puppets should be cleared within a time limit and returned or compensated separately to the citizens. Public utilities should be based on the principle of public operation, encouraging and supporting people to operate them. Public works facilities should pay attention to urgency and priority. Health facilities should focus on the common people, and medical relief should be universal. The attitude of service personnel must be improved, and a system must be established in financial matters, and institutions must be streamlined. All opinions such as these were unanimously passed.

The Need for a Large Amount of Gas and General Inspection of Water Pipes

Following Shan Yefeng's report on the review of the Public Works Bureau's report and modification of the text, Pan Xulun believed that one item under the heading of expensive fuel and the use of gas, which is cheap and clean, should be greatly expanded, and the takeover of the Wusong Gas Plant and the British Gas Company should be realized in the short term, which has been cancelled and should not be re-mentioned. Moreover, the British company has a contract and should not be taken over arbitrarily. Vice-Speaker Xi Yushu explained that "An Guan is to connect a pipe, not to take over the management," and the whole audience burst into laughter. Xu Yongzhi stood up and suggested that the discussion or revision of the text and style should not take up the time of the general meeting, and it is best to form a separate organizing committee. Feng Youzhen also expressed his agreement. As a result, Feng Youzhen, Zhan Wenhua, Shen Chunhui, and Xu Shihao were elected as members of the committee to organize and revise all reviewed text and style. Li Bojia expressed that from the perspective of industrial art, gas should be supplied in large quantities, and after a vote, the majority agreed that gas was needed. Other opinions, such as the re-allocation of water supply areas, general inspection of poorly repaired water pipes, the responsibility of landlords and tenants to repair them, the rapid repair of damaged electric wires, the increase of street light intensity, the increase of vehicles, ferries, and wharves for difficult traffic, the addition or collection of warehouses that are insufficient for use, and the acceleration of telephone connection efficiency and the addition of machines, were all passed.

Dredge River Banks and Ditches and Build Public Housing

The report of the Public Works Bureau was reviewed by Shui Xiangyun. Shen Chunhui believed that the garbage problem should be handled by the Health Bureau, and the mobilization of the Baojia (local security system) was not within the scope of the Public Works Bureau. The general meeting agreed. Other opinions, such as speeding up the construction and repair of river banks, bridges, wharves, and ditches, rushing to repair seawalls, opening up main roads to facilitate traffic, building public housing, dispersing them to the suburbs, re-planning the Greater Shanghai Plan, and establishing a funding policy, were all resolved and passed.

Land Registration Procedures Should Be Expedited

The Land Administration Bureau Review Report, the Land Administration Bureau Review Report, was read by Xu Shihao. Regarding the item "Land value increment tax should also be reduced as much as possible," Wang Genzhong, Wang Bing, and several other councilors advocated deleting it, believing that national construction should equalize land according to the Three People's Principles and reduce the burden on people's lives. The general meeting also passed the procedures for land registration should be expedited, and the public land should be cleared, measured, and valued.

Revise Rent Standards and Take Both Parties into Consideration

Finally, the two items of the rent and housing donation were discussed: (1) The mayor submitted a proposal to allow the committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council to revise the calculation standards for rent in the city. Regarding the revision of the rent standards in the city, it is proposed that the municipal government should take into consideration the income and profits of the owners and the affordability of the citizens, and be responsible for handling them. (2) The mayor submitted a proposal on how to collect housing donations in the city. The general meeting passed three points: 1. It is proposed to collect housing donations on the full amount of the rent for rental housing, without the need to issue rental contracts. 2. For self-occupied houses, housing donations will be collected based on the current valuation method. 3. It is proposed to change the housing donation rate to 20% after the rent increases, which will be borne by the landlord. The speaker and vice-speaker reported that it was noon for the councilors' picnic, and the time had passed, and the meeting adjourned at 12:15. Yesterday afternoon was the fifth group review meeting, and the thirteenth general meeting will be held this morning, and the fourteenth general meeting will be held this afternoon, and the closing ceremony will be held at the same time.

At noon, it reached 1.42 million, and the situation improved.

### The Falling Trend in the Yarn Market Intensifies; Current Cotton Transactions Are Sluggish

The falling trend in the yarn market intensified yesterday. The number of buyers was already small. After the plunge in the previous two days, there was even more hesitation. 20-count large-factory yarn, such as Golden Rooster Dafeng, has fallen to within the million mark, and Shuangma has also dropped by 70,000 to 80,000. The last transaction was 950,000. The decline of 20-count small yarn was really miserable, and all of them were approaching 700,000. However, the removal is still lacking.

The near-term US dollars were 27.90, the long-term were 28.05, and the current spot price of Metlin was 28.47. In the current cotton trade in this port, manufacturers and flower shops, in view of the fact that the prices of foreign cotton and yarn are falling, the intention to enter is becoming increasingly weak. Only Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory entered Indian cotton, Bai Luo, and went for 400 bales. In addition, Fangjian and private yarn factories were at a loss. The seed flower shops still made 14,500 yuan.

### Feathers and Broadcloth Are Short and Pricey

Feathers and broadcloth are more expensive than spring, autumn, and winter goods due to the lack of supply. Except for those who need to entertain retail customers, only two or three out of ten of the broadcloth and wool merchants who have sales, because they all think the market price is too high, and the daily sales are very temporary. The incoming goods will soon be shipped, and they are unwilling to eat a heavy cost and take a huge risk. However, recently, feathers and broadcloth, whether stripes, plaids, or solid colors, are quite salable. Although there is a lack of original piece and whole box transactions, the scattered embellishments are not weak.

### Nylon Stockings: US Restricts Exports

The purpose of restricting exports is to prevent a large outflow of limited domestic goods. The above decree takes effect immediately, because the United States feels that there is a lack of socks.

### Under the Contest of Bulls and Bears, the Stock Market is Erratic

At the beginning of the Chinese stock market, it was reported that Dean Song had taken appropriate measures on prices, and a large amount of inventory was released, and people were extremely panicked. The short sellers continued to be active. Yong Yarn fell to 4,450 yuan, American Asia 3,450 yuan, and Jingfu about 340 yuan. The bulls were persistent, but the short sellers urgently made up the stock and the chips were strangely scarce. In addition, the funds were loose and indiscriminate, and the bulls were fearless. The noon suddenly revealed a profit, and the stocks were returned to a good 10%. The noon closing was the same as the previous closing of Yong Yarn American Asia. Because the loose shorts were crowded, Xiao Shu rose by 27 yuan, Xin Guang 30 yuan, Qinxing 25 yuan, and Xinhe stabilized. In addition, the other cold stocks did not have the opportunity to short, and continued to decline. The opening in the afternoon called a little lower, and then it was pulled up again. Yong Yarn rose to 5,100 yuan, American Asia 4,100 yuan, and Jingfu more than 440 yuan. The result was still subject to the noon closing price, and the situation was extremely erratic. The trend of foreign stocks and Chinese stocks was the same. Before 11 o'clock, it was still stable, and many people outside the industry came out. Securities help maintained the price when it was low, so in a moment before noon, the stocks reappeared high flying. As a result, except for the early close of Jardine Matheson, which fell slightly, the rest of the stocks recovered a little. The popular Pears and British United Asia Bee increased by about 10%. In the afternoon, the next-day pre-made Yisha British United fell to about 11,100 yuan, and small stocks had small fluctuations in the rise and fall, and turned erratic.

The early rice price on the South Road was nearly 1,000 yuan lower. White Yin Yuan came and went equally, and the price was neither honorable nor shameful. The flour market in other ports and the local street market were not happy to remove, and the transactions were limited. The price was tired by 100 to 200 yuan. In the oil market, the situation was still tending to be dull and tired, because Lu province, Jiaozhou, Qingdao, Bian province, and Kaifeng continued to arrive. People were soft-hearted, and prices were gradually repairing and improving. Soybeans had arrived and stored, and digestion was still depressed, and the price fell by 600 to 700 yuan. Soybean cakes were reduced by another 200 to 300 yuan. Bran has been slightly inquired about in the mainland, and the market is temporarily flat.

### New Tea on the Market

New Dragon Well Tea at 25,000 Yuan per Catty

"Flag Spear," synonymous with Dragon Well, has traditionally been sold primarily to domestic customers and merchants in this area. The earliest new harvest before the Qingming Festival comes from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, followed by Hangzhou. Although the Wenzhou harvest has already arrived on the market, due to shipping issues, it only arrived in Shanghai on the same day as the Hangzhou harvest. Regarding prices, after multiple rounds of negotiations between buyers and sellers, the Hangzhou Dragon Well tea merchants agreed on a price of 24,000 to 25,000 yuan per catty. Currently, to be the first to market, tea houses are willing to pay high prices to obtain the tea quickly. However, it is feared that as more tea arrives, the base price may soften. As for Wenzhou Dragon Well, trading has not yet commenced, and because of the varying quality, it is generally cheaper than the Hangzhou variety. Furthermore, as the new tea season approaches in various regions, the market for aged teas is shrinking, and transactions are becoming increasingly scarce.

### Cotton and Wheat Arriving in Succession

### Northern Goods Association Reorganizes Rules; Merchants and Traders in Stand-off

Additionally, there will be 10,000 rolls of building felt to supply the market. Upon hearing this news, oil merchants, seeing no hope for hoarding, have recently been selling off their stocks, causing oil prices to fall. The company will also reduce its selling prices after the oil arrives in Shanghai, it is said.

### New Avenues for Buying U.S. Dollars in Hong Kong: Depositing Funds... Sending U.S. Dollars... Buying Black Market Exchange Rates

[Hong Kong News] Bank deposits made by Hong Kong residents before the war have not yet been allowed to be withdrawn. However, according to news recently circulating among importers and exporters, bank deposits can be used to purchase goods from foreign countries with relatively simple procedures. It is only necessary to notify the bank holding the funds to make the payment, without going through the foreign exchange application process. Therefore, many people coming to Hong Kong to purchase American goods are using their past bank deposits to do so. There are also two other methods: (1) Buying U.S. dollars on the black market and entrusting reliable sailors to purchase goods in the U.S. when they return on American ships. However, this method is less common because it is difficult to do without good relationships with sailors. (2) Buying foreign exchange from companies or trading houses dealing in U.S. import and export goods. The recent black market price is approximately HK$5.20 to HK$5.40 per U.S. dollar. After paying the company or trading house, they will immediately telegraph their affiliated company in the U.S. Payment can be made in two to three days, which is much faster than through a bank. This method is now quite common.

### Hubei Province's Education Budget for the 35th Year [of the Republic] Severely Insufficient; Allocation Impossible; Annual Budget 930 Million; Central Government Allocated Only Over 300 Million

[Our Hankou Special Dispatch] The recovery of education in Hubei Province is proceeding very slowly, which has been criticized by the general public. The main reason is the lack of funding. Recently, the Hubei Provincial Department of Education informed our reporter: The budget for education in Hubei Province for the 35th year [of the Republic] (including relocation and recovery expenses) was originally 930 million yuan, but it has not yet been approved by the central government. To date, the central government has allocated only over 300 million yuan to Hubei Province, a significant shortfall compared to the original budget, making allocation impossible. Therefore, although the Department of Education is keenly aware of the severity of the education situation in the province, it is powerless to act. Currently, the schools in Hubei Province that have reopened include two provincial colleges, thirteen provincial high schools (including the temporary high schools in Wuchang and Hanyang), five provincial junior high schools, eleven provincial normal schools, six provincial senior vocational schools, sixty-four county junior high schools, twenty-four county simple normal schools, five provincial capital elementary schools, ten normal school-affiliated elementary schools, 1,316 central national schools, 10,951 guaranteed national schools, and over twenty private middle schools. However, many private middle schools are not in good condition and urgently need to be improved, it is said. (Re-print)

### Lihang National Education Demonstration Area School Building Committee Established Yesterday

[Our City News] Residents of the Lihang district in this city, because the district has been designated by the Education Bureau as a national education demonstration area, and to assist in promoting this, local gentry enthusiastic about education, such as Zhang Qiwen and Qu Shao-yi, drafted an educational construction plan and submitted it to the Education Bureau for approval. They were granted permission to organize a school building committee for the demonstration area to raise funds for the construction of school buildings in the district. At noon yesterday, over fifty local gentry were convened at Jinjiaqiao to discuss the direction of implementation. Chen, the director of secondary education at the Education Bureau, and Zhu, the director of national education, attended to provide guidance. The initiators reported on the progress, and the articles of association of the school building committee were approved. In addition to Lu Guanliu, Huang Xincun, and Zhang Yiwen, representatives from the Education Bureau, and Zhong Renjie, the district head, and Wang Jiyu, the police precinct chief, as ex officio members, Zhang Qiwen, Qu Yue, Huang Yucheng, Jin Shuyi, Tao Bingrong, Luo Suiliang, Yao Deming, Yang Guang, Zhang Shuhua, Li Wenbi, Shen Wenxin, Zhang Dajing, Huang Zhiyuan, Qu Renfu, Gu Junru, Zhu Songyu, Shen Daqing, Xu Shien, and Gu Jiangsai were elected as committee members. They will begin discussing fundraising methods and determining construction steps immediately. Residents of the district are enthusiastic about education, and it is predicted that the fundraising goal of 100 million yuan will be achieved in the shortest possible time.

### Chengming College Property Dispute; Awaiting Legal Resolution

[Our City News] Chengming College and Bethany Orphanage have been in dispute over school property for some time. Recently, the presidents of National Jinan University, Jiaotong University, Fudan University, as well as private Datong College, Guanghua University, and the College of Law, sent letters to Chengming and Bethany, urging both sides to remain calm and await legal resolution. The original letter stated: "Having read in the newspaper that a dispute has arisen over school property, we, as members of the educational community, are deeply concerned. In our humble opinion, both sides have been striving for educational and charitable causes for many years and have established a good reputation. It seems appropriate that this unfortunate misunderstanding should be resolved calmly, awaiting legal resolution, and that neither side should go to extremes, which would damage their reputations. As colleagues, we dare to offer our sincere opinion. We would be grateful if it is accepted." It is now reported that both parties are at peace, awaiting legal adjudication.

### Lecturing and Studying Abroad; The Whereabouts of Six Professors Lecturing in the U.S.; Twenty-Five Students Returning from Germany

[Our Paper, Chongqing Special Dispatch] Our reporter recently learned from the Ministry of Education about new developments in international education—lecturing and studying abroad—which are detailed below:

Lecturing Abroad

In addition to Cao Yu and Lao She, six other professors were recently invited by the U.S. State Department to lecture in the U.S. from 1945 to 1946. The whereabouts of the six professors are as follows: (1) Dr. Yan Jici, Director of the Physics Research Institute of the National Research Institute of Peiping, specializing in electricity and spectroscopy, is lecturing in the U.S. and visiting or examining electricity and spectroscopy laboratories and research institutions in stages. (2) Dr. Lin Tongji, Professor of Political Science at Fudan University, is lecturing on modern politics, Chinese language, and Chinese literature at the Mills College summer camp. (3) Dr. Tao Menghe, Director of the Institute of Social Sciences of the National Central Research Institute, visited various American political science institutions and the sociology and political science departments of universities in the eastern U.S. (4) Dr. Zheng Zuoxin, Professor of Biology at Fukien Christian University, is engaged in specialized research at the Smithsonian Institution in the U.S. and the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior in Washington, D.C., with the aim of creating a complete classification table for Chinese birds. (5) Dr. Mei Yibao, President of Yenching University, arrived in the U.S. in May 1945 to attend the graduation ceremony of Oberlin College, where he also received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree. (6) Dr. Yuan Dunli, Professor of Health Education and Physical Education and Dean of Students at Northwest Normal College, arrived in the U.S. in August 1945 to lecture.

Studying Abroad

After the victory, some students who had been studying in the U.K. and the U.S. returned to China in batches. Recently, twenty-five students who had been studying in Germany, along with forty-three family members, left Germany in December of last year, arrived in Saigon early, and have now returned to China. These students are mostly specialized in technical fields, and the Ministry of Education plans to recommend them to various institutions based on their fields of study. The names of the students who have reported their return are as follows: Wei Xiongliang (from Zhongshan, Guangdong, graduated from Yangcheng Industrial University in Germany), Wang Baoying (from Yishui, Shandong, graduated in medicine from the University of Berlin), Huang Bingyao (from Xinhui, Guangdong, studied at the Berlin Advanced Industrial School), Mao Wenjing (from Huangyan, Zhejiang, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Berlin University of Technology), Tao Yongshan (from Yongji, Jilin, Licensed Engineer, Berlin University of Technology), Zhou Yuanzhen (from Nanhui, Jiangsu, Doctor of Engineering, Berlin University of Technology), Tao Shengyang (from Nanchang, Jiangxi, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Berlin University of Technology), Yan Huiyuan (from Kaiyuan, Liaoning, Berlin University of Technology), Ma Zengxiang (from Shenxian, Hebei, Doctor of Economics, Berlin School of Economics), Li Liren (from Changsha, Berlin Technical College), Zheng Gongdao (from Kaiping, Guangdong, Faculty of Medicine, University of Berlin), Wang Bingzhou (from Leting, Hebei, Doctor of Chemical Engineering, Berlin Technical College of Kashgar), Cheng Xinian (from Wuyuan, Jiangxi, Doctor of Physics, University of Berlin), An Yukun (from Shandong, Doctor of Law, University of Berlin), Xu Shigao (from Huangxian, Shandong, Doctor of Engineering, Berlin Technical College), Li Guohao (from Meixian, Guangdong, Doctor of Engineering, Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany), Li Yejingsi (from Fuzhou, Doctor of Medicine, Mingxing University), Li Licong (from Wuhu, Anhui, Doctor of Chemistry, Mingxing University), He Dexuan (from Ningxiang, Hunan, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Berlin).

### Japanese Women Eagerly Apply to the Imperial University

[Kaizo Nippo, Tokyo, 8th] This year, the average number of students applying to the University of Tokyo is 700 per faculty, including 45 women in some faculties and 10 in others. Among these women are female students, graduates of medical colleges applying to the Faculty of Economics, and married women whose husbands are far away in the South Seas. They are all waiting to pass through the "narrow gate" of Japan's highest institution of learning.

### Some Opinions on the Future of Higher Education (Continued)

— Huang Qijun

We should pay the highest respect to the teachers and students of various schools who suffered displacement and hardship during the war. However, the post-war period is not necessarily a time of joy after hardship. It should be known that we are still far from the road to nation-building. Now that the National Government is about to return to its capital, the rear schools are mostly restless and eager to move east. Those who are left behind in the rear schools are envious of those who are moving east, and some even scold the government for abandoning them and discriminating against them. In some schools, declarations are issued, classes are boycotted, and demonstrations are held. Nowadays, people often talk freely about democracy, but we should always make rational judgments about everything. We should oppose unreasonable measures by the government, but we should accept reasonable measures. During the War of Resistance, we worked hard in the rear to develop a new land of culture, and now we cannot let these cultural warriors retreat completely and let it lie barren. Since the cultural warriors in the rear shoulder this special mission, we must continue to endure and adhere to our original intentions.

(2) Salary Issues. To improve the efficiency of education, the most basic issue is to increase the salaries of teachers. The low salaries of university professors in China are probably unprecedented in the world. Shanghai university professors have appealed to this, saying that their salaries are even lower than those of bank tea servers. However, the mission they bear is heavier than that of anyone else, so teachers flee, resulting in a lack of academic expertise. We cannot blame the teachers for not being able to live in poverty, because otherwise, they would be in danger of starvation. However, the government and people in society cannot shirk their responsibility for sitting idly by and not helping. Therefore, we cannot blame them, but should extend our infinite sympathy to them.

The lessons of this great war have made us aware of the importance of higher science and culture. However, to improve higher science and culture, we must first stabilize their lives so that they have no worries about food and clothing and can teach earnestly and study diligently.

(3) Discipline Issues. Chinese people often misinterpret democracy, and when they talk about it, they inevitably tend towards license. Now, students often talk a lot about freedom and equality, and often when one student is expelled, most students will respond, support, and force the school to withdraw its decision. As a result, discipline is lost, and morality declines.

In the future, schools should strengthen guidance on discipline. When students engage in deviant behavior, they cannot continue to adopt the policy of appeasement that they have in the past. As long as the school's attitude is fair, it should be punished, because the quality of discipline has too great an impact on the future of the school. We must take this next-best measure to enable people in the school to study and teach with peace of mind.

(4) Party Affairs Issues. I often have a sense of foreboding: If China becomes democratic and party bans are lifted, a group of ambitious people will inevitably take the opportunity to rise up, and the forces of all parties and factions will naturally flood into the schools together. As a result, there will be open and secret struggles in the schools, and they will be in chaos and will never have peace.

Students come to school for the purpose of studying advanced knowledge, and the attitude of learning must be to focus one's will and concentrate one's mind. If the mind is distracted, it will not only affect the efficiency of reading but also affect the entire style of learning. We are against students not asking about national affairs, but it is more meaningful to bury oneself in research than to proclaim and march. I believe that the future of China depends on promising young people conducting in-depth research in the laboratory. Young students should be aware of this, and the central government should prohibit any party activity within the school in order to maintain academic sanctity and improve the style of learning. It should be known that in-depth research is the path for young people of the era to serve the country.

We dare not compliment, but indeed, higher education in the past has made various mistakes. Now, while the schools have not yet reopened, we should plan ahead and make new plans for the schools of the future, so that we can cultivate new seeds of era education!

Spring and Autumn

### Remembering the Poet Yang Yunshi (End)

— Tang Liyan

Five years later, Meimei returned to Beiping and went to see the teacher. The teacher saw her with the same youthful complexion as before. After some playful banter, Meimei asked for a painting. Moved by the times and remembering the past, he inscribed five poems on the painting, saying:

Dismissing officials and settling down is a long and slow affair. How many autumns have passed with the river grass and flowers? Lately, a cool breeze stirs at the edge of the sky. Who is playing the flute in the Yellow Crane Tower?

One hundred thousand brave soldiers chant songs while sharpening their swords. In several places, the sound of music lingers after the battles. In the second month, the fish are plump and the river water is beautiful. The new orioles sing from Mount Wuchang.

The ambition of hegemony has already passed by for ten years. The marching staff officer appears old and worn. Back then, laying the weapons across the river, only remains the peach blossoms by the flowing water.

Among them, returning resembles facing Chao Yun. Embroidered curtains and jade hairpins accompany the envoy. Facing each other, Qin Cao is like Buddha Seal, the Kasaya not unlike a red skirt.

After seeing green fields, one sees colorful garments. The lonely Han Hong's temples have already turned white. I have not yet succeeded, and you are not yet married. Let's put down our cups and together look at the autumn mountains.

He earnestly advised her to choose someone to serve and compared her situation to that of Wu Meicun and Bian Yujing, but the outcome was slightly better. Now that the teacher has passed away, I don't know if Meimei is still in this world. "If Xin is not married to Little Hong, she will cry and damage the pompon flowers," which can be said to be Meimei's lament. Many people in the country know about the teacher and Meimei's affair, but the rumors are diverse. The poems written before and after are mostly not included in the "Changjiang Wanli Lou Poetry Collection," so I have recorded them all here to show the truth. His poems are also clear, firm, and unconventional, half in the style of Shang music, beyond what incense-burning love poems can achieve. In modern times, only Meicun and Ding'an are comparable to him. Yet some say he is at most similar to Wang Cici, and cannot reach the level of Wen Tingyun and Li Shangyin. Those who say this not only do not know the teacher's poems, but also only superficially mimic rain and innocence, and have never dreamed of Wen and Li.

In his youth, the teacher was a famous young master and a pampered guest of the Prime Minister's residence, with luxurious clothing and fine horses, and elegant literary talent. After passing the imperial examination, his talent and reputation spread throughout Nanjing. Just as he was about to rise rapidly, the imperial examinations were suspended, so he was appointed as the Consul-General in Singapore with the rank of Postal Department Secretary. He was in Singapore for six years. When the edict of abdication was issued, he abandoned his post and returned. He engaged in business but lost a huge amount of money. In middle age, although he got along well with Wu Gong as a host and guest and was able to somewhat realize his ambitions, the income from his official salary was only enough to support himself. When Wu Gong's army was defeated, he moved around in exile, and his livelihood became increasingly difficult. During this war of resistance, the Changjiang Wanli Lou was turned to ashes, and generations of hard work were destroyed in an instant. His hometown was ravaged by war, and he could not return. Entrusting himself to Hong Kong was not a choice. One day, he said to me, "A twenty-year-old chronic illness has suddenly been cured." It turned out that the teacher was addicted to opium. When the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars soared, he could no longer afford it, so he forcibly quit smoking. I thought that the teacher was over sixty years old and physically weak, so it might not be suitable for him. But I could do nothing to help. As expected, not long after, both arms were severely painful, and he could not write, gradually developing rheumatism. Later, I returned to Shanghai due to my parent's death. When I occasionally inquired about his well-being, he was not yet seriously ill. After a separation of three years, the loss is unimaginable. Later, I received a letter from a friend, saying that he died of illness in the summer and autumn of the thirtieth year. He was desolate after his death, and there was nothing to use for his funeral. Fortunately, two or three good friends managed his funeral. The end of a great talent in the twilight years was like this. "Yu Xin's life was the most desolate, and his poems in his later years moved the Jiangguan," which can truly be given to the teacher.

As the saying goes, "White hair is like meeting someone for the first time, but a brief encounter is like an old friend." It depends on whether you know each other or not. I met the teacher very late, and the days we spent together were not long. But the friendship between the two of us can last through calamities and endure for a long time. Life is like morning dew, the sun and moon move, and the new replaces the old. Remembering that since receiving books from the East, senior talents have either praised junior scholars or found mutual sympathy in their spirits. In addition to my teachers, Nantong Zhang Jian, Xinhui Liang Qichao, and Taicang Li Huchen, teachers who asked questions include Liuyang Liu Renxi, Yuhang Zhang Binglin, and Houguan Chen Yan. Teachers who appreciated me include Panyu Xu Shaozhen, Anhui Xu, and Sichuan Xie Chi. Friends include Nantong Zhang Xiaoruo and Chongming Xu Yugong. Those who were between teachers and friends, such as Zhuji Jiang Zungui, Baoshan Yuan Xitao, Wujiang Qian Chonggu, and Qingpu Shen Pengnian, either became friends after a brief encounter or became friends regardless of age. In less than twenty years, they passed away one after another. The last one I met was the teacher, who has now left me again. Cao Zhi's so-called "Xu Chen Ying Liu" all passed away at once, the pain is unspeakable! "Having mourned the dead, I must think of myself." Fan Wenzi only prayed for a quick death, and Sheng Xiaozhang worried that he could hurt people. Old friends are scattered all over the world, and life has come to this point. What is there to say about the way of heaven? Alas, I want to be silent.

### Review of Feng Zikai's Cartoons

— Wen Zhaotong

From the ancient prehistoric period to today's atomic age, mankind—collectively or individually—is following the historical trajectory of continuous progress. The history interwoven with time and space does not suddenly produce any disconnection or insulation. The so-called culture and art can be said to be its inevitable products.

Based on such a premise to explore and study a painter's works, the conclusions obtained may be more correct and reasonable than to critically examine them in a detached manner solely from the perspective of their pure artistic evolution.

Feng Zikai's cartoons are well-known works. Recently, he compiled a complete collection, but what exactly is the relationship between the author's subjective desires and the social effect? In other words, what is the causal relationship between his many works and the trajectory of history? It is really necessary to clarify.

Zikai was born in Chongde County, Zhejiang Province, a place with beautiful mountains and rivers. It is bordered by the Grand Canal to the west and West Lake to the south, surrounded by secluded scenery, a land of talent and outstanding people. It can be said that the seeds of art had already sprouted in him congenitally.

A beautiful corner, a garden full of thorns, this is the epitome of our ancient China. From Jingfu's poetic longing, he depicted "New Interpretations of Ancient Poems." He more sensitively realized the suffering of all classes of society and the motherland heavily oppressed by imperialists and feudal remnants, forcing the central theme of his cartoons to step from static poetic sentiment into the reality of the social masses. The two collections of ink paintings, "Folk Scenes" and "City Scenes," represent his tendency in this direction. "Ink Painting of Ah Q's True Story" can be said to have the same living conditions.

A mass of darkness, the ideal is too far from reality, and he is extremely depressed. He had to seek the only consolation in his heart, the spoiled little girls, the little ambassadors of the innocent paradise, the carefree playmates. He also painted a collection of cartoons, "Children's Scenes," which is a reproduction of pure childlike innocence. Actively pursuing it, from the perspective of an educator, he wanted to protect the innocent soul to the point of eternity. The intention of "Student Scenes" can perhaps be used as an explanation in this regard.

Ideal beauty is ultimately illusory. The masses of living beings are, after all, suffering. Here, Feng Zikai seems to no longer dare to face reality squarely, and no longer uses a playful, angry, and scolding brushstroke to expose it. He shifted direction, only passively hoping to reduce, reduce... those cruel acts of people killing people and people killing things. The "Protecting Life Collection" expresses his religious and philosophical views on life.

With the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Feng Zikai fled from his picturesque hometown to Zunyi, Guizhou. He not only witnessed the bloody wind and rain, but also felt that "the children of the past have all grown up, and half of the relatives and friends of the past have withered." Therefore, rather than passively cursing reality, it is better to actively depict the real situation of the War of Resistance in the Great Rear to inspire and guide the masses. The "Wartime Scenes" collection expresses the artist's contribution to the War of Resistance, which cannot be denied.

The reason why Feng Zikai's cartoons have so many aspects of expression is that, from the point of grasping the theme, it is due to the superiority of his literary foundation. As for the expression forms he is accustomed to, it is the form of Chinese brush painting—only using simple lines and ink wash, simply and flatly depicting some images, fully capturing the strengths of "bone method with brushwork." Therefore, rather than saying that he preserved national essence in his cartoons, it is better to say that he used old forms to make it easier for the Chinese masses to understand and accept, which is also a good method of popularizing art.

The torrent of democracy is permeating every corner of the world. Therefore, future art, especially cartoons, should move forward on a grand road that guides the masses to strive for democracy. The author dares to believe that Feng Zikai's cartoons, with their unique achievements, will not disappoint us.

### Inscription for Lao She's Memorial Album

— Zhu Jun

Stubborn in the world, ashamed of a meal in a noble family, writing to exhaust the principles, holding a pen to create history. The night is long and the spirits are exhausted, the spring is deep and the flowers and birds are sad. It is difficult to walk through the Fushui River, and one often faces the uneven flow.

### Seasonal Changes

— Yang Lianyuan

The new buds on the withered tree in front of the door are not yet green; the color of the new buds is milky yellow.

The winter haze still shrouds the sky; here, the environment in which I live, the people I meet, their faces all have winter expressions.

If the songs that come from the radio are the voice of spring, then it is an insult to spring. Spring should have a healthy voice. The soft and weak sounds from the radio are just the mumblings of people who have enjoyed luxury in the "greenhouse" of winter!

Spring is really like a deeply affectionate girl. She approaches you from time to time, but often avoids you; look, the little birds are singing loudly in the morning sunlight. Isn't it telling us that winter is long gone?

Alas, the suffocating air around you assaults you like a demon! Can't you smell the breath of spring here? Tell you: the seasons have changed!

You might as well climb a tall building. Without stone steps, you don't have to worry about moss slipping your feet, nor do you have to use a cane to support your tired body; "Dusk in the Ancient City," I'm afraid you don't have the leisure to hum a line from a Song Dynasty poem, besides, this is not an "Ancient City"!—Here, you can get on a modern elevator, and this "monster" will immediately send you to the highest building.

Well, now that you are on the tall building, have you seen the vast twilight gathering around you? Can you also see the gauze of dusk sprinkled on the mountain streams, forming an extremely beautiful picture?… These may all be in your memories. Now, you won't see these on this tall building. What you see are teams of cars, moving like an ant colony, with high and low foreign buildings arranged around you, painted with milky white twilight.—At this time, you may faintly hear a loud song coming into your eardrums from the other side; then, you may feel that the seasons have really changed.

Now, you have left those faces with winter expressions, and you can't hear the softest sounds. You should feel that it is spring now.

### Spring

— Shi Jimei

Everyone says that spring comes early in Jiangnan, and everyone says that spring is good in Jiangnan. A month of wind and rain, rain and wind… soaks the spring so much that it doesn't even dare to show its face. Suddenly, the sky clears, and although the spring is strong, the sunlight shining on the body makes people feel like it's summer.

After fighting for several years, eating the enemy's unspeakable suffering, and waiting for the victorious spring day after day, victory has come, but spring seems still far away. Maybe this is spring in Jiangnan?

I can't think of an answer; but I remember there is an eternal immortal child—Peter Pan, who lives on "Neverland." It is said that "Neverland" has four springs a year, so—spring is for children, because "Neverland" is Peter Pan's domain, the paradise of fairies.

The human world naturally follows the heavens; spring is for children. So, I, a lagging spring seeker, went to the children to inquire about the news of spring.

Qinyin, who is nine and a half years old, said, "Auntie, what 'Neverland'! I haven't heard of it, but spring has really come. Look, the grass has greened."

Indeed, this piece of green is not the trace of spring?

Chenchen, who is fourteen years old, has the imagination of a poet: "The swallows are back, and they have also brought back the warm weather of the south, spring..."

However, did the swallows bring spring? Or did spring come and the swallows came back from the south? Probably only spring and the swallows themselves know. Chenchen doesn't know.

A girl who has just started junior high school wrote in her diary: "...Today's wind and rain will pass, and tomorrow, under the warm and sunny days, I will be a promising person, because the plan for the year lies in spring." —This is the thought of a smart and studious girl, the thought of spring.

I finally figured out the answer and explored the news of spring.

### The Last Quarter Moon

— Fang Yang

Everyone knows that the moon has its phases of waxing and waning, but one still cannot avoid being moved by the scene. Facing a silver hook in the long sky, that solitary last quarter moon.

A sad person says, "It was just reunited not long ago, and now it is already incomplete..."

A happy person says, "In a few days, the flowers will bloom and the moon will be full again."

Dear, what do you think? When that pale crescent moon hangs outside your little window...

### The Fall of Hope

— Liumang

Hope is like a famous city:

With long-standing historical sites,

With magnificent buildings;

It is a place where culture gathers,

It is a safe and joyful thoroughfare.

But hope is suddenly invaded by the enemy!

Like the great fire of Xianyang for three months,

Like the tragic massacre of Jiading for ten days.

The famous city is destroyed under the iron hooves,

The famous city disappears in the blaze.

Hope is like a famous city,

But the famous city has already fallen,

The famous city has also become a relic!

### Flying in Pairs (25)

— Zhao Qingge

"Dad, what's wrong with you? Your face is very red, your hands are very hot—you, what's wrong with you? Why are you staring straight at me? I, I'm afraid! Dad!" Lihua said, pulling her hand away forcefully and standing aside timidly.

"Don't be afraid, child! Don't be afraid! Come, sit beside me. Dad likes you. Dad is only happy when he sees you. In the past, your brother accompanied me for many years, but now he has gone to school and is no longer often with me. Then I have you again. If, if it weren't for you two siblings comforting me, Dad would have died long ago!" Master Mo said, stroking Lihua. Then he pulled her closer to him. A drop of old tears flowed onto the child's small hand.

"Dad, you... you're crying!"

Lihua asked in confusion. She used her sleeve to wipe Master Mo's eyes. "Ouch! Your head is scalding hot!" Lihua cried out in fright.

"Yes! Dad is very hot right now! It's probably the wine acting up," Master Mo said.

At this moment, Madam Mo returned. She shouted for Mo Sheng to open the door. Her voice startled Master Mo, and he suddenly sat up in bed.

"Mo Sheng must be asleep. I'll go open the door for Mom."

Lihua thought that Master Mo was going to open the door for Madam Mo, so she quickly stood up and ran out.

"Xiaohua, go ask your mom to come to the study for a moment."

"Okay!" Lihua responded and left.

Master Mo slowly got out of bed. The fire in his heart burned all his nerves tense. He forcibly supported his excitement. His thoughts were completely suffocated, so he didn't have time to consider much. He only firmly controlled one concept: that he wanted to break through this silence of six or seven years, and he wanted to avenge the shame of the past six or seven years!

Master Mo staggered to the desk, clenched his fists tightly with both hands, and stared intently at the door.

Sure enough, after a while, Lihua and Madam Mo came in. Madam Mo muttered as she walked:

"He's still not going to lie down after getting drunk. What does he want me for now?"

Before she could finish speaking, a sudden, unexpected slap landed on Madam Mo's left face.

"What are you doing? I want to teach you a lesson!" Master Mo roared, grabbing Madam Mo's shoulder with one hand.

"You, you drunkard! You dare hit someone?" Madam Mo jumped up in anger.

Indeed, Madam Mo had never dreamed that such an unexpected and humiliating attack would happen today. She angrily raised her hand, ready to resist her enemy. But suddenly, Master Mo pressed her onto the bed, followed by a rain of punches and kicks, heavily landing all over her body!
