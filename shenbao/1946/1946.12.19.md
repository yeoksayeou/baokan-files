### Article 1 of the General Principles of the Draft Constitution: The Comprehensive Committee Upheld the Original Draft After Reconsideration; Fierce Debate Over the Number of Supervisory Committee Members

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 18th] The fifth meeting of the Constitutional Draft Comprehensive Review Committee was held at 5:30 PM on the 18th at the Assembly venue. 113 representatives were present at the start, later increasing to 127. Chen Cheng chaired the meeting. First, Deputy Secretary-General Lei read the motion proposed by Chen Cheng and 37 others, requesting to retain the original text of Article 1 of the Constitutional Draft and to reconsider the decision of the Comprehensive Review Committee. Subsequently, at the request of Huang Shaomei, a representative from the Hubei region, Chen Cheng frankly explained the reasons for proposing the reconsideration, stating that the reason why the Assembly only reported the review results in the morning without discussing them was entirely due to the unresolved dispute over this article. Various parties held different opinions on this matter. It was heard that Mr. Chen Qitian of the Youth Party had vomited blood due to anxiety, and Kuomintang comrades had also debated this for days, but ultimately they sincerely cooperated. Therefore, he requested reconsideration to maintain the original text of the Constitutional Draft so that the meeting work could proceed smoothly and be completed. After Chen's speech, Fu Sinian first expressed his opposition, believing that the Comprehensive Review Committee had already made a decision on this point and that any changes should be proposed in the Assembly. Another group of representatives supported reconsideration. Chairman Chen then put the original text to a vote. Some representatives stood up to protest. Jiang Yiping argued: "No matter how much we compromise, the rules of procedure should be respected." Pan Gongzhan stated: "I believe that, according to legal procedures, the original draft text cannot be put to a vote directly. The reconsideration procedure should be followed first. Even if it is decided that reconsideration is permissible, the Assembly and the Review Committee must solemnly record the opinions of the minority during the discussion. The amendment proposed by Representative Fu to delete the seven characters 'of the people, by the people, for the people' from Article 1 of the original draft has already been passed. We can all still remember the reasons (cannot agree with this unclear and grammatically incorrect wording). I have already agreed with Representative Fu's opinion. Please propose a reconsideration of the change in the Assembly. Even if this committee accepts the reconsideration, the Assembly and the Review Committee must still solemnly record this opinion." (Applause) Chairman Chen immediately stopped the vote and expressed his apology for the negligence in handling this case in pursuit of efficiency, and announced the start of speeches.

Fu Sinian first said: "Bringing up this issue again today is not to stubbornly maintain the previous resolution to achieve my personal goals, but due to a spiritual feeling. I believe that my soul has not made any guarantees to anyone and should have the freedom to speak. I believe that reason should be clarified and should not be decided hastily by a phone call from Shanghai. This is by no means democratic politics, but genuine monarchical politics. Just now, a certain representative said: 'The French constitution also contains the phrase 'of the people, by the people, for the people,' but in the French constitution, this phrase does not involve the form of government but is only listed as the principle of its government.' The original text of Article 1 of the French Constitution is: 'France is an indivisible, secular, democratic, and social republic.' The form of government is clear and can be easily checked. (Applause) Therefore, what we are currently arguing about does not seem to be about reason. Not pursuing reason is called democratic politics. I have never heard of it. I do not expect to overturn this reconsideration motion with this reason, but only hope to include it in the record. I once strongly opposed a certain group of people pulling the constitution back to the May 5th Draft. Today, I also oppose this undemocratic meeting method in this so-called democratic assembly. Therefore, I hope to record it so that future generations can make their correct judgment and determine whether this is a democratic and free style." (Applause)

After Fu's speech, Jiang Yuntian rose and said: "I propose to postpone the decision on this issue and wait for all parties to sincerely discuss it further. Firstly, the role of us minority parties in the meeting can only be realized through reason and emotion in their claims. If we rely on voting rights, it is difficult to achieve any goals. This is what we do not want to do. Secondly, with such sharp disputes on this point, even if the Kuomintang uses its strict discipline to make its members abandon their claims, there will inevitably be unpleasant feelings. This is also what we do not want to do. (Applause) Thirdly, only the Kuomintang, Youth, and Democratic Socialist parties have participated in this arduous constitutional drafting work. We must pay attention to the intentions of those parties that have not participated in this work and people across the country so that our decisions can gain their agreement and acceptance. This is what the Democratic Socialist Party members hope for. Based on these three points, I propose that this issue be postponed for a vote and discussed separately." (Applause)

Subsequently, Chen Qitian spoke, saying that the constitutional draft review work had been going on for a year, with many twists and turns. It is impossible for several parties to completely agree on a decision on one matter. It is already a good thing to be able to make a decision and achieve general satisfaction. Our intention in participating in constitutional drafting is to formulate a constitution that the whole country can reluctantly agree to. I have been very anxious about this matter in recent days and have indeed vomited blood. I sincerely hope that the article proposed by Chairman Chiang can be smoothly supported by everyone and established."

At this point, those who wanted to speak rose one after another. Leng Xin rose and said: "I believe that the reasons of all parties have been explained. There is no need to engage in theoretical debates with stimulating tones. Please put it to a vote, Chairman." This was accepted by Chairman Chen, and the reconsideration opinion was passed with an absolute majority of 118 votes. The Comprehensive Review Committee's decision on Article 1 still maintained the original text of the draft: "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People, of the people, by the people, and for the people."

After this topic, the discussion of Song Wan's work on the 17th began according to the agenda. (8) The issue of the consent rights of the President of the Judicial Yuan, Grand Justices, and the Supervisory Yuan, the organizing opinion of Article "83", and the review of the Fourth Review Committee were maintained, and the result was passed. (9) Regarding the issue of the organization of the Examination Yuan and the consent rights of the Supervisory Yuan, the organizing opinion of Article "89" was adopted and the second review result of the Fourth Review Committee was adopted and modified as: "The Examination Yuan shall have one President and one Vice President, and a number of Examination Committee members, who shall be nominated by the President (deleting "according to law" and the two characters, ) and appointed with the consent of the Supervisory Yuan." (10) Regarding the issue of the qualification and evaluation of public officials, the organizing opinion of Article 91 maintained the original draft: "The qualifications of candidates for public office" are not included in the evaluation. (11) Regarding the issue of the consent and disciplinary rights of the Supervisory Yuan, the organizing opinion of Article 95 was modified according to the review result of the Fourth Review Committee as: "The Supervisory Yuan is the highest supervisory organ of the state, exercising the rights of consent, impeachment, indictment (deleting the two characters "disciplinary"), and audit." The organizing opinion of Article 99 was modified to: "When the Supervisory Yuan exercises its right of consent in accordance with this Constitution, it shall be decided by a majority vote of the attending committee members", and both were passed. At this point, (12) the issue of the number of Supervisory Committee members was brought up again, causing a fierce verbal battle. Zhang Weigao, a representative from the Gansu region, spoke and requested to maintain the original text of Article 96 of the Constitution Draft, which stipulated five people per province and two people per city. Ren Zhuoxuan rose to oppose, saying that our country is a unitary country, and the population of each province is unequal and it cannot be a uniform rigid regulation. He advocated adopting the elastic regulation of the Fourth Review Committee, with one to five people per province and one to two people per directly administered municipality.

Ruan Yichen supported Zhang Weigao's opinion and explained the reasons in detail, stating: "Firstly, the Assembly has already had disputes over the issue of ethnic minorities and cannot have issues with a minority of people. Secondly, the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan are both based on population ratios, and the Supervisory Committee should follow the principle of regional equality so that each province and city can have equal exercise of the right of consent and impeachment in the Supervisory Yuan. Thirdly, the Supervisory Committee is not supervising the people, but supervising officials. Although the population of each province and city varies, the establishment of governments at all levels is roughly the same, and the number of officials is not much different, so it should not be based on population. I am a representative of Zhejiang Province, and Zhejiang Province has a large population, but I am also willing to have provinces with smaller populations participate in the Supervisory Yuan equally."

Li Zhongxiang, as the convener of the Fourth Review Committee, explained that the committee did not completely base on the principle of population standards when reviewing this article, but rather on the differences in the area of each province (such as Anhui Province with only seven counties) and decided on this elastic regulation.

Jiang Yiping said that a class of "administrative divisions" has been added to Article "111", and the reorganization of provincial regions will be carried out sooner or later. He also advocated maintaining the original text of the draft and opposed determining the number of Supervisory Committee members based on population.

At this point, Chen Yiyun and Wang Xiaoying also spoke for women to fight for the number of Supervisory Committee members. Chen said: "Women will definitely do a good job in supervision. (Much laughter, applause.) If the election ratio can be passed, it does not matter, otherwise the supervisory aspect should be stipulated separately." Wang advocated that the quota allocation of the Supervisory Committee members should be the same as that of the Legislative Committee members. Wang Xiaolai appealed for directly administered municipalities and occupational groups, advocating that the quota of Supervisory Committee members in directly administered municipalities should be increased to four, or at least three, and occupational elections should also be adopted. For a time, speakers were clamorous. Wang Hanzhang forcefully refuted the public opinion and loudly called for attention to the border issues, giving remote provinces an equal status, advocating maintaining the original text of the Constitution Draft. The reaction of the audience was mixed, and the tide continued to rise, uncontrollably. At 5:15, the order was greatly disturbed, and Chairman Chen announced a recess, and the conveners gathered to organize various opinions.

The meeting continued at 5:40. Chen reported the results of the organization and explained several points of the convener's opinion: (1) The problem of large and small provinces can be naturally resolved after the reorganization of provincial regions. (2) The task of the Supervisory Committee members is to supervise officials. If politics can be clear, this system is even better, and there is no need to affect the harmonious meeting mood due to the quota issue. (3) Everyone has a career, and elections can never be extended to unemployed vagrants, and there is no need to list them separately. (4) The status of women should of course be improved, and it can be guaranteed by a gentleman's agreement, but it is not convenient to stipulate it in the constitution, and a way can be found in the election law. It was then put to a vote, and the result was passed with an absolute majority of 101 votes, maintaining the original text of Article "96" and adding a clause: "Eight nationals residing abroad" and other characters. Chen Yiyun demanded that Chairman Chen's report be included in the record. Wang Xiaoying and Wang Xiaolai declared that they reserved the right to speak at the Assembly, and the storm subsided. (13) Regarding the issue of whether the Supervisory Yuan impeaches the President and Vice President, the organizing opinion of Article "105" maintains the original text of the draft, and there is no need for special provisions. (14) Chapter 11, the provincial and county system, was changed to the local system issue, and the organizing opinion was passed by 176 votes after debate in accordance with the review results of the sixth and eighth review committees. At this point, it was 6:05, and the entire audience refused to extend the time and announced the adjournment of the meeting.

### The Peiping-Shenyang Plane Landed in Pyongyang, Korea Due to Fog; The Soviet Side Treated Them Generously and Released Them the Next Day

[Our Shenyang Correspondent, 18th] When the Peiping-Shenyang plane was flying to Shenyang on the 16th, it lost its direction due to fog and flew into Korean airspace. It landed at Pyongyang Airport when it had only 100 gallons of gasoline left. After landing, the thirty passengers on board were startled. They discovered that there were many Soviet military aircraft parked in the field, and Soviet troops came to investigate at the same time. All passengers initially thought they had mistakenly landed at the Lushun-Dalian Airport, but later learned that it was Pyongyang. The Soviet person in charge saw that there were many women and children on the plane and knew that it was a passenger plane. Although they could not communicate verbally, they were very polite. Because it was close to dusk, the plane was grounded overnight. The Soviet personnel were very hospitable and provided food and drink, which was very kind. They were released on the afternoon of the 17th. The Soviet side refueled the plane and it returned to Shenyang at 4:30 PM. Passengers included Mrs. Xiong, the director, and a section chief of the Xingyuan. According to the driver, although he knew that the situation was critical in the heavy fog, he tried his best to remain calm because he was carrying passengers and the lives of all passengers were the most important. Therefore, he did not prepare to parachute. Later, he received a ground radio to descend, and the result was Pyongyang. However, the Soviet friendship was touching.

### The Communist Army Intensifies Sabotage of the Peiping-Liaoning Railway; Leizhuang Station is Heavily Besieged; Fierce Fighting Also Occurs in the Peiping-Tianjin-Baoding Triangle

[Our Peiping Correspondent, 18th] Transportation circles report that the Communist army has recently intensified its sabotage of the Peiping-Liaoning Railway, almost every day for the past week. Starting at 3 PM on the 18th, they attacked Leizhuang Station with more than 4,000 people. The situation is unclear afterwards. The nearby National Army has rushed to rescue. The villages around Leizhuang have been completely occupied by the Communist army. Chazitou Station, north of Leizhuang, was also briefly captured by the Communist army on the 15th. A section of the power line between Anshan and Shimen was destroyed on the morning of the 17th, and a section of the railway between Guye and Leizhuang was destroyed on the morning of the 13th. At the same time, a section between Chazitou and Leizhuang was also destroyed. It was quickly repaired.

The Communist army south of the road attacked Anci from Gu'an. After the National Army learned of this plan, they preemptively recovered Gu'an and continued to mop up the Communist army in the Yongqing, Anci, Gu'an, and Baxian areas. Fierce fighting broke out in Gu'an on the 13th. More than 10,000 Communist troops launched a fierce attack, and the fierce fighting is still going on south of Gu'an.

### Zhang Lan Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing and Issues a Written Statement to Reporters Explaining the Democratic League's Views on the Current Situation

[Our Report] Zhang Lan, chairman of the Democratic League, arrived in Shanghai on the Long'an Wheel of the Sanbei Company in the early morning of the 18th. Those who came to welcome him included Shen Junru, Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, Chen Jiakang, and Pan Zinian. Zhang immediately issued a written statement saying: "After the headquarters of the Democratic League moved to Nanjing, I had planned to come to the east for a long time. I had already gone from Chengdu to Chongqing two months ago. At that time, I wanted to come directly to the east, but I learned that the National Assembly convocation order had been issued and I was sick, so I temporarily stayed in Chongqing. This time I came to Shanghai according to the original plan, not a temporary decision. The Democratic League should not participate in the divisive National Assembly. When I was in Chongqing, I had a phone call with the Nanjing headquarters and learned that the comrades in the central government and various places all agreed with this view, which was very gratifying. As for why the Democratic League does not participate in the National Assembly and its views on the current situation, the Democratic League issued a written statement when it received reporters in Nanjing on the 24th of last month, which I completely agree with. In the future, the Democratic League should stick to its original intention, support the Political Consultative Conference, oppose the civil war, and strive for the realization of peace, democracy, and unity. It should maintain a detached and independent third-party position in mediating the armed struggle between parties and continue to make its best efforts. I am also willing to contact truly third-party figures and all peace-loving people to work together.

As for participating in the government, the Democratic League will not consider this matter at all before the civil war stops and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference are implemented. As for the National Assembly that has been convened, I do not want to criticize the situation at all. What the people of China urgently need now is not to fight, and they must not fight in order to survive. Otherwise, all the people of China, whether farmers, workers, merchants, or students, will only end up perishing together. The War of Resistance Against Japan ended more than a year ago, and it is really outrageous to ask the people to bear the suffering of war. As for the future relationship between the Democratic Socialist Party and the Democratic League, it should wait for the decision of the Second Plenary Session of the Democratic League. However, no matter what, there should be no difference in our opinions on the struggle for democracy. In the future, we must work together, whether inside or outside the League. The date and location of the Second Plenary Session of the Democratic League must wait until the Standing Committee is convened before they can be decided. Mr. Zhang Dongsun may come to Shanghai to attend. Mr. Liang Shuming will not come to the east for the time being, but he is not passive. He has repeatedly discussed national affairs and League affairs with me, and our opinions are very similar."

Those who came with Zhang included Xian Ying and Fan Puzhai, members of the Standing Committee of the Democratic League. They are temporarily staying at Zhang Bojun's residence on Yuyuan Road. The People's Salvation National Association held a banquet to welcome them on the evening of the 18th. It is heard that the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Communist Party has also scheduled a banquet for Zhang and his party at Zhou's residence on Sinan Road on the afternoon of the 19th.

### Huge Traitor Executed by Firing Squad at Yuhuatai　Qi Xieyuan Executed Yesterday　Old Thief Feared Death and Was Chaotic Before Execution

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] Qi Xieyuan, a major traitor in North China, was transferred from Peiping to the capital in May of this year. After repeated interrogations, he was sentenced to death a month ago. On the afternoon of the 17th, the execution was approved by Chief of Staff Chen and authorized by the Chairman. On the morning of the 18th, reporters visited the prison and saw Qi, in the “Ren” cell number one, having breakfast of bean sprouts, tofu, and brown rice. At this time, Qi did not know that the execution was imminent. When a large number of reporters visited, the atmosphere immediately became tense. Huge traitors such as Ye Peng remained silent, and Qi was particularly uneasy, as if he knew that death was approaching. At exactly 10:00 AM, soldiers arrived at the prison to call roll and took Qi out of the prison. At the time, Qi was wearing a new blue silk coat, a melon-shaped hat, blue silk cotton trousers, black felt shoes, and grey-yellow woolen socks. He was old, bloated, and his steps were disordered. Qi immediately asked the guards, "Is today the execution?" The guard replied, "No, no!" Qi then calmed down as before. When exiting the third gate, Qi muttered to himself, "Today is Wednesday, is it to see family members?" As he was about to turn toward the family visiting room, the guard pulled him towards the exit gate. The old thief immediately realized the situation was not good. His face changed drastically and he trembled uncontrollably, with his hands tucked into his sleeves as he was dragged forward. Presiding Judge Meng Fuda, Judges Xu Zhennan, Zhang , He Guohun, and Clerk Ma Zhengqiang had already taken their seats in the court. After Qi arrived in court, he was mentally confused and did not know what to do. According to his statement: he was 62 years old, from Ninghe County, Hebei Province, and formerly a military advisor to the Peiping branch of the Military Commission. The Presiding Judge then read out the main text of the judgment: "Traitor Qi Xieyuan, colluding with enemy countries, plotting to resist our country, is sentenced to death and deprived of his civil rights for life. All property will be confiscated except for necessary living expenses for his family." The Presiding Judge then announced: "This case has been approved by the highest authorities and will be executed this morning. Does Qi Xieyuan have anything to say?" At this time, Qi had entered a state of confusion and did not know how to answer. After about two minutes, he shouted, "Qi—Xie—Yuan—Loves—His—Country!" Before he finished speaking, the judge interrupted, "Do you have anything to say to your family?" Qi again loudly replied, "Nothing to say!"

Writing "Will" Shaking All Over

The judge asked him if he had anything else to say and if he wanted to write a letter to his family. He said, "How do I write it?" The judge said that if he wanted to write, there was a place for him to write. He answered that he wanted to write, so under the guard of soldiers, at a small table in front of the courtroom door, Qi wrote two "Wills" with ink brush (see other article). At the time, he was shaking all over as he picked up the brush.

After about twenty minutes, he finished writing and threw the ink brush heavily on the table. Soldiers immediately tied him up. At this time, Qi's nerves were extremely tense, and he did not ask to be untied. He looked around at the audience and said, "Please everyone, this is the result of loving the country!" His words were incoherent. After being bound, he was pushed onto a large truck parked in front of the door and driven straight to the Yuhuatai execution ground at top speed.

Kneeling Facing North One Shot to Death

At the execution ground, there were already more than two thousand spectators gathered on the hillside waiting to watch the execution. After the execution vehicle arrived, the execution soldiers immediately worked with the South Suburb Police Bureau to set up a cordon. In a short time, Qi was carried to the lawn at the foot of the mountain and made to kneel facing north. Under the order of Supervising Officers Yan Houde and Wang Jingwu, executioner Yang Guangzhao fired one shot with a rifle, which entered the center of his back. Qi immediately fell to the ground. The soldiers untied him and turned his body upright. At this time, only two minutes had passed since the shooting. Qi had not yet breathed his last. His eyes gradually closed from large to small, and his face showed signs of death. A hole was torn in the front of his leather coat, and blood gurgled from the wound. He did not struggle at all, and died after another two minutes, at exactly 10:30 AM.

### Qi's Two "Wills"

The First

"Qi Xieyuan is a person who loves his country, unexpectedly harmed by those who are jealous. I hope my compatriots and family members will take note."

The Second

"National affairs are extremely volatile. Compatriots should always take loving the country as the foundation. Do not let the result of my loving the country lead to something unacceptable. The struggle for national rights, the struggle for national rights, can lead to the destruction of the country and the extinction of the nation. Those who cannot give up power, even if Xieyuan dies as a vengeful ghost, will certainly fight against this. No personal matters are mentioned, that is all."

Four-Plank Coffin Huge Traitor is Gone

The audience on the mountain applauded, and the mountains and valleys echoed with the sound. The undertakers carried the pre-placed four-plank coffin and put Qi's body inside, temporarily burying it, pending identification by family members. Thus, the life of a generation of huge traitors came to an end.

Qi had been quite docile in the detention center for several months, but three days ago, he suddenly changed his behavior, making a fuss every day, demanding better food, claiming that coarse food was unpalatable. The guards said this might be a premonition of death.

### Pauley's Investigation Report Bernas Believes Should Not Be Published

[United Press International, San Francisco, 18th] Reparations Commissioner Pauley told reporters today that he was extremely troubled by the publication of the confidential report he submitted on his investigation of the situation in Northeast China by a certain senator. He believed that the report could be made public, but Secretary of State Bernas believed that it should definitely not be published at this time. However, since a committee of the Senate had requested his report on the nine provinces of Northeast China, he had no choice but to comply. It is reported that Pauley's report to President Truman and Bernas stated that the Soviet Union's plunder of industrial equipment in the Northeast was based on far-reaching military strategic reasons.

### Hong Kong Police Kicking Wang Shuixiang to Death Case The Court Cannot Pronounce Judgment The Trial is Scheduled to Resume This Morning The Defendant is Released on Bail

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 18th] The police officer Lin Xingshe, who kicked Wang Yongxiang to death, underwent a second public trial in the High Court on the morning of the 18th, with Judge Baigaole presiding. Three witnesses were first called to testify, and the hearing continued at 12:30 PM, with the defendant's lawyer arguing that the testimonies of the witnesses were muddled and could not be used as a basis for conviction. It was also stated that the deceased suffered from splenomegaly, which could rupture and cause death at any time. Judging from the circumstances at the time, the deceased actually died of illness rather than being kicked to death. The judge then elaborated on the instructions to the jurors on how to judge the case, saying that the case should be based on facts and carefully and thoroughly studied from beginning to end before a verdict could be reached, and should not be affected by any external influences or harbor any prejudices. The jury consisted of seven people, four Westerners and three Chinese. After listening, they retired at 3:10 PM. After two hours of lengthy deliberations, they finally passed a verdict of not guilty by a vote of four to three, and reported to the judge. The judge ruled that, according to British law, whether guilty or not guilty, there must be a decision of five to two jurors before a verdict can be pronounced. Therefore, it was announced that the case could not be judged, and a retrial was scheduled for the morning of the 19th. Another seven jurors were called to the court for jury duty. The defendant Lin Xingshe was released on bail of one hundred yuan pending trial.

### Large-Scale Yellow River Water Conservancy Plan Completion Will Electrify Four Provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong Savage and Others Survey Longmen and Hukou

[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 18th] Savage and his party, who traveled 5,000 kilometers over the entire line from the Yellow River to the East China Sea to the source of the river in Qinghai Province, left Xi'an this morning to survey Longmen Hukou, and are expected to return by Christmas. According to experts, building dams on the upper reaches of the Yellow River for power generation and irrigation will greatly benefit Longmen and the Shimen Hukou, five kilometers north of it. Once completed, the power generation will reach the average level of the US TVA, enough to electrify Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, and the Shanghai, Peiping-Hankou, and Datong-Puzhou railways, irrigate 20 million mu of farmland, and allow 10,000-ton ships to travel between Fenhekou and Tongguan. There will be no floods in the lower reaches of the Yellow River for fifty years. It is also said that the Zhulamaxia Gorge, Niubixia Gorge, and the Xiangxia Gorge on the border of Gansu and Qinghai in Shaanxi are planned to build dams to store water and generate electricity, which can reach a total of 600,000 horsepower. Savage does not want to publish partial preliminary conclusions before the full survey is completed. In addition, there are still remnants of the Communist army in the Shangxian, Luonan, and Chujuzhai areas on the border of Shaanxi and Henan.

[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 17th] The Yellow River governance advisory group led by Savage, a party of eleven, arrived here today and visited the local authorities, and immediately went to various places for inspection. They will first go to the Sanqu on the Jingwei Road, and after inspecting the Baoji Gorge, 15 kilometers east of Saiji, they will go along the highway to Hancheng and Yichuan to survey the Longmen of the Yellow River, and then go north 65 kilometers to Hukou. They will try to return to Xi'an by Christmas to avoid spending the holiday on the frozen Yellow River. Liu Zhongrui, Director of the Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau, will accompany them.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 17th] Savage and his party visited Chairman Zhu and then rested at Huaqing Pool. They returned to the province in the evening and are scheduled to go to Longmen for work at 9:00 AM tomorrow. The itinerary of the delegation in Shaanxi has been decided. They will first go to Longmen, then to the Luo, Jingwei canals, and Baoji Gorge, and then to Henan Province. They are expected to return to the capital at the beginning of next month.

### Postal Delivery in Shaanxi Has Not Improved

Beijing-Shanghai Newspapers Become Bi-Weekly

[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 17th] After the Ministry of Communications promulgated the time limit for postal and telecommunications delivery, postal delivery in Shaanxi has not improved. The direct Xu-Shaanxi train runs once a week, but mail from Beijing and Shanghai takes 40 days to arrive here. Airmail flights have been reduced from three times a week to once, stopping in E County, and it takes two or three days to reach the urban area, so it is often slower than land transportation. Beijing-Shanghai newspapers have become bi-weekly. The First District Telecommunications Bureau manages the sending and receiving of inter-provincial and inter-regional telegrams within Shaanxi and Henan provinces, and all meet the standard speed. The Telecommunications Bureau has suggested adding a direct Shaanxi-Shanghai communication line, which would reach its destination in one hour after implementation.

### Our Deputy Consul to Saigon Xu Nai Went to the Four Prefectures to Comfort the People The French Side Expressed Its Commitment to Protecting Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Diplomatic sources said: France and Siam signed an agreement in Washington on October 17, stipulating that Siam would return the four prefectures to France. Our side then stated that there were many overseas Chinese residing there, and requested the French government to properly protect the overseas Chinese during and after the takeover of the four prefectures, which was agreed to by the French side. Our Deputy Consul to Saigon, Xu Nai, flew from Saigon to Phnom Penh on the 9th, and entered Madex with the French army on the morning of the 10th. Before the French army took over the area, the local overseas Chinese closed their doors and suspended business, in a state of panic. After Xu arrived, he separately visited French Army Commander Daixiongji and Khmer representative Zhu Long, requesting them to earnestly protect the safety of the lives and property of the overseas Chinese, and then summoned the overseas Chinese leaders to convey the central government's intentions. Now the market in the area has recovered and the people's hearts are stable, and the overseas Chinese have gradually resumed business. On the 11th, Deputy Consul Xu hosted a banquet for Dai Zhu and the French-Khmer military and political authorities, and introduced them to the overseas Chinese. Xu delivered a speech on the spot, emphasizing that he requested the French-Khmer authorities to pay attention to the safety of the overseas Chinese in the four prefectures in the future. Both Dai and Zhu sincerely expressed their commitment to protecting the overseas Chinese. Other provinces such as Ditou, Fenbase, and Beilai were generally peaceful, and the overseas Chinese were all celebrating their well-being. Deputy Consul Xu flew back to Saigon on the 13th.

### Fierce Fighting Between French and Vietnamese Troops in Hanoi The Overseas Chinese District is Safe

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 18th] After several clashes between French and Vietnamese troops in Hanoi yesterday, the tense situation has become more serious. Gunfire continued throughout the night of the 17th, and large-scale conflicts could occur at any time. On the morning of the 18th, French and Vietnamese troops engaged in fierce fighting again in the market and near the Hanoi Bridge, which lasted for about two hours before stopping. The two sides are still facing each other. Some areas of the city are under martial law.

[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 18th] French and Vietnamese troops clashed near the Great Lake this morning, killing three French soldiers and fifteen Vietnamese soldiers.

### New Insecticide "Di Ding Si"

Made by Taichung Sugar Factory Can Eliminate Plant Pests

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 18th] The Taichung Sugar Factory of the Resources Committee has recently manufactured "Dilis" powder, which is a powerful and effective plant insecticide, but is currently little known. This drug is made from the roots of DERTIS in leguminous plants. Mr. Machang Xian of Taipei City transplanted seedlings from Singapore in 1927 and gradually promoted planting. In 1943, the factory established the Dilis Factory to engage in the production of finished products. The current output has reached 15,000 catties per month. Dilis roots contain a toxin called ROTENON, which is 30 times more potent than lead arsenate. Regardless of the concentration, it can kill plant pests, and it also has the effect of promoting plant growth, improving varieties, and increasing yields. In 1930, the factory suffered from two pests on sugarcane, namely wireworms and termites. After using Dilis powder, it was extremely effective and is still widely used today. This drug also has strong toxicity to animals. If swallowed, it can cause death within ten minutes to three hours. Those who come into contact with it will also die within thirty minutes to six hours. A large fish three feet long can also die in its million-fold solution, so it is also an effective drug for reducing bed bugs. However, whether it exceeds the efficacy of "DDT" cannot be determined at present because no comparative research has been conducted. It is said that the natives of Malaya in the past used this plant to make poisoned arrows for fishing or hunting. Currently, Taiwan and various parts of Southeast Asia have many products. The factory has now renamed this powder product as "Di Ding Si" insecticide, with a selling price of NT$12 per pound.

### "Christian General" Feng Yuxiang Recounts His Rise to Fame at a Reception

[Our Correspondent in New York, Mao Shuqing, 17th] This afternoon, General Feng Yuxiang gave a speech at a reception held at the Sino-American Christian Alliance on 77th Street here, recounting how he became the "Christian General": "When I was 15 years old in 1896, I hated Christianity and often disrupted preaching, and I even moved the preaching podium on the street in Baoding, Hebei. However, I was gradually influenced by American missionaries and finally became a Christian in 1912."

The chairman of the reception was Mr. Qin, the managing director of the alliance, who had served as a professor at Northwest University of China. He introduced General Feng to the Americans present. General Feng first expressed his gratitude to the United States for its assistance to our country during the war, and hoped to enhance the traditional friendship between China and the United States in order to seek lasting world peace.

Speakers who followed General Feng included Dr. Yang Yuanqing, former president of Soochow University, Mr. Gibson, director of the New York City Government's Department of Commerce, and Dr. Mayou, dean of Boston Theological Seminary. All emphasized developing Sino-American friendship with the spirit of Christianity. Finally, Ji Zhifeng, a famous Peking opera amateur, sang Peking opera, which was highly praised by the audience.

### Student Unrest at Fu Jen Catholic University

[United Press International, Peiping, 18th] Two thousand students at Fu Jen Catholic University in Xicheng, Peiping, went on strike on the 17th and confined President Chen Yuan to the lecture hall. Today, all professors and lecturers at the university went on strike to show their disapproval. Earlier, last week the university announced that each student should pay a coal fee of 35,000 yuan to heat the classrooms. The students immediately held a meeting and believed that the coal fee was too high. The university declared that any student who did not pay the fee would not be given credit for the semester. All the students then staged a demonstration strike yesterday, locking the classrooms and confining a small number of professors to the classrooms, which caused the professors to feel resentment and subsequently went on strike. It is expected that this matter will continue until after the Christmas and New Year holidays.

### Curing the Symptoms Should Not Neglect the Root Cause

Exchanging what one has for what one needs is inherently a mutually beneficial action. In the current international relations, which are becoming increasingly close, the era of closed-door policies has long become a thing of the past. Not only exchanging what one possesses for what others lack is the normal course of international trade, but also making the best use of one's strengths and abandoning one's weaknesses is also in line with economic principles.

The problem lies in the fact that international relations have their ups and downs, tariff barriers have not been completely abolished, and restrictions on imports and exports, as well as remnants of domestic controls, have not been completely eliminated even in economically superior countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, whether a country's surplus products can be freely marketed and whether a country's necessities can be freely purchased are still ideals today. As for the period of military conflict, mutual blockades and traffic disruptions, leading to extreme chaos and difficulty in domestic industries, we, in China after eight years of resistance, have a deep understanding of reflecting on the past and looking at the present!

Therefore, although the ideal of self-sufficiency is not easy to achieve in practice, it is not necessarily completely feasible in theory. However, it is extremely dangerous for a country's economic lifeline, especially the daily necessities of the people, to constantly rely on others and be unable to provide for itself. As a result of the First World War, everyone knew that the Allied Powers failed due to bread. As a result of the Second World War, everyone also knew that the Allied Powers gained strength from production. Judging from these historical lessons, it can be seen that if a country's economic foundation is too weak and lacks the ability to exist independently, it is very disheartening.

As a result of unequal treaties, China's economy had long been reduced to a semi-colonial status. After the victory, although unequal treaties have been abolished one after another, the economic foundation has been damaged too much, and it has not yet recovered to this day. Moreover, issues such as currency, exchange rate, prices, transportation, and labor are all chaotic and unresolved, and the already very fragile foundation seems to be shaking completely. Here, let's cite a few examples for review.

The most important economic needs are nothing more than clothing and food, followed by silk and wool fabrics. Now, with the textile industry, it is said to be relatively advantageous. However, the production volume is fundamentally insufficient, and most of the cotton has to be imported from overseas. If foreign cotton is insufficient, this relatively advantageous industry will be fundamentally shaken. In recent days, the authorities and industry representatives have been discussing the issue of foreign cotton exchange settlement for days, which has been painstaking, indicating that the raw material problem is very serious, that is, the textile industry and the problem of people's clothing are very serious. It is also rumored that Japanese and Indian cloth have arrived in Hong Kong. When the news reached Shanghai, the cloth market in this city immediately fluctuated. The future of the textile industry, which is under internal and external attack, is extremely worrying!

The crisis in the silk weaving industry can be seen from the urgency of its loan applications and the calls for relaxed conditions. This point can also be said to be a common problem in various industries now. The most worrying thing is: (1) If Japanese rayon does not arrive, the industry is in danger of closing down. (2) If Japanese silkworm cocoons do not arrive, it is also rumored that silk reeling factories will completely stop work by the end of the year. Judging from this, whether it is the silk weaving industry or the silk reeling industry, its lifeline is completely dependent on foreign goods. And if foreign sales do not move, the silk industry will not move either, forcing the Central Trust Bureau to step in and purchase at a price. The silk fabric industry has too much inventory, and it has to rely on borrowing to survive. What a miserable thing this is!

The wool weaving industry is an emerging enterprise. According to the industry's report: If all operations are started, it can very well supply domestic needs. Its difficulties lie in (1) the dumping of cheap foreign goods, making it impossible to compete with them, and (2) most of the raw materials used must be imported from overseas. Now, leaving aside the first point, China is originally a wool-producing country, and the quantity is not small. The reason for purchasing foreign goods is said to be due to the length of the fibers being more suitable, and also due to less mixing, making them easier to process. Then, before these shortcomings can be remedied, the industry's raw materials must also be imported from abroad.

China is originally an agricultural country. Even before the war, it had to import a large amount of foreign rice every year to supplement its needs. In May and June of this year, rice prices soared. In addition to transporting Sichuan and Jiangxi rice to Shanghai for sale, the government also purchased foreign rice from Brazil and other countries to supplement the supply, just like the United Kingdom, Japan, and other countries, as if it could not do without it for a single day, which is already confusing. Apart from rice, flour is also a major food. The flour milling industry occupies a considerable position in China's modern industries. Unfortunately, domestic wheat is not enough to meet the needs. Not long ago, it once stopped work due to insufficient raw materials. In order to maintain the people's food supply and maintain this industry, the government was forced to purchase foreign rice to supplement the supply. According to this, both rice and flour, the two main foods of the people, must be supplemented by imports from foreign countries. As for shark fins, sea cucumbers, dried shrimp, canned food, foreign wine, fruits, and so on, foreign goods are everywhere, which is especially worth mentioning.

The most important building materials are hardware, cement, and wood. Most hardware is imported, and there are currently no domestic products that can replace it. Cement, which could potentially be replaced, is also overwhelmed by cheap foreign goods. Modern buildings must purchase foreign pine, tongue-and-groove boards, and so on. Domestic wood from Anhui and Fujian, etc., is not only insufficient to replace them, but also has surprisingly high shipping costs, making the cost too expensive, and it is still impossible to compete. The housing shortage is now serious everywhere, but the construction industry remains stagnant as before. There are naturally many reasons for this. However, the fundamental lack of domestic raw materials is certainly one of them.

When it comes to people's travel, the situation is even more serious. Look at trains, locomotives, automobiles, trams, ships, which one is not an imported product? At least the mechanical parts and tire parts cannot but rely on imported goods for assembly. Even small items such as rickshaws, pedicabs, and bicycles do not have a single one that is purely a domestic product. As for gasoline and engine oil, the domestic products are so small that they are negligible, which is something that everyone can see. Fortunately, sailboats, civilian boats, handcarts, and the like have not been completely eliminated. If material civilization takes another step forward and these ancient means of transportation completely disappear, then taking a single step out of the door will require relying on foreign goods!

The above four categories of clothing, food, housing, and transportation are mostly light industrial products, or even unprocessed agricultural products. However, if foreign goods are cut off and cannot be replenished, there is a danger of being unable to survive from one day to the next. As for national defense industries, machinery industries, chemical industries, etc., apart from the supply of foreign goods, it is difficult to take even a single step. Looking at the entire economic and industrial sectors, this is an extremely serious matter!

At this time of extreme crisis in industry and commerce, everyone knows the need for prompt rescue. We also hope that these rescue efforts will be carried out swiftly and effectively. However, only rescuing the present is a superficial solution. We hope that while curing the symptoms, we must not forget to treat the root cause. In general, all industries must be able to stand on their own feet fundamentally, and various important industries and people's daily necessities must develop rapidly, so that they can achieve self-sufficiency and not rely on others. Only then can it be considered true economic construction.

### Southwest Transportation Artery: Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Under Construction; Funding and Materials Secured

[Our Newspaper Chengdu News] The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, a major artery of transportation in Southwest China, is now undergoing accelerated construction. The central government is determined to expedite the completion of the construction project. In addition to the pre-war investment of 20 million yuan jointly contributed by the Ministry of Communications, Sichuan Provincial Government, and China Construction Bank, it has now been decided that the Ministry of Communications and Sichuan Provincial Government will each increase their investment by 26 billion yuan. Sichuan Province will raise 80% of this amount through levies on grain farmers throughout the province, to be deducted from central government loans, while Chongqing City and the counties and cities along the railway will each contribute 10%. For the first phase of the project next year, the Ministry of Communications will first allocate 15 billion yuan. It is estimated that all French materials will be shipped to Sichuan by February or March of next year. The 15 billion yuan to be allocated by the Sichuan Provincial Government will be disbursed after approval by the Sichuan Provincial Assembly this month. The route follows the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, bypassing Jiangjin to Yongchuan, then bypassing Jinyang and Xindu to Chengdu. Tunnel and bridge construction is actively underway throughout Sichuan. Guang, from the Railway Bureau, is currently in Beijing negotiating the purchase of materials and will return to Chongqing within days to oversee the commencement of construction on the entire line.

[Our Newspaper Chengdu News] He Beiheng, Director of the Sichuan Construction Department, recently went to Beijing to discuss the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Dujiangyan Power Plant, and the promotion of construction work in Sichuan Province with the central government. He returned to Chengdu on the 13th. According to his remarks, the central focus of Sichuan Province's construction work in the future will be on developing power industries. Regarding the Dujiangyan Hydropower Irrigation Project, an agreement has been reached with the Canadian Ambassador to China to secure a loan of 5 million to 10 million US dollars. The Dujiangyan Power Plant will adopt the plan of Canadian engineer Kirk Kirsten, with the first phase completing a 50,000 kilowatt power generation project and the second phase completing a 250,000 kilowatt power generation project. In addition, the expansion of the Changshou-Longxi River hydropower project in eastern Sichuan has also received a Canadian loan, and the construction of a 50,000 kilowatt total capacity will be completed soon. In the future, the irrigation and water conservancy of farmland in the Chengdu Plain in western Sichuan and eastern Sichuan will be completely resolved.

### Detective Mistakenly Arrests Principal: Lu Jingxuan Suffers Unjust Calamity; Has No Connection with Arms Trafficking Case; Returns After Release, Speaks Out for Injustice at the Provisional Council

[Our Newspaper Suzhou News] Lu Jingxuan, the principal of the Suzhou County Middle School, was suspected of arms trafficking. Personnel dispatched by the Changzhou Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Protection Headquarters came to Suzhou and, together with the local police局, arrested him at his residence in Fang Lane at midnight on the 14th. The next morning, he was taken directly to Changzhou for interrogation. After the news broke, various parties were extremely shocked. Our newspaper reporter continued to inquire with the relevant authorities for several days and learned that Mr. Lu was not the perpetrator but was mistakenly arrested due to the same surname and given name. It turns out that the Changzhou Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Protection Headquarters had cracked a large-scale arms trafficking case a month ago. After questioning, all the local criminals confessed that there was an accomplice named Lu Yan, who was the principal of the Jingjiang County Middle School, currently teaching in Suzhou and hiding at No. 30 Xinxue Front Street in Suzhou City, continuing his activities. The headquarters immediately dispatched personnel to Suzhou, lodging at the Tianran Hotel outside the Lümen Gate, to secretly investigate. Unexpectedly, the criminal became aware of this and immediately disappeared. By the time they went to arrest him together with the local police局, they only managed to arrest the criminal's brother-in-law. At that time, they immediately launched another investigation. Mr. Lu was mistakenly arrested because he was also known as "Principal Lu of the County Middle School." Due to the haste that night, there was no time for interrogation. The next day, he was taken to the Changzhou Headquarters. It was a routine weekend holiday. It was not until the 16th that Guo Luzhou, the commander of the Railway Protection Headquarters, personally interrogated him and realized that he had mistakenly arrested an innocent person. He was immediately released on bail by Sun Danzhen, the county magistrate of Wujin County. Now, Mr. Lu has safely returned to Suzhou, reported the arrest to the Education Bureau, and requested that the matter be escalated to uphold justice and protect his reputation.

This was rarely seen in March. Cao was furious and specifically summoned the seven garrison area captains on the 18th afternoon, instructing them on various methods of arresting thieves and strengthening defense, the main point being to organize patrols, to patrol around, and to randomly check suspicious pedestrians at any time.

### England and America Begin New Actions to Organize Provisional Western Government. Spanish Republican Prime Minister Declares Before Leaving US for Europe That Force Will Be Used If Necessary to Oust Franco

[Special dispatch from our London correspondent, 18th] According to sources in the British government: the British diplomatic mission in Spain is actively organizing a provisional coalition government to replace the Franco regime. A formal government will be elected after a general election is held. Starting today, the British mission has begun negotiations with leaders of various Spanish political parties, including right-wing and left-wing moderates, but refusing participation by extremists. The British government further stated: US participation in the above activities is expected. It is unknown how the British side will overthrow the Franco regime. However, according to well-informed sources: the Spanish military no longer supports Franco. England and America plan to start from this point, using the Spanish military as the main factor supporting the new government. Furthermore, according to authoritative observers: England and America's current activities in Spain to organize a pro-British and American government are intended to counter the Soviet Union's attempt to establish a left-wing regime in the West.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 17th] José Giral, leader of the Spanish Republican government in exile, said before departing for Paris today: If Franco does not abdicate voluntarily, the Spanish people will have to use force to expel him, but if Franco hands over power, Spain can avoid civil war.

### Vandenberg Decides to Support Byrnes' Foreign Policy; Bipartisan Opinions Differ Slightly on Far East Issues

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] Senator Vandenberg, the US representative to the UN General Assembly, made a statement to the press after returning here from New York today, saying that he does not intend to accompany Byrnes to the meeting of the four foreign ministers in Moscow in March next year, but this does not mean that he does not agree with the policies adopted by Byrnes. On the contrary, I fully agree with Byrnes' foreign policy and will continue to support it. As for the US presidential election in 1948, I do not intend to participate in the election.

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Senator Vandenberg, the Republican leader on foreign affairs who will chair the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the next session, said today: There is considerable misunderstanding of the so-called bipartisan foreign policy of the United States. In fact, it does not mean that the Republican Party agrees with all of Secretary of State Byrnes' foreign policies. The agreed-upon foreign policy between the two parties only includes the affairs of the United Nations organization and the negotiations on the peace in Europe. Other foreign policy issues, such as Palestine, tariffs, Latin America, and the Far East, the two parties may not have the same opinions. However, Vandenberg reiterated that he believes that the foundation of US post-war foreign policy has been firmly established, and said that he will continue to do his best to maintain a united US foreign policy. For the benefit of the United States, he should continue to support Byrnes' policies on the peace in Europe, the establishment of a collective security system, and the United Nations organization. However, he finally specifically stated that the Republican Party cannot bear any responsibility for the government's Palestine policy.

### US Promotes Famine Relief Campaign Truman to Issue Statement

### Byrnes Denies Exhaustion Praises Achievements of Foreign Ministers' Conference. Soviet Discussions on Boundaries Turn More Moderate

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] US Secretary of State Byrnes recently declared at a press conference: British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov have expressed satisfaction with the progress made at the conference of the four foreign ministers and the UN General Assembly, and I feel the same way. Rumors that I will submit my resignation are absolutely untrue. I have no intention of resigning or resting. (According to people close to Secretary of State Byrnes, Secretary of State Byrnes will not consider resigning until he has participated in resolving the peace treaty with Germany.) The next meeting of the four foreign ministers will be held in Moscow, and I will ask Senators Connally and Vandenberg to go with me.

[United Press, Washington, 17th] Secretary of State Byrnes returned to Washington from New York after attending the United Nations conference, and today hosted reporters to report his impressions of the conference, praising the achievements of the four foreign ministers' conference and the UN General Assembly, while issuing a warning that this progress and the increasing consensus among the major powers does not mean that all difficulties have been resolved. The most gratifying thing is that the four foreign ministers have agreed to appoint representatives to prepare for the peace treaties with Germany and Austria, so that the four foreign ministers can directly review them when they meet in Moscow in March next year.

[United Press, Moscow, 17th] "A New Era" magazine, the authoritative publication of Soviet foreign policy, today discussed the various efforts of the major powers to negotiate international issues in 1946 and expressed optimism about the prospects for cooperation between the Soviet Union and Western countries. It is said that although reactionary elements of the imperialist faction tended to impose the opinions of one country on other countries this year, new methods of democratic cooperation have achieved excellent results internationally. Although there are contradictions between countries on all specific issues, the experience of the war shows that all freedom-loving nations, regardless of their political and social systems and ideologies, will be able to find a common voice and a way to resolve contradictions without panic. Each side must abandon some demands and focus its greatest efforts on cooperation in a certain plan, which plan should be uniformly acceptable to other colleagues. The progress made by the recent conference of the four foreign ministers in completing the five-nation treaty proves that the constructive solution to post-war problems lies in the negotiation and agreement of the major powers, which is clearly different from the voting method adopted by the Paris Peace Conference.

### British Diplomatic Personnel to Undergo Major Changes

### French Cabinet Officially Established After House of Representatives Passes Vote of Confidence. Supported by Everyone from the Communist Party to the Extreme Right Party, Main Task is to Balance Budget This Year

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] Blum's Socialist Party cabinet has officially become the fifth provisional government since the liberation of France after obtaining a vote of confidence from the House of Representatives today. Everyone from the Communist Party to the extreme right-wing Republican Liberty Party cast a vote of confidence. Out of 546 members of parliament, only two voted against. Blum told the House of Representatives that the main task of his government during its five weeks in office is to balance the ordinary budget for the remainder of the year. According to the balance sheet drafted by outgoing Finance Minister Schuman, there is a shortfall of 1.9 trillion francs in the total national expenditure of 6.5 trillion francs. At the same time, according to some political observers, the refusal of the Communist Party to serve as Minister of Defense is the first test of the strength of the Communist Party and anti-Communist factions, and it is expected that a second test will occur during the election of the President of the Republic in January. The most promising candidate for president is former Radical Party Prime Minister Herriot. During the negotiations last week, he made every effort to make concessions to the Communist Party, so he has the strong support of the Communist Party. As for the anti-Communist faction, it wants to appoint General de Gaulle as president, but it is not yet known whether he is willing to take this position, as General de Gaulle has criticized the president's powers under the new constitution.

### Atomic Energy Commission Discusses US Proposal

Decision Postponed to 20th for Vote

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 17th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission is discussing the US proposal on the control of atomic energy to decide whether the commission will submit the proposal to the Security Council for discussion. According to the proposal put forward by the United States, when the Atomic Energy Commission submits a report to the Security Council on December 31, it should propose the establishment of an international control system. Implementation will begin when the countries concerned sign a treaty supporting the international control plan. The treaty should stipulate the establishment of an international atomic energy development agency, granting it the power to control atomic energy, and the power to control the mining of ore, as well as manufacturing methods and uses. This agency also has the power to send representatives to various places for inspection. The manufacture, retention, or use of atomic weapons by any country is prohibited. The disposal of existing atomic bombs should also be stipulated in the treaty. Any country that violates the treaty will be regarded as an international crime and will be punished. US Representative Baruch urged representatives of all countries on the Atomic Energy Commission today to submit the US proposal for a vote, saying: It is time for us to follow up our words with action. The UN General Assembly's discussion of disarmament issues has been supported by all member states unanimously, and the declaration of the end of the disarmament plan will have a significant impact on the people of the world today and our future generations, so it is of great historical significance. Now that the United Nations General Assembly has passed the disarmament plan, we should speed up the adoption of the atomic energy control plan. At this point, representatives from the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia stood up to speak one after another, all requesting the Atomic Energy Commission to pass the US proposal. Dutch Representative Van Kleffens said that the US proposal on the control of atomic energy and the disarmament plan passed by the UN General Assembly do not contradict each other in any way. Representatives from China and Brazil also believed that the US proposal should be adopted and that swift action was necessary. The French representative expressed support in principle but proposed that the US proposal should be studied according to the rules. Soviet Representative Gromyko requested time to study the US proposal, saying that he did not believe that the disarmament plan passed by the UN General Assembly was completely parallel to the US proposal, especially on the issue of veto power, the disarmament plan did not mention it. Finally, US Representative Baruch agreed to postpone the proposal he had put forward to be voted on until the 20th of this month, so that the Soviet representative would have sufficient time to study it.

### British Foreign Policy (Part 2)

— Authored by Professor Carr, Specially Translated by the Newspaper Translation Department

Foreign policy and trade policy are closely related. In diplomacy, Britain must seek a balance between the US and the Soviet Union, and in trade, it must seek a balance between imports and exports, that is, implement a planned economy.

One of the foundations of British foreign policy is that it is a country that needs large-scale imports. At the same time, precisely because of this, it must also be a country with large-scale exports. However, the term "exporting country" seems best used sparingly, because in the past its application has created an optimistic illusion that exports are sufficient to create more employment. In fact, such an idea is the number one economic fallacy. If our motivation is to guarantee people's employment, let us organize them to produce the food and supplies we need. The war has taught us many good economic principles. Today, if we cleverly see a large amount of urgently needed domestic materials being loaded onto ships and transported to foreign countries, we should know that exporting goods is not an absolutely beneficial thing in itself, but an inescapable demon, or more precisely, a step towards destruction. Today, we are busy transporting essential materials to exchange for more urgent things, such as staple foods, raw materials and oils, which constitute the mainstay of British exports. The need for imported goods is always the basis for determining foreign trade.

Creditor Nation Becomes Debtor Nation

Since 1930, the balance of British foreign trade has shown a huge deficit. In fact, we are selling off part of our foreign investment as compensation. Even if the Second World War did not happen, we would have gradually moved to a point where imports would inevitably be reduced due to the exhaustion of repayment sources sooner or later. The war only accelerated this shift. The foreign investments we sell to offset the import surplus are increasing, and the foreign debt we borrow for the same reason is increasing day by day. As a result, we have changed from a creditor nation to whom other countries owe debts to a debtor nation burdened with debts to others. In the future, the task of our country's export industry will not only be to offset imports, but to clear these debts. If we hope to restore the import volume before 1939, we must increase our export volume by at least one-third to one-half more than before 1939. Although our increased export movement was successful last year, it is still far from reaching this figure.

I once said that politically, Britain needs the importance of planned foreign policy. Based on the arduous facts listed above, I think it is not difficult to understand the importance of Britain's planning of foreign economic policy in recent years, and at the same time, most of Britain's foreign trade will soon be controlled by the government. I don't mean that we are going to copy the Soviet Union's monopoly of foreign trade, adopt state-owned forms to organize all foreign trade, and trade directly with foreign countries as a representative of the country. At the same time, on the other hand, we also do not have the power to engage in luxurious and unregulated free international trade. In the mid-nineteenth century, our country was rich enough to do so, and it did very well, but today's situation no longer allows it.

Implementing Planned Economy Domestically

Another reason for planning foreign trade is that we are trying to implement a planned economy at home, in other words, we are committed to plans for full employment and maintaining a minimum standard of living. Under unregulated international trade, money becomes the regulating and determining factor, and whatever makes the most money is the most popular. According to this concept, to give the simplest example, a ship of jackfruit or caviar may take precedence over a ship of wheat or sugar. The time, location, and method of national investment are completely determined by short-term financial profits, and the impact on employment can no longer be taken into account. Full employment plans and the maintenance of a minimum domestic standard of living are fundamentally incompatible with free international trade.

Therefore, the importance of planning foreign economic policy is now beyond dispute. Since the conclusion of foreign economic policy lies in imports, first, we should plan imports so that no individual or company can occupy the position of accounting for the import volume of wheat, sugar, butter, or meat. These things and other equally needed things such as important industrial raw materials must be balanced in distribution. Only state organs have the right to comprehensively determine the importance of a certain item from the total import surplus that the entire country can afford, and then decide how to allocate the import quota of various goods according to the total import volume.

State-owned Trade is Conducive to Peace

Another argument for the national overall planning control of imports is that standard goods must be purchased in bulk, and most of the British imports today are done in this way. State-owned agencies are often better than private enterprises in undertaking this business. State-owned agencies can have the power to place large orders, sign contracts several years in advance, and guarantee that prices will not fluctuate. This is attractive to both buyers and sellers. In this way, buyers don't have to worry about obtaining necessities in the years to come, and sellers can also get a reasonable and stable market. This seems to be the contribution of planned trade between countries to world peace and happiness.

At the same time, in today's world where various countries control foreign exchange, sellers value the types of currency received more than the price of goods. For example, if you are able to choose between American cotton whose price must be paid in US dollars and Egyptian cotton whose price can be paid in pounds sterling, and you do not have enough US dollars, but only a large number of pounds sterling, then you will certainly no longer pay much attention to whether American cotton is theoretically cheaper than Egyptian cotton. Decide to retain a small amount of US dollars for the purchase of important items whose price must be paid in US dollars, and exchange pounds sterling for Egyptian cotton.

In addition, the nature and object of our exports will also be partially determined based on the need for the types of currency received. We must export to countries that can pay in the currencies we need.

### Maintaining Order, Ensuring Public Security, and Conducting a City-Wide Household Re-registration; Holding Training Sessions for Re-registration Personnel in Each District Before the Start

The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, in view of the large population of this city and the rapid movement of people, in order to ensure local public security and maintain social order, must strive for accuracy in household registration. Therefore, it has decided to conduct a city-wide household re-registration. Before the re-registration, various publicity efforts will be made to make citizens aware of the importance of household registration. At that time, it is planned to mobilize a large number of autonomous personnel, such as all the ward chiefs and ward household registration clerks in the city, all the village chiefs in the city, and one supervisor will be sent by the Civil Affairs Bureau to each district. The heads and assistant staff of the household administration sections of each district will also be dispatched, stipulating that each person will supervise ten wards, and two police officers will be assigned to each ward to assist. Before the re-registration begins, training sessions for re-registration personnel will be held in each district. The duration of the sessions is tentatively set for two days. It is reported that during the household re-registration, the ward will be the unit, and the ward chief and ward household registration clerk will be responsible separately, each cooperating with a police officer, to supervise and re-register household by household. The re-registration period for each ward shall not exceed ten days at most.

### The Bodies of the Deceased from the Central Corporation Accident Transported to Shanghai by Special Plane; Lost Banknotes Will Be Claimed from the Insurance Company

The Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) specially dispatched a CA-50 aircraft yesterday morning to Changxing to transport six bodies to Shanghai by air. The bodies had been placed in coffins by the Changxing County Government. According to the person in charge of the company, Flight 50 arrived at Longhua Airport at 5:30 p.m. yesterday, and the bodies were sent by car to the International Funeral Parlor to await the families of the deceased to claim and bury them, and in accordance with regulations, a consolation payment of one million yuan per person was issued to the deceased passengers. Regarding the drivers who died on duty, it was rumored that the company issued a consolation payment of US$10,000 per person, which was not true. However, it is known that all drivers usually have life insurance, and this driver will certainly not be an exception.

Regarding the 1.2 billion yuan of banknotes from the Bank of China, the bank had fully insured all of them with the China Insurance Company and the China Property Insurance Company before shipment. Due to the heavy responsibility, the above two insurance companies had also reinsured with a foreign insurance company in this city. Since the accident on flight 31, personnel from the Bank of China and the insurance company have rushed to Changxing one after another to negotiate with the county government and recover the banknotes and other matters related to the aftermath. According to a person in charge of CATC, after receiving a telegram from Assistant Manager Zhou Kechang the night before, the Bank of China authorities instructed to ask the Changxing County Government to cooperate with the local township ward chiefs to recover the banknotes from the villagers as much as possible. If this was not possible, the remaining 20 sacks of banknotes would be transported to Shanghai, and the rest would be compensated by the insurance company.

[Another News] According to the person in charge of the flight operations group of the Central Air Transport Corporation, there were six fatalities in this accident, and another one was an employee of the Central Corporation, named Hou Ande.

According to Assistant Manager Zhou Kechang, who returned to Shanghai from Changxing at 5:30 p.m. yesterday, of the 20 sacks of banknotes retained by the Changxing County Government, two sacks were found to be the driver's belongings, and one sack of banknotes was completely damaged and unusable. Therefore, only 17 sacks were actually complete and usable. These banknotes have been transported from Changxing to Huzhou, and the Huzhou branch of the Bank of China, together with the Commissioner's Office, the Changxing County Government, the court, and representatives of the Citizens Bank, are counting them. Two sacks have been counted yesterday, and the rest are still being counted. It is expected that it will be completed today, and the amount will be known tonight. It has not yet been decided whether to transport these banknotes to Shanghai again, and the decision will be made at the meeting convened by the bank today. As for the banknotes that were snatched by the mountain villagers, the personnel of the Changxing County Government and the township ward chiefs have been separately advising the villagers to return them.

### Director of the Territorial Affairs Department Comes to Shanghai to Investigate the Provincial and Municipal Boundary Issues

The issue of provincial and municipal boundary demarcation has not yet been resolved. It is reported that Fu Jiaojin, Director of the Territorial Affairs Department of the Ministry of the Interior, arrived in Shanghai the night before last, and visited Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau yesterday to discuss the boundary demarcation issue. When the reporter visited Director Zhu to inquire about the boundary demarcation issue, he said that since the establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipality in 1927, the scope of the Songhu District has not been clearly defined. At that time, it was delineated by the Executive Yuan. After the victory, according to the original plan approved by the Executive Yuan, the Municipal Government should take over 13 rural districts, including Dachang and Yanghang. However, in reality, only a part of the administration of the two rural districts of Dachang and Yanghang has been taken over. In February of this year, the Municipal Government held a symposium, and the issue of provincial and municipal boundary demarcation was planned to be handled in accordance with the 1927 decision, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Executive Yuan previously ordered that the two rural districts of Dachang and Yanghang should still be划归宝山县. However, the residents of the two districts have expressed their disapproval and have requested the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Municipal Government to request that they still be划归上海市. When the reporter asked whether the boundary demarcation issue could be resolved by Director Fu's trip, Zhu said that Fu's trip was to investigate the actual situation on the ground, and then report back to the capital for instructions before making a decision.

### The Paper Mill Affiliated to the Resources Committee Sends a Letter to the Social Affairs Bureau to Prevent Labor Unrest; The Dispute at the Shenzhou Paper Mill is Resolved

[Reported by this newspaper] After the victory, the Resources Committee took over the East and West factories of the Tianzhang Paper Mill, the Jinxing Paper Mill, and the Yingjing Paper Mill. After reorganization, they resumed work in October last year. Since the start of work, the factory's expenses have been huge, with monthly expenses for wages, electricity, etc. totaling 700 million yuan, and an additional 200 million yuan spent on equipment such as blankets and copper wire. In addition to all miscellaneous expenses, monthly expenses are no less than 1 billion yuan. Maintenance relies on self-borrowing and advance deposits. Regular income is often in the form of promissory notes with a payment period of half a month to a month, rather than cash. Recently, due to the union's request for year-end bonuses, which it was unable to bear, it feared that it would cause labor unrest and sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday yesterday to prevent it in advance.

The labor dispute at the Shenzhou Paper Mill in this city, which was caused by the dismissal of 13 workers, was resolved yesterday after mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. The content of the settlement record is as follows: (1) The dismissal of 13 workers, including Wang Deqing, is approved; (2) The dismissed workers will be handled in accordance with the dismissal worker measures of the Wage Assessment Committee; (3) After receiving the above dismissal money, the workers will terminate their employment relationship with the employer and shall not make any further demands.

### The Huacheng Tobacco Factory is on Strike; Yuanhua Workers are Arrested; The Social Affairs Bureau Conducts Mediation Separately

[Reported by this newspaper] Some workers at the Huacheng Tobacco Company have a dispute with the employer over the issue of year-end bonuses. These workers started working in the factory in August this year and are now demanding equal treatment in year-end bonuses, which was rejected by the factory. Therefore, they went on strike yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau is currently sending personnel to persuade them.

[Another News] The employees of the Yuanhua Tobacco Factory requested the issuance of a one-month year-end bonus, which was rejected by the factory. The workers believed that the factory's business was still good and that they had to work overtime every night. In order to protest against the factory, they unanimously refused to work overtime at night. The factory believed that the workers had committed illegal acts and reported it to the police station, which arrested six workers who took the initiative. The rest of the workers petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning. The Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau is investigating the details and has telegraphed the Xincheng Branch Bureau to release them first and then mediate according to law.

### The Materials Bureau Sets Up Suggestion Boxes to Prevent Special Stores from Cheating

The Materials Supply Bureau recently received a batch of American goods for daily use from the remaining materials transferred by the US military. They have been transported to the bureau. In order to facilitate direct procurement, it has formulated measures and publicly solicited applications from stores to be special sales agents. Eleven stores have now been decided. It is reported that the bureau has set up suggestion boxes in each store for these special stores because they are in a trial period. If any store sells at prices that do not comply with the bureau's regulations or is found to have changed the quality or concealed the quantity, any customer can send a letter to the suggestion box at any time to criticize and report it, but they must indicate their real name and address so that the bureau can investigate and correct it in time, so as to use the power of customers to prevent cheating by the stores.

### The Executive Headquarters Uses Work-for-Relief to Repair the Cement Factory Road

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Cement Factory near Longhua Airport in this city is now rented by the Executive Headquarters as a warehouse for its stored materials. However, the road and bridge at the entrance and exit of the factory have been in disrepair for many years, causing damage to vehicles and materials during transportation. Therefore, Ernest, Deputy Executive Director of the Executive Headquarters, suggested that the authorities repair it to avoid accidental losses. After the headquarters contacted the Municipal Public Works Bureau, the Public Works Bureau agreed to cooperate with the Executive Headquarters on a work-for-relief basis. The Executive Headquarters will be responsible for the flour and road construction materials needed by the workers. The Shanghai Branch of the Executive Headquarters has submitted the list of required materials to the headquarters for review and approval, and construction can begin once it is approved. As for the rumor that the Executive Headquarters is supplying machinery and materials to the airline to repair Longhua Airport, it is said to be inaccurate, and it is feared that it is a misunderstanding of the above-mentioned road construction.

### The Issue of the Venue for the Second General Assembly of the Municipal Council; Chairman Pan Telegraphed Secretary Xiang That Zhenshi Middle School is Still Appropriate

[Reported by this newspaper] The second general assembly of the Municipal Council has been decided to be held at Zhenshi Middle School on Anhe Temple Road on January 6th of next year. The Health Committee of the council believes that the location of Zhenshi Middle School is too remote and far from the city center, making it extremely inconvenient to travel back and forth. After discussion, it was decided to suggest that Chairman Pan change the venue and borrow the auditorium of Aurora University. The secretariat of the council believes that the borrowing of the Zhenshi Middle School venue has been agreed upon by both parties, and the road to the school will soon be repaired. If the venue needs to be changed, contact should be made urgently to avoid insufficient preparation as the assembly date approaches. Therefore, a telegram was sent to Nanjing to ask Chairman Pan for instructions. Chairman Pan has replied to Xiang Changquan, Secretary-General of the Council, stating that "Zhenshi Middle School is still appropriate for the second general assembly."

### The Tricycle Rental Industry Association Submits a Request to the Municipal Government to Issue Licenses for 2,000 Tricycles

The Tricycle Rental Industry Association of this city states that more than 2,000 business tricycles that have been manufactured in the first half of the year have been stopped from being licensed by the Public Utilities Bureau. If this is the case, nearly 10,000 rickshaw pullers will face unemployment. If they operate without a license, it will violate the regulations, which is a dilemma. Now, the industry association has voluntarily set five points in order to not impede traffic, maintain business, and save the lives of rickshaw pullers. It is specifically recommended to the Municipal Government and requested that the Municipal Government leniently order the Public Utilities Bureau to issue licenses quickly.

### Late Night Gunfire on Nanjing Road: Air Force Police and Soldiers Clash, Four Injured. Minor Incident Causes Trouble

[Our Newspaper's Report] At approximately 10 PM last night, Wang Dezhu, the Second Section Chief of the Changning Road Police Precinct, was passing the intersection of Nanjing Road and Guangxi Road when he saw two men in plainclothes arguing at the telegraph station. He stepped forward to mediate, but one of them grabbed him, accusing him of interfering. He then called over eighty soldiers from the First Battalion, 101st Squadron, and 103rd Squadron of the Air Transport General Team stationed on military trucks on Lloyd Road, intending to drag Wang onto a truck. Wang, sensing danger, shouted for help. When Police Officer No. 2555 arrived, Wang seized the opportunity to escape and telegraphed the Old Zha District Precinct. Chief Shi, after receiving the report, dispatched over ten officers. However, the Air Transport General Team soldiers believed the police were deliberately making things difficult for them. They dragged Police Officer No. 2555 onto a truck and drove away, while another group of soldiers stood ready for battle. Both sides clashed. In self-defense, the police officers fired several shots, injuring Liu Mingzhao (20 years old, from Hunan), a soldier from the 103rd Squadron of the Air Force, in the left foot. Mechanics Yu Alin and Guan Tianxi were also injured. Police Officer No. 3314 from the Old Zha District Precinct was also beaten during the chaos. The situation was serious at the time, but fortunately, military police arrived after receiving the news and suppressed the situation. Thirty-five soldiers were then taken to the Old Zha District Precinct. Afterward, Qi Zaiwang, the Director of the Shanghai North District Inspection Office of the Garrison Command, and Yang Daogu, the Squadron Leader of the Air Force 101st Squadron, sent secretaries, adjutants, and others to the precinct to discuss solutions with Chief Shi. In the end, Police Officer No. 2555 was escorted back to the precinct by the Air Force, and the thirty-five Air Force soldiers detained at the precinct were taken back by their own officers in cars.

### Waning Year: Under the Eaves of Shanghai

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] As the year wanes and industries decline, the increase in unemployment due to the poor economy has also led to a rise in cases of theft and suicide. With the Lunar New Year approaching, the military and police have been implementing winter security measures since last month to strengthen public order. There were 192 labor disputes in November, and in recent days, disputes over year-end bonuses have become even more frequent. This annual accounting period is a real challenge for China's precarious industrial and commercial sectors today. Cold waves have repeatedly hit Shanghai. Hopefully, they won't bring "bankruptcy winds" with them!

One-Third of Shanghai's Four Million People Unemployed

Despite Shanghai having many high-rise buildings, dignitaries, lavishly decorated company windows, and new cars shuttling through the streets like shuttles, this beautiful outer appearance cannot hide its internal crisis. Today, with a population of 3.96 million, Shanghai is estimated to have 1.353 million unemployed people, accounting for one-third of the total. This alarming figure is the result of today's poor economic situation.

Where can these unemployed people go? A serious problem that threatens social stability is before us. We talk about relief and placement, but in today's state, where can so many be accommodated?

Alarming Figures for Theft and Suicide

Let us also look at the figures for theft and suicide cases in the city: According to statistics, a total of 924 suicide cases occurred from January to November this year. The most common causes of suicide are financial difficulties and family disputes. November, with 85 cases, exceeded the average for each month. As for theft cases in October, 854 were reported, and 63 robberies occurred. The statistics for November have not yet been released by the police, so we don't know. But presumably, it won't be much different from October.

The Other Side of Society: Brothels and Dance Halls

Let's look at another statistic: As of the end of November, there were 853 registered brothels in the city, with a total of 2,337 prostitutes. There were 27 registered dance halls, with a total of 1,835 dancers. Most of them are between the ages of sixteen and twenty-five (this is the registered number; how many are unregistered?). People, who wouldn't want to live happily in the world? This group of people who engage in theft, sell their bodies and smiles, and even destroy their own lives, cannot be said to be 100% forced by life to do so, but the fact remains that they do it in order to not "starve." Doesn't the "street vendor case" also contain serious economic problems?

The Pros and Cons of Sleeping Pills

Many people commit suicide by using sleeping pills. The police department has specifically sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau, ordering the Shanghai New Medicine Merchants Association to inform all pharmacies that people who come to purchase sleeping pills must have a formal prescription from a doctor, and pharmacies can only fill the prescription once, stamp it, and not refill it. This measure is intended to prevent problems in advance, but it is only a passive deterrent. The way to fundamentally cure the problem is to make society stable and enable people to live happily.

Surviving the End of the Year?

Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors after the victory have been struggling to survive due to shortages of raw materials, high costs, difficulties in exporting, imports of foreign goods, and high-interest loans. Although the government once relaxed the foreign exchange rate, it still cannot cure this serious illness. The rising prices since the victory have made it impossible for ordinary salaried people to make ends meet. The recent fluctuations in gold prices and US dollars will undoubtedly stimulate prices again. It's the end of the year, is there going to be a finale?

Today, how many people are worried about Shanghai's "collapse" and the collapse of China's entire economy? In the long winter nights, it seems optimistic and confident to those who think "winter is here, can spring be far behind?" But reality is reality, the end of the year is just around the corner, and we only hope that Shanghai will not have more trouble!

### How Were the Top Ten News Stories Selected? A Preliminary Decision Was Made, Then the Order Was Evaluated by Each Newspaper. Only 30 Hours from Initiation to Completion

[Special Report from This Newspaper] This newspaper's selection of the top ten domestic and local news stories of 1946, organized by this newspaper, was published in this newspaper yesterday. How were these top ten news stories selected? Perhaps we should give a report.

In advance, we carefully considered and "preliminarily selected" a dozen or so "major news stories." The criteria for selection were roughly based on these standards: (1) Was it sensational when it happened? (2) The importance of the event itself. (3) Whether the involvement and impact are widespread. After the "preliminary selection" was decided, we asked the chief editors, domestic news editors, local news editors, and interviewing directors of major newspapers in the city to evaluate the order. They ranked the "preliminarily selected" news items on the printed list according to their importance, from one to ten. We then calculated the scores according to this order: the first major news story received ten points, the second received nine points, and so on. Then we "counted the votes," and the one with the most points was the first major news story.

Among the thirty-three votes participating in the selection of domestic news, nineteen votes recognized that "The Political Consultative Conference Signing" was the biggest event of the year, resulting in 257 points, accounting for the absolute majority in first place. The second, "The National Government Returns to the Capital," had six votes recognizing it as the first major event, and the score difference was quite large. The third major event, "Peace Talks," had a score very close to the second place. Two votes recognized it as the first major event, but eleven votes recognized it as the second major event of the year. The scores for the fourth "Opening of Foreign Exchange," the fifth "Recapture of Zhangjiakou," and the sixth "The National Assembly was suddenly postponed for three days when it was about to open" were very close, with only about ten points difference. The seventh was "Chairman Chiang's Sixtieth Birthday," the eighth was "Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo Were Assassinated," and the ninth was "Import and Export Permit System." It is truly a matter of opinion; some people thought it was the first major event, while others did not consider it among the top ten news stories at all. The Chen Gongbo case was tenth - perhaps some people want to ask if there is a "candidate"? Then the first candidate was "Changchun Besieged for Thirty-Nine Days," and the second was "General Dai Li's Plane Crashes."

Among the thirty-two votes for the selection of local news stories, twenty votes recognized that the street vendor dispute was the biggest event of the year, which can be said to be unanimously recognized. The second event, the arsenal explosion, was also very interesting, with eleven votes recognizing it as the second major event of the year. The third event, Rong Desheng's kidnapping, had only a few points difference from the second place, with four gentlemen nominating it as the first major event of the year. The fourth was the grain loan case, the fifth was the Jiang Gongmei case, the sixth was the Yu Xiangyan case, and the seventh was the Zang Daerzi case. All four were "cases," and three of them have not yet been concluded. The eighth was the City Council election, and the ninth was the gold brick case, with close votes. The tenth place, "Miss Shanghai Election," was also very interesting, with four votes recognizing it as the tenth major news story, while one humorous gentleman said that it was the first major event in Shanghai this year!

This time, the top ten news story competition, from launching the plan, soliciting evaluations, organizing, to publishing in the morning newspaper, took only thirty hours in total. Because the time was relatively tight, omissions were inevitable. Thank you to all the gentlemen from various newspapers for their enthusiastic participation. We would like to express our utmost gratitude here!

### Bank Manager's Car Used for Drug Trafficking: Police Officers Go Undercover to Crack the Case. The Portuguese Mastermind Is on the Run

[Our Newspaper's Report] On the afternoon of the 14th of this month, the Detective Section of the Police Department cracked a case of opium trafficking at the intersection of Xizang Road and Shantou Road. Two suspects were arrested on the spot, and four pieces of opium, weighing fifty taels, were seized. He Zhisheng, the manager of the Yadong Commercial Bank at 250 Nanjing Road, also provided his own car, license plate number 16756, to transport the drugs. After being taken to the police station for questioning, the suspects confessed that the mastermind was a Portuguese man named Zhamu. However, when the police went to arrest him, he had already fled upon hearing the news. It turned out that Cai Ruisheng, a 30-year-old man from Pudong, residing at No. 5 Ruitai Lane, North Suzhou Road, met Zhamu, a friend, at the Mals Cafe on Nanjing Road a month ago. Zhamu told him that he had a lot of opium and asked him to find a way to sell it, promising a generous reward. Later, Cai met Zhang Shude (29 years old, residing at No. 160 Taixing Lane, Xinkai River), a fellow townsman, on the road, and told him about Zhamu's intentions, asking him to pay attention. Zhang, tempted by the high profits, opened room 206 of the Longgong Hotel in the Eight Immortals Bridge area as a liaison office. Eventually, the matter was discovered by the police due to insufficient secrecy. On the afternoon of the 13th, the police department sent Section Chief Zhang Jinsheng and employee Chen Xianrong undercover, pretending to buy fifty taels of opium and showing gold bars as proof of their credit. Zhang, seeing that a large buyer had arrived, immediately telegraphed Cai Ruisheng. Cai arranged to meet the next afternoon at the intersection of Xizang Road and Shantou Road to exchange the goods for payment. When the time came, Cai went to the Mals Cafe to get fifty taels of opium from Zhamu, and then went to his relative, He Zhisheng, the manager of the Yadong Bank, to borrow a car, driven by the chauffeur Zhou Fengsheng, and drove straight to Shantou Road. The police officers had already been waiting at Zhang Shude's place, and when they saw Cai get out of the car, they arrested him and Zhang together while they were exchanging the goods. The car was also impounded. After being taken to the police station for questioning, Cai and Zhang confessed to drug trafficking. However, when He Zhisheng was summoned to the police station, he claimed that although Cai was his close relative, he was not aware of the drug trafficking and that he had not been asked for permission to borrow the car that day. After investigation by the police department, it was confirmed that this was the case, and the car and the chauffeur were released. The mastermind, Zhamu, had already fled upon hearing the news and is still being actively pursued. The case was completed yesterday and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### Small Office Workers Donate 630,000 Yuan to Sympathize with Fellow Citizens in Distress

The city's Winter Relief Committee, in order to provide relief to refugees, has organized a fundraising committee to actively encourage the wealthy to donate, so as to save those in distress from starvation. They have successively held broadcast fundraising and district resident donation activities. Although the results are still satisfactory, there are still few wealthy merchants who are willing to donate automatically. Therefore, they plan to hold a dance party next spring. It is learned that the other day, a small office worker, sympathizing with fellow citizens in distress, donated all of his savings of 115,000 yuan from several months' salary. At the same time, he persuaded his friend to save the 515,000 yuan originally intended for his deceased father's birthday celebration and sent it to the committee along with a letter.

He sold the other one to the Dakang Hardware Store at 394 Beijing East Road, who bought it for 400,000 yuan. After summoning the receivers of stolen goods to the police station for questioning, considering that they were all legitimate businessmen, they were released on bail.

### Accident Involving Health Bureau Car: Cart Driver Run Over and Killed on Carter Road. Police Officer Injured Jumping off Car in Pursuit

[Our Newspaper's Report] At around 9 PM the other night, a rickshaw puller was passing the entrance of Sanwei Yi Village on Carter Road near Avenue Road when a black truck with license plate number 31788 sped past and ran over the rickshaw puller's head, causing brain matter to splatter and instant death. The truck driver, seeing the serious accident he had caused, stepped on the accelerator and tried to escape. At that time, traffic police officer Xing Weiguang was stationed in the police booth of the newly established precinct. Witnessing the scene, he rushed out of the police booth. Unable to catch up, he took another truck and chased after the hit and run truck to Gordon Road. The two trucks were only a few steps away, and the police officer shouted for the driver of the hit and run truck to stop. But before the vehicle had come to a complete stop, the police officer jumped out of the vehicle, causing him to fall and injure his head. The driver of the hit and run truck took the opportunity to abandon the truck and flee. Other police officers then drove the truck back to the new precinct. By the next morning, it was found that the truck belonged to the city's Health Bureau and was used to transport bureau members. It was temporarily borrowed from the Aftermath Relief Administration. As for the hit and run truck driver, it was learned that his name was Zhang Yulin, and he lived at 3367 Nanyinghua Lane, Changshou Road. He was eventually arrested by Police Officer Wei Qihu No. 1484 and brought to the police station for investigation.

### The First Public Trial of the Grain Loan Embezzlement Case: One of the Eight Defendants is Absent. Wang Daren and Others Request Bail, Rejected in Court. Ren Xingya Pays Additional 5 Million Yuan in Cash Bail

[Our Newspaper's Report] The sensational nationwide grain loan embezzlement case, since the District Court Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution on the 23rd of last month, was first publicly tried in the Criminal Division II Court of the District Court at 9 AM yesterday, with Court President Wu Xiangzu serving as the presiding judge, and Wu Rongcai and Huang Guang serving as associate judges. At the time, the defendants in custody in the case, Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, and Wang Daren, had already been brought from the detention center. At the same time, the defendants who were out on bail, Xing Zhigang, Yang Runshe, and Ren Xingya, also arrived in court on time. Only Wan Molin was absent. The audience was full before 9 AM, but the order was well maintained. There were twelve lawyers, including Yu Zhongluo (selected by Wang Xunzhi and Zhuang Manzhang), Wu Zhengzhu (selected by Wu Rongsheng), Yu Zhongluo (selected by Wan Molin), Gu Weixiong and Wei Xuezhang (selected by Xing Zhigang), Zhong Juexian and Zhang Guangzong (selected by Yang Runshe), Wang Shanxiang and Miao Qingbang (selected by Wang Daren), and Lu Shaozong (selected by Ren Xingya). Lawyer Duanmu Kai was absent because he was attending the National Assembly in Beijing. The trial began at 9 AM and ended at 12:30 PM, lasting three and a half hours. The eighth defendant, Ren Xingya, paid an additional 5 million yuan in cash bail. The sixth defendant, Yang Runshe, was also allowed to pay 5 million yuan in cash bail. The fifth defendant, Xing Zhigang, was allowed to maintain the original bail. The remaining defendants were returned to custody for another hearing. The presiding judge first summoned seven defendants and asked the lawyers seated and questioned them one by one on their names, ages, and birthplaces. The lawyer of Wan Molin stood up and presented a letter from the defendant in Nanjing, and answered the court, saying that the defendant originally intended to appear in court, but now that the National Assembly was convened, he could not come to Shanghai. The court ruled that he must be present at the next hearing, otherwise a warrant would be issued.

### Prosecutor's Statement of Charges Against Eight Defendants

Before the trial, Prosecutor Wu stood and stated the charges against each defendant, roughly as follows: Defendant 1, Wang Xunzhi, used the name of Housheng Company to borrow 150 million yuan of grain loans from Zhejiang Province. He then borrowed 60 million yuan in this city under the name of Changjiang Company, violating grain loan regulations and engaging in speculative manipulation. Defendant 2, Zhuang Hanzhang, as the business director of Changjiang Company, was responsible for purchasing and selling grain. He hoarded the rice purchased with the grain loan together with Wang Xunzhi and did not sell it immediately. Defendant 3, Wu Rongsheng, sold 1,193 bags out of the 11,000 bags of public rice entrusted to him by the government to stabilize grain prices to fellow traders, preventing it from stabilizing grain prices and creating suspicion of manipulation and monopoly. Defendant 4, Wan Molin, failed to declare 630 shi of grain and rice obtained through grain loans, creating suspicion of hoarding. Defendant 5, Xing Zhigang, used the name of Wan Changxin to obtain loans fraudulently. Defendant 6, Yang Runyu, transferred the loan of Wan Changxin to Xing Zhigang without approval from the relevant authorities. Defendants 7 and 8, Wang Daren and Ren Xingyai, as grain administration officials, allowed grain merchants to hoard and manipulate grain without intervention, disregarding the people's livelihood. This violated the original intention of the government's grain loan program. Although there is no evidence of a conspiracy to profit, there is suspicion of condoning the manipulation and hoarding of grain by grain merchants. Therefore, all are being prosecuted under Article 31 of the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce. The court is requested to impose strict penalties according to the law. After Prosecutor Wu finished his statement, he began individual questioning in order.

Wang Xunzhi

First, defendant Wang Xunzhi, deputy general manager of Changjiang Company, was questioned. Wang was wearing a blue coarse cloth robe, cloth shoes, and glasses. Wang stated that he had handled a total of 151 bags of grain and rice, which arrived in Shanghai around April 26th or 27th. At that time, the market was in turmoil, and he was ordered to delay sales. There was no intention to hoard. The second batch of 1,150 shi was brown rice and needed to be processed, so it could not be sold immediately. He also stated that Changjiang Company only borrowed 60 million yuan but handled 100 million yuan worth of rice. All the rice was sold immediately and not hoarded for profit. The Grain Loan Review Committee stipulated that grain merchants must return any special profits to the national treasury. He personally had no profit, so the accusation of manipulation and hoarding was based on a misunderstanding of the truth.

Zhuang Hanzhang

Defendant 2, Zhuang Hanzhang, business director of Changjiang Company, claimed to be just a minor employee. He knew very little about the points inquired by the court. He said that everything had to be done on the manager's order and that he had no right to advise on whether to sell the purchased grain.

Wu Rongsheng

Defendant 3, Wu Rongsheng, manager of Santai Grain and Miscellaneous Goods Store, stated that Santai was established seven or eight years before the war and reopened this year. He was responsible for the affairs of the guild and sometimes his employee Gao Qingkui handled some too. After obtaining the loan on April 21st, he purchased more than 3,500 shi of grain and rice and sold them continuously. On April 27th, he was entrusted by the Grain Administration to sell 30,000 dan of public rice. He was ordered to sell 5,000 bags within ten days, but he only sold 4,530 bags and then stopped. Everything was done on orders.

Defendant 4, Xing Zhigang, manager of Chengfeng Rice Store, claimed to have handled 100,000 large bags of military grain on consignment, but only 3,000 bags were completed. He served as a standing director of the Soybean and Rice Industry Association. When applying for a loan, because the quota was full, Wan Molin agreed to let him handle the loan under the name of Wan Changxin. He handled a total of 40 million yuan, 20 million yuan of which Wan Changxin used himself. He knew nothing else. He also did not report the matter to the Grain Administration.

Yang Runyu

Defendant 5, Yang Runyu, manager of Wan Changxin, was responsible for store affairs. Wan Molin notified him that the grain loan was received, so Xing Zhigang took all of it. He did not know how the profits were distributed.

Wang Daren Describes Grain Loan Process

At 11:01 AM, Wang Daren was questioned. He was the specialist commissioner of the Ministry of Food and acting director of the Shanghai Grain Administration. The court first ordered him to talk about the grain loan process. Wang stated that the proposal was made in October last year during Mayor Qian's tenure. Because the grain industry in Shanghai had been almost completely destroyed during the war, the purpose of the grain loan was to help restore the grain industry to protect the people's food supply. On April 1st, Premier Song came to Shanghai and convened a food conference. Xu Jiying, president of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and others proposed grain loans. Eight grain stores were proposed and selected for a conversation the next day about their capital and grain management experience. Chengfeng was proposed by the Chamber of Commerce, but it failed the review. Later, Wan Molin suggested that eight stores were too few, and it was decided that he would recommend nine more. These nine stores were later discussed under the chairmanship of Minister Xu. Although Chengfeng was included again, it was still eliminated. A total of sixteen stores were approved. On April 4th, the first review panel was convened, deciding that the total amount of loans would be 1 billion yuan. They drafted the loan regulations. At the time, to encourage competition, the loans were not limited to rice merchants and depended on their ability to purchase grain. Tongyi and Jiangbei companies were introduced by Li Chongnian. Although they were not rice merchants, they had the ability to purchase grain, so the trial was approved. The court inquired about the market dispute on April 27th. Wang replied that on that day, Tongyi sold 50 shi of rice at a price of 31,000 yuan per shi. The market price was more than 40,000 yuan, so rice stores scrambled to buy it, causing a dispute. After the dispute, the market was in chaos, so he reported to Minister Xu and requested Premier Song to decide to suspend the sale of grain loan rice in order to restore the normal transaction of the market. The court further inquired that the Soybean and Rice Industry Association submitted an application for loans from 52 rice stores on April 17th. Wang replied that it was true, but he received the application late, after May 20th, at which time the government no longer intended to provide grain loans. The court further inquired whether there was documentary evidence, such as a signed report, showing that the suspension of the sale of grain loan rice was ordered. Wang replied that the draft of the announcement was in Minister Xu's handwriting. He also said that the grain loan did not charge any fees other than the official interest of 3%. If any are discovered, they can be strictly prosecuted.

Ren Xingyai

Finally, Ren Xingyai was questioned. He stated that he was the chief of the Regulation Section, responsible for investigating grain prices and registering grain merchants. After the grain loan was issued, he was also responsible for verifying sales. He stated that the market dispute on April 27th was as Wang Daren described. He also stated that he resigned due to illness after May 8th. On May 25th, he was summoned to Nanjing to report the grain loan situation to Minister Xu. He knew nothing else. After all the defendants were questioned, lawyer Yu Ting stood up and requested that defendant Wang Xunzhi be granted bail, stating that Wang had a severe lung disease. He then stated that Zhuang Hanzhang had sores and also requested bail. Lawyer Wu Zheng also requested bail for defendant Wu Rongsheng, stating that since Wu was arrested, his family had been scattered, which was very tragic. Lawyer Yu Qingbang also requested bail for defendant Wang Daren, because the defendant who was prosecuted under the same clause had been granted bail and should enjoy the same treatment. After listening, the judge stood and declared that the requests for bail for Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, and Wang Daren should be rejected. Ren Xingyai was granted bail of 5 million yuan in cash. Yang Runyu was granted bail of 5 million yuan in cash. The case was adjourned for further hearing.

### Kerosene Sales Have Not Stopped, Prices Have Not Changed

Interview with the Person in Charge of Mobil Oil

[Reported by this newspaper] Amidst the rumors of rising kerosene prices, a reporter visited Mobil Oil, one of the three major kerosene importers in Shanghai, yesterday to inquire about the company's recent kerosene sales. According to the person in charge, there are 25 retail dealers in the city that distribute kerosene from Mobil Oil. The company distributes five large barrels of kerosene, each containing 53 gallons, to each retailer every day. The price per gallon is still 1,500 yuan. This sales situation has not changed or been interrupted. Therefore, the recent rise in kerosene prices is likely due to a sudden increase in demand from users.

### Reader Consultation Legal Questions

(1) Malicious Abandonment

Question from Tai Rong in Nantong: A friend, Mr. A, married Miss B, and their relationship was poor and they often quarreled. At the beginning of this year, Mr. A secretly left while Miss B was returning to her parents' home, and there has been no news of him since. Since then, B's in-laws have treated her coldly, seeing her as a thorn in their side. Later, through mediation by relatives, A's parents acted as agents and signed an agreement with B to terminate the marital relationship, allowing her to remarry as she pleased, with a lawyer's certification. Now there are several legal questions, please answer them. (1) Is the divorce agreement signed by B and A's parents legally valid? (2) B published a notice urging A to return within a time limit, but A ignored it. Is it legal for B to remarry due to livelihood reasons? (3) Do A's parents have the legal right to handle the divorce procedures for their son? (4) How many years after A's disappearance can B remarry?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin Answers] (1) The agreement signed by A's parents and B is not legally valid. (2) A has been gone for more than a year, with no news and disregarding B's livelihood. A has maliciously abandoned his wife, and the situation is ongoing. According to Article 1052, Paragraph 5 of the Civil Code, this constitutes grounds for divorce. After publishing a notice and A failing to return within the time limit, B should request a divorce from the court. She can remarry only after the judgment allows the divorce. (3) Divorce must be done voluntarily by both the man and woman; others cannot act as agents. (4) If someone's life or death is unknown for more than three years, it constitutes grounds for divorce, but this provision does not apply to this case because A's malicious abandonment has specific time requirements.

(2) Fickleness

Question from Yu Lao: There is a woman, Miss A, who married a man surnamed Fang. Later, she became restless and cohabited with Mr. B. B is also married and has an evil nature. After the two cohabited, Miss A was often treated poorly. Now Miss A regrets it and wants to end her cohabitation with Mr. B. Please advise (1) how should she end it? (2) Can Miss A demand alimony from Mr. B? (3) If Miss A leaves B for C, does Mr. B have the right to interfere? (4) If Mr. Fang is dead, can his parents sue Mr. B? (5) Is it illegal for Mr. C and Miss A to cohabit?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin Answers] (1) Because A is not B's wife and has been abused, A is free to end the cohabitation. (2) If A cohabits with C after ending her cohabitation, she cannot demand alimony from B. (3) Because there was no formal marriage, they cannot become husband and wife. B has no legal right to interfere with A leaving B for C. (4) No. (5) If C already has a wife and does not have his wife's consent, his wife can sue A and C for interfering with the family.

Unexpectedly, this led to acute osteomyelitis of the mandible, spreading throughout the entire mandible, causing swelling of both cheeks and inability to eat, making his situation critical. On the 16th, he came to the office to apply for relief funds, tearfully explaining his situation. His entire family depends on him for their livelihood, and now they face starvation.

The opening price was 3.38 million, but it was sold off by those who had made profits, so it declined. Soon after opening, it fell to 3.33 million, then rebounded to 3.365 million. Therefore, the Central Bank doubled its pressure, gradually reducing it to around 3.31 million, and then it hovered. After ten o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 100 bars at a price of 3.335 million. After that, buyers became active again, and the supply became stagnant. The market price rose immediately. Speculative funds from the securities market came to support it, and the rising wind rose again. The high price was back to 3.44 million. After that, the demand and supply turned into a wrestling match, and the Central Bank also controlled it, once back down to 3.35 million. It was stable near noon. In the afternoon, people were slightly hesitant, and some even cut the line. Therefore, next-day delivery did not have much effect, but it saw a small setback. The final price was 3.34 million, and the result fell 35,000 compared with the previous recovery. Gold decorations were listed at 35,200, silver dollars rose slightly, and bank loans were still flat.

Nos. 229, 185, 27, and 145 took advantage of the low to make purchases, and then rose to 685 yuan. No. 198 was for sale, and there was still a setback, but Nos. 212 and 229 still entered. Near noon, it entered the board file. The result was that Ji Yongsha Xinyu rose by half, Meiya rose slightly, Huafeng was flat, Jingfu Qinxing fell slightly, and Xinguang fell by half. The rise and fall of cold stocks were uneven. The glory and disgrace of the delivery of each stock were mutually seen.

However, Nos. 199, 177, 61, etc. all entered, and once rose to 670 yuan.

### Tea Prices in Australia to Skyrocket

[Reuters, Sydney, 16th] According to local importers and wholesalers, unless the Federal Government increases tea subsidies, Australian tea prices will skyrocket by the end of this year. Public tea auctions will begin at the end of the year. Merchants are comparing the reopening of tea auctions to wool auctions, saying that tea will also experience an unprecedented surge, jumping from a high of 30 pence to over 60 pence. To avoid this price leap, the government must increase subsidies to around three to four pence per pound. The manager of a major tea company in Sydney said that due to the continued suspension of tea production in Java, there is a shortage of tea worldwide. The Australian government has previously obtained sufficient tea to maintain the rationing system. During the period of the rationing system, the government must continue to purchase domestic tea and sell it to wholesalers. The manager also said, "After the resumption of auctions, no one knows how high world tea prices will rise." Tea prices will undoubtedly increase significantly. To maintain the current retail price of two shillings and three pence per pound, subsidies must be greatly increased. "The local tea price in Singapore is already higher than in Australia."

### Filament Rayon Prices Increase Consistently

Yesterday, D-grade silk opened at 4.55 million yuan, a significant increase of about 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Although there were few transactions for remaining goods, asking prices were consistently raised. Silk fabrics also saw slight progress due to the high cost of raw materials. Quilt covers rose by 50,000 yuan, while Huajin crepe and feather yarn rose by 100 yuan. Hangzhou goods also increased by 200 yuan per tael.

### 8,500 Tons of US Wheat to Arrive in Shanghai Next Week

Over twenty committee members were present, chaired by Huo Baoshu. The meeting adjourned at around 3:00 PM. During the meeting, there was a detailed discussion on the current financial dynamics and the production capacity of various industries. The committee also studied how to coordinate the various regulations that had already been passed and the technical issues involved in their implementation.

It is understood that the Central Bank has issued a circular for implementation.

### Wool Import Restrictions Cause Severe Crisis in the Wool Textile Industry, Production Work Largely Suspended

Currently, half of the wool textile industry in this city has suspended production, and three factories have already closed down. According to industry sources, the import of wool has been affected by the foreign exchange adjustment because most raw materials come from abroad. Shandong wool, which is domestic, is more expensive than foreign wool due to transportation difficulties. It is predicted that a large number of manufacturers will close down by the end of the year.

### New Measures for Controlling Cotton Yarn to Be Discussed by the Textile Control Commission Today

The new measures for controlling cotton yarn by the Textile Control Commission (Fang Guan Hui) are nearing a final decision. The commission will hold a meeting today at 3:00 PM to discuss them. It is reported that Premier Song, while in Shanghai, drafted a plan with Mayor Wu, Shu Yunzhang, and others. This plan will be discussed together with the plan proposed by the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association today. Therefore, today's meeting is particularly important. The Sixth District Association held a meeting of its standing directors yesterday afternoon to finalize the opinions put forward by private textile mills. After the meeting, Chairman Wang Qiyu submitted the proposed specific measures to Chairman Wu for review. It is understood that today's discussion by the Textile Control Commission will focus on the principles of the government supplying raw materials to private yarn mills and purchasing the cotton yarn they produce. Once the raw materials are confirmed, implementation measures will be drafted.

### Representatives of the Cotton Textile Association Present the Opinions of Various Factories

[Our Correspondent] After drafting eight points for a future cotton yarn handling plan, the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association submitted them to Chairman Wu of the Textile Control Commission (Fang Guan Hui) some days ago. Chairman Wu summoned Chairman Wang Qiyu of the association yesterday morning and gave him six points of a plan decided after Premier Song convened a meeting with relevant parties in Shanghai. Wang convened a meeting of the standing directors of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association yesterday afternoon to discuss the six-point plan, gather opinions, and then appointed Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Xiao Yixin, Guo Dihuo, and Liu Jingji as representatives to visit Chairman Wu at 5:30 PM to exchange views on these six points in a private capacity. It is understood that the three points that factories find most difficult are: (1) Factories that have applied to the government for foreign exchange to purchase cotton should have half of the cotton yarn spun from their current cotton inventory purchased by the government. (2) The purchase price, previously stipulated as production cost plus a legal profit of 15% and a reserve for business development of 10%, for a total profit margin of 25%, seems too high and should be reduced to 10% to 15%. (3) In the future, all yarn spun from cotton purchased with foreign exchange should be purchased by the government. The factories' opinion is that they hope for a slight relaxation of each point. They hope that the original total profit margin can be maintained. They hope that half of the yarn spun from cotton purchased with foreign exchange will be purchased by the government, and the other half can be freely traded by the factories to facilitate increased production efficiency. During yesterday's informal talks, both sides' opinions were very close, and concrete results are expected to be achieved at the Textile Control Commission's regular meeting this afternoon. However, according to Chairman Wu, the Textile Control Commission's resolution still needs to be submitted to Premier Song for approval before it can be implemented.

### Taiwan Sugar Spot Shortage

Yesterday, Taiwan sugar rose again due to a shortage. The association's board quoted the spot price of medium-grade white sugar at 142,000 yuan, which then rose to 144,500 yuan. Warehouse warrants were at 138,000 yuan, up 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Raw brown sugar was at 124,500 yuan, and warehouse warrants were at 118,000 yuan. Guangzhou-produced Runde Qing saw a decrease of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan as a larger quantity arrived and was immediately unloaded. Superior-grade Zhuang was at 94,000 to 95,000 yuan, second-grade was at 89,000 yuan. Xinghua white was at 138,000 yuan, and second-grade was 4,000 yuan less. Xinghua red was at 124,000 yuan. A total of over 700 pieces were traded.

### Tea Merchants Call on the Government to Purchase Tea, Meeting Held Yesterday to Decide on Measures

The China Tea Association, the Export Trade Association, tea shops, tea trading associations, and representatives of tea merchants from various provinces held a meeting yesterday, presided over by Shou Jingwei, at the China Tea Association to appeal to the government to purchase stored tea. Attendees exchanged opinions and decided on the following measures: (1) Request the government to allocate 70 billion yuan for tea purchase funds. (2) Designate appropriate tea purchasing institutions to oversee the purchase matters. (3) Hire tea experts to handle grading and valuation matters. It is also understood that the above groups have scheduled an emergency members' meeting at the New Life Club this Saturday (21st) at 2:00 PM to continue discussing the above cases and hope that the government will implement them as soon as possible to alleviate the difficulties of the tea industry.

### There is Renewed Interest in Pingshui Chen Zhu Tea Among Tea Merchants

Domestic sales of red and green tea in this district's shops and various road merchants remain sluggish. In the foreign tea market, high-grade aged Keemun is still stable. Other varieties, such as Wenzhou New Zhenmei and higher-quality aged smoked Zhenmei, aged Zhenmei, and aged medium Keemun, are selling relatively well. The rest are mediocre. However, according to industry sources, Xiachang Tea Company has renewed interest in No. 1 aged Chen Zhu tea from Pingshui. In addition, Wang Yutai Tea Company is also interested in stir-fried green tea.

### Slight Changes in the Items Subject to Import Restrictions by the Export-Import Control Commission

According to a person in charge of the Export-Import Control Commission (Shu Guan Hui), some of the materials previously designated as restricted imports have presented difficulties. After discussion by the commission, (1) aircraft parts and (2) radio parts in Category IV of restricted import goods have been reclassified into Category III (A) because China does not produce these items and must rely on imports. This will facilitate their import. For goods that do not require foreign exchange and goods that have already been imported, applications can be made directly to the Import Management Office of the Customs within certain regulations. At the same time, the Customs has issued separate regulations regarding the handling of goods on the way and goods that have arrived: (1) Goods that have been loaded onto ships or airplanes and are within 20 hours of arriving at their destination are considered to be "on the way." (2) Goods that have been loaded onto ships or airplanes, imported, and are being unloaded by barges or trucks are considered to have "arrived." It is also heard that the commission will have several important decisions to implement, and is currently studying them in detail, which will be announced soon.

### Import and Export Industry Group Meetings Discuss Import Restrictions, Pigment Merchants Raise Two Requests

[Our Correspondent] The import and export industry is scheduled to hold a hardware group meeting today. After the cotton group meeting concluded, a written opinion has been submitted to the Export-Import Control Commission (Shu Guan Hui), with suggestions on import quotas. The commission has requested the government to allow the import of raw cotton that shipped before August 24th. It is heard that the government has agreed to this in principle. At the same time, the import industry hopes that future foreign cotton orders will not be concentrated solely in the United States, neglecting other sources. Because ordering exclusively from one place can cause merchants there to raise prices speculatively, and this phenomenon has already been observed. Nearly forty group meetings of the import and export industry will be held sequentially according to importance. All meetings are expected to be completed in two weeks. The resulting conclusions and statistics will be provided to the government for reference. As for the quotas for various types of imports, the Export-Import Control Commission has not yet fully decided today. The import and export industry hopes that when making decisions, the commission will pay attention to actual needs, and in addition to the government's statistics, will also refer to the statistics already compiled by the import and export merchants' associations and the quantities needed by private and state-owned factories.

After consultation, pigment importers in this city have resolved to request two points from the Export-Import Control Commission (Shu Guan Hui): (1) Pigments are necessities for China's dyeing and weaving industry. Our country has no production, and foreign sources have also decreased because Germany is no longer a pigment-producing country, and British products are also scarce. Only the United States can still supply a considerable quantity, but the demand is very large. It is proposed that pigments be elevated to a first-class import item, on par with production tools. (2) Pigments ordered after November 17 should all be allowed to be imported. It is also learned that the prices of American pigments are fluctuating due to high demand. According to the speculation of local importers, an export permit system may be implemented in the future.

(3) When the CSC relends the overdraft funds to various manufacturers, payment shall be made upon seeing the silk.

The reeled raw silk will also be the joint collateral for the ABC, managed by the Autumn Cocoon Loan General Management Office, with personnel stationed in various factories for supervision. The ABC will also send personnel to conduct random checks at any time, and the CSC shall provide convenience. (5) The Autumn Cocoon Loan General Management Office will be responsible for supervising the factories to sell the raw silk produced from the overdraft collateral at any time, and the proceeds shall be used to repay in the following order: First, repay the principal of the reeling labor overdraft; second, repay the principal of the ABC's cocoon loan; and third, repay the loan interest in proportion to the loan amount. (6) The term of the contract is from the date of signing to March 31, 1947, when the principal and interest will be fully repaid. (7) The interest rate is 2.5% per month.

### Municipal Bureau of Education Issues Commendations to Schools with Excellent Literacy Classes

Municipal Experimental People's School and Others Are the Most Outstanding

The first phase of public and private primary and secondary schools in this city holding public education classes has ended one after another. The Municipal Bureau of Education has sent staff to observe the teaching situation in each class. The Municipal Experimental People's School and the Central National School in the 15th District are considered to have the most outstanding results. Each school has more than ten classes, and the number of graduates exceeds two-thirds of the original number of students. In accordance with Item 2 of Article 8 of the Provisional Measures for Promoting the First Phase of Literacy Education for Out-of-School Public in Shanghai, they should be commended. It is heard that the Municipal Bureau of Education has instructed the two principals, Yu and Pan, of the aforementioned schools.

### Celebrating the Birthday of Zhejiang University Alumnus Xu Qianfu

Xu Qianfu, a senior figure in education and esteemed for his virtues, dedicated himself to industry in his early years. During the late Qing Dynasty, he founded the Tianzhong and Class B Industrial School, along with an attached weaving training institute, in Hangzhou. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, the school was expanded into an industrial vocational school. When Zhejiang University was established, the school was reorganized into the College of Engineering. Over decades, he cultivated numerous talents. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Xu retired to the Shanghai concession, living a secluded life while remaining steadfastly loyal. His virtue was widely admired. Last spring, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek met with him in Shanghai and treated him with great respect. This month, the twenty-second day marks Mr. Xu's sixty-ninth birthday. Zhejiang University alumni from Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, in accordance with the principles of honoring teachers and respecting the elderly, will gather at Wangfo Temple on Binlang Road in this city to offer birthday congratulations and hold the resumption conference of the National Industrial Association. It is expected to be a grand occasion.

### Preparation for the Establishment of Xinsheng Primary School in the Fifteenth District of Zhabei

The population of this city has surged, leading to overcrowding among school-age children. Public and private schools are insufficient to accommodate them, and countless children are out of school, especially in the Fifteenth District near the North Railway Station. Mr. Yu Bingwen, a local enthusiast for education, recognizing this problem, invited many like-minded individuals to organize a school board. They raised funds and secured three buildings at 101 Chongming Road as the school site. They plan to begin enrollment and classes next semester, naming the school Private Xinsheng Primary School. They have already submitted an application to the Municipal Education Bureau for approval to operate.

### Mayor Wu, Representing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Welcomes Zhang Boling's Return to the Country; Nankai Alumni Schedule a Meeting and Banquet to Celebrate

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Boling, President of Nankai University, returned to China aboard the "StagHound" from New York, arriving in Shanghai at 3:50 PM yesterday. The ship docked at the Kai Ping Wharf in Rihui Port. Among those who went to welcome him were Dong Shouyi, representing Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua; Cha Liangjian, President of the Local Court; Wang Yousheng, Director of the Relief Administration; Huang Yusheng, Secretary-General of Nankai University; He Lian, Director of the Institute of Economics; and Li Bojian, Chairman of the Nankai University Alumni Association, along with Tan Xifeng, Fang Xianting, and fifty to sixty others. Mayor Wu Guozhen also arrived promptly. Before the ship docked, he announced loudly to Zhang Boling: "Yesterday evening, after nine o'clock, the Chairman called me and asked me to represent him in welcoming you." Mayor Wu, being a Nankai alumnus himself, not only extended greetings on behalf of Chairman Chiang but also personally joined the welcoming party. Everyone sang the Nankai school song in unison and shouted slogans such as "Long live Nankai," "Long live President Zhang," and "Long live the Republic of China." Although Zhang Boling had a full head of white hair, he appeared remarkably energetic. As he descended the gangway, he declined the assistance of Nankai alumni, using a walking stick and repeatedly saying, "I'm alright, I'm alright."

Reason for Delayed Travel

Mr. Zhang departed for the United States on March 2nd of this year to undergo surgery for prostate enlargement. He had recovered quickly and was scheduled to return home in August, but he fell and injured his spine before boarding, delaying his travel. Subsequently, a strike by American sailors further prevented his departure. He finally set off from New York on the "StagHound" on November 15th, a journey that took a total of thirty-two days. It is understood that this was a cargo ship with only four or five passengers. Those returning to China with Zhang Boling included his eldest son, Zhang Xilu, and a nephew of Gan Junji, our envoy to Italy.

Nankai's Ten-Year Plan

Everyone is quite concerned about the future of Nankai. Mr. Zhang told reporters that he plans for Nankai to revert to private status in ten years. At the same time, Nankai Middle School in Chongqing will be expanded. It has also been decided to establish a Nankai Middle School in Shanghai and gradually expand to other cities. Regarding the situation and future of China, Mr. Zhang is full of optimism, saying, "Now is a golden opportunity. All our constraints have been lifted. The Japanese have surrendered, and the unequal treaties have been abolished. There are no enemies to the east, west, south, or north. China is going to grow! However, there will be difficulties, and everyone must work hard."

A Bright Future for China

After a short rest, Mr. Zhang added, "We have such a great leader, working hard for the country and for democracy. His health and spirit are so good. The future of the country is certainly bright. At the same time, we have the help of the most powerful country in the world, the United States, and the Soviet Union's attitude is also quite peaceful. As long as everyone acts with patriotism, China's peaceful reconstruction will certainly succeed!"

Scheduled Visits to Nanjing and Tianjin

Zhang Boling is currently residing in a warm and comfortable villa on Maiyang Road, prepared by Nankai alumni. It is also reported that the alumni plan to hold a welcoming banquet on Sunday. Mayor Wu is scheduled to host a dinner this Friday to welcome Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang is scheduled to travel to Nanjing next week to meet with the Chairman and to discuss important matters with relevant parties before proceeding to Tianjin.

[Another Report] During his trip to the United States this spring, Zhang Boling received an honorary doctorate from Columbia University and had discussions with renowned professors such as Dr. John Dewey.

### After the Victory, the First National Games Should Be Held in Changchun; Joint Conference of Party, Government, Military, and Organizations in Changchun Resolves to Request the Ministry of Education to Implement Its Previous Order

[Report from Our Correspondent in Changchun, 17th] At today's joint conference of party, government, military, and organizations here, it was unanimously resolved to request the Ministry of Education to schedule the first post-victory National Games to be held in Changchun. It is generally believed that: (1) Before September 18th (the Mukden Incident), the government issued an order that the National Games be held in Northeast China. However, the subsequent invasion by the Japanese prevented its realization. Now that Northeast China has been liberated, the government should implement its previously announced order. (2) Everyone knows the importance of Northeast China, but people in the interior of China do not have a clear understanding of the true situation in the Northeast. As the saying goes, "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." All young people in the country should have the opportunity to understand our great Northeast. (3) Northeast China was occupied for fourteen years, longer than any other occupied area. The National Games should be held in Changchun to provide an opportunity for the Northeast to revitalize. (4) The sports field in the capital has been completely destroyed and is unusable. The cost of repair is estimated at 3 billion yuan. The government should save this money. The sports field in Changchun is still intact and can be used. Furthermore, the cost of concentrating athletes in the capital is no less than concentrating them in Changchun.

### A Major Explosion at the Municipal Stadium; Education Bureau Petitions the Municipal Government to Negotiate Compensation for Losses

Requesting the Public Works Bureau to Estimate Repair Costs

The Municipal Central District Stadium was previously occupied by enemy forces. After liberation, it was still occupied by military agencies as an arsenal. Unfortunately, a major explosion occurred on the 7th of this month, destroying half of the stadium's structures and causing significant losses. Director Gu Yuxiu of the Municipal Education Bureau, to investigate the losses and petition for compensation, sent a letter to the Municipal Public Works Bureau, requesting that it send personnel to estimate the cost of repairs. The original text: "The Municipal Stadium in Jiangwan was built in the 23rd year of the Republic of China at a great expense and is the most complete sports facility in this city. Although it suffered minor damage during the war, most of it was intact and usable. It is currently used by the First Logistics District Headquarters of the United Logistics Command as the Second Arsenal, storing artillery shells and other military supplies. Unfortunately, a major explosion occurred on the 7th of this month, destroying more than half of the stadium's structures and causing significant losses. The stadium is an important educational facility in this city and was built with municipal bonds borne by the citizens, making it one of the city's most important municipal assets. Now that it has been destroyed, compensation should be sought. In addition to reporting the damage to the Municipal Government and requesting negotiations for compensation, we hereby request your bureau to send personnel to estimate the cost of repairing the stadium and to provide a response for use in petitioning for compensation. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau, Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, Li Ximou, Deputy Director, December 13, 35th year of the Republic of China."

### A Trip to Taitung: A Forgotten Virgin Land

— Taipei Air Dispatch, 12th, Our Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun

Taitung, also known as Eastern Taiwan, is a virgin land that has been almost forgotten. On the edge of the Pacific Ocean, high mountains and deep waters, wind and rain, nurture a rugged, desolate, and secluded wilderness. Not only are tourists reluctant to set foot there, but even those who grew up in the western plains regard this area with trepidation. Recently, the Governor-General's Office has shifted its vision and focused its attention on this area awaiting development. Eastern Taiwan, like China's Northwest, should no longer be forgotten. It is like a tumor on Taiwan, which must be operated on quickly. Precisely because of this, a public organization was formed to conduct investigations, using the findings as a basis for development. I, the reporter, have also become a member of the reclamation team, embarking on a journey with the group.

Developing Taitung: The Inspection Team as Vanguard

The Taitung Inspection Team includes fourteen units and twenty-four key personnel from relevant departments. This is the first planned organization in this province since the restoration. This organization will determine the fate of Eastern Taiwan and will be the vanguard of development, especially in terms of transportation. Almost all are mobilized, led by Director Ren Xianqun. The members include Hua Shousong, Director of the Highway Bureau; Xu Shangzhen, General Manager of the Transportation Company; Chen Qingwen, Chairman of the Railway Commission; Zhang Zhongsong, Factory Director; Xu Renshou, Director of the Keelung Port Bureau; Lin Zebin, Director of the Kaohsiung Port Bureau; Jin Deming, Feng Fazhu, Bao Guanfang, Directors of the Shipping Company; Tang Tongsun, Captain; Fei Hua, Director of the Public Works Bureau; Li Chunsong and Ye Mingsheng, Chief Engineers; Xu Eyun, Special Commissioner of the Industry and Mining Bureau; Li Jianren, Section Chief; Huo Bochang and Jin Teng of the Postal and Telecommunications Administration; Bi Qingchang, Director of the Geological Research Institute; Wang Renyu, Section Chief of the Meteorological Bureau; Mao Chuanpo of the Oceanographic Institute; Yuan Jidian, Section Chief of the Civil Affairs Department, and others. These members can be said to be the most comprehensive inspection team and the heads of the main departments urgently solving problems in Eastern Taiwan.

On the evening of the 5th, we boarded the night express train to Kaohsiung. The departure was uncertain until a few hours before, because the earthquake in Tainan had damaged the road surface and prevented passage. However, the repairs were quickly completed in three hours, and the train departed on time, allowing us to spend the night traversing the 510 kilometers of the western plains. On the morning of the 6th, we boarded a special military vehicle to Taitung, beginning a nearly 700-kilometer island-wide journey.

On the Southern Loop Line: Like a Spring Trip

On the Southern Loop Line, we made a large loop in the southern part of the island. Everyone prepared woolen clothing, fearing the cold nights of winter, but on the journey, everyone felt differently. The climate in southern China, at the southern tip of the island, is the opposite of the north in winter: dry, rainless, and dusty. The sun is still like a large umbrella, heating the hearts of travelers. It no longer makes people yearn for the north. We all felt that this was truly a spring trip.

The Southern Loop Line goes from Kaohsiung through Pingtung to Linbian, with provincial and county roads intersecting. At noon, we ate lunch at Fangliao Station and continued on, turning into Dawu in the east from Fenggang. This is purely a pebble road along the coast. The Japanese used to plant trees here, but the war forced them to cut them down for military use. From Dawu to Dama, it is purely an undeveloped wilderness: the mountains are covered with hardy plants, broadleaf and needle-shaped trees stretching their branches to welcome the wind, purple-crimson flowers interspersed with emerald green leaves, unpicked, wild smoke and desolate, a scene of desolation.

In Fenggang, Zhang Shaochu, director of the Seventh Engineering Office, led workers to welcome us. Director Fei was pleased to introduce to us that the roadbed from here to Taitung, seventeen kilometers long, had been washed away by typhoons last year, and fifteen bridges had been destroyed. Repairs began in March this year, mobilizing 150,000 workers and costing 22 million Taiwan dollars. The project was completed on August 25th. Director Zhang, at the southernmost end of the island, quickly completed the construction of the highway network. He now feels gratified to be able to ride in the newest Ford car on the pebble road he built, speeding like wind and lightning. This is the greatest reward for an engineering worker!

Seaside Night Talk: County Magistrate Praises the Gaoshan People

In a remote township called Dawu, the Taitung County Councilors traveled 66 kilometers from the county seat to greet us. The rugged mountain road lacking rest stops caused their cars to become separated from ours, and we did not see them until 9:00 PM. This enthusiastic welcome was truly touching.

The night in this small seaside town is not lonely tonight. The government's concern for Taitung made them welcome us warmly, waiting from the afternoon until dusk. We proceeded along the orderly welcoming lines, listening to County Magistrate Xie Zhen's report amid the sound of green firework crackers:

Of the 100,000 people in Huidong County, the Gaoshan people (Ami tribe) account for 44,000. There is an agricultural vocational school with 4,500 mu of experimental fields. Gaoshan students account for more than 90% of the student body, and the principal is also a Gaoshan agricultural researcher educated in Japan. County Magistrate Xie earnestly said that the Gaoshan people are not only not to be feared but are also the most lovable and promising people. They are the fastest to pay land taxes, and they also dominate in village appearance competitions, being clean and simple. Their performance in this year's provincial games was also the most outstanding. As Governor Chen said, the Japanese discovered the Gaoshan people's strengths too late. We are now trying to discover and understand them as much as possible.

The Bank of Taiwan has a branch here, with deposits reaching over 105 million, but loans are only over 4 million. In the past, it reached 8.5 million, but now it is clearly struggling to circulate. It is hoped that the liquidity will be eased. The Monopoly Bureau has a monthly income of 3.3 million and plans to enter 46% of the mountain areas, hoping to reach 5 million. The annual production of camphor is over 60,000 kilograms, and 750 mu are planted with tobacco. The county has an area of over 540,000 mu, of which more than 36,000 mu are forest land (arable land), which is currently barren. It may be possible to use it to plant pineapples, fiber crops such as ramie, and Sayi Chaila (transliteration). The latter is a broadleaf tropical crop, planted in the United States. 60,000 seedlings have already been planted and are used exclusively for making ropes. It is the most promising crop for promotion in the east.

The reporter is very concerned about the issue of the Gaoshan compatriots' centrifugal force. Not long ago, it was rumored in Taipei that it was causing trouble. According to Secretary Chen Hueling, it may have been caused by a misunderstanding arising from the need to cut one-third of the police force in line with the budget. Now there is something close to a cult that is gradually penetrating the mountains. According to other sources, in the past, the Japanese government, in order to protect the lives of the Gaoshan people, designated reserves for them to cultivate. After the restoration, the forestry authorities rented out some of the areas to merchants for business, causing them extreme dissatisfaction. Recently, this kind of situation, which almost caused major incidents, has occurred in Hsinchu and Tainan. The Governor has issued a notice to pay attention.

The Gaoshan people are excellent, but also the most innocent. They only have one belief: the government gives them comfort, and what the government promises to do must be fulfilled every time. If the government gives only empty promises once, even the achievements of the past will be lost. [End of Section 1]

### East Tai Outer Perimeter Fire Line

— Caonian, 3rd [of month] Dispatch from Tai County Correspondent Ling Songshou of this Newspaper

Donghe City was recovered just over a month ago, and the people are already hearing the rumble of artillery again.

Needless to say, the recovery of Donghe was a severe blow to the Communist army, pushing its fate in northern Jiangsu towards a dead end. The reporter knew that the Communist army would not be reconciled, so he had been waiting in Dongtai for this drama to unfold.

Overture Begins

Sure enough, the overture to the drama has begun. The 83rd Division's staff office told the reporter that the Communist army has concentrated eighteen regiments of troops around Dongtai, claiming they will use all their strength to "recover" Dongtai.

"Mr. Reporter, you have another good article to write!" The fire in the stove illuminated the face of Division Commander Li Tianxia, who excitedly said, "If they don't attack me, I won't attack them. If they want to try something, hmph! Eighteen regiments, I want to see what they can do!"

On the evening of the 27th, the Communist army used its most elite force in northern Jiangsu—the 1st Regiment of the 31st Brigade (reorganized from the original 7th Column)—to launch a full-scale attack on Jiuli Pavilion, on the outskirts of Dongtai. But the National Army was well-prepared, and in a combined arms operation with infantry and artillery, the Communist army could not withstand the intense artillery fire for several hours and retreated to Dingxi Town (16 li from Dongtai), and the Touzong, Erzong, and Sanzong areas four li east of the town.

Who did they encounter from the National Army? It was the 19th Brigade, which defended Taixing and Xuanjiabao, and was the first to enter Dongtai. This was truly enemies meeting face to face. The brothers of the 56th and 57th Regiments were rubbing their fists and shouting, "Damn it! You've provoked the tiger. If we don't fight to Dingxi and Caonian, we're not worthy of being men."

The National Army continued its advance and began a counter-offensive. The forward outposts of both sides were in a standoff near Panjiashe (12 li from Dongtai).

The Communist army also knew that the situation was tense, so they gathered all three regiments of the 31st Brigade—the 91st, 92nd, and 93rd—in the Dingxi and Caonian area, preparing for a major battle.

At 2:00 PM, the reporter accompanied Division Commander Li to the front line for inspection. Accompanying him were Chief of Staff Chang, Deputy Chief of Staff Cheng, and Dagongbao reporter Yan Qingshu—but he left Dongtai the next day for other tasks.

The sky was a dull gray. Although the drizzle wasn't heavy, the wind was strangely cold. It looked like it was going to snow. Two jeeps sped along the highway, and the jolting of the vehicles vibrated the heartstrings of everyone.

Upon reaching Sanli, the 19th Brigade's command post was set up here. Brigade Commander Yang also jumped into the vehicle to go to the front line.

Due to a phone call from the brigade command post, Regiment Commander Liu Guangyu knew that the division commander was coming to the front line. He stood by the highway waiting. The division commander got out of the car, and he immediately reported the situation at the front. Then he talked to the reporter: "Look, they're attacking again. I really don't understand what they're thinking, wanting to cause trouble for this land and the nation? The world needs peace, the country needs peace, and we need peace even more. Mr. Reporter, please think for us: We've suffered enough during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we've shown our strength enough. Do we still have to play this game among ourselves after victory today? However, they won't allow it. They want to attack you!" As he spoke, running, we arrived at the regimental command post. The command post was set up in a thatched shed. The light was very dim. While the generals were discussing strategy, Brother Qingshu and I went out for a walk.

This was a field. There were very few houses, and even the thatched sheds were sparse. The soldiers used grass stalks to build tent-like shelters as places to rest, scattered in groups across the positions.

You can only see everything about soldiers when you get to the battlefield. Among them, there were old men in their forties and fifties, and there were also children of fourteen or fifteen years old. They were all very innocent and lively. On a small mound, we saw a soldier carrying a piece of wood, probably for some construction work. As he walked, he spun the wood around his body, singing folk songs. Although the cold wind was blowing on him, the reporter believed that his heart was full and joyful.

They had very good habits of cleanliness. When they were fighting, the newly received cotton clothes were inevitably soiled, so they wore their clothes inside out, or put the summer clothes they wore on top. At first, the reporter thought it was another kind of uniform, or a kind of marking, but later, when I went to the front, I realized it was this. In fact, on the battlefield, even life cannot be guaranteed, let alone clothes? This alone is enough to show their innocence.

Injured with Brave Words

The reporter encountered a wounded soldier, who had just been carried from the front line to the rear. After he was set down, the reporter went up and asked, "What's wrong? Are you injured?" He pointed to a patch of crimson on his arm and said, "It's nothing, just a minor injury." The reporter said to him, "You are too tired." He raised his eyebrows and said very bravely, "If we don't sacrifice, then tens of thousands of our compatriots will have to suffer!" The reporter asked him again, "How is it on the front line?" He said, "Damn it! I aimed at these sons of bitches on the battlefield, one shot for each, and fired several shots in a row. After a while, we charged forward, and after less than a few dozen meters, I was injured..." The more he talked, the more excited he became, wanting to sit up. The reporter hurriedly pressed him down.

At dusk, the reporter left the front line with Division Commander Li. The sounds of gunfire and artillery were resonating densely. The clouds in the sky were even thicker, and the northwest wind was blowing from behind. The reporter shivered several times.

Overnight, the northwest wind blew down pure white snowflakes. On the afternoon of the 28th, the snow became even denser. The sounds of artillery fire were also directly proportional to the density of the snowflakes. The reporter knew in the divisional headquarters that the troops had advanced to the Panjiashe and Wujiaqiao lines in the face of bad weather, and the snowflakes were fluttering. "Like scattering salt, like drifting catkins, like the dancing of pear blossoms," Division Commander Li was concerned about the food and lodging of the soldiers on the front line, and frequently called the front to ask about it.

On the 29th, the weather turned clear. After lunch, the reporter accompanied the division commander in a speedboat to the front.

Harmony Without Distance

As soon as the reporter saw Artillery Battalion Commander Zhao Bingxing, he asked him: How was yesterday? He smiled and said, "We have plenty of hot blood, and the wind and snow can never diminish our fighting spirit." He also told the reporter, "The soldiers' morale is very high, and there is absolutely no sign of being afraid of the cold. Some soldiers even said to each other: 'We are considered good, the infantrymen in the front row have to hold their guns and charge forward!'" Battalion Commander Zhao pointed to his thatched shed and a radio and said, "The reason why we officers and soldiers can be harmonious and without any distance is that we absolutely share weal and woe with the soldiers. Look, this is my resting place, no different from the soldiers. Whenever we have free time, we immediately turn on the radio for everyone to listen to. But as soon as there is a firing order, everyone runs back to their original posts." Afterward, we logically talked about the Communist Party. Battalion Commander Zhao said, "Some people think that no matter whose reasons are right, it seems a bit too much for our own people to fight our own people. In fact, they don't know, who doesn't want peace? If there wasn't a war, would we come here to be attacked by the wind and snow? But, does the Communist Party treat us as Chinese people? To go a step further: Do they even treat themselves as Chinese people?"

We also arrived at the 56th Regiment's command post, which was no longer the same place as the day before.

I asked Regiment Commander Liu:

"How are you doing yesterday?"

He jokingly replied:

"I'm fine, it's just that I've drunk several buckets of ginger and brown sugar tea (the reporter's note: used to ward off the cold)."

The situation on the battlefield that day was like this——

The National Army has approached the front of Dingxi, Toude, Erzong, and Sanzong, facing off against the Communist army across the river. The Communist army, the 92nd Regiment is defending Caonian, the 93rd Regiment is defending Dingxi, and the 91st Regiment, the most elite of the 31st Brigade, is in the Tou, Er, and San Zong area.

Regiment Commander Liu Guangyu glared at the reporter and shouted, "Our highlight performance is here again, watch!"

On the morning of the 30th, the 56th Regiment used a company to cross the river in front of the enemy at Erzong, occupy a bridgehead, and cover the sappers in building a bridge. The Communist army was flustered, so other than leaving a small number of troops at Touzong and Sanzong, they concentrated all the main forces of the 91st Regiment to annihilate this company. They charged seven times in a row, but they couldn't withstand the concentrated artillery fire, and one by one they fell. The National Army crossed the river like a tide, and fifty-seven [unit] attacked [direction]. A part of the 56th Regiment turned to Dinghandong. At the same time, the main force of the 56th Regiment in front of Dingxi, under the cover of artillery and air force, cooperated with the naval forces and recovered Dingxi at 4:00 PM. Next, the 57th Regiment took an encirclement offensive against Caonian, and captured it at 4:40 AM the next day (December 1).

After the incident, according to investigations, in San[ ] alone, the Communist army left behind more than a thousand corpses. This was the end of the Communist army's elite troops attacking Dongtai.

"Strike the attackers with strikes!" After the recovery of Dongtai, the 19th Brigade gave the Communist army another serious lesson.

### Ambassador Wu Jingxiong

— Chen Ruyi

Dr. Wu Jingxiong, our country's ambassador to the Holy See, left Shanghai on the "General Joffre" postal ship the other day and went to Marseille, transferring to his post to assume his new position. Dr. Wu was originally a legal scholar of our time, and his morality and writing are admired by the world; now I respectfully write several anecdotes about Mr. Wu's life and deeds to give to readers.

Obtained Doctorate at Twenty-Two

Wu was born in Yin County, Zhejiang Province in 189[?]. His father, Mr. Jiacuang, was a Confucian merchant and the first president of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce. Wu was taught by Mr. Jiacuang himself in his childhood. Later, he graduated from Hanxiang Primary School and Xiaoshi Middle School. In 1920, he graduated first in his class from Soochow Law School. He immediately went to America and, in 1921, obtained a doctorate in law from the University of Michigan, at the young age of twenty-two. His article, "A Study of Ancient Chinese Law and Jurisprudence," was very popular among readers there. Recommended by professors Dickinson Drake and Crane of the school, he was awarded the Carnegie International Peace Prize, which funded his advanced studies at the University of Paris. Because of his outstanding grades, he received the scholarship for another year and transferred to the University of Berlin, where he engaged in research under the guidance of the famous Professor Stammler. Wu also wrote an article, "Holmes's Philosophy of Law," which was published in the "Michigan Law Review." In 1923, he returned to study at Harvard Law School under Dean Pound. Wu then published an article, "Pound's Philosophy of Law," in the Illinois Law Review. Soon after, at the invitation of Dean Wigmore and Professor Kocourek of the Northwestern University School of Law, he wrote "Stammler and His Critics," which was included in the famous "Modern Legal Philosophy Series." Later, at the invitation of his alma mater, Soochow Law School, he returned to China to teach, studying international law, Roman law, and jurisprudence. Wu once served as a philosophy researcher at the Academia Sinica. His book, "The Human Element in Law," was included in the Harvard Law School Series.

Contributed Greatly to the Constitution

Wu was originally a giant in the legal field. In his early years, he lectured in the United States, [gaining] great fame. Since the establishment of the National Government, he has served as a member of the Legislative Yuan to this day, presiding over the Law Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, etc. He has contributed greatly to the creation of our country's code of laws and is highly regarded by President Sun Zhesheng of the Executive Yuan. The initial draft of the Constitution of the Republic of China was drafted by Wu. During the constitutional process, Wu participated in everything. Before and after the opening of the National Assembly, Wu participated in the final revision work to provide a basis for the conference's discussion. Everything he said was profound and to the point. This draft constitution incorporated opinions from all parties and naturally differed from the spirit of the "May 5th Draft" [Constitution]. On November 27, the Central Propaganda Department held a press conference. More than 200 foreign and domestic reporters attended. Wu attended to explain the origins of the constitution, tactfully and thoroughly, and the reporters were all convinced. Also, Wu went to the United States last summer to attend the San Francisco Conference as an advisor to our country's delegation. The Chinese version of the United Nations Charter was also drafted by Wu. The adoption of Chinese as an official language of the international community was actually due to this. The Charter is the fundamental law, and the peace and stability of the world are based on it. Wu's contribution can be said to be great.

Received Baptism to Avoid Banditry

Wu was a Protestant in his early years. In the fall of 1937, Shanghai fell, and Wu, who was an aide at the core of power and held an important position, was eagerly sought by the enemy puppets. At first, he took refuge in the home of his friend Yuan Jiahong. He happened to read the book "The Story of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux" and was deeply moved. A few hours before going to Hong Kong, he was baptized as a Catholic, which has been nine years ago. His faith and diligence in religious practice are often praised by people in the church.

One Hundred and Fifty Songs Without Falsehood

During the Anti-Japanese War, Wu translated the Bible under the order of President Chiang. The entire New Testament and the Psalms (formerly known as "Book of Odes") in the Old Testament have been completed. The initial draft of the translation of the Psalms, with a total of one hundred and fifty songs in five volumes, was translated into verse with elegant diction and resounding rhythm. President Chiang himself proofread them in his spare time, which is enough to see the value of this book. It was published by the Commercial Press in October. In two months, more than 10,000 copies were sold. Good reviews arose everywhere, and the world respected it. The author wrote an article, "The View of Life in the Psalms," to briefly express his views. What did Wu think of the Psalms? Wu once said to me: "The three hundred Songs can be summed up in one sentence: 'Without corrupt thoughts.' And the one hundred and fifty Psalms can be summed up in one sentence: 'Without falsehood.' The Psalms are words of supplication to God by prophets throughout the ages, and the words come from sincerity, truth, and honesty, which is a further step from the ancient Chinese poetry that expressed intentions."

Family Journey with Native Country in Mind

In 19[??], Wu returned home at the young age of eighteen, and his relationship with [wife] was intimate and lasted for a long time. Wu's studies and politics were without domestic worries, which was due to the efforts of his wife. Wu currently has nine sons and four daughters, with an age gap of only one or two years between them. Those who joke call him a "prolific writer" in both senses of the word. All the children have been baptized one after another. The family is harmonious and the sound of reading never stops, which can be called a model family. Wu often said that the Confucian requirements for family harmony are sometimes forced and rely on patience. But Wu's family, with parental love and filial piety, is naturally so. This trip to Rome will take months. Except for his eldest son, Zulin, who will remain in Shanghai, his wife and the rest of his children will travel with him to his post. The postal ship is well-equipped, and guests feel at home. The sea is vast and the sky is wide, so it must be enjoyable. I once jokingly said to Wu, "This can truly be called a total mobilization of the whole family." Wu turned to me and said, "With family traveling together, my native country is still in my heart. Looking at the difficult times, how can I stop myself?" Wu's deep concern for the country is overflowing in his words.

Beautiful Appearance and Diligent in Reading

Wu has a beautiful appearance, wears glasses, often wears a long robe, and his demeanor is natural. He is nearing the age of fifty, but looks like someone in his thirties. He reads very diligently, mostly late at night, with a volume in hand, happy and forgetting fatigue. His private residence is located on Extreme Civil Road in western Shanghai, and the collection [of books] is vast and rich. During the years of occupation, it was moved to a certain church, so it was preserved intact. Usually, he is addicted to cigarettes as his life, burning dozens of sticks a day as usual. Whenever he holds a pen, he consumes a lot, the smoke swirling around, and his thoughts flow incessantly.

Likes to Listen to Opera and Loves Mountains and Rivers

Wu also likes to listen to opera and is good at singing the "Selling Horses" section. He was a famous amateur opera singer in his early years. During the war, he lived in various places and moved several times. He lived under the Seven Star Rock in Guilin, rented a house near Huaxi in Guiyang, and lived in Beibei in Chongqing. The above places all have beautiful scenery, and Wu's writing has a lot of unique spirit.

### Arts and Life

— Yang Tongfang

By Cao Fu, Published by Kaiming Bookstore

Here, I want to introduce a book about self-cultivation for young people to young readers. However, this book, "The Art of Living," is different from the typical book on self-cultivation for young people. I believe everyone feels that young people need self-cultivation in academics, thought, emotions, and attitudes. However, what understanding and recognition young people themselves should have of self-cultivation is something no one can estimate. The reason is that grasping the meaning and goals of youth self-cultivation correctly cannot be done by those who only know how to write moralizing articles.

In the preface, "Starting from Inspirational Philosophy," the author explains the motivation for writing these articles. "The Art of Living" is not a book on self-cultivation with neatly arranged chapters and sections, but rather a collection of articles discussing the cultivation of life. Although the articles are scattered, the author writes with a consistent goal and thought. His main point is to reverse the past self-centered definition of cultivation and focus on the individual's adaptation to social life, correct the traditional error of isolating the individual from society, and expound on the significance and value of moral behavior in real-life practice. In the past, the author translated a book on self-cultivation by Dr. Marden, titled "Inspirational Philosophy," which had a significant impact on the spirit of young people. It must be said that the book made a special contribution to inspiring the ambition of young people and cultivating their character, but it inevitably leaned towards individualism. If one can grasp a relatively correct attitude, it is not necessarily harmful; it is just that there are too few people who can understand the way of self-cultivation with a correct attitude. The author treats writing these articles as a kind of "redemption," so the arguments made in this book are much more advanced than his previous translations.

Indeed, "Inspirational Philosophy," even if it has an encouraging and inspiring effect on young people, inevitably leads people to a narrow, individualistic "success." However, if one can filter out the individualism and bourgeois气息 (worldly atmosphere), it is undeniable that it is still beneficial to young people. For example, emphasizing the importance of subjective effort in one's personal life is very valuable.

The author of this book retains this advantage and gives young people's life cultivation a new assessment. He sees through the deceitful and flattering discussions of self-cultivation, whether Chinese or foreign. If self-cultivation is regarded as "dealing with the world" or "coping" with sophistication, or as a "means" of pleasing others, it is tantamount to instructing young people in the hypocritical methods of boasting, flattering, and wearing high hats, corrupting their minds and destroying their natural qualities. In recent years, books such as "How to Make Friends" and "The Way to Deal with the World" have been commonly seen in bookstores and sell very well. Young people are generally willing to spend a small amount of money to acquire the art of defeating others. In fact, talking about self-cultivation in this way is simply turning young people into cunning and slippery "worldly people."

There are also American-style discussions of self-cultivation that are close to bourgeois mentality. The author wants young people to have the ambition to surpass others, to strive for progress, to stand out from the crowd, and to become "people above others," just like the common Chinese people's hope for young people to "bring glory to their ancestors." This is entirely a vulgar worship of material desires and "success." Treating dealing with the world and treating people as a means to achieve the goal of "success," and even talking about personality and integrity for these reasons, makes the motivation for such self-cultivation impure.

The author wrote these articles with a view to enhancing the interest in life and expounding the art of living. As the name suggests, this book is called "The Art of Living" precisely to change people's general perception so that everyone recognizes that the cultivation of life is an art, and a noble ideal of life is indispensable for beautifying life. To pursue the art of living and the most valuable spiritual life is the ultimate goal of youth self-cultivation. On the stage of life, one can see all kinds of roles, some skillful and some clumsy, and the difference between them lies in the depth of artistic cultivation. Let us look at the art of living discussed by the author of this book, "The Art of Living," from the standpoint of an anti-individualist.

If there is anything different between this book and other similar books, it is mainly that it fundamentally discusses youth issues and life cultivation based on the principles of emerging psychology. The author believes that for young people to "settle down and establish themselves," they must seek psychological peace and find a place to entrust their spirit. Indeed, the suffering,烦恼 (worries), and sadness of young people are really due to the fact that their spirit has nowhere to turn. He said something very pertinent: "The most fundamental way to overcome all psychological illnesses is to entrust one's life to a cause and goal that is more important and more valuable than oneself. Other than that, all sermons about overcoming the psychological illnesses of young people, even if they can be effective, are only temporary pain relievers, sedatives, or even anesthetics. ... To seek a place to settle down and establish oneself outside of real life, if it is still possible, then the so-called establishing oneself is only establishing oneself in an ivory tower, and the so-called peace of mind is only ostrich-like苟安 (temporary ease)." From his words, one can see the fallacy of general empty talk about self-cultivation. Young people must be determined to make the country better and society better before they can find a place to anchor their spirit. Young people must not regard their profession merely as a way to solve their livelihood; they should stimulate the social significance of their work and find the permanent value of life. It is not enough to physically participate in a job; one must also add imagination and emotional enthusiasm. We very much agree with the author's highest ideal of youth self-cultivation: to participate in, promote, and facilitate the realization of an ideal social life.

At the same time, the author also points out that people who generally talk about youth self-cultivation seem to only talk about "character" but not about "morality." Most people confuse these two terms. Courage is a quality we must have, but if this quality is developed poorly, it is easy to produce evil results. One cannot say that robbers and spies are not courageous, nor can one say that they lack boldness, but their evil deeds do not meet moral standards. We certainly hate hypocrites who are full of benevolence, righteousness, and morality, but we still want to praise genuine moral behavior. The most fully developed personality (which has gradually shifted from ethics to psychology) is what we should pursue. The author does not advocate listing moral behaviors as rules; he agrees with the moral cultivation of "major virtues do not exceed boundaries, and minor virtues can be flexible," and points out a path of youth self-cultivation: from "external refinement" to character, to morality, to the whole personality cultivation, and to the broad cultural cultivation. The included items are: "external refinement," character, morality, intellectual education, physical appearance, aesthetic education (art), and mental hygiene (emotional cultivation).

In the book, the Confucian "Great Learning" which states "The way of great learning consists in manifesting one's clear virtue, loving the people" is given an explanation. The author uses these words to explain public and private virtues. Manifesting one's clear virtue is private virtue, and loving the people is public virtue. The two are the obverse and reverse of the same thing, and must be linked together to exert the greatest effect of morality. The Song people divided the eight virtues of "investigating things, extending knowledge, rectifying the mind, making the will sincere, cultivating the person, regulating the family, governing the state, and pacifying the world" into two parts. The first half is the effort of sincerity and righteousness, and the second half is the effort of governing and pacifying. Above rectifying the mind and making the will sincere, there are still the two efforts of investigating things and extending knowledge. The author believes that investigating things and extending knowledge means grasping the correct method of thinking and making a correct understanding of the principles and methods of governing and pacifying, so it is still connected to the following section. The author does not agree with the division of private and public virtues. He believes that in fact, there are only minor virtues and major virtues. The minor points in private life are minor virtues, and governing and pacifying are major virtues. However, governing and pacifying must be motivated by rectifying the mind and making the will sincere, and guided by investigating things and extending knowledge, so major virtue is the unification of public and private virtues. Yes, we very much agree with the author's words that valuable cultural heritage should not be completely abandoned and completely obliterated; we must do the work of discarding and selecting. Except for the reactionary and poisonous, which cannot be allowed to exist, the ethical thoughts related to moral cultivation may as well be "re-evaluated" for their value.

Overall, although this book is compiled from scattered articles, because it was written with a consistent goal and a unique perspective, the various articles still feel closely connected in thought. The ordinary youth self-cultivation talks about things that are also expounded in this book. This is not empty talk, but the most needed problems to be solved in real life. The theory is mostly based on the principles of psychology, with philosophical judgments about life. However, it is not as dry and boring as other books on theory; it is really a very cordial conversation. Articles such as "A Confession of an Idealist," "Interest in Life," "Work," "Play," "Reading," "Love," and "Anti-Cynicism" all have novel and unique insights that are thought-provoking. In ordinary books on self-cultivation, at most, young people are told some abstract moral rules in a "preachy" way, how to conduct themselves in the world, how to treat people, how to please people, and how to achieve success and establish a career. In the end, everything is for one's own sake and for the sake of material desires. But what is discussed here belongs to the positive. The author emphasizes the importance of a sound personality and correct thinking for the life of young people. He wants young people to pursue the highest ideal of life (the ideal spiritual one), which is not only the cultivation of personal virtue, but also should further stimulate the highest and greatest value of life, promote the artistry of life, to purify life, and beautify life.

### "America and the Pacific"

— Sun Jingzhi

By Li Xiefei, Published by Chunghwa Book Company, January 1946

The Pacific era, which has leapt from the prosperity of the Atlantic to become the focus of global attention, is unfolding. The United States is a major power in the northeast of the Pacific. Since its independence, its historical evolution, national growth, and development have been closely related to the Pacific. That is, it has always played a very important role in the Pacific international political arena. The 20th century was recognized as the Pacific century by general sighted politicians, and so far, the situation on the Pacific, the competition among the powers, has been changing under the tense and turbulent situation. The United States' influence in the Pacific started in the northeast, extended down to Hawaii in the mid-Pacific, and the Philippines in the western Pacific. After this war, it extended south to Japan and southeast to Korea on the edge of mainland China. The distribution of its sphere of influence is almost all over the Pacific, so there is an inseparable relationship between the United States and the Pacific. Whether one wants to study American history or the international political disputes in the Pacific in recent centuries, one must understand the historical relationship between the United States and the Pacific.

In the book "America and the Pacific" by Mr. Li Xiefei, he divides it into eight chapters. Chapter 1, "The Natural Trend of the Development of American National Power," describes the consistent westward movement of the United States after its birth, which is the historical origin of the United States and the Pacific.

Chapter 2, "International Politics in the Pacific in the 19th Century," describes the decline of the power of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain in the Pacific, the establishment of the British Empire's hegemony, and the rise of the new forces of Japan and the United States. The competition among the powers in mainland China created the complex situation in the Pacific in the 20th century.

Chapter 3, "The Relationship between the United States and China and Japan," from the establishment of the relationship between the United States and China, to the rise of Japanese imperialism, formed an adversarial situation between the United States and Japan in China's sphere of influence.

Chapter 4, "The Development of American Power in the Pacific," the westward development of the United States reached the Mississippi River basin in 1803, Oregon in the mid-19th century, Alaska from Russia in 1867, and naval bases such as the Philippines, Hawaii, and Guam at the end of the 19th century. The opening of the Panama Canal brought the United States and the Pacific into a new stage, and the United States' power in the Pacific consolidated its foundation.

Chapter 5, "The Open Door Policy and the Washington Conference," after the Sino-Japanese War, the powers' ambition to divide China intensified. The United States vigorously advocated the Open Door Policy, prompting various countries to establish a strategy towards China, and supporting the ten years of peace and balance in the Pacific international community. The convening of the Washington Conference determined several principles, the Four-Power Pacific Treaty, the Five-Power Naval Treaty, and the Nine-Power Treaty, consolidating the situation in the Far East. The limitation of armaments further maintained peace.

Chapter 6, "The United States' Far East Policy after the September 18th Incident," the United States' foreign policy has always had its consistent purpose. The Open Door Policy was advocated first, and the Nine-Power Treaty followed. After the "September 18th Incident," the situation in the Far East changed drastically, but the United States never changed its attitude; it strengthened the flexibility of its policy. The Stimson Doctrine of non-recognition is one example. After Roosevelt was elected president, the United States changed its isolationism—breaking its historical silence, and took a positive measure and expression against Japan's aggressive ambitions, creating a trend in which the United States and Japan were bound to fight in their policies.

Chapter 7, "The Pacific War after the Attack on Pearl Harbor and the Responsibilities of the United States after the War," the attack on Pearl Harbor marked the beginning of the Pacific War. The situation of the two major groups in the world was established. The Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan and the anti-aggression Allied countries of the United States, China, and Britain launched a comprehensive world war. On January 1, 1941, the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union signed a joint declaration, clarifying the common purpose and principles of the war. On January 1 of the following year, it was formally signed, and 26 countries, including Australia, Belgium, and Canada, joined, which laid the foundation for the tasks and victory of the countries in the war. During the war, the United States always shouldered great responsibilities in the Pacific, and after the war, how to solve Japan's ambitions, assist China's construction, preside over the autonomy of various ethnic groups, and establish peaceful relations in the Pacific, the United States still has responsibilities.

Chapter 8, "The United States and the Pacific in the Post-War Outlook," in the post-war Pacific, the relationship with the United States will inevitably become closer. In this Pacific international circle surrounded by 19 independent countries, the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and Britain occupy important positions. The United States' power has now moved from the north of the Pacific to the central and southern parts, occupying a more central position. Its future policies, the establishment of relations between the United States and China, the United States and the Soviet Union, and the cooperation and development of the countries in the Pacific, and the maintenance of peace in the Pacific, the United States already has the decisive ability.

Mr. Li Xiefei's book was completed on March 1, 1945, and was published by Chunghwa Book Company at the beginning of this year. It can be considered a new book. The content is very rich, especially the last three chapters have more information. If you want to study history or international issues, it is worth buying for reference.

### Introducing Several Publications on Industry

— Shao Qiu

This is a cliché that is unbearably俗不可耐 (banal): "China's industry is too underdeveloped." But despite saying it, who is really working on reviving and building China's industry? Therefore, China's industry since the founding of the Republic of China 35 years ago is still in the infancy stage, not even weaned yet. And due to the underdevelopment of China's industry, the depression of China's industrial publishing industry is also closely linked, and these two aspects have a mutual cause and effect relationship.

Because I am engaged in industry, recently I took advantage of my position to visit the industrial publishing industry in Shanghai. Here I sincerely recommend these three industrial publications that are very worth reading to those who care about China's industry and future—Engineering World, Textile Dyeing Monthly, and Fiber Monthly.

Engineering World

This is published by the Chinese Technical Research Society since it moved to Shanghai last November after the victory. At that time, the format was very small, only four pages of eight-page newspaper, and because it was limited by economic conditions and the limited spare time of the person in charge, there was nothing to talk about. However, after suspending publication for two months in June of this year, it resumed publication in August, and the resumed Engineering World has a completely new look. Everything about the content, layout, printing, and manuscripts has been significantly improved. And the format has also expanded a lot (about 60 pages of 16-page format). Is this really because the advertising is squeezed in, which has increased economic strength? Of course, the efforts of its person in charge cannot be ignored. And here I will make a brief review of the contents of the recent two issues, October and November of Engineering World: it is too biased towards theory and translation, so there are relatively few articles on textiles and civil engineering. Because although "industry" is only two words, the scope is quite broad, and Engineering World is named after this broad name, then the content should also be uniform, and there should be some about all aspects of engineering world. However, Engineering World has a lifetime characteristic, that is, there are many illustrations and photos, which other industrial publications do not have. Furthermore, according to the Engineering World's name, the format can be expanded a bit for the sake of uniform content.

Fiber Industry

This is a textile industry journal. First, let me say that the fate of this journal is very pitiful. Since it was published in October last year after the victory, it has only published five issues in more than a year, although it is said to be a monthly publication. In the meantime, it has been suspended for four consecutive months. This is because the person in charge is困于 (troubled by) time constraints. Because in the fiber industry, advertising is much more than in Engineering World. The format of Fiber Industry is also about 20 pages more than that of Engineering World. And in terms of content, it really focuses on the fiber textile industry. But it is almost entirely reprinted from British and American magazines. And there are too few illustrations, and although the manuscripts are very uniform, they are not neat enough. But Fiber Industry also has a characteristic, that is, the price is very cheap. A very thick volume with very generous and gorgeous装璜 (decorations) and printing only sells for 500 yuan. The most recent issue also only sells for 1,000 yuan.

Textile Dyeing Monthly

Not only is it relatively the best among the three industrial publications I introduced, but it is also difficult to find in the entire industrial publishing industry in Shanghai or China. Because apart from a cover that is not as gorgeous as Fiber Industry and as simple as Engineering World, but is somewhat顯 (obvious) but反单调 (not monotonous), it is very uniform, clear, novel, and neat in other aspects such as content, printing, layout, and manuscript acquisition. Especially Textile Dyeing, which has been in its second volume, has had even greater improvements, and what is especially worth mentioning is that the manuscripts of Textile Dyeing are far more domestic than translated ones. This is also worth mentioning today in China's industrial publishing industry, where translations overwhelm original works. The most recent issue of Textile Dyeing has also added a column introducing textile industrialists and added many photos and illustrations. This is very valuable. However, its price seems to be a bit too expensive, costing 2,000 yuan, because in my opinion, general young students who are interested in industrial research cannot afford it. Furthermore, the number of advertisements in Textile Dyeing is comparable to that in Fiber Industry, so why is Textile Dyeing Monthly more expensive? It is also worth mentioning that Textile Dyeing also has a characteristic that it never misses an issue. It is always published on time on the 15th of each month. Therefore, it seems that Textile Dyeing is the most promising one in the difficult and萧条 (depressed) industrial publishing industry.

### Child Rearing Methods

— Ye Jinchun, translated by Huang Jiayin, published by Benfeng Society

I remember that Lao Lin once chatted with me and said: "When I got married, my friends also gave me two books about marital life and self-cultivation. I still haven't finished reading them, but since I had A Dong and Xiao Pang, for their sake, I bought more than a dozen books about raising children. After reading them, I still feel that I lack too much knowledge in this area."

I think there is some reason in these words, because maintaining a harmonious family, although it requires the efforts of both husband and wife to implement many basic principles, because of the love between men and women and the adaptation of adults to new environments, some difficulties are still easy to overcome. Only with these generally innocent children, because our prejudices are too deep, and the children's actions are innocent and their preferences are very different, there are many questions about the children that we cannot answer. Many of the children's actions are handled inappropriately by us, and as for the attention to children's nutrition and the care of diseases, which involves some specialized knowledge, we are even more at a loss when asked. So no wonder Lao Lin feels棘手 (thorny).

Generally, more responsible parents have no choice but to study in books when they encounter this situation. Speaking of books about teaching and raising children, I have read several books in Chinese and English. Based on what I have read, I think they inevitably have various shortcomings. Some are too theoretical, and some are too specialized. Some books are mostly compiled and translated from foreign books, and they often fail to choose appropriately, but only整摭杂取 (patchwork together) odds and ends, so that the books have too much foreign flavor.

Because there are not many good books of this kind (it is really not easy to be good), I recently saw a product that is差强人意 (barely satisfactory) and I am very willing to推　 (recommend) it to the public.

The book I want to talk about is called "Child Rearing Methods," translated by Shen Chenshi, edited and proofread by Huang Jiayin, published by Xifeng Magazine in October this year. The whole book has two hundred and six pages, and the price is three thousand yuan.

The original text of "Child Rearing Methods" was compiled by the Children's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor. It has been revised several times after publication. Children's health experts from major hospitals in the United States participated in the compilation and revision, so the content is very practical, and the compilers may have spent some effort to make a selection on the subject matter, so after reading it, it does not feel "unsuitable for the national conditions" or "蹈高惊远" (aim too high and scare people away).

The whole book is divided into eleven chapters, namely "Infancy to Childhood," "The Child's Environment," "Maintaining Health and Avoiding Disease," "Disease Prevention Methods," "Teeth," "Food and Eating Habits," "Sleep and Sleeping Habits," "Clothing," "Games," "Child Development," and "Sick Children." Each chapter details the nutrition of the child's body and also the陶育 (cultivation) of intellectual habits, which can be said to emphasize both "teaching" and "raising." The book does not emphasize theory, but lists methods, and the methods are all written based on correct theories and experience. The writing style is clear and smooth, and it does not feel沉闷 (dull) when reading it. I think that a book about teaching and raising children that can be compiled in this way is already very satisfactory. I hope that after this book is published, it will be reviewed by domestic children's health experts, and some of the more special problems of Chinese children will be added to make it the most perfect children's teaching and raising book in our country.

### Preface to Mr. Yang Wei-yun's Eightieth Birthday

— Qian Jibo

In the auspicious days of the first month of the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Yang Wei-yun, an elder of the village, celebrates his eightieth birthday. The erudite Guan Tongyi entrusted me with writing a congratulatory essay, saying, "My father has experienced many trials, yet he has long admired your lofty integrity. Despite my lack of talent, I am honored to be considered your disciple. For seventy years, I have wished to receive your guidance to please my father, but you declined, citing family duties. For the past decade, the Eastern barbarians have been ruthless, indulging their greed like boars and snakes, wreaking havoc upon our land. The divine land has been devastated, warhorses roam the suburbs, the nation lacks strong defenses, and the people lack firm resolve. Surviving with humiliation is considered fortunate. Yet, my father has maintained his integrity and remained steadfast in the face of adversity. Relatives dare not sway him with personal favors, and villains cannot steal his principles. He has bided his time in Tianjin, concealing his brilliance while remaining clear-sighted, and hopes for eternal life to witness the restoration of our nation. This is the benefit of persevering in hardship, and it is also what you have foreseen. If I can obtain your essay to honor my father's aspirations, it will not only be a toast to celebrate this day, but also an inspiration for the timid and a model for generations to come." Though I, Jibo, am an old man devoted to the classics, living in solitude, Mr. Yang is twenty years my senior and achieved eminence early, benefiting many. His reputation is well-known, and those who praise his virtues by discussing the past and present fill the room. There is no shortage of talented writers, so why seek out a poor scholar like me to write this? I believe the reason Tongyi asked me is that his words are sincere, their meaning profound, and related to moral instruction, so I cannot refuse.

Mr. Yang was known for his literary talent from an early age and was knowledgeable in all fields. He passed the Shun Tian provincial examination in the seventeenth year of the Guangxu era and became a Compiler of the Grand Secretariat in the late Qing dynasty. He dedicated himself to the great cause of managing the world, and upon imperial decree, he accompanied the five ministers on a fact-finding mission, traveling to various European and American countries and even the islands of Southeast Asia, gaining extensive knowledge of foreign affairs. His writings synthesize the past and present, elaborating on details and carefully analyzing issues, aiming for practical implementation. However, his ideas were not adopted. He drafted memorials for many prominent figures, the most important of which were advocating for constitutionalism to express public opinion, reforming the official system to purify governance, and establishing a budget to control national expenditures, among many other proposals for the nation. I once wrote a preface to Mr. Yang's "Sikun Wenchao Biechao," which dealt with these matters. However, his suggestions were not heeded, and the Qing dynasty collapsed. After the founding of the Republic of China, when the President was still cautious, Mr. Yang served as the Vice Minister of Finance under the first Minister. He was prudent and measured, assigned people according to their abilities, did not lightly increase taxes to exploit the people, and did not issue public bonds to bankrupt the nation. He rejected loan proposals from various provinces, both domestic and foreign, saying, "I have been in charge of finance for years and have never signed a single bond contract. I can claim innocence to the people." Seeing that those in charge of the nation and its finances after the sixth year of the Republic of China considered borrowing to be the primary policy and the ability to borrow the greatest talent, he could not help but indignantly say, "Other countries use public bonds to supplement their finances, but our country uses public bonds to destroy them. When I accompanied the delegation abroad, French financier Dr. Penk told me that a country's indiscriminate issuance of public bonds is tantamount to entrusting its finances to banks, causing the government to lose its power to balance and adjust. Banks prioritize profit above all else, and the government is controlled by them. The drawbacks are countless." These words were full of emotion. Before that, during the late Qing dynasty, there was interaction between officials and merchants that touched upon national laws and regulations. If one did not value one's reputation, impeachment would follow. However, this practice gradually declined towards the end of the dynasty. Even so, the compradors of HSBC could only sit in the tea room of the Ministry of Revenue, waiting for officials to receive them. Since the Republic of China, the Director-General and Vice-Ministers began to treat bank managers as equals. With the implementation of the public bond policy, banks gained power, and Director-Generals and Vice-Ministers rushed to please them, fearing to be late for bank association meetings. National principles were swept aside. Mr. Yang said, "The country has its own system. How can I bow to others' will?" Yet, the annual revenue of the national treasury, eighty to ninety million, was mortgaged to banks, and the custody of the public bond funds was entrusted to the customs commissioner, Anger. Thus, the lifeline of the nation's finances was controlled by foreigners, and those in charge of finance could only follow their orders. Later, the Americans convened the Washington Conference, and the Nine-Power Treaty was signed, stipulating that China would implement a five percent ad valorem tariff, which could increase annual revenue by more than ten million taels. Anger then submitted the Witt Internal Debt Tax Bill, intending to allocate the additional tariff revenue to six public bond funds, including financial funds. Those who held public bonds all echoed this proposal, but Mr. Yang opposed it, saying, "The new tariff revenue and the monthly surplus revenue of more than three million are now used to supplement government expenses. Anger is ostensibly reorganizing, but in reality, he is controlling the customs revenue, privately investigating the draw, setting the deadlines, and purchasing pounds at will, without the Ministry of Finance's involvement. He is taking advantage of the government's urgency, using the stored tariff revenue to issue public bonds, half of which is consumed by interest. Officials are clamoring for the issuance of public bonds, showing joy as if they were reborn, not realizing who is causing the depletion of their marrow. Those in charge of finance must rely on Anger's approval and align with the banks. Otherwise, they will face criticism and slander, making it impossible to have peace of mind. I have been indignant about this for a long time, unable to stop the tide. How can I praise them?" Pursuing profit became the norm. Newspapers demanded subsidies, and if they were not granted, they would launch attacks. Councilors requested favors, and if they were not granted, they would propose impeachments. Anger's influence grew, and he said to Mr. Yang, "What I have studied is China's financial history, and what I have examined is the financial systems of various countries. In the past six years, national expenditures have been extravagant, and accountants have used fake figures and deviated from normal procedures for personal gain. How can my ideas be implemented?" He resigned due to illness and refused to return. After that, Anger was able to pursue his ambitions, using the customs revenue to manipulate public bonds, accumulating tens of millions of dollars. In the winter of the fifteenth year, Gu Weijun became the Prime Minister and resolutely dismissed Anger. When Anger left office, he privately embezzled four million in customs revenue and deposited it in HSBC. When the Ministry of Finance investigated and impeached him, Anger had already fled overseas, beyond the reach of justice. Only then did people realize Anger's treachery and recognize Mr. Yang's patriotism and integrity as unattainable.

Mr. Yang participated in key government affairs early on, but escaped slander. He was in charge of finance for a long time, but did not enrich himself. The President entrusted him with the position of Minister, sincerely seeking his advice. He aroused no suspicion, had friends all over the world, and loved people widely. He once said to Tongyi's brother, "In this era, how can we find such virtuous gentlemen to help us overcome difficulties? Just let them do their best." Many people thought Mr. Yang was indiscriminate in his dealings with people, but they did not know that he was broad-minded in his interactions but upright in his conduct, civilized internally but gentle externally. When it came to righteousness, he stood alone, unmoved by the clamor of the crowd. When he felt a connection with someone, he treated them with sincerity, without seeking glory or reward. Li Yuanhong and Zhang Xun experienced different fortunes, but their friendship remained steadfast. Xu Shichang had a teacher-student relationship with him, and Wang Shizhen, Duan Qirui, and Feng Guozhang were all close friends of the family. They shared mutual respect but never sought advancement through him. His advancement was not due to others, and his retreat was not due to others. When the Eastern barbarians committed atrocities and seized Chinese territory, they sought out people of prestige to sway public opinion. Few prominent figures remained untainted. Many high-ranking officials in the new regime were his acquaintances. Tianjin was under the control of the Eastern barbarians, and slander filled the air, harboring filth and accepting corruption. All the evils of the world gathered there. Mr. Yang had been living in Tianjin for a long time, and the foreigners used him as their eyes and ears, but they dared not use any official position to tempt him, nor did anyone try to persuade him with flattering words. He remained aloof from worldly affairs, cultivating his virtue in seclusion. It was not difficult for Mr. Yang to maintain his integrity in times of crisis, but what was difficult was that people expected Mr. Yang to live in a land of nothingness.

Guan Yinzi, between Liezi, said, "The most virtuous man walks in stealth without emptiness, steps on fire without heat, walks above all things without fear. How can he achieve this?" Guan Yinzi said, "It is the preservation of pure Qi, not the realm of wisdom, skill, courage, and decisiveness. He will reside in the deepest depths and hide in the realm of the beginningless, wandering in the realm where all things end and begin, unifying his nature, nourishing his Qi, embracing his virtue, to understand the creation of things. If he is like this, his heavenly protection is complete, and his spirit is unwavering, so nothing can harm him." Observing Mr. Yang's experience of extreme vicissitudes and his transcendence beyond the realm of appearances, facing danger as if it were flat ground, acting as if nothing had happened, is this not what is meant by embracing his virtue to understand the creation of things, so nothing can harm him? This is truly the so-called virtuous man of ancient times, encountering the end and beginning of all things. For thousands of years, he will be one with the world. His virtue is like the Huai River, flowing endlessly. Therefore, his life is not lacking, so why should I praise him to pray for longevity?

### Sheep Herd

— Lu Yang

The hunting dogs are speeding across the sandy hills of the wilderness; they no longer need to be overly alert and wary, as they do in the mountains, guarding the newborn lambs. In groups of three or five, they frantically sniff at tree trunks and grass roots, suddenly darting off like arrows to pounce on flocks of sparrows pecking at manure piles; startled, the sparrows fly away, and the dogs instinctively bark loudly at the sky a few times, the sound reverberating in this boundless space, full of wildness in its clarity. Then, wagging their hairy, thick tails, they scurry back into the ranks of the sheep herd. How much they love their homeland! They have been running around every alley in Zhuangzi since they were young.

The peasant women, carrying their children, run out, naggingly asking how many lambs their sheep have given birth to, whether any have been snatched away by evil birds. The shepherds respond warmly and tactfully, while the cowherds with sickles stuck in their waists chuckle on the side.

Now, the shepherds are beginning to work as woodcutters or plasterers; the adult shepherds, bundled in thick furs, their wrinkled faces ravaged by wind and sand reddened by old wine, slip into the gambling dens of the villages. The sheep herd has changed masters, and at sunrise and sunset, shepherdesses drive the sheep herd out of and into the village.

The shepherdesses' light shadows appear and disappear on the hillsides, in the fields, and on the sand dunes; the sheep herd lies docilely, wandering; the hunting dogs still race around; even though the wild wind is so strong, and occasionally crystal-clear snowflakes swirl.

In winter, the sheep herd is driven back to the village from the mountains, returning to the owners' thatched sheds and fences, spending this period of wind, snow, hardship, and cold.

Farmers compete to treat the shepherds well, hoping that the sheep herd will "lie in the field" on their own land; because in places where the sheep herd lingers for three or five days, there will naturally be rich and fresh fertilizer left behind, and won't there be a better harvest next year?

The wind and snow become more and more cruel with each passing day, but the wool on the sheep becomes denser and thicker, which is the shepherds' gambling capital. Next spring, when the flowers bloom, they should gather together and go to the mountains to "cut wild grass," another thrilling and magnificent journey!

### Brief History of Musicians

— Mozart

A German, one of the "Vienna Trio," an unprecedentedly amazing prodigy in the music world. His works are delicate and touching, light and gentle. He wrote a great deal throughout his life, making particular contributions to opera and instrumental music. His life was unusually short, dying at the age of only thirty-five. Born in 1756, died in 1791. ·Sky·

### Lily

— by Schmanski, translated by Liu Ling

Life is like a pasture. It has all sorts of colors, and many flowers grow on it. Deceit grows after purity, and malice follows kindness, with kindness and love standing side by side in sorrow.

Thus, all sorts of colors drowned me; mystery surrounded me; the shadow of life was revealed from the mirror.

I stood hesitant. Life is very easy to fail in; very difficult to understand; very impossible to succeed in.

And I lost myself in a veil of hope and illusion, in a sea of destruction and ruin, in an ignorant night of shedding meaningless tears.

Truth is revolving between right nourishing and justice.

I walked from one flower to another, and finally I stopped in front of the lily. So I embraced her with both hands, murmuring: "I love you - because I adore everything that possesses beauty."

But the lily answered, "Don't talk to me about love. Life is a perpetual battlefield. You must be calm, hard-hearted, and prepared to cope with that battle. But remember never to disclose your name. Go out and show your face, but your heart must be concealed. Let it stay under a layer of invisible armor. Because only the person who speaks his own name is the defeated, only the person who pours out his heart is a fool. Because you are a hero, and heroes are fighting without a name and without a heart, so don't talk about love or emotion."

A hero did not answer.

And I just revered flowers,

A strange, white flower…

Snow, such transparent snow in a white, boundless black garment. Dangerous white petals, why do you abandon me? The clamor of pure power, why do your fingers draw stars? Why does your burning moon dance a dance of desire on my heart?

Blindness in white.

The wheel of the earth shattered in mid-flight; my magical mouth rules the world; my body is power, intelligence is my gaze - only the moon no longer turns. And on the crystal orbit, my power of the night's work, the same energy that originally created the world, finally disintegrates, pushing itself into destruction with its own destructive power; ambition with the mask of death parades high in the treasury.

"No," I shouted, "unless the rain ceaselessly cries to the unfortunate ocean, do not force me to accept ambition."

But the white petals burned my eyes; their pure roots pierced my skin, and the world still existed, still to live for many centuries.

"Will I have power in the future?" I asked.

A flame arose.

"And will I become omnipotent?"

And the flame gradually grew larger.

"What's going on?" I asked softly,

At the same time, the flame engulfed me.

Finally, it turned dark, and the lily withered.

### Postscript to the Reissue of "New Acting Manual"

— Tian Qin

This booklet was being translated during a period of continuous enemy bombing. It accompanied the translator through countless air raid alerts and shelters, finally able to be published in Guilin, the cultural city of the rear, before the Xianggui Campaign.

I remember that before publication, Brother Jinglu sent a letter to solicit my opinion on the title. Because I translated the original word for word as New Acting Manual. Brother Jinglu thought that this name seemed a bit stiff, so he wrote several names in the letter, asking me to choose. At this moment, I still vaguely remember one or two of them, such as Twelve Lectures on the Art of Drama, Actor's Handbook... At the time, I also had my prejudices, thinking that the former was too academic, but I was very satisfied with the latter, so I wrote back to decide to change it to "Actor's Handbook." Soon, Brother Jinglu discovered that "Actor's Handbook" was used first by Mr. Du Xuan's translation, so he still adopted the translator's original translation name.

After the book was published, it was still during the Anti-Japanese War, so it could only be sold in the southwest. Now that victory has been achieved for many years, the translator eagerly wants to reprint it, hoping to widely teach drama workers all over the country. Coincidentally, when I boarded the Minquan Wheel eastward in November, I stopped in Hankou for five hours. When I went ashore to visit Brother Jinglu on Jiaotong Road and talked about the reprint, Brother Jinglu expressed his approval. Because the type of my humble translation was spared during the Xianggui retreat (Note: Shanghai Magazine Company lost a lot of type during the Xianggui retreat). Otherwise, it would be extremely difficult to reprint recently.

After considering each other, we decided to change the translation name from "New Acting Manual" to "Actor's Handbook." Before the translator came to Suzhou on the ninth, he received a letter from Brother Jinglu in Nanjing urging him to send the original book and the reprint postscript, so while enjoying the scenery of Jiangnan, he specially drafted the postscript to explain the reasons for the name change, to commemorate the reprint.

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 126

— Ye Jingfeng

"You may not be happy with what I'm saying, and you may think I'm being too harsh on you, but in my sacred duty, I can only do this. I hope you can forgive me. As for the second point, I can answer you clearly: Your actions are your freedom, and I can't interfere. In other words, you can do whatever you want. But I have to state in advance that I consider myself a person who is more rational than emotional. I am very grateful for your kindness to me, but you will have to bear the responsibility for the consequences. I can't be any clearer than that..."

"One more thing, I have now decided to take back my question!... Because I asked it too clumsily, too bluntly, and too embarrassingly for you... Other than that, I hope our conversation will come to an end for now. This is just a change in my thinking, and it is not influenced by you in the slightest. You don't have to worry about it. One last sentence: If possible, I plan to go back to the mainland tomorrow!"

Pingzi did not transcend the gentleness and absolute obedience of Japanese women. She was also more intelligent than the average person, knowing about Tsurumi's thoughts and dramatic changes. Therefore, she respected Tsurumi's opinions and did not drag out the question and conversation, knowing that it would be a waste of time. Five minutes later, this beach and the half-moon restored the tranquility of nature, erasing the colors of human intrigue, a very discordant stain.

Half an hour later, a medium-sized sports car sped along the highway from Matsushima to Tokyo, driven by the wild boar, with Tsurumi sitting beside him. In order to avoid unexpected troubles from several hostile groups, the two of them put on some simple disguises, making it impossible to recognize their true faces for a while.

In the car, Tsurumi carefully examined the various reports that the wild boar brought him, using a specially installed small electric light. What he paid most attention to, of course, was the dramatic change in the situation at Changxing Store, and the matter of Yaoqun and Xiaokaolu. - From participating in the Tong Dian Uprising to his disappearance -. These two things, of course, stirred up no small amount of agitation in his thoughts and emotions. On these two reports, he drafted the ways to deal with them, wrote notes, and asked the wild boar to hand them over to No. 012, the person in charge of the Tokyo organization, to handle them according to the instructions. (The way to handle it has already been explained in the secret telegram Yue Jun received in the previous article, so it is not repeated here).

The report included a telegram from the mainland headquarters, ordering Tsurumi to return to Shenyang as soon as possible, because the intelligence agencies in Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other places in China need to be reorganized due to military developments and deployments. The order was forwarded by the Internal General Staff Headquarters. The director of the General Staff Headquarters' telecommunications department wrote on the order, "Order the officer to reply by telegram quickly and take action as soon as possible."

The most exciting thing in the report for Tsurumi was that someone in his Tokyo secret organization had accurately found out where the "Seven Sealed Letters" were stored and was already preparing for inside cooperation. The report only contained a few sentences written in secret language. As for who was in charge of the search, how they prepared for inside cooperation, and other details, he could only ask the wild boar.

"Who found the storage warehouse for the 'goods'?" Tsurumi asked with an excited smile. "Goods" of course refers to the "Seven Sealed Letters."

### Never Old

— Shao Fu

Mr. Zhang Boling returned from overseas yesterday. This never-old old man, when we think of his famous saying "Go to the road with the greatest resistance," which he practiced himself, we cannot help but feel respectful.

Mr. Boling has been engaged in education all his life, forty years as one day. Nankai has made contributions to the nation and the country, which is an undeniable fact. If he had still been working in the naval field until now, the impact he would have produced would probably not exceed his achievements in presiding over Nankai!

Before the victory in Hankou, in Chongqing, and in the National Political Council, I often heard Mr. Zhang speaking on the podium. His low voice explained his age, but few people who heard his voice were not moved. But he never admitted to being old. Unless he fell asleep, he never missed a meeting of the National Political Council and never interrupted the handling of Nankai's affairs.

What was most worrying was Mr. Zhang's serious illness between the spring and summer of last year. Everyone was concerned and wished him a speedy recovery. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also personally visited him. Sure enough, he recovered soon after. This time he returned from overseas recuperation, I think his health is even better, and his work will be even more vigorous.

This is the best standard, explaining the following four things to us from Mr. Zhang's life and behavior:

(1) Perseverance

(2) Eternal Youth

(3) Fearlessness of Difficulty

(4) Planned Career

If we can have the above conditions in life, what can't be done? Naturally, we will be successful in everything.

### Mobile Cinema

— Jin Danshu

"Please ship a mobile cinema with a capacity of 1,200 guests immediately."

When we see this note, we will definitely feel a little embarrassed, but in a few years, these order forms will fly around like snowflakes. Now in California, USA, someone is designing a mobile cinema palace that can accommodate 1,200 viewers.

The equipment inside this mobile cinema is all manufactured according to standard sizes, so the same equipment can be disassembled and assembled freely, like the various parts in a jeep. These detachable equipment include roof truss structure, roof, panel, ceiling, floor, seats, lighting, lead pipe and interior decoration. In the planned plan, equipment that can broadcast wireless radio will be installed, so that exciting scenes such as horse racing and baseball can be unfolded in front of the audience.

### A Mobile Cinema Illustration

The only requirement is a simple reinforced concrete foundation. Then, in a very short period, an ordinary open space is transformed into a cinema palace equipped with the latest sound, light, and seating facilities from Hollywood.

The planned mobile cinemas will have seating for 1,200, as well as two other sizes with 800 and 1,000 seats respectively. The entire structure is made of stainless steel, while the internal panels are composed of two layers of corrugated metal sheets. The walls, regardless of height or width, are mainly composed of asbestos and gypsum, and have been proven absolutely safe after multiple fire tests. The floors, walls, roof, and flat ceiling are all connected with special screws, making them resistant to fire and earthquakes, while the internal air conditioning is excellent.

The interior is very spacious, making it both comfortable and easy to clean. The seat cushions are made of sponge-like rubber (spring cushions are clearly outdated), making them wide and comfortable. The corridor walls are entirely made of streamlined metal sheets. Small lights are installed in the aisles between seats, completely under the floor, saving space,不易損壞,便捷美觀.

If you find the walls not beautiful enough, you can order ready-made curtains, and a set of beautifully patterned curtains will be delivered quickly, ready for installation.

In Shanghai today, where materials and labor costs are incredibly high, a mobile cinema that can be shipped immediately is truly the most cost-effective option. A mobile cinema with 1,000 seats is priced at US$70,000, while building a cinema in the United States with the same capacity would cost US$150,000.

Needless to say, this new invention is a great help to smaller towns with sparse populations, so people who crave to see movies no longer have to travel long distances. After being shown in one place for a few days or months, this mobile cinema can easily complete its relocation.

The mobile cinemas currently being designed can be conveniently packaged, taking up very little space, and can be transported by ships, railways, or three or four ordinary trucks.

According to expert estimates, this "rare commodity" has a wide world market, especially in South American countries, China, and the Soviet Union. It is estimated that 30,000 to 40,000 units can be sold in each location. After two years of painstaking research, the planned mobile cinema now has broad adaptability, and can easily adapt to environments from the cold of Siberia to the hot and humid equatorial regions.

According to a recent study by the National Theatre Corporation of America, this mobile cinema may have the latest sound and projection equipment. As for wireless facsimile movies, they have also entered the final stage of experimentation, requiring only the installation of an antenna.

### High-Interest Loans in the "Lower Class Society"

— Zhang Ji

Not far from North Sichuan Road, there is a small town. This is where lower-class compatriots are concentrated. Most of them are rickshaw pullers and dockworkers. They live in thatched huts. But there are also two *shikumen* alleyways, where the so-called more advanced people live. This place is truly "small but complete," with a small street containing barbershops, pharmacies, pawnshops, small theaters, and snack shops, everything one would need. It represents a society in miniature.

Because they cannot make a living in their hometowns and due to job search reasons, a large number of people from northern Jiangsu have come to Shanghai. Because many relatives and friends are concentrated here, many thatched huts have been added to this small town out of thin air. Those who escaped of course have no money, so many high-interest loans have emerged. They dare to use high-interest loans because they can immediately rent a rickshaw or carriage after borrowing money, and can earn ten to twenty thousand a day, and can slowly pay it off.

Speaking of high-interest loans here, it is a bit scary. Interest is calculated on a daily basis. A polite one calculates three percent interest a day, that is, borrowing 10,000 yuan has a daily interest of 300 yuan. If calculated on a monthly basis, borrowing 10,000 yuan requires paying 19,000 yuan at the end of the month. If you need it urgently, you have to pay five percent interest per day. There is also a type of interest that is paid daily, with a monthly interest of fifty percent. For example, if you borrow 20,000 yuan, you pay 1,000 yuan a day, for a total of 30,000 yuan in a month. Both principal and interest are cleared. The borrower pays 1,000 yuan a day, feeling that the burden is not heavy, while the lender has dozens of debtors, and the money received every day can be lent out again, so it grows more and more.

Most of the lenders are local "bullies," but they are not all enjoying the benefits without working for them. Their lending conditions are:

1. Have a job,
2. Have a place to live,
3. Have a wife and children.

When lending money, the debtor seeks them out. When collecting money, the lender must come in person, because the lender knows the debtor's temperament. They like to delay for three or five days. The first time when negotiating, the other party asks for a delay of one or two days, which can be accommodated. But the second time they still don't pay, the creditor shows their skills, rolls up their sleeves, pulls the top button of the traditional Chinese jacket backward, and starts cursing, taking anything they see. The other party will obediently take out the money. More skilled lenders, after offending the debtor, will try to put on a clown face to make the other party laugh, so that the other party will not bear a grudge and not come to borrow money next time. This may seem unbelievable.

Lenders have all become rich. Of course, there are also cases where both principal and interest are lost, but the amount they lend is as much as 80,000 to 100,000, and as little as 30,000 to 50,000. Nowadays, coolies and rickshaw pullers, as long as they have the strength, can easily earn money. Who would run away for a few tens of thousands of yuan?

Don't look down on rickshaw pullers. Their material enjoyment is sometimes better than those who wear long gowns. One rickshaw puller came to Shanghai penniless a few years ago. Now he has built a bungalow himself and bought a rickshaw, painted shiny white and covered with a new blanket. People are of course happy to ride it, plus he is strong and muscular, so business is booming. When he goes home to rest, he takes off his work clothes, puts on a fur coat, shiny leather shoes, and slicked-back hair. Those who don't know often mistake him for a big boss. He recently married a wife, who was originally an elementary school teacher. Because her monthly income could not make ends meet, she was willing to marry this rickshaw puller who earns more than 50,000 yuan a month.

### Also Talking About Old Ladies Turning into Men

— Lu Shixiong

Reading Mr. Zheng Ji's article "An Old Lady Turning into a Man After Death" in the December 13th issue of this paper, in which the reasons for sexual change are not given a definite explanation, I will now provide a theoretical explanation as follows:

Generally, when a person is born, they have two adrenal glands on their kidneys. Initially, they are very large, occupying one-third of the kidney. As they get older, the adrenal glands shrink instead, with the normal size being one-thirteenth of the kidney.

The adrenal glands are specifically responsible for a person's sexual characteristics, and the two must be of equal size. If one of them suddenly enlarges, then this person will immediately undergo physiological changes. The so-called man turning into a woman, or a woman turning into a man, or having both sexes at the same time, all originate from the enlargement of the adrenal gland.

Chinese people often keep silent about sexual abnormalities, considering it very shameful, usually calling it "strange illness." We sometimes see in the news that the reason for disharmony in marriage and requests for divorce is due to only having the name of husband and wife. This is sexual change or abnormality, such as the common term "stone woman," which has been seen in ancient times. The *Tai Xuan Jing* says: "Wide without a son, a chamber of stone women." Su Dongpo's poem says: "A stone woman has no children, like barren valleys." Between husband and wife, if one party has sexual characteristics like a stone woman or hermaphrodite, not only is there no happiness in life, but there is also no hope for offspring.

The peculiarity of one thing having both sexes is not limited to humans, such as snails and earthworms in the animal kingdom, which are hermaphrodites. In the plant kingdom, such as hazelnuts, male and female flowers grow on the same plant.

The reason for a man turning into a woman or a woman turning into a man is due to one of the two adrenal glands enlarging, as mentioned above. Therefore, simply removing the enlarged one will immediately restore the sexual change. This matter has been clinically tested in British sexually transmitted disease hospitals several years ago and has been proven successful. However, only the enlarged adrenal gland can be removed. If both are removed at the same time, death will occur in less than two days.

The cause of sexual change was discovered by a British doctor, Dr. Broster. He studied the sexual changes in fish, and then progressed to the organization of human physiology, and obtained a definite treatment method.

As for the fact that Mr. Zheng Fan mentioned of "an old lady turning into a man after death," if it is not due to the sudden enlargement of the adrenal gland mentioned above, it is a case of male impersonating a woman and is close to a "hysterical" condition. The so-called "hysterical" is a type of mental illness. Those who suffer from this have a strange personality and are highly imitative. For example, she hopes to have a son, or pretends to be pregnant, or due to years of accumulated thinking, her stomach may even bulge, resembling an "imaginary pregnancy." Regarding "hysterical," a type of imitative mental illness, this theory comes from a medical doctor who studied the meaning of Latin, and he once told the author about it.

When we read about the sadness and pain of eunuchs in the unofficial histories of the palace, it is indeed an inhumane measure. In the rural areas of western Zhejiang, there is a practice of treating roosters in the same way as ancient eunuchs. It is said that after this procedure, the rooster becomes fat and tender.

Chinese people often avoid talking about sexual issues, and are ashamed to mention them. In fact, before the war, the American Sex Education Committee had already drafted nine articles of sexual education guidelines for middle schools, to be shared by parents, teachers, and doctors. European countries such as England and France have also included sex education in national teaching materials.

Gas masks

Yesterday on Nanjing Road, vendors appeared selling American "gas masks," priced at 3,500 yuan each. I believe business must be good, because the New Year is approaching, and many people will definitely buy them as cheap toys for children. Very "profound significance"!

"Worthy of emulation?"

The Guangzhou municipal authorities, due to budget deficits, are reportedly preparing to charge citizens a "bridge toll" for crossing the Pearl River Iron Bridge daily, in order to make up for the deficit. The bridge was destroyed in the war and was only repaired after the victory. Taking from the people and using it for the people is more bearable than other "benevolent policies."

Shanghai's municipal funding has always been in a state of panic. Shanghai also has a Waibaidu Iron Bridge, which seems to have been repainted this summer. We could possibly...

The only exception

Amidst the massive dumping of cheap American goods, all industries in this city are affected, but there is one industry that has never been hit: "Trams remain as crowded as ever."

If the tram company takes back self-management and makes a public offering of shares, I will be the first to join.
