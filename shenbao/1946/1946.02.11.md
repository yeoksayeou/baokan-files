### Government Reorganization: Distribution of Positions - Various Parties Continue to Exchange Opinions; Military Reorganization Conference to be Held in Beijing Mid-Month

[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 10th] It is reported that regarding the distribution of positions in the government reorganization, various parties continue to exchange opinions. Disputes over the membership of the National Government Committee remain intense. The Communists, still claiming the status of the second-largest party, insist on a majority. Within the 20 positions allocated to various parties, factions, and independents, they demand to occupy ten positions. The Democratic League has already echoed this demand. However, the Youth Party adamantly refuses to concede. General observation suggests that the Communist demand is excessively extravagant. If their demand is eventually reduced to seven or eight positions, they may still have hope of maintaining a majority.

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 10th] It is reported that after the successful conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference, the central government, to thoroughly implement military reorganization, has decided to convene a military reorganization conference in Beijing in mid-month. All military officers with the rank of division commander or above will attend. The personnel from this area who are required to attend have already received the order and are preparing to travel there at the appointed time.

[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 10th] When the Political Consultative Conference concluded, Chairman Chiang announced the release of political prisoners. Liao Chengzhi and many others have already been released successively. Another large group of political prisoners are also being actively considered for release soon. Ye Ting, the former commander of the Communist New Fourth Army, engaged in armed separatism and attacked anti-Japanese troops during the emergency of the war, obstructing national law and military discipline, which made it necessary to imprison him. According to reliable sources, Mr. Ye may be released shortly after the current batch of political prisoners. Government officials, military personnel, Kuomintang members, Kuomintang civil servants, and other education, transportation, and business personnel who have been imprisoned by the Communist army in recent years may also be freed in the near future. General Ma Fawu, who was illegally captured by the Communist army several months ago, may be released by Yan'an at the same time as Ye Ting.

Thousands of railway construction engineering technicians have already arrived at various work sites according to the established plan. The required materials, after being pieced together from various sources, are barely sufficient to meet the needs of some key sections at present. The urgent work spirit of the personnel rushing to the designated sections for emergency repairs is like that of firefighters arriving at a fire scene or epidemic doctors at the bedside of patients. He firmly believes that the restoration of domestic railway traffic is truly just around the corner. The people of the country are now eagerly awaiting national unification and the restoration of transportation. The colleagues in the Ministry of Communications share the same sentiment.

In his conversation, Mr. Chen absolutely guaranteed that the Communist side would seek a prompt and proper solution to the Taian food shortage in accordance with the Linyi agreement.

Fighting Over the Title of General Chairman

The meeting had been in preparation for a long time. The people actually responsible for the preparation were Zhang Naiqi, Li Gongji, and others. On the evening of the 9th, it was decided at Zhang Naiqi's place in the Qianchuan Building that the candidates for the presidium of the meeting would be Liu Ye from the Municipal Farmers' Association 　, Tan Zesen from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Zhou Dehou from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wu Renchu from the education circle, Chuan Boqun from the women's circle, and representatives from all walks of life 　　 Hang, Guo Dequan, Zhang Naiqi, Gu Feng, Li Gongpu, Zhang Mian, Li Dequan, Li Senpu, Shi Liang, Shi Fuliang, Huang Cixian, and others, and Guo Moruo, Shao Lizi, Zhou Enlai, Li Zhuchen, Shen Jun　 and others were invited to participate.

At 9:30 am, when the meeting started, Zhang Naiqi of the presidium proposed that Li Dequan be the general chairman, while Zhou Dehou reported at the venue in an expanded voice: The most farmers in our country,提譏with Liu Yeqiao, the representative of the Farmers’ Association, as the general chairman. The people applauded to express their approval, and Liu announced the start of the meeting immediately. When giving his opening remarks, Li Gongpu prevented Liu from speaking because Liu should not serve as the general chairman, and夺 went to Liu's hand's microphone. For a while, the audience　然, and the masses surged onto the podium, the order was disturbed, and they beat each other. Liu Yeqiao and Li Gongpu were both injured in the head, Zhu Qirui in the hand, Shi Fuliang in the leg, and Guo Moruo also suffered a slight injury on his left forehead.

Military Police Maintain Order

At this time, the military police rushed to mediate and protect Shen Jun　. Guo Moruo and others came out of the venue, Li Gongpu and others went to the Municipal Hospital for medical treatment, and Liu Yeqiao also withdrew due to injury, and Zhou De　 acted as chairman to continue the meeting. After several citizens gave speeches, the declaration was passed, and the meeting was adjourned with shouts of slogans. After the meeting, Liu Yeqiao hosted reporters at the Bailing Restaurant and reported on the situation of being beaten, roughly saying: The representatives of the people's groups from the Municipal Farmers, Industry, and Commerce were promoted to the presidium last night. During the meeting this morning, it was unexpected that the members of the Labor Association and the students of Yucai participated in the beating, causing the presidium Li Gongpu and I to be injured. It is really unfortunate. In the past, the Cangbai Memorial Hall has been sabotaged repeatedly, and the truth of the facts can be known from today's disputes. He also said: Citizen Huang Jianhui witnessed Qin Hu and Xie Zhishang being arrested by members of the Labor Association. It can be clearly seen who is trampling on human rights, etc.

Li Gongpu and Guo Moruo Slightly Injured

The reporter then went to the Municipal Hospital to visit Li Gongpu. Li's head was wrapped in gauze, and he had already walked out of the hospital gate. At this time, Luo Longji, Zhou Enlai, and others also rushed to the hospital. Seeing Li coming out, they waited carefully and brought Li back to the hospital. The reporter asked Dr. Shi Liansheng, a doctor at the hospital. He specially signed the certificate as follows: "Patient Li Gongpu Hospital Number (8184), Jiangsu native, male, 46 years old, found to have a scalp laceration, about two centimeters long, this is." According to Yin Gongzhen, the director of affairs at the hospital, Guo Moruo, Shi Fuliang, and four injured people from the Labor Association also went to the hospital for examination and fluoroscopy. Because they were slightly injured, they all left the hospital after being treated.

Li Dequan Hosted Reporters Yesterday

He first stated: The mass meeting in the capital to celebrate the success of the Political Consultative Conference was prepared by more than 20 groups in this city and spent 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. It was unexpected that it was disrupted by rioters at the Xiaochangkou meeting today, and Mr. Li Gongpu, Guo Moruo, Shi Fuliang, and other gentlemen were injured. The preparatory committee of the meeting had proposed Mr. Zhang Naiqi as the general chairman, but Liu Yeqiao took over as the chairman at today's meeting.

Zhang Naiqi and Others Report on the Process

Regarding the process of the meeting, I would now like to invite the executives of the association and Mr. Zhang Naiqi to report separately. After the executives of the meeting reported on the preparation process, Zhang Naiqi continued: I would like to correct Mr. Li Dequan’s report, that the preparatory committee of the meeting had nominated people as the general chairman. I am not the general chairman, but one of the members of the presidium who was scheduled to speak first. The association had previously invited all walks of life in the capital to participate, but at about 10:00 pm last night, representatives from several groups such as the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Municipal Education Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce came to our residence and held a public letter requesting to join the meeting. I believe that since this is a joint celebration of all walks of life in the capital, then all the people of the capital can participate. Unexpectedly, several rioters suddenly came to the meeting this morning, stepped onto the podium, occupied the broadcast device, and elected Liu Yeqiao, the representative of the Municipal Farmers' Association, as the chairman. Mr. Li Gongpu was injured when he went forward to stop him, because the chairman was elected by the preparatory committee and could not be elected temporarily, causing a disturbance, etc. After Zhang finished his inquiry, they unanimously advocated to immediately express condolences to those who were injured today.

### First Time in Eight Years: Nationwide Elections Held in the Soviet Union; Stalin Delivered a Radio Address the Night Before, Saying Equal Distribution of Markets Can Avert War

[United Press, Moscow, 10th] Soviet citizens today held their first elections in eight years to elect representatives to the Supreme Soviet. Citizens over the age of 18 have the right to vote. Voting in Moscow began at 6:00 AM. Although the temperature was below freezing, the polling places were crowded. Until the midnight deadline, the crowds were still packed. The only way to oppose the election of Communist Party candidates is to submit a blank ballot. In the 1937 election, there were only 632,000 votes against out of a total of 100 million votes.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 9th] The Soviet Union will hold nationwide elections on the 10th. The elections are not limited to Soviet territory. Military personnel and civilians overseas, as well as passengers on merchant ships on the high seas, have the opportunity to vote. Soviet occupation forces in enemy territory have the privilege of electing one representative for every 100,000 voters, or one representative for every 300,000 people. Special polling districts are set up in the far north, Siberia, and mountainous areas. Passengers on trains can also vote if they can prove their right to vote.

[Reuters, London, 10th] Marshal Stalin delivered an election eve speech in Moscow last night, his first broadcast since his victory speech on Japan's unconditional surrender on September 2 of last year. When the speaker invited Stalin to speak, applause thundered for eight minutes. Stalin said, "War is not an accidental occurrence, but is caused by inevitable economic forces and is the result of world trends. Groups of capitalist countries believe that they are not as fortunate as other countries in terms of raw materials and attempt to change their position by force, resulting in war. The Soviet Union's participation greatly strengthened the anti-fascist and liberating nature of the war. As far as we are concerned, this was the most brutal war in our history, but it was also a test of our national strength. Marxists have repeatedly declared that the capitalist system of the world economy contains aggression and armed conflict, and now the development of world capitalism is not proceeding smoothly, but is experiencing various crises and disasters. In fact, the inequality between capitalist countries is constantly attempting to change the situation by force to benefit themselves. As a result, the capitalist world is divided into opposing camps and engaged in war. If it were possible to divide export markets equally between countries, then war tragedies might be avoided. But this cannot be implemented in the current state of the world economy under capitalism. Therefore, the capitalist system of the world economy creates a situation that prompted the outbreak of World War I. World War II also occurred due to the second crisis within the capitalist system."

### British Representative Protests Seriously Regarding Sending a Delegation to Investigate the East Indies Incident; Soviet Side Says the East Indies Will Be the Spark for World War III; No Results After Yesterday's Council Discussion

[Our Dispatch] London, 10th Broadcast: The Security Council discussed the issue of British troops staying in Indonesia this afternoon, with no results. The discussion was rescheduled for tomorrow afternoon. Before the adjournment, the Dutch Foreign Minister gave a speech, saying that the presence of British troops in Indonesia did not endanger peace.

[Our Dispatch] London, 10th Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a long speech in the Security Council today, expressing a serious protest against a certain major power placing the issue of British troops staying in Indonesia on the agenda. It is claimed that the representative of a certain major power cannot prove it with facts and insists on proposing to send a delegation to Indonesia for inspection, which is inappropriate. The presence of British troops in Indonesia is to assist the Dutch army in accepting the surrender of the Japanese army. Now, a certain representative insists that British troops endanger peace, which is improper. As for the Soviet representative Vyshinsky's statement that since the British side has sent Kerr to Indonesia, other countries can also take the same measures, Bevin replied: Kerr's visit to Indonesia is not for negotiation, but only for political advisory work. Regarding the Ukrainian representative's accusation that British troops are using Japanese soldiers to fight in Indonesia, Bevin said: "Only once have a small number of Japanese soldiers been used as guards, because at that time, many women, children, and British soldiers were in danger." Bevin accused Ukraine of not making unfounded attacks without consulting or inquiring with the British government beforehand.

[United Press, London, 10th] At today's meeting of the United Nations Security Council, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky said in his speech that the East Indian dispute is the spark for World War III. The Council should send a committee to investigate on the ground, consisting of representatives from China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands. Vyshinsky spoke for two hours, and Ukraine seconded the motion.

The mission of this trip and the topics to be discussed with the President are unknown.

### Sex Hormones Have Miraculous Effects in Treating Cancer

[United Press, New York, 9th] The "Freedom" magazine published an article by Dr. Haming, saying that sex hormones have proven to be the only effective chemical weapons for treating cancer. Male and female sex hormones seem to have mutually hostile tendencies in the human body. If cancer occurs on the sex organs, treatment with hormones is particularly effective. For example, breast cancer in women can cause serious damage because the female hormones in the body stimulate the growth of the breast, seemingly also stimulating the growth of cancer with the same force. But if male hormones are injected, they seem to be able to counteract the effect of female hormones, delaying the growth of cancer. Similarly, when a man suffers from cancer in the accessory sex organ prostate gland, the secretions of the man's testicles will also promote the growth of cancer. At this time, using female hormones can stop it. Although this treatment cannot eradicate the disease, it does have the power to prolong life and relieve infinite suffering.

### Dutch Government Issues Statement Wishing to Set Up East Indies Republic, Drafting Constitution Respecting Its Basic Rights; Dutch-Indonesian Negotiations Began Yesterday

[Reuters, The Hague, 10th] The Dutch government issued a statement today stating that the Dutch government's view is that the people of Indonesia should be able to freely determine their political destiny. The Dutch government is deeply aware of its responsibilities, so it believes that its task is to do its best within its authority to create and realize a situation as soon as possible that allows for the adoption of decision-making methods and guarantees its international recognition, so as to comply with Article 73 of the United Nations Charter. The Dutch government intends to establish an Indonesian Republic within the framework of the Dutch Empire.

[United Press, Batavia, 10th] Dutch-Indonesian Deputy Governor-General Van Mook met with Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir today to discuss the issue of Indonesian autonomy. The meeting will be held in the British Embassy, ​​with only Van and Sjahrir as representatives, and the British Kerr. Dutch sources said that Van Mook will present a new plan to Sjahrir.

### Egyptian Students Demonstrate Against the British

### Plastic False Eyes Can Be Compared to Real Eyes

[Reuters, London, 10th] Thousands of British military and civilians who lost their sight during the war have been fitted with lifelike plastic eyes that can move with muscle contractions and even blink. These artificial eyes were originally a secret of the German scientific community, but the artificial eyes created by British scientists during the war have become even more advanced than those of the Germans. Plastic eyes are lighter and less reflective than the glass eyes previously used, and there is no danger of shattering.

### Floods in the Rhine Region of Germany, Lowlands Flooded, Transportation Cut Off

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 9th] After the floods in the Rhine region, the situation in western Germany is serious. Food reserves are about to run out, and the situation is precarious. Railway traffic on the Rhine has been cut off. Coal in the Ruhr region cannot be transported to France, and traffic between the British and American occupation zones has also been blocked. The Westerwald is currently flooded, and residents have taken refuge in the highlands.

British Disaster

[Reuters, London, 10th] Southern England and the Midlands have been hit by the most severe storms in half a century, with wind speeds of around 70 miles per hour. Where the strong winds passed, huge trees were uprooted, many houses were destroyed, and many fields and villages were flooded. Although the wind has subsided slightly, heavy rain is still expected to continue. Floods have also occurred in Germany and the Netherlands. The Rhine River has overflowed, and the Mouna sluice gates have been opened to prevent flooding.

### The Phenomenon of Blasting in the Northern Crown Constellation Helps Atomic Energy Research

[Central News Agency, New York, 10th Dispatch] The Wisconsin Astronomical Observatory in the United States discovered today that the atomic explosion that occurred during the explosion of the Northern Crown Constellation was millions of times more violent than the atomic bomb that hit Japan. Astronomers around the world have been actively observing this stellar phenomenon, as this phenomenon may be of value for atomic research. According to the observatory's report, the brightness of this constellation during the explosion was a thousand times brighter than it was two weeks ago, so it may be a reborn nova. A nova is a star whose luminosity suddenly increases and emits a huge amount of energy, and then returns to a relatively stable state. Astronomers believe that this explosion is basically the same as the principle of atomic energy application. Observations of this nova may be extremely important for the interpretation of stars and contribute to atomic energy research.

### The Light of the Atomic Bomb Also Has Destructive Power

[Reuters, Minden (Germany), 10th] Professor Huen, a German atomic expert, told visiting journalists yesterday that the pressure of the light emitted when an atomic bomb explodes is extremely great and can even destroy walls. Few people know that pressure is generated when light reflects on solids. If it is ordinary light, this kind of pressure has little relevance, but the light emitted when an atomic bomb explodes is so strong that it has significant destructive power. The heat generated by absorption can ignite any non-flammable material. Professor Huen won the 1939 Nobel Prize for discovering the secret of atomic fission, but under the Nazi regime, Germans were not allowed to accept the Nobel Prize.

### Tragedy of a Love Triangle; A Chinese Immigrant in Paris Commits Suicide

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] A love triangle tragedy occurred here. It was caused by a French worker, Garot, and a Chinese immigrant, Sang Lu Zhi (transliteration), both falling in love with a French woman. A few days ago, the police found Garot murdered and immediately continued the investigation. Finally, Sang's body was found hanged. It is speculated that Sang committed suicide out of fear of punishment after murdering Garot.

### Local Dispatches

Kunshan: The 21st Army Arrives in Kunshan to Take Over Defense

Since the 71st Army of the National Army has been stationed in Kunshan, the military and civilians have had a harmonious relationship. Now, upon orders, they are moving to Suzhou. On the morning of the 7th, officers led their respective units and soldiers, and marched along the highway to Suzhou. The 21st Army, which came to Kunshan to take over the defense, also arrived in Kunshan by train from Danyang at 3:30 p.m. on the 7th, led by Chief of Staff Major General Li Qianrong with all officers and soldiers.

Wuxi: Grain Stocks Are Not Abundant

Wuxi is a major grain center in Jiangsu Province. Produce from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces are transported to Wuxi for distribution. Fluctuations in the local market price can affect other regions. Grain prices rose at the end of last year, and since the new year, the market trend has been upward, and it is feared that prices will not fall. This is because the existing reserves in Jin County are not abundant. At the end of last year, apart from some merchants having some stocks, the amount of inventory was significantly different compared to the previous year.

Zhenjiang: Jiangsu Province Abolishes County Loan Measures

Jiangsu Province has suffered devastation from the enemy and puppet regime, and the finances of various counties have reached a critical point. Moreover, due to the financial restructuring by the provincial government, the provincial treasury has no revenue to allocate, and subsidies from the central government are slow to arrive. In the midst of despair, temporary loan measures were provisionally stipulated and promulgated to various counties and cities. This was entirely a temporary expedient. After various counties and cities followed the measures, they often faced difficulties in finding loan targets and obtaining loans easily. Therefore, if execution is not careful, it will degenerate into factionalism, which is easily criticized by society. The provincial government, aware of this, has, while ordering various counties and cities to earnestly reorganize reasonable taxes and thoroughly clear public funds and public property, also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to quickly allocate subsidies. So far, only 60 million yuan has been allocated, which, when distributed among the 63 counties and cities, is a drop in the bucket and far from meeting actual needs. The provincial government specially sent Finance Director Dong Che to Nanjing the other day to negotiate urgently with the Ministry of Finance. Before the allocation of funds to various localities is finalized, they requested a monthly loan of at least 400 million yuan to enrich the finances of the counties and cities. It is said that the Ministry of Finance authorities have agreed, and the provincial government has decided that once the funds are allocated, they will be immediately distributed to various counties, and the previously established temporary loan measures will be abolished, and further borrowing will be strictly prohibited. At the same time, a detailed investigation will be conducted into the items and amounts of past loans in various counties and cities, so that debts can be repaid in installments when the county treasuries are replenished.

Jiangsu Establishes Relief Stations

Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong, considering that the people of various counties in northern Jiangsu, left behind after the calamities, are displaced and homeless, has previously allocated funds to order the Winter Relief Association to organize relief efforts in Xuzhou, Yangzhou, and Zhenjiang. Chairman Wang, in view of the increasing numbers of refugees gathered in Yangzhou, Xuzhou, Haizhou, and Nantong, crying out for food, has specially sent a letter to Director Lu Yuke of the Jiangsu-Ning Relief Branch, earnestly pleading for the establishment of relief branch stations in Yangzhou, Haizhou, Xuzhou, and Nantong, transporting large quantities of food, clothing, and medicine for distribution, so that the refugees can barely survive.

### A Great Project in a World of Utmost Happiness: The Mystery of the American Grand Dam: A Profound Impression After Inspecting TVA: Special Dispatch by Air: Professor Hu Huanyong, from New York

With the assistance of the U.S. government, our country has already begun planning the world's largest Yangtze River water conservancy project, the details of which were previously published on page 3 of this newspaper on the 27th of last month. This time, Professor Hu of Central University sent this article from the U.S., introducing the detailed content of TVA. We are publishing it urgently for the reference of our countrymen. Professor Hu is a leading geography expert in the country. Since being sent to the United States to study in October of last year, he has deeply researched geography and geographical education, and his gains have been particularly rich, all of which came from on-site inspections and are worth broadcasting to the country. (Editor)

Roosevelt's Creation: TVA, a Paradise on Earth

At the end of December last year, the Association of American Geographers held a meeting in Knoxville, Tennessee, in the southern United States. I was invited to participate, taking the opportunity to meet most of the American geographers, and to raise the issue of China's population for discussion with American experts. What was especially rare was the on-site inspection of TVA. The so-called regional design and regional development, TVA has become a world-renowned paradise. The full name of TVA, translated into Chinese, is the "Tennessee Valley Authority." It was established in 1933 by former U.S. President Roosevelt and is one of the important facilities for developing localities under his New Deal. After only twelve years, it has already achieved great success, benefiting the country and society. The so-called ideal country, the so-called Utopia, has indeed become a reality here.

The Tennessee River is a tributary of the Ohio River, which is a tributary of the Mississippi River. It is 1,000 kilometers long and flows through seven states, with a drainage area of 100,000 square kilometers, about the size of Zhejiang Province in our country. The total population of the entire area is only 4.5 million, only a quarter of the population of Zhejiang Province. The valley is mostly mountainous, and the rainfall is also very heavy, about 1,300 mm per year. Therefore, not only is the soil easily eroded by rain, but there are also frequent floods. In the past, the local economy was very poor.

Nine Major Dams on the Main Stream, Thirteen Dams Built on Tributaries

What is the Tennessee River Valley like now? Nine large dams have been built on the main stream and thirteen dams have been built on the tributaries, for a total of twenty-two dams. These dams (1) control floods. Now, not only is the Tennessee River no longer plagued by floods, but the floods on the Mississippi River have also been greatly reduced. (2) They facilitate navigation. Each dam on the main stream is equipped with a ship lock. Although the water levels upstream and downstream are different, ships with a draft of nine feet can pass all year round. The water level difference between the upper and lower reaches of the Tennessee River is 500 feet. Without ship lock facilities, navigation would be almost impossible. (3) They generate electricity. This is the core work of TVA. Currently, the power generation capacity of all dams in the area is 2.5 million kilowatts, which, together with thermal power generation, totals 3.2 million kilowatts. Last year, a total of 32 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity was generated. Each kilowatt-hour is equivalent to ten hours of work for one person. The annual electricity in this area is equivalent to the work efficiency of ten million people.

Atomic Bomb Factory: TVA Supplies Electricity

About 60% of this electricity is used for factories. The most important of these are the atomic bomb factory, the American Aluminum Company, and other metal factories. These are the most important national defense industries during the war, and also the important facilities that determined the outcome of this war. In addition, fertilizer plants are the most important foundation for improving agriculture inside and outside the area. Currently, there are about 600,000 electricity users inside and outside the area. This is an important hub for rural electrification. The average electricity price is only a little over one cent per kilowatt-hour. Electricity consumption by the public is organized through cooperative associations.

Since its establishment, TVA has used a total of 700 million U.S. dollars from the national treasury, of which about 65% was used for power generation equipment. Now, the annual revenue from electricity sales is 40 million U.S. dollars. After deducting 20 million U.S. dollars in expenses, the net surplus is 20 million U.S. dollars. It is estimated that the entire start-up costs can be fully repaid within thirty years, while the power generation equipment will still exist. The above is an introduction to the general situation of TVA.

According to the above, it seems that the spirit of TVA is water conservancy, electricity, and economy, but in reality, it is not so simple. TVA does things in the form of a company, not a government office. However, TVA's work is connected to and cooperated with all departments of the federal government, as well as state governments and township offices, with a thousand strands, meeting needs from all directions. This is truly the highest expression of the American democratic spirit.

Secondly, TVA's work is not only about flood control, power generation, and fertilizer production. There is also educational work, research work, health work, and even tourism management, with a wide variety of activities, everything is available.

The highest administrative body of TVA is a board of three directors, appointed by the U.S. President. Internally, the appointment and administration of personnel is completely free, but the administrative policy is determined by Congress, and a work report is submitted to Congress every year. Its connection with other agencies is based on contractual relationships, and it is not constrained by any party, nor does it infringe on the authority of any party.

American Democratic Spirit: TVA's Utmost Expression

From this point of view, TVA is not only an engineering technology or commercial economic organization, but also a political organization and social institution. In the past, it was an experimental site for local development, but now it has become a paradise on earth. It is said that in the past ten years, more than ten million people from all over the world have come to visit.

We in China are now about to begin building YVA, building the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River. In terms of scale, it is even greater than TVA. The situation of our Yellow River is similar to that of the Tennessee River in the past, but the disasters are even more severe than those of the Tennessee River. When will our HVA begin to be organized?

When we learn from TVA, we not only learn from its engineering technology, hydropower economy, but more importantly, we learn from their working spirit and cooperative spirit. It is said that there are particularly many compatriots from China who visit TVA. We hope that the achievements and spirit of TVA can be effectively realized in China. I am still abroad, but I have boundless expectations for our YVA, HVA, and even the entire China. China has very good opportunities in terms of climate and geography. What is lacking is harmony. As long as people do their best and make the most of the land, TVA's operation is our best example. I hope we can all work hard. (Broadcast manuscript to the country)

### The "Stubborn" Elements of Northern Jiangsu

Editor:

Your newspaper has repeatedly published articles disclosing the true situation in northern Jiangsu. It is fortunate that there is still such a newspaper in Shanghai that has not forgotten our fellow countrymen in the corner of northern Jiangsu. We are sincerely grateful. To be honest, what we see in Shanghai, in newspapers and magazines, regarding the so-called "Liberated Areas" are all works by writers who ignore the facts and write with their eyes closed. Especially in one or two magazines, they often portray the so-called "Liberated Areas" as being incredibly advanced, saying that the cornerstone of true democracy has been laid there, and that the army there is truly the people's armed force. When we see these propagandistic (the authors of course say they are factual) articles, we can only swallow our anger. Because they are directly praising the "Liberated Areas," indirectly implying that we, the thousands upon thousands of people who have fled from the "Liberated Areas," are crazy and deserve to starve and freeze. Alas! These writers, opening their mouths, all say they are speaking for the people, taking it as their responsibility. Why do they produce such deceptive texts? Is this the expression of freedom of speech? I don't need to say more about the true situation in the "Liberated Areas" here. In Shanghai, because it is relatively isolated from northern Jiangsu, and the standard of living is higher than in other places, there are still few refugees who have fled here, and it is not easy to see the true situation of the refugees. However, I only hope that these writers will go to Zhenjiang and Yangzhou to take a look. There are countless refugees there, old and young, men and women, wandering the streets, with no fixed abode or food, and receiving no comfort at the same time. Why are they willing to stay in this "unfree, undemocratic" circle and suffer, rather than go to the "democratic and free" "Liberated Areas" to live a stable life? I think, in the eyes of these writers, those who do not know will be called "stubborn," and they will certainly say that they are "anti-democratic special agents" who have been ordered to come and damage the reputation of the "Liberated Areas." I am extremely angry and will not say more. Sincerely, Reader Wang Zhun (February 4)

Editorial

### Hopes for the Future of Politics

For the past eight or nine years, the entire nation's soldiers and civilians have shed sweat and blood, swallowing tears and suppressing grief in pursuit of driving out the Japanese invaders and, after their expulsion, building a prosperous and happy new China. We want to safeguard the country, we want to protect the rights of the people, and we want to raise the people's living standards. Now that the enemy has surrendered, our goal of nation-building still seems to be within reach, yet still unattainable. Regarding international relations, although world peace is highly probable, covert and overt struggles are inevitable, leaving no room for naive optimism. Domestically, while the danger of internal strife has largely passed, disturbances in various regions have not completely ended. Furthermore, with skyrocketing prices and production stagnation, the general middle class is rapidly going bankrupt, leading to disappointment and even resentment replacing the joy of victory in people's hearts. The Political Consultative Conference and the United Nations Conference seemed to offer hope to the people. However, after these two conferences, neither the international situation nor China has shown any new signs of improvement. The situation is indeed changing. However, whether it is truly changing for the better is still too early to say.

The people of the whole country hope for things to change for the better. We only allow things to change for the better, not for the worse. But at the moment, the tendency for things to improve is no greater than the tendency for things to worsen. What is the reason for this? To be honest, those in power in politics today certainly intend to do good, or are also working hard to do good, but unfortunately, influential figures and groups seem to prioritize the planning of competing for power over the planning for the country. Although Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is loudly calling for politics to be a responsibility rather than a right, those who can truly understand and practice this are few and far between!

Politics, of course, cannot do without the struggle for power. But the struggle for power is a means, and planning for the country is the goal. To struggle for power for the sake of planning for the country, the struggle must be aboveboard. If one does not consider the interests of the country and the people, then the struggle for power is no different from seizing profits! What is valuable about a statesman is their ability to have foresight and plan for the country for thousands and millions of generations. Therefore, a statesman must worry about the worries of the world before worrying about his own, and rejoice in the joy of the world after rejoicing in his own. So-called "realism" is truly a political trap. Planning solely for immediate power and interests can easily turn one into a fool. To reiterate, politics cannot do without the struggle for power. But to struggle for power by any means necessary, to struggle for power with short-sightedness and quick gains, is no different from the speculative practices of a profiteer! We should at least offer one hope to all powerful parties in politics today, which is that their intelligence and wisdom should not only be used to seek temporary convenience based on reality but must be used to make precise arrangements for the permanent future of the country and nation.

Since the victory of the War of Resistance, our country's international standing has suffered increasing damage and continues to suffer manipulation. We not only have no voice in international affairs, but our own security is also not guaranteed. Moreover, we are almost losing our voice even on matters concerning our own country. Our recognition of Mongolia's independence originally had the tragic grandeur of a brave warrior cutting off his wrist. However, Northeast China and Xinjiang have remained in confusion. Overseas, news of the abuse and persecution of overseas Chinese in various places is constantly reported, and even French Indochina Vietnam is trying to bully the Chinese. What is the reason for this? To be honest, people must insult themselves before others insult them. Our discord and incompetence have caused the international status gained through eight years of bloody battles to be in danger of being lost before the bones of the dead have even been buried. The reason why the powerful factions in our politics are discordant and incompetent is that many of them regard political means as an end and are intoxicated with realism. Therefore, they are indifferent not only to the situation in Northeast China and the plight of overseas Chinese but even regard this as a good opportunity for political activity. The greatest source of disaster today is realism! All forms of factionalism, bureaucracy, and opportunism are variants of it!

We must awaken from realism and face the problems of the country squarely!

In today's era of international life, the politicians of a country—if they deserve to be called politicians—must first consider the country's position and policies in the world. Our country is nominally one of the four or five great powers. But let's be frank, is that really the case? Nevertheless, we must strive for strength. The most important thing for everyone, especially those engaged in political movements, is to make the country a truly strong country. We must not be intoxicated with the fine name of "four or five great powers," nor should we be deceived by the ideal of "peace" and think that there is no need to strive for strength.

We should know that competing for political power internally is one thing, and competing for national rights externally is another. If we do not compete for national rights externally, then at the very least, we should warn each other never to use foreign forces as tools for political struggle. We must understand that although China's environment is not as bad as that of the Middle East, if we do not make a painful decision to solve our own problems ourselves and never use foreign forces as tools for solving internal affairs, then we will inevitably be reduced to puppets on the international stage, like the countries of the Middle East! However, everyone is very enthusiastic about internal affairs, but they are very calm and silent about the rights and honor of the country!

Secondly, in today's industrial era, industry and commerce are the lifeblood of the country. After the victory, everyone was busy fighting for power and taking over. No one asked about how to produce. Taking Shanghai as an example, 90% of the industry has been at a standstill for the past five months! Even many shops still have "Iron Generals" guarding the doors! No wonder prices are soaring! If we do not actively restore production and transportation, we will inevitably drive capital to speculation and hoarding. The day when there is no opportunity to speculate will be the day when the whole country becomes beggars! In the face of such a bankruptcy crisis, in addition to restoring order and transportation, on the one hand, we must remove obstacles to industrial and commercial enterprises, and on the other hand, we must support the progress of production enterprises. This includes the elimination of corruption, the reform of the tax system, the determination of exchange rates, the support of international trade, and the encouragement of various government loans and underwriting measures. Most importantly, the government must establish a policy of not interfering with legitimate industry and commerce and must provide all conveniences. However, the government has not yet taken any measures, and the various parties have not truly paid attention, or even consider the bankruptcy of the national economy as an opportunity for political attack.

Furthermore, in the last few years of the War of Resistance, political discipline and social morality declined. One of the biggest reasons is that the treatment of public educators is simply unreasonable. Those who are loyal to their duties and abide by the law cannot maintain a healthy and self-respecting life according to the law, which is tantamount to forcing or tempting everyone to take the wrong path. This is not only a problem of the lives and morals of a small number of people. The destruction of the physical and mental health of the country's intellectuals will lead to political and cultural bankruptcy. In fact, everyone has to live. Rather than having everyone survive by unofficial means, why not raise their salaries and strictly prohibit illegal income? However, everyone does not seem to take this problem very seriously.

Finally, a country must be unified, and it must be democratic. Today, China seems to have only people who use unity and democracy as political slogans but do not realize that unity and democracy are the fundamental conditions for establishing a country, and that the two are one and not two. A country that is not unified is not a country at all. We do not agree that warlord politics is a good thing, but it is another thing that the unity gained at a heavy price must be maintained. Today, those in power must fully understand that unity must be achieved through democracy and freedom, while those in the opposition must also know that today, to use so-called "autonomy" to oppose unity and repeat the trick of "federated provinces" is just a bad political plot. Today, everyone supports democracy, which is a very good thing. However, there is no doubt that some people use democracy as a disguise, while others only use democracy as a weapon. In other words, they are not democratic themselves, but they only demand democracy from others. Little do they know that the most democratic will definitely be the last to succeed, and there is no need to criticize others for one's own shortcomings. The reason for this is that everyone lacks confidence in democracy, which is also the fundamental crisis of the country.

In fact, whether it is unity or democracy, we must implement four things: First, we must not use force as a tool for political struggle, that is, the so-called nationalization of the military. But because of our outdated vision, we always believe in force. Even today, we still cannot see clearly and give up the universal awareness of using force to fight for power. Therefore, we are still bargaining over this issue, and the losses to the country and the suffering of the people are beyond calculation and not in their minds. Second, we must ensure the basic rights and freedoms of the people. Without the rights and freedoms of the people, the country will not be unified. Third, so-called democracy must be carried out through elections so that the people can choose their ideal government with their free will. Fourth, democratic politics is indeed party politics, but the reason why democratic politics is worthy of support is that the democratic method makes it easier for talents to emerge.

In short, we believe that the major issues facing the country are:

We must ensure the integrity of territorial sovereignty.

We must protect industry and commerce.

We must protect the rights and freedoms of the people.

We must protect the lives of public educators.

We must not use foreign forces or force as a tool for political struggle, and then establish a government through free and universal suffrage.

We must establish a unified government of talent from all over the country.

These are the several major goals at present. However, the Political Consultative Conference failed to truly solve these demands of the people. It is not that the Political Consultative Conference does not have the power to solve them, but that it is not interested in them at all. To be more honest, they are all too realistic. They only pay attention to how to divide the rights of the parties, but they never pay attention to the reception in the Northeast and the problems of the overseas Chinese, nor have they put forward an emergency relief plan for the bankruptcy of industry and commerce. What is even more worrying is that they all ignore the long-term problems of the country for the sake of temporary expediency. For example, regarding the draft constitution, the May 5th Constitution is not entirely satisfactory, and the provincial autonomy advocated by the conference will inevitably lead the country to local separatism before the military is completely nationalized. What is especially disappointing is that the various parties only use the party as the standard for talent. In the past, it was said that there were no poor people in the upper class and no noble people in the lower class. Today, we seem to have a kind of party "caste" too! If this continues, five people in a party and three people in a faction can turn mediocrity into talent!

The Political Consultative Conference did not fail to achieve anything. It has opened a door for negotiation to resolve unspecified internal strife, and it has opened a road for free competition in Chinese politics. As for practical achievements and major plans for establishing and stabilizing the country, the people themselves must work hard.

Today is the period from political tutelage to constitutional government. The Kuomintang's political tutelage did not complete the establishment of the country. The Political Consultative Conference has also failed to provide us with security and happiness. If the future National Assembly is only an enlarged Consultative Conference, we are really worried. The Political Consultative Conference represents the existing forces in China, and these forces are only hindering each other for the sake of fighting for political power. Therefore, China needs a new force. This new force must represent the force of thorough democracy and freedom to urge everyone to carry out the cause of national construction, so that Chinese politics can have vitality. Who is the newest force? Farmers, workers, teachers, industrialists, businessmen, and freelancers. Is it necessary to establish a party? No, non-party and non-faction, regardless of party affiliation. What method to use? Use the power of public opinion to urge the various forces in politics to follow the right path of democratic constitutionalism.

Whether Chinese politics can quickly get on track depends on whether the people who truly love freedom in China can unite and launch a powerful movement!

### Outstanding Meritorious Service of American Generals Madame Chiang Kai-shek Presides Over Conferment of Medals Madame Expresses Deep Pleasure at Returning to Hometown of Politics

If someone were to ask me about the most solemn and harmonious medal conferment ceremony in this city after the victory, I would tell them directly that it was the medal conferment ceremony held by Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, on behalf of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, at the mayor's office in the Municipal Government yesterday. Such a scene may be common in the wartime capital, but in Shanghai, which has been occupied for eight years, it is still the first time.

Ceremony Begins

At 4:00 PM, Mayor Qian's exquisite semicircular office suddenly became lively. Fifteen minutes later, Madame Chiang Kai-shek and General Chen Cheng, along with Madam Tan Xiang, gracefully appeared. The eyes of the entire room involuntarily converged on them. Madame Chiang Kai-shek was wearing a dark black long-sleeved cheongsam, inlaid with sapphire blue trim, black high heels, and a face full of smiles. Madame Chen wore a crimson cheongsam and always followed closely behind Madame Chiang Kai-shek. At this time, General Wedemeyer also arrived, standing to the right of Madame Chiang Kai-shek. The medal conferment ceremony officially began.

Reading of Citations

The four American generals to be awarded medals were General Stratemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces in China, who is returning home today; Brigadier General McNarney, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army Air Forces in China; Brigadier General Evans, Deputy Chief of Staff; and Brigadier General Ruteledge. Their uniforms were neatly pressed, and their left chests were already covered with decorations. They stood in an orderly row under the portrait of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, displaying redoubled spirit. On both sides were bright Party and national flags. First, General Huang Renlin read the citations in Chinese and English, stating that General Stratemeyer had made contributions to defeating the enemy, the cooperation between the Chinese and American air forces, and the training of the Chinese air force while serving as Commander of the Air Force in the China-India-Burma Theater and Commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces in China, and should be awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Cloud and Banner and the Air Force Hutu Medal… Brigadier General McNarney was also awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Cloud and Banner and the Air Force Luoshu Medal for assisting General Stratemeyer… Brigadier Generals Evans and Ruteledge were also awarded the Order of the Cloud and Banner and the Air Force Qian Yuan Medal for their meritorious service… In addition, Major General Claire Chennault, former Commander of the U.S. 14th Air Force, also received the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Cloud and Banner and the Air Force Medal. Since Major General Chennault has already returned to the United States, this medal will be accepted and forwarded by General Wedemeyer.

Medal Conferment

After each citation was read, one of the generals would step in front of Madame Chiang Kai-shek in a perfect salute. Madame Chiang Kai-shek personally took the medal and pinned it on the recipient's left lapel, then draped the Grand Cordon over their shoulders. At this time, the flashes of the photographers' cameras were incessant, and the sound of the shutters was endless. Madame Chiang Kai-shek shook hands with the recipient and said "Congratulations." The recipient nodded and thanked her, returning to his original position with a smile of honor. A solemn and colorful scene was completed in a short 20 minutes. Also attending the ceremony yesterday were Zhou Zhirou, Chairman of the Aviation Commission; Qian Dajun, Mayor; He Dekui, Deputy Mayor; Shen Shihua, Secretary-General; Li Jilan, Deputy Commander of the Garrison Command; Xuan Tiewu, Police Chief; and Mei Qiju, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Battlefield Service Corps.

Generals Sign

After the ceremony, Madame Chiang Kai-shek raised a glass of wine to congratulate the awarded generals. Then she spoke with General Wedemeyer for ten minutes, constantly nodding and smiling, showing that she was in a very happy mood. The faces of the American generals who received the awards, which were serious and tense a moment ago, were now overflowing with lighthearted smiles, a smile that contained honor and satisfaction. Reporters seized the precious moment, approached the generals, offered congratulations, and asked them to leave a commemorative signature for the newspaper, which they signed without hesitation.

Madame Chiang Kai-shek Speaks

Finally, the reporter asked Madame Chiang Kai-shek to say a few words. She smiled again and said that this was her first time in Shanghai after the victory. Shanghai was originally her hometown, and she felt infinitely excited and happy to set foot on her native soil again and see the people of Shanghai. There was really nothing else to say. Yes, Madame Chiang Kai-shek had been away from Shanghai for eight years. Her deep joy upon her return was such that she was speechless. This joy symbolizes the future of Shanghai, and the people of Shanghai will soon experience the warmth of this joy.

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek to Receive Reporters in the Coming Days

Since Madame Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Shanghai, reporters from various newspapers have visited her to seek an audience, but she has been unable to find time to meet with them due to her busy schedule. It is now learned that Madame Chiang Kai-shek will hold a press conference in Shanghai in the coming days to meet and talk with reporters from various newspapers in the city.

### Newspaper Industry Union to Host Newspaper Authorities

In the spirit of the government, labor, and management independently negotiating, a comprehensive exchange of views will be made on issues such as adjusting the wages of union members in the industry.

### Gone for a Month Without News Sailing Junk Lost at Sea Off Zhoushan

Shanghai Enterprise Company leased the China Merchants Bureau's No. 109 motorized junk (formerly known as Beiwu) last year, sailing the Qingdao line. It departed from Shanghai on January 14, carrying goods to Qingdao. According to the voyage, it would have arrived in a maximum of five days, but it has been a month and there is no news. The ship has no wireless equipment, so communication is difficult. The company and passengers are extremely anxious. The ship has a deadweight tonnage of 197 tons and a crew of 15 people. This time, it carried 4,150 bags of flour, 500 bags of rice, and about 130 tons of miscellaneous goods. The above rice and flour were loaded by Jinjiangtai Reporting Office, and three people were sent to escort the ship. Last Tuesday, someone from Bailonggang, Pudong, suddenly reported to Jinjiangtai that five corpses of men had been recovered from a junk in the Zhoushan waters. A card was found in the body of one of the corpses, as well as the agency's introduction to board the ship as an escort, named Zhang Minyun. All the bodies have now been transported to Sijiao near Zhoushan. The firm confirmed that Zhang Minyun was indeed sent to escort the ship, so the ship's loss has been confirmed. They immediately informed Shanghai Enterprise Company, who reported to the China Merchants Bureau and immediately sent people to Sijiao to identify the bodies and investigate the shipwreck.

### Liu Shangqing Arrives in Shanghai to Go to the United States for Medical Treatment

### Youth Winter Camp Holds First Memorial Week Yesterday Mayor Qian Presides Over Admonition

The 34th Shanghai Youth Winter Camp, organized by the Three Principles of the People Youth League, held its first Premier Memorial Week at the camp headquarters on Jingzhou Road yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Qian Dajun, the honorary camp director, made a special visit to give a spiritual speech. Director Wu Shaoshu reported as chairman, followed by the spiritual speech by Honorary Camp Director Qian, with the topic "The Responsibility and Cultivation of Youth."

### Strict Prohibition of Hoarding Grain Guild Deliberates on Measures

In response to the recent rise in rice prices, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Rice Shop Industry Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 5:00 PM on the 9th, with the participation of Yang Xizhi, special commissioner of the Grain Administration. The directors and supervisors reviewed and explained the reasons for the rise in rice prices: (1) Rice prices have been very stable for several months, but have recently been severely stimulated by the price of gold and other commodities. (2) Fewer goods arrived before the Lunar New Year, and people are optimistic. (3) The organizational foundation of the Rice Industry Association is weak during the recovery period, and unscrupulous individuals who have been popular in recent years inevitably take the opportunity to raise prices. (4) Speculators inevitably buy and hoard at high prices. After deliberation, the following was decided: (1) Strengthen the organization and management of the rice market; non-rice merchants are not allowed to trade. (2) Advise colleagues not to raise prices and to report each other. (3) Effectively prevent non-members from buying, and members are responsible for reporting speculators and requesting the authorities to punish them. (4) Hope that the authorities will generally stabilize prices. (5) Request the Grain Administration to continue selling rice, which will be handled by the association. However, the price should not be too low to avoid purchase. Yang said that he will work with the military and police authorities to inspect warehouses, strictly prohibit speculation and hoarding, and consider entrusting the association to continue selling rice in the market at prices slightly lower than the market price to regulate the people's food, replenish the grain source, and stabilize the rice price. It is not a low-price sale, because it is difficult to seek fairness in distribution and only benefits a small number of people.

### Brief Civil Affairs News - Census to Begin

The work of reorganizing the Baojia system in this city has been fully completed. The next important task is to conduct a census, which is scheduled to begin on the 16th of this month and must be completed within five days.

Before the start, the Civil Affairs Bureau of the city government made preparations by first convening a training session for district chiefs, deputy district chiefs, general secretaries, directors of civil and household affairs sections, and the third section director of the police precinct. Next, training sessions will be held separately in each district for personnel at all levels of the Baojia system so that everyone can understand the meaning and procedures of the investigation. The distribution of investigation forms and registers can be completed by the 15th of this month.

All citizens of the city must, first, have someone on standby during the specified investigation period to wait for the census; second, the census must be honest and truthful, and nothing must be concealed; third, when the investigation is completed, the head of the household or the person in charge must sign and seal the investigation form to ensure its authenticity.

The investigators all have symbols. No fees will be collected during the investigation. Anyone who falsely claims to be investigating or collects fees in the name of the investigation may be reported to the Civil Affairs Bureau and will be punished according to the law, with no leniency.

### Announcement to Students Applying for Educational Loans - Special Grace Period of Two Days - Application Forms Must be Completed and Submitted Immediately

The "Educational Loan" jointly organized by this newspaper and the Shanghai Educational Loan Committee has seen a very enthusiastic response from impoverished students in major universities and schools since applications began on the 4th. Statistics show that the number of applicants has exceeded 7,000. The original deadline was yesterday, but because some students were still returning from their hometowns for the Lunar New Year holiday and are rushing back, many have sent letters requesting an extension. After discussion among the responsible personnel in the committee, a grace period of two more days has been granted, meaning applications can still be submitted today and tomorrow. No further grace periods will be granted. Among the more than 2,500 students who received assistance from this newspaper last year, a small number have not yet applied. Unless their families' financial situation has improved or their academic performance is poor, it is hoped that they will come and pick up the forms quickly and not give up the opportunity to receive assistance. Also, applying students should submit their completed application forms to the principal for endorsement and then submit them to the committee as soon as possible. The deadlines are before the 13th for university and college students, before the 15th for senior and junior high school students, and before the 17th for primary school students. All must be submitted on time for review. As the start of the school term is fast approaching, it is hoped that the principals of each school will be responsible for expediting the process so that the committee can complete the necessary procedures early, including reviewing the applications and sending personnel to investigate family situations, so that impoverished students will not suffer the pain of being unable to attend school.

Commercial News

### Supply and Demand of Yarn and Cloth Mismatched - Hope that Textile Construction Increases Sales Volume

(Our Report) The market price of yarn and cloth has been rising sharply recently. The listed price of the China Textile Construction Corporation has also been rising steadily in each phase. For example, 42-count yarn was over 900,000 yuan at the end of January, and 20-count yarn was 550,000 yuan. But by February 10, 42-count had opened at 1.43 million yuan and 20-count at 820,000 yuan. From February 1 to 10, the company announced public prices four times. Although the price of 20-count yarn remained steady at 680,000 yuan for three phases, the quality of the first phase was Blue Phoenix, the second phase was Yueqin, and the third phase was reduced to [missing name] Girl and unbranded, which has invisibly raised prices. Compared with the Lunar New Year, it has risen by about 30-40%. All parties are quite concerned about this. According to Mr. Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, this situation is entirely due to the mismatch between supply and demand. Most yarn and cloth manufacturers have already accepted orders at the end of the Lunar New Year. For general white cloth weaving factories, they have been too busy recently to deliver orders and have no way to supply spot sales. However, the Textile Construction Corporation has not released any cloth since the red opening. Dyeing factories have sold orders before the year, so they have to purchase white cloth on the market in order to dye and deliver goods. As a result, the supply is not balanced, and the market price has risen. Moreover, customer groups have received telegrams from the mainland, saying that people have been lacking clothing for a long time and are urging to catch up on the supply of yarn and cloth. The market price is even more difficult to stabilize. Because most dyeing and weaving factories have sold orders before the Lunar New Year, they have suffered a lot of losses. If the Textile Construction Corporation does not sell white cloth again, the factories and customer groups will feel even more difficult. Mr. Pan also pointed out that the Minrong Dyeing and Weaving Factory in this city has about 10,000 looms, most of which were preparing to start work during the Lunar New Year. Recently, the Textile Construction Corporation has released yarn in each phase, but the number is not large, so the factories hope that it can increase the number of sales so that they can start work. White cloth factories urged to stop work for three days during the Lunar New Year. They are now rushing to ship goods to the market to avoid causing another disturbance in the market. If state-owned yarn and cloth factories can increase their supply and pay attention to the yarn and thread of private industries and the original price, they can gradually recover. It is also heard that since the Textile Construction Corporation handled the registration of yarn and cloth manufacturers, the association has been forwarding the member registration cards to the company on a daily basis and has also sent a letter requesting to open sales of white cloth to meet urgent needs. However, according to news revealed by the Textile Construction Corporation, because the government needs military fabrics, it may not be able to supply a large amount for civilian use for a while. It is found that the cloth factories taken over by the Textile Construction Corporation can produce about 5,000 pieces of cloth per day. According to its production capacity, it can be increased to tens of thousands of pieces per day.

### Silk Boom

Silk has been booming since the market opened on Wednesday, rising in a straight line. The spot price of 120 artificial silk at Tianqiao has risen by a total of 500,000 yuan in four days, but the actual transactions are few. Although there is a move to pay supplementary taxes on warehouse receipts, transactions are frequent and unwilling to show weakness. By the weekend, it had risen to more than 300,000 yuan. Factory-business transactions, foreign firms and factory sales are all available. The selling price follows the gold market and has risen by about 200,000 yuan in each stall. Dacheng Gebi Crepe, a silk fabric, is currently on sale and is the most popular. Compared with the opening red plate and the weekend price, it has risen by more than 29%. Lin Ji's Wax Wing Gauze and Huajin Crepe are also rising sharply, reaching 40% and 30% respectively. Meiya bedsheets have risen by 150,000 yuan per hundred, and Minsheng brocade has risen by 2,000 yuan per piece. Yesterday, Sunday, the silk market was closed as usual, although there were no transactions, the silk fabric market was quite lively, people's hearts were inspired, and the buying intention was strong. Meiya bedsheets are calling 1.05 million yuan per hundred, and Dacheng Gebi Crepe is calling 4,480 yuan per yard. Looking forward to the future of the silk market price, it seems to have a tendency to move forward.

### Tinplate Shows Its Edge

Recently, various colors of tinplate have been selling very well, and the market price has been rising sharply, rising by as much as 30-40% compared to half a month ago. For example, 180-pound double-linked iron is currently calling 140,000 yuan per box, 90-pound single-linked iron is 75,000 yuan per box, and 200-pound Hui Si iron is 100,000 yuan per box, which has already been made, and is currently calling 120,000 yuan. One-inch to three-inch narrow strip iron sells for 75,000 yuan per box, and four-inch to eight-inch wide strip iron mixed goods sell for 90,000 yuan per box. The market for 24-gauge tinplate is relatively stable, with each sheet trading at 8,000 yuan. 26-gauge tinplate is calling about 250,000 yuan per box. 112-pound kerosene box blanks are calling as high as 60,000 yuan per box, a sharp increase of nearly double compared to two weeks ago.

### Citibank Exchanges "Hawaii" US Dollars - Safeguarding Public Interests Proves No Difference

Mr. J.T.S. Reed, General Manager of Citibank's Shanghai Branch, made the following remarks to reporters yesterday.

In this city, US dollars printed with the word "Hawaii" are generally recognized to be of lower value than other US dollars. In order to correct the above misconception, the bank (No. 41 Jiujiang Road in this city) has specifically decided to exchange all US dollars printed with the word "Hawaii" for US dollars without the word "Hawaii" at the same price, starting today (i.e. Monday). The purpose of this move by the bank is to safeguard public interests, because the public has mistakenly believed the rumors of speculators, obviously believing that US dollars printed with the word "Hawaii" are not as welcome as ordinary banknotes in the United States. However, the fact is not so, so the bank has specially implemented this exchange method, so that all sectors can understand that US dollars printed with the word "Hawaii" and US dollars without the word are equally supported by the government of the United States and are in the same status.

The restoration of overseas Chinese schools in Thailand is particularly important this time because they have been subjected to pressure. The commission has sent Standing Committee Member Xie Zuomin to Thailand on a long-term basis to assist in everything.

### Zhejiang University School Buildings Damaged - Will Not be Able to Move Back Until May

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, February 10] Zhejiang University was well prepared when the War of Resistance broke out, so the loss of books and instruments was still slight.

The session will last for two weeks and will be headed by Liang Dong, Director of the Provincial Education Department. Although this is called a training class, the content of the training is the same as that of the Central Training Corps. This is a pioneering initiative in the education sector of the Northeast after the restoration.

### Fuchun Primary School - Private to Municipal

[This City News] Because the tuition fees of various schools have generally increased this semester, the Municipal Education Bureau has added a municipal primary school to reduce the burden on students' parents. The school was originally the private Fuchun Primary School site on Shaanxi South Road (i.e. Avenue Albert). It was founded by teachers of the Municipal Wanzhu Primary School after August 13. Its tuition fee is higher than the average. Now that it has been taken over by the city, the tuition fees for students will be waived.

### Educational Loans - Continuing to Apply for the Last Day

[Dahua News Agency] Since the Shanghai Educational Loan Committee started soliciting applications on the 4th of this month, as of yesterday, there were 2,762 people in the primary school section, 2,458 people in the junior high school section, 1,185 people in the senior high school section, and 449 people in the university and college section, totaling 6,854 people. Yesterday was the last day to apply, but in view of the fact that there must be quite a few people who are unable to apply temporarily, for the sake of poor children, they can still continue to apply to the committee at No. 735 Zhongzheng Middle Road today.

### Bank Applications Approved in First Batch

[Dagong News Agency] The Shanghai Municipal Bank held its first review meeting for educational loans a few days ago.

Special Issue on Production and Construction

### Current Labor Issues

— Wang Lu

In the current industrial world, labor issues are quite serious, and this is true not only in China but also in the United States.

In the United States, the first issue encountered after victory was the labor issue. After the working hours of laborers were restored from 48 hours per week to 40 hours, their income also decreased accordingly. The employers sternly rejected the demand for wage increases. President Truman convened a national labor-management consultation conference in mid-November last year.

After the three-week labor-management consultation conference, the labor issue was not resolved. Currently, nearly two million workers in the United States have left their jobs due to labor-management disputes. This number is not large compared to the total number of laborers in the United States, but the trend of strikes has affected the American economy. More than 200,000 workers in the automobile industry are on strike, accounting for more than half of all workers. Other industries that have already gone on strike include the slaughtering industry, the timber industry, and the steel industry.

President Truman's most recent measure is to conduct a factual investigation in order to use the power of public opinion to solve the problem. However, this measure cannot win the sympathy of both labor and management. From the labor side, because they cannot strike or stop work within the 30 days of the investigation, they lose a weapon; from the management side, they are unwilling to disclose their [missing word] books.

In fact, this kind of mutual suspicion is the biggest reason that hinders cooperation between labor and management. In fact, the management cannot do without the laborers, and the laborers cannot do without the management. What the management hopes is to obtain legitimate profits, and what the laborers hope is to enjoy a stable life. Both sides should absolutely discuss calmly and reasonably, and find ways to cope with the difficulties of the environment.

China's industry urgently needs to be built after victory. Even if there is no delay and no obstruction, it is already very difficult to catch up with the advanced countries. Therefore, it is absolutely not allowed to lose valuable opportunities because of labor issues. Therefore, China's labor issues must be resolved rationally. The most rational method is for labor and management to have no barriers, be frank and straightforward, and based on facts, formulate mutually beneficial measures that are beneficial to both labor and management and the future of the business.

### The Revitalization Efforts of the Ford Motor Company

— Qing He

Regardless of the type of enterprise, continuous effort is necessary to maintain its existing position. People in our country generally acknowledge that starting a business is difficult, but maintaining it is also not easy. Recently, Henry Ford, the founder of the American Ford Motor Company, officially retired, and his grandson succeeded him. We can now pay attention to future developments. The young Ford has taken on the responsibility of revitalizing the Ford Motor Company. This situation differs from the inheritance methods of some business circles in our country.

Recently, in Detroit, the most discussed topics, besides labor issues, revolve around how Henry Ford II will succeed his grandfather in carrying forward the Ford Motor Company's business.

He is known locally as Young Henry or Henry II. He is currently undergoing a trial, meaning his talent will ultimately be judged. Under these circumstances, he has to demonstrate his abilities with facts. Several years ago, he was a quiet and cheerful young man with blue eyes and apple-red cheeks, without any particular characteristics standing out. He used to live a carefree and leisurely life, but since his father passed away in mid-August 1944, he has inherited his father's position, becoming the second-in-command in the Ford Company. His colleagues at Ford have a sense of sympathy for him, but not of fear, because he still needs to learn a lot about the automobile business.

During his first meeting with reporters, he admitted that he was very young and inexperienced. After accepting a position like a throne, he still frankly said that he had many things to learn. But in fact, he already has a considerable understanding of the automotive business.

The three most important issues for the Ford Motor Company are: (1) how to cope with the changing environment, (2) how to maintain its inherent strengths, and (3) how to maintain good relations with the press. In the past, Ford Company produced a large number of wartime vehicles, and their publicity gave the impression that Ford Company was always at the forefront. Regarding relations with the press, a reporter said several years ago that investigating Ford Company's activities was as difficult as interviewing in the Soviet Union. But in recent years, Ford Company's executives have answered all questions raised by the press without hesitation. The young Henry's current task is to promote that good relationship and implement their inherent policies. A characteristic of the Ford Motor Company is that Henry Ford made a lot of money soon after founding the company and bought out the shares of the other shareholders. The Ford family owns a large number of shares, making it a private, family-owned company. As long as the money earned can meet the interests of the shareholders, they are very satisfied, unlike other companies with a large number of shareholders, making it difficult to please everyone as a manager.

However, in recent years, the Ford Company's business has been declining. During World War I, Ford Company's turnover accounted for 60% of the national automobile business. By World War II, its turnover accounted for less than 20% of the national business. Therefore, the Ford Motor Company will have used up all its surplus from previous years to pay interest to shareholders.

The young Ford is very capable in his work and has earned the praise of the old Ford, although he may not agree with everything he does. Since taking over, his first step has been to strengthen the sales department and to strive to link sales, manufacturing, and engineering departments together. His goal is to bring the Ford Motor Company back to the top spot. Undoubtedly, he has already taken on the heavy responsibility of revitalizing the Ford Motor Company.

### The Past and Future of Knitwear

— Zhang Hongxun

Knitwear is one of the light industries, and it can also be said to be a necessity for everyone. It has only been a few decades since people in our country set up factories to weave themselves. Even considering sock factories, they are still very immature. In the past, people in our country advocated simplicity and mostly wore cloth clothes and socks. In the early years of the Republic of China, British-made Eagle Brand cotton socks came to China. At that time, there were only two colors, black and white. Initially, they were promoted in China because they were more comfortable than cloth socks and cheaper. The public began to wear them. Later, people in our country also established sock factories to imitate them, seeking small profits. However, due to a shortage of capital, they were simple and unable to produce in large quantities to compete with foreign goods. Later, the United States imported a kind of patterned socks for dumping in China. People in our country loved their beautiful patterns and they were very popular. At that time, I was working in the knitwear machinery service. Seeing such an outflow of rights and interests, I founded Kangfu Sock Factory in 1926, specializing in the manufacture of various patterned socks, selling them throughout the country. Although it could not compete with imported goods, it could still save some of the market. Before the Pacific War, a large number of wholesale and sales were also conducted in Nanyang, Africa and other places abroad.

Times are constantly improving, and the needs of all walks of life are increasing with each passing day. Ordinary cotton socks should be produced in large quantities. Due to changes in clothing, patterned socks have also gradually been noticed and widely used, even in remote areas. Therefore, for all kinds of products, in terms of material, the first requirement is to be sturdy. In terms of patterns, they must also be constantly updated. Of course, the color must be durable and not fade after washing. Only then can we talk about resisting foreign goods, regaining rights and interests, and promoting the goal of domestic products. To achieve the above-mentioned situation, it is necessary to have huge and abundant capital, sophisticated machinery, and cultivate specialized technical talents, self-weaving, self-dyeing, and self-dressing, responding to the trend of development, constantly improving, striving for perfection, large-scale production, and working hard to build. I ask myself that the ability of one factory is limited. I hope that the knitwear industry across the country will unite and work together. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, traffic was blocked everywhere. Now that the rivers and mountains have been restored, traffic is open everywhere. The future of light industry has greater development. The Japanese invaders have surrendered and are seeking peace. Domestic needs are still difficult to meet. Foreign trade will inevitably be completely abandoned. In the past, the Nanyang market was mostly controlled by the Japanese. Taking advantage of this great opportunity, we can engage in plundering. Therefore, the knitwear industry is indeed the best period for development in the future.

### Production News: Three-Wheeled Cars

American car manufacturer, Calay Davis, has finalized plans to manufacture three-wheeled cars and may begin manufacturing in California within six months. These cars weigh 1,000 pounds and come in several versions including four-cylinder, six-cylinder, and eight-cylinder. The four-cylinder version can travel forty miles per gallon of gasoline, with a normal speed of sixty-five miles per hour and a top speed of eighty miles per hour.

Cotton Picking Machine

The American International Harvester Company spent much time manufacturing a cotton picking machine, which was tested in a cotton field two miles from Clarkdale with great success. Each time the machine was driven through the cotton field, it picked 95% of the cotton. The remaining bits were unripe burrs. The cost of picking cotton by hand is forty dollars per bale; with the machine, the cost is only seven dollars and fifty cents.

Using machines to pick cotton can reduce the cost of American cotton and make it competitive in the international market.

Direct Mail Delivery of Food

The United States has recently begun using direct mail delivery to sell food, including flour products and vegetables. This method was used to obtain some food in Europe during the war. The number of farms in the United States is increasing rapidly, with 5,500 farms at the end of 1944 and an expected increase to 15,000 by 1950.

### Worker Training Programs in the UK and the US

— Fei Wen

In the process of post-war recovery and reconstruction, talent training is a matter of urgency. The British Ministry of Labour recently announced a government plan to remedy disruptions to careers during the war. Technical colleges and business schools across the country will provide returned men and women with three months of business management training. Trainees must have formally served in the military, merchant marine, defense work, or coal mines for at least one year, and be able to prove that their careers were interrupted by the war before the age of 21 or after less than two years of business operation. Trainees can receive subsidies when necessary.

In the United States, the development of worker education has become an important part of adult education. Worker education in the United States focuses on the study of group issues, including skills ranging from union administration to the study of social sciences, American labor history, and labor philosophy. Educational methods include all educational techniques, such as classroom lectures, discussions, broadcasts, recordings, performances, films, and dramas. In addition to classroom instruction, there are entertainment and cultural activities. Recently, there has also been leisure education and education on how to avoid dangers in life, as well as medical care.

### Small Boards of Directors

— Dong

In general factories, the issue of talent is very deeply felt, especially mid-level talent. Senior employees certainly have innovative ideas and a spirit of progress, but no one can understand them and turn their ideals into reality. The reason for this is a lack of capable mid-level personnel.

In factories abroad, in order to enable employees with ambitions to contribute more to the factory, small boards of directors, or Junior Boards of Directors, are often established. Their mission is to study the actual situation and provide suggestions for the highest authorities to adopt. Small boards of directors are organized by senior employees who are relatively progressive and hardworking. This not only enhances the efficiency of mid-level employees but also cultivates many management talents. Previously, the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai also had a small board of directors, organized by young people.

Some manufacturers' boards of directors in China do not take on the responsibilities of a board of directors and are close to being nominal. In the future, if we want to develop industry, directors should truly act as directors. At the same time, the establishment of small boards of directors can also solve the current problem of talent shortage.

### Important Departments in the Sewing Industry

— Luo Liqun

The definition of the sewing industry is very broad: Any industrial product made from a whole piece of raw material, after cutting and sewing, is collectively referred to as the sewing industry, such as the underwear industry, suit industry, hat industry, shoe industry, handkerchief industry, leather products industry, etc. They not only occupy a necessity in life, but can also be converted into military industry during wartime. Therefore, the sewing industry can also be called a light industry for national defense.

In addition to paying attention to skills, the sewing industry also values the threads used for sewing. The main threads used in the sewing industry are wood yarn threads. The difference between good and bad lies in tensile strength, toughness, smoothness, and softness. Feilun (Flying Wheel) brand wood yarn skeins have been loved and cherished by all parties for many years because of their excellent quality. After using them, there are no defects such as "button detachment" or "seam cracking." Therefore, it is worth paying attention to when choosing wood yarn skeins.

### A Warrior in the Industrial World: Mr. Wu Yun Chu

— Xu Baiyi

Mr. Wu Yun Chu, the founder of Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, has returned to Shanghai for nearly forty days. Because he has always adhered to the spirit of hard work and pragmatism, and does not pay attention to meaningless publicity and socializing, he has not made any statements. When the author visited Mr. Wu this time, he began by saying that he had no special opinions to express, and that he was striving to do his job to the best of his ability. The following describes the situation of the three important industries created by Mr. Wu.

Mr. Wu was a hardworking man in his youth. After graduating from middle school, because of his inclination, he was admitted to the chemistry department of the Shanghai Ordnance Special School of the Ministry of the Army. After graduation, he successively served as a chemistry professor at the Ordnance Special School, a steelmaking technician at the Ordnance Factory, general manager and chief technician of the Hanchang Soda Company, and chief of the physics and chemistry section and chief of the pharmaceutical section and acid manufacturing section of the Hanyang Arsenal. In 1923, after the successful testing of monosodium glutamate, he founded the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory.

The most important raw materials for manufacturing monosodium glutamate are wheat gluten and hydrochloric acid. If these important raw materials have to rely on external supply, it will not be a long-term solution. Especially because hydrochloric acid was a Japanese product, he founded the Shanghai Starch Factory to supply the wheat gluten needed by the Tianchu Factory, and founded the Tianyuan Electrochemistry Factory to supply the hydrochloric acid needed by the Tianchu Factory.

Among the products of the Tianyuan Electrochemistry Factory, in addition to hydrochloric acid, there are also bleaching powder and caustic soda, which are important industrial raw materials. However, there is a large amount of hydrogen, and if it is not utilized, it is a great pity. Therefore, he then founded the Tianli Nitrogen Products Factory.

The field of nitrogen products is very broad. It is not only an important chemical industry but also an important national defense industry. In the inaugural commemorative album of the factory, Mr. Wu described the preparations at the time: "In 1932, the American DuPont Company intended to sell a synthetic argon (i.e., synthetic ammonia) plant in Seattle and sent personnel to contact it. I happened to be traveling to Europe and the United States, so I went to inspect it and found that its machinery and equipment were still in good condition, so I began to negotiate. The agreement was reached in November 1933. When this agreement was first proposed, the shareholders of the Tianchu and Tianyuan companies were willing to invest in Tianli. Although they were told that the capital of the basic chemical industry was huge and the profit was small, those who subscribed to shares were still enthusiastic. A million yuan of capital was raised in no time. In January 1934, it was established. Later, the Ministry of Industry decided to run a ammonium sulfate factory by itself, and commissioned industrialist Mr. Fan Xudong to preside over it. For the sake of cooperation and for the sake of meeting the urgent needs of industry, after discussing with Mr. Fan, we concentrated our efforts on the manufacture of nitric acid, and decided to use the air method, that is, to purchase a complete set of machinery from France with a daily output of 12 tons of nitric acid. In July, I went to Europe again to inspect the machinery I had ordered and to investigate the progress of nitric acid production methods. I returned to China in October and actively installed the machinery. At that time, the machinery of the [ammonia] plant had already been shipped to Shanghai in advance, and the machinery of the acid plant also arrived in batches by the end of the year. By August 1935, anhydrous [liquid ammonia] was produced, in September, dilute nitric acid was produced, in October, concentrated nitric acid was produced, and in November, the sulfuric acid concentration device was completed.

According to Mr. Wu's original plan, nitric acid can be used to manufacture explosives and contribute to national defense. He also wanted to further use his experience in manufacturing light gas to manufacture synthetic gasoline using the light coal method. He personally went to Germany to order machines and returned to Shanghai at 5 p.m. on August 13th, when the war had already started at 10 a.m.

Since August 13th, he had to relocate inland with the government. He first arrived in Hankou, but before the factory construction was even half completed, Nanjing fell and Hankou was in a state of emergency. He had to sacrifice the work that had been done and move to Hong Kong and Chongqing separately, where he built factories. In Hong Kong, he manufactured monosodium glutamate and hydrochloric acid, and in Chongqing, he manufactured chemical raw materials such as bleaching powder and caustic soda for the paper and soap factories.

Building factories in the interior, due to material constraints such as the lack of transportation tools and building materials, required at least double the effort, and the difficulties were countless and the suffering was unspeakable. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Hong Kong factory refused to cooperate with the enemy and deliberately destroyed important parts. The most important parts were moved to Chongqing to prove to the British ambassador that the Chinese people had international credibility. The Hong Kong factory was occupied by the Japanese invaders. The monosodium glutamate factory in Xinqiao Road, South Shanghai, and the starch and glucose factories in Qu Zhenren Road were destroyed by the enemy. At present, they have become a vacant lot. Currently, only the old site of the packaging department on Caishi Road in Shanghai is used for small-scale production.

The future work, under the current economic difficulties and rising labor unrest, is to sort out and reorganize this devastated situation and rebuild. But with Mr. Wu's strong perseverance and full spirit, he will definitely be able to complete the work of revival in the midst of all difficulties.

Among the joint organizations of the industrial sector during the War of Resistance, the Shanghai Industrialists' Relocation to Sichuan Federation, which was mainly composed of Shanghai industrialists, was historically rich and had considerable strength. The National Industrial Association was established in Chongqing on April 22, 1943, with branches in various industrial areas to seek contact between factories and factories, industry and the government, and the industrial sector and the outside world. Mr. Wu is the current chairman of the National Industrial Association and the former chairman of the Sichuan Factory Relocation Federation. Recently, the directors and supervisors of the National Industrial Association have met and moved the headquarters of the association to Shanghai.

Mr. Wu saw the lack and need for chemical talents in China and established the Qinghan Education Foundation in March 1931, which has cultivated many useful talents.

Mr. Wu has devoted himself to the chemical industry for decades, only seeking progress in his career and not hoping to receive monetary rewards. Therefore, he constantly moved forward in peacetime and worked hard during wartime. He can truly be said to be a heroic warrior in the Chinese industrial world and can be a role model for those who are devoted to industry.
