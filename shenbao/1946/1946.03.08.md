### Marshall and Wedemeyer Confer, Discussions Focused on the Northeast Situation

[United Press International, Chongqing, 7th] U.S. Special Envoy to China, General Marshall, after inspecting various regions where conflicts have occurred between the former Nationalist and Communist armies, consulted with General Wedemeyer, Commander of U.S. Forces in the China Theater. It is widely believed that the discussions between Marshall and Wedemeyer focused on the situation in the Northeast and the issue of merging the Nationalist and Communist armies. General Wedemeyer is residing at General Marshall's residence in Chongqing during this visit.

[United News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, Commander of U.S. Forces in the China Theater, paid visits to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek twice last night and today for consultations. He also visited Special Envoy Marshall for discussions. It is understood that the discussions pertain to issues such as the transportation of Nationalist troops to the Northeast and the repatriation of Japanese soldiers and civilians.

[United Press International, Chongqing, 6th] U.S. Special Envoy General Marshall, government representative Zhang Zhizhong, and Communist representative Zhou Enlai have returned to Chongqing on the 6th after a week-long tour of various regions in China where military conflicts are still occurring. The three leaders briefly visited Beijing, Jinan, Xuzhou, Taiyuan, Yan'an, and Hankou, urging the local Nationalist and Communist commanders to guarantee the maintenance of peace. According to accompanying reporters, Special Envoy Marshall made resolute remarks in several venues, stating that the next two months would be the most crucial period for China's future destiny.

[United Press International, this city, 7th] The publication of the U.S. note to China and the Soviet Union regarding the Soviet army's removal of "war booty" from the Northeast will reveal the "Northeast problem". General Marshall may be invited to explore solutions to the current crisis. As President Truman's special envoy with ambassadorial rank, Marshall has the authority to look after all U.S. interests in China, including the Northeast. At the invitation of the Chinese government, Marshall is serving as chairman of the three-person committee, and the Military Mediation Execution Headquarters in Beiping has the authority to act in the Northeast, namely, to send field inspection teams to prevent conflicts, designate areas to be received by the Nationalist and Communist armies, and reorganize local Nationalist and Communist troops. As an ambassador, he also has the authority to send U.S. representatives to the Northeast, especially to look after U.S. commercial and other interests in various parts of the Northeast. The Soviet Union's refusal to allow U.S.-China joint field inspection teams and U.S. officials to enter the Northeast may create a serious international crisis. The Chinese government is adopting an official attitude of silence on this matter in an attempt to prevent the occurrence of a "formal crisis." If General Marshall is invited to handle the Northeast problem, he will face a far more difficult and delicate task than mediating the Chinese civil war or reorganizing and unifying the Chinese army. Soviet participation in the field inspection committee talks seems possible, as this move could alleviate Soviet concerns about U.S. activities in China.

At 11:30 a.m. on the 6th, French Chargé d'Affaires Thierry visited Wu Nanru, Director of the European Department of the Foreign Ministry, to discuss the matter. It is reported that the cause of the conflict was that the French warships rushed north from Saigon to Haiphong ahead of schedule, while our garrison had not yet received the order to take over defense. Negotiations between the two sides were unsuccessful for a time, leading to the exchange of fire. The responsibility is currently under investigation. The Foreign Ministry has decided to send Secretary Ling Qihan, our representative in Vietnam, to fly to Shanghai and then to Haiphong on the morning of the 8th to handle the negotiations regarding this unfortunate incident in order to achieve a satisfactory resolution.

[United Press International, Paris, 7th] Today, the French Colonial Ministry and the General Staff of the Ministry of Defense issued a joint statement saying: The French Navy, attempting to land in Haiphong, suffered considerable damage under the intense artillery fire of the Chinese troops. The statement continued: "After the representatives of the Chinese and French governments signed a diplomatic agreement in Chongqing on February 26, our troops immediately approached Haiphong on March 6 with the aim of relieving the Chinese troops stationed in Tokyo. Although contact was made with the Chinese army headquarters in Hanoi and guarantees were obtained, our ships were still subjected to artillery bombardment and there was no response from the other side for more than half an hour. Only after suffering some damage under the intense artillery fire were our ships ordered to return fire. The French military command has made contact with the Chinese military command, and negotiations are now underway between the two commands."

The future goal is to unify peace and build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. If this goal can be achieved through consultation, it is truly what our party hopes for. (2) Our party has consistently advocated that the interests of the nation and the people are higher than the interests of the party. If the Political Consultative Conference can achieve unified peace and national construction, then the concessions made by our party are also the success of our party. (3) After our party opens up political power, it is hoped that all parties will not insist on party interests being higher than everything else and should prioritize the nation and the people. In particular, it is hoped that the Communist Party will abandon its separatist regime and achieve the unification of government orders. (4) The nationalization of the military and the unified military order of the military reorganization plan must be implemented immediately. In particular, it is hoped that the Communist Party will abandon its ambition to seize power by force. (5) If parties adhere to the Three Principles of the People and affirm Chairman Chiang's leadership in national construction, especially the Communist Party's repeated declarations to strive for the thorough realization of the Three Principles of the People, they must prove it with facts, should not distort the principles, and should not use various issues to restrain the leader. (6) The five-power constitution is the legacy of the Founding Father and cannot be changed arbitrarily. The "Principles for Amending the Constitution Draft" must be corrected. (7) In view of the shortcomings of the three-branch separation system and the malpractices of the multi-party cabinet system, our country should adopt a five-yuan system and a presidential system in the future. (8) The National Assembly should exert the spirit of democracy and should not restrict its power. (9) There are a large number of ethnic minorities in the border areas. In the future, representatives of the National Assembly and members of the National Government should pay attention to their distribution quotas. Later, Sun Ke, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Tiecheng, and Shao Lizi gave supplementary explanations on the agreed matters of the Political Consultative Conference. The meeting adjourned at 6:15 p.m.

### Executive Yuan Report

[United Press International, Chongqing, 7th] The report from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee revealed that the Chinese government has signed contracts with several British shipping companies to lease ships. These ships will fly the British flag because the British government is paying the transportation costs to provide friendly assistance to China's relief efforts.

The organization has purchased 20 locomotives and 3,500 military carriages from Iran and purchased 27,000 tons of rails from abroad.

It should be known that there are still some people in our country who want to fight the Soviet Union, and Churchill is one of those who remind us of this matter. Churchill is more eloquent than anyone else. Since Churchill now has no official position, it does not matter if he makes this statement.

### Special Article: What is a Cooperative Treasury?

— Xia Gaobo

The Shanghai Cooperative Treasury Preparatory Committee held a standing committee meeting on the 27th of last month. More than ten representatives from the Municipal Social Bureau, China Farmers Bank, Shanghai Bank, China Industrial and Agricultural Bank, and various cooperatives attended. The meeting was chaired by Chen Zhongming, special commissioner for cooperative affairs of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The subscription amounts of equity capital for each unit have been drafted. It has been decided that the municipal government, China Farmers Bank, China Industrial and Agricultural Bank, Shanghai Bank, the Shanghai branch of the National Cooperative Office, and various cooperatives in the city will launch a one-time full subscription, totaling 100 million yuan in national currency. The subscription period will run from now until March 20, and the China Farmers Bank, China Industrial and Agricultural Bank, and Municipal Bank will collect the funds on behalf of the Treasury. It is expected that the Treasury can be established in April.

A cooperative treasury is a type of cooperative, a cooperative federation formed by many cooperative organizations. Its purpose is to regulate the capital of cooperative enterprises. Strictly speaking, according to the regulations of the cooperative treasury, its members (usually meaning shareholders) are cooperatives, and its customers are also cooperatives, not individuals. In terms of the task of the cooperative treasury, it is very similar to a central bank; the central bank is the bank of banks, and the cooperative treasury is the cooperative of cooperatives. Simply put, it is a cooperative financial institution jointly owned by many cooperatives, with the purpose of regulating the finances of various cooperatives.

A cooperative treasury is also a legal person, and its responsibilities are of two types: (1) limited liability and (2) guaranteed liability. In a limited liability cooperative treasury, the liability of its members (not individuals) for the treasury is limited to the amount of capital they have subscribed, just like the liability of shareholders in a limited company. In a guaranteed liability cooperative treasury, the liability of the members for the treasury is limited to a certain multiple of the amount of capital they have subscribed. In the United Kingdom, it is a guaranteed limited company. As for the multiple to be added, there are no mandatory regulations, and it can be determined by each treasury itself in its charter. Of course, the minimum is one time. The so-called "one time" (i.e., doubling) means that if one subscribes to one million yuan in national currency, one must bear a liability of two million yuan. Cooperative treasuries can be divided into four types:

(1) Central Cooperative Treasury, supervised by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Customer status: Provincial and municipal cooperative treasuries under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan, as well as cooperative federations with national scope.

A. Provincial cooperative treasury, supervised by: the cooperative authorities above the provincial level; customer status: county and municipal cooperative treasuries and cooperative federations with provincial scope.

(2) B. Municipal cooperative treasury under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan, supervised by: the cooperative authorities above the municipal level under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan. Customer status: credit cooperatives and various cooperative federations in the region.

(3) County and municipal cooperative treasuries, supervised by: cooperative authorities above the county and municipal levels. Customer status: credit cooperatives and various cooperative federations in the region.

(4) In areas below the county and municipal levels, cooperative treasury agencies may be established if necessary, and their tasks may be exercised by local credit cooperatives or credit cooperative federations.

Since cooperative treasuries are divided into four types, their sources of funds are also different: (1) The central cooperative treasury is jointly subscribed and organized by provincial and municipal cooperative treasuries under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan, as well as cooperative federations with national scope. (2) The provincial cooperative treasury is jointly subscribed and organized by county and municipal cooperative treasuries and cooperative federations with provincial scope. (3) The municipal cooperative treasury under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan and the county and municipal cooperative treasuries are jointly subscribed and organized by credit cooperatives and various cooperative federations in each region. The cooperative movement in the world has a long history, but the cooperative movement in our country has only been spontaneously launched for less than 30 years. Consumer cooperation and production cooperation are still in the promotion period, and cooperative treasuries are still in the pilot period. The entire cooperative organization system and administrative supervision are not very strict and clear. Therefore, in order to promote the establishment of cooperative treasuries, governments at all levels, Farmers Banks, local banks, and other private banks that handle agricultural loans, as well as other legal entities that do not aim to make profits, are allowed to subscribe to equity capital to facilitate their establishment. There were many cooperative treasuries established with the assistance of the China Farmers Bank in the rear area during the Anti-Japanese War. According to the bank's report in 1940, more than 200 counties had been established, providing funds of more than 38 million yuan in national currency (see my article "Rural Financial Institutions in China During Wartime" published in the 50th issue of the China-US Weekly in September 1940). The Shanghai Cooperative Treasury, which is still in preparation, is also of this nature.

The "Cooperative Treasury Regulations" promulgated by the National Government previously had minimum requirements for the total capital of cooperative treasuries. The total capital of the central cooperative treasury should be at least 10 million yuan in national currency, the provincial cooperative treasury and the municipal cooperative treasury under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan should be at least 1 million yuan in national currency, and the county and municipal cooperative treasury should be at least 100,000 yuan in national currency. This minimum amount is obviously not suitable for the current situation. Increases and decreases in the capital of cooperative treasuries must be approved by the representative assembly and reported to the competent authorities for approval before they become effective.

According to the regulations, the organization of a cooperative treasury is:

Representative Assembly — Board of Directors — Board of Supervisors — Manager — Deputy Manager — Assistant Manager — (may be established if necessary).

A cooperative treasury is a cooperative financial institution, so its business is of course similar to that of a bank, and it handles deposits, loans, remittances, and other agency payments. In addition to operating these businesses, the operating funds of the cooperative treasury must not be used for investment in any other business. This is clearly stipulated in the regulations.

Since the cooperative treasury is aimed at cooperatives and its purpose is to regulate the finances of cooperatives, its mission, as mentioned earlier, is very similar to that of a central bank. The cooperative business in our country has not yet been developed, and the strength of cooperatives is neither universal nor very large. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, there was chaos everywhere, and the economic and financial resources of farmers were almost completely destroyed. It is really not an easy task to establish a universal cooperative network in the vast recovered areas. Even if there are cooperatives, their resources will not be strong, so financial assistance from cooperative treasuries is urgently needed. We hope that the Shanghai Cooperative Treasury will be established quickly to help nearby cooperatives become increasingly developed and sound. With prices going crazy like this, the cooperative movement is really an army of salvation.

Cooperatives need cooperative treasuries, and similarly, cooperative treasuries must also have cooperatives so that their funds can have an outlet and be used effectively. This is truly a "win-win situation." At present, with prices going crazy like this, the weakness of rural finance is really the most serious problem. More than 79% of the people in our country are farmers. If farmers have weak purchasing power, no guarantee of livelihood, economic recovery cannot be discussed, economic construction cannot be discussed, and national industrialization is just a dream. To save the countryside and prevent bankruptcy, in addition to large-scale agricultural loans, the universal cooperative business is indeed a good way, so is a strong cooperative treasury not a very important thing?

After the rice shops were vandalized by the public, the government has set a maximum rice price of 23,000 yuan. However, many rice shops are still using various excuses to delay reopening or are selling inferior rice, causing considerable public anxiety. It is reported that black market rice prices in the Chengzhan and Qingtai Road areas have reached over 30,000 yuan. Fortunately, the Rehabilitation Administration Branch Office has recently distributed a batch of flour in Hangzhou, using the provincial Cooperative Marketing Office and 15 rice shops as subsidized price units. The price is set at 6,000 yuan per bag (including the sack), with a limit of five bags per person, and 140 yuan per jin. All citizens can purchase it. It is reported that the head office still has 100,000 bags of flour, which will be transported to Hangzhou soon to provide assistance.

Soaring Grain Prices Lead to Rice Shop Vandalism

Grain prices in this port have been rising daily since the beginning of spring. After discussions between the county government and relevant trade associations, it was decided to sell rice at 11.5 jin per thousand yuan. Yesterday morning, the Yeh Yanqing Rice Shop on Ma Hang and Seng Street suddenly posted a price of 8 jin per thousand yuan, causing a dispute. Rice factories in the Shuangmen and Shuitoumen areas did not sell a single grain of rice. The common people, unable to obtain food, became panicked, leading to a wave of unrest. Rice factories in areas such as Dananmen and Xiaonanmen were vandalized, and large quantities of rice were dumped into the river. Groups of people marched in the streets, and shops throughout the city closed down. The situation only quieted down after the Security Headquarters announced martial law.

### Improving Road System for Traffic Convenience, Jielu Road to be Widened First, Construction Decided to Start This Month, Part of Zhejiang Road to be Modified into Arcades

The width of Jielu Road varies. In order to improve the city's appearance, improve the road system, and facilitate traffic, the municipal authorities will first widen the important Jielu Road leading to the North Railway Station. The railway authorities will voluntarily concede 5 meters of roadbed, widening the road to 35 meters. The Public Works Bureau has decided to start construction this month.

Lower Levels to be Demolished for Sidewalks

After the widening of Jielu Road starts, the width of Zhejiang Road, which directly connects to the North Railway Station, will be widened to 20 meters. However, due to the prosperity and dense population of Zhejiang Road, it has been decided to start construction on the South and North sections of Zhejiang Road first, and then proceed with the middle section after the construction of the two sections is completed. All steel-reinforced concrete buildings will have their lower levels demolished and rebuilt into arcades for pedestrian passage, following the construction of houses on Gongguan Road. Furthermore, the Public Works Bureau is also planning to widen the roads of North Xizang Road and Xinmin Road. This plan has been submitted to the municipal government for approval.

Illegal Buildings to be Gradually Removed

Regarding the entire road system, according to reliable sources, the Public Works Bureau will first start reorganizing the Xuhui and Nanshi areas. In the Xuhui area, where roads were illegally built beyond the concession boundaries, illegal buildings that do not comply with the road system stipulated by the pre-war municipal government will be gradually removed. The entire road system of the city will be announced after the master plan of the urban planning committee is completed, so as not to conflict with the urban planning master plan.

Nanshi and Zhabei to be Reorganized First

Nanshi and Zhabei districts have suffered severe damage. The Public Works and Land Administration Bureaus are currently jointly handling land registration and road reorganization, making adjustments based on actual needs and the well-being of citizens. Therefore, before the Public Works Bureau completes and announces the road system map, it will not issue formal construction permits for construction requests in areas outside the Huangpu District, but will issue temporary permits. This is because if the road system is changed, the building will have to be demolished accordingly.

### Japanese Nationals Management Office Reports on Work Overview

[Our Report] The Japanese Nationals Management Office of the Third Front Army held a reception for reporters in the auditorium yesterday to report on the overview of its work.

These technical personnel can be divided into two categories: (1) those originally retained by various agencies, and (2) those requisitioned by receiving agencies due to needs. Subsequently, Deputy Director Zou Renzhi explained the "horror hut" incident to the outside world. At this time, Commander Enbo arrived and reported on the process of accepting the surrender and the tasks of the Japanese Nationals Management Office.

### Nine Department Stores Announce Automatic Closure, Refusing to Concede to Labor Demands Anymore, Four Thousand Employees Petitioned Collectively Yesterday

[Our Report] Since the labor dispute occurred on the 23rd of last month, the nine major department stores, including Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, China National Products, Sun Wah, Yue Hsin, Chung Hwa, and Lilian, have been in turmoil for almost a month. Although the Social Affairs Bureau has mediated five times, a compromise has not been reached due to the base salary issue, so it has not been resolved. From 3 PM to 5 PM the day before yesterday, employees of various companies staged a demonstration by going on strike for two hours, urging the management to make concessions. After joint discussions, the management of the nine companies also took a unified action and announced the automatic closure of the stores starting at 9:15 AM yesterday.

Holding Emergency Meeting

More than 3,000 employees immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures. It was decided to submit a request to the relevant authorities, ordering the management to resume business immediately, and to hold a collective march of 4,000 people at 2 PM to petition the Social Affairs Bureau, demanding that the Bureau handle the matter fairly. They believed that the management's automatic closure was an illegal action and requested sanctions. According to a labor representative who spoke to the reporter, the management of the Sun Sun and Wing On companies once expressed their acceptance of the labor's demands. However, after the successful organization of a joint organization by the management of the nine companies, they no longer made concessions to the labor and adopted a tough attitude, even at the expense of declaring liquidation and dismissing some employees. It was also stated that the labor's demand for a base salary was originally 79 yuan, but after repeated concessions, it was reduced to 69 yuan, but the management only agreed to 40 yuan and insisted on not increasing it.

Ruling Sent Out

Because the mediation could not be established, the Social Affairs Bureau sent a decision to both parties yesterday morning, stipulating that the base salary for clerks should be 60 yuan, assistant clerks 50 yuan, and trainees 45 yuan, with adjustments made at any time according to the current month's cost of living index. However, because the management suddenly announced the automatic closure, the situation became more confusing. It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to the management urging them to resume business, and the relevant authorities are also closely monitoring its development.

In addition, representatives of employees from the nine major department stores in this city are scheduled to receive reporters from various newspapers at 1:30 PM today (the 8th) at the China National Products Company's Fellows Association on the third floor of the Quanggong Building at No. 334 Nanjing Road to explain the details of the incident.

### Representatives Not Released, Tram Won't Operate

[Our Report] More than 500 employees of the British Tramway Company gathered at the head office on Hardoon Road at around 9 AM yesterday and marched to the Social Affairs Bureau on Avenue Joffre to petition, requesting the Social Affairs Bureau to assist in securing the release of the arrested representatives Zhang Xuekui and two others. Later, the Social Affairs Bureau sent a member to accompany two representatives to negotiate with the Garrison Headquarters, but the Garrison Headquarters stated that the three workers were suspected of treason, and whether they were guilty or not must be investigated and tried by the court, and they could not be released casually. The workers stated that if the representatives were not released for one day, they would not sell tickets or drive the trams for one day. Yesterday, all tram and trolleybus lines of the British company were suspended, and rickshaws and pedicabs profited threefold. Citizens felt very inconvenienced.

### After the Bank of China Allows Forward Foreign Exchange Settlements, Fluctuations Occur in the Financial Market

Nearly 100 Applicants for Type A Operating Firms

Yesterday, the financial market in this city fluctuated again, with both gold and US dollars rising. It is rumored that the reason for the fluctuation was due to the Central Bank's release of forward exchange rates for April, May, and June, which were higher than the spot rates. However, the Central Bank authorities solemnly denied this, saying that the US exchange rate announced by the Central Bank yesterday was still 2020 yuan, and remained unchanged throughout the day. However, because the import period of foreign goods ordered by importers cannot be predetermined, the Central Bank specially allowed forward settlements for the months of April, May, and June to facilitate merchants' import business. The exchange rate for the spot market is still 2020 yuan. From now until April 7, it is 2120 yuan, until May 7, it is 2220 yuan, and until June 7, it is 2330 yuan. The reason why the exchange rate is higher than the spot rate is because interest is added. Currently, the black market interest rate is too high, exceeding 20%, while the interest rate set by the Bank of China this time is less than 5%. In addition, the Foreign Exchange Examination Office has received a total of 95 applications for Type A operating firms. By day, there were 13 on the first day, 38 on the second day, 33 on the third day, and 11 on the fourth day. There were also 15 cases of brokers dealing in foreign exchange.

### Free Movie Screenings for Laborers

### Unauthorized Driving Causes Accident

At 6 PM, the Shanghai Women's Association will hold a banquet for the women's community at the Municipal Party Headquarters auditorium. The March 8th Commemoration Preparatory Committee also issued a March 8th Declaration, the main points of which are: "We are not talking about women's liberation now, we are just doing it practically; women's liberation is already the demand of the times and will inevitably be successful, and no one has the power to stop it. From now on, we must use a more heroic attitude and a more practical style to shoulder the responsibilities given to us by the nation and the state, and to shoulder the responsibilities given to us by the times."

### News Censorship in This City Canceled

The municipal government received a telegram from the Central Propaganda Department yesterday stating that news censorship in the recovered areas would be canceled from the date of the telegram. The news censorship agency in this city was originally named the Jiangsu News Censorship Office, under the wartime News Censorship Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission. Last November, the central government stipulated that news censorship business should be handled by local governments. The news censorship agency in this city was transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Government on December 1st of last year and renamed the Shanghai Temporary News Censorship Office. The office stopped censorship immediately after receiving the order.

### Heard the Verdict, Looked Depressed, Japanese War Criminal Ishihara Isamu Sentenced to Life Imprisonment, Life Imprisonment and Forced Labor

[Our Report] Ishihara Isamu, 36 years old, a former translator at the Japanese Jiangwan and Wusong concentration camps, was sentenced yesterday at 3 PM in the Tilanqiao Prison after four trials by the US Military Tribunal. Before the court session, Ishihara Isamu's attitude was natural, with a smile on his face. Although smoking was prohibited in the courtroom, Ishihara Isamu was an exception. After the judge and the defendant's defense counsel were seated, Judge Middleton ordered Ishihara Isamu to step forward to hear the verdict. He declared that Ishihara Isamu was accused of seven major crimes, which were all found guilty by the court's vote. It was also decided by a two-thirds secret vote to sentence him to life imprisonment and forced labor for life, and the place of imprisonment would be determined by the competent authorities. After hearing the verdict, Ishihara Isamu's expression suddenly became serious and tense. However, when he was escorted back by the military police, he was still smoking, trying to appear calm.

Portuguese Leimdys Quibbles and Denies the Charges

[Our Report] The Portuguese Leimdys (i.e. Leimidy) is a strong player in the Portuguese merchant football team in this port.

[Our Report] The reporter visited Xi Yushu, a senator and Vice-Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Temporary Council, yesterday and asked him whether it was possible that the convening of the Temporary Council would be stopped because it was rumored that formal senators would be elected at the end of April.

### To Revive Our Silk Industry, The First Batch of Mulberry Seedlings Arrived in Shanghai from Japan, 300,000 Centimeters of Silkworm Eggs Will Also Arrive

### The Rapid Advance of New Benchmarks and Institutions in British and American Social Services

— Wang Keji

Special Dispatch from Chongqing by Our Newspaper

The author, Mr. Wang Ke, arrived in the United States last August, traveling through New York and other places for a total of five months. On his return journey, he traveled from America to England, staying there for less than two months. He was urgently called back by telegram and then traveled through Continental Europe: France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Italy, Greece, Iran, India, and other countries. He finally returned to Chongqing in February of this year. This trip was commissioned by the Ministry of Social Affairs to investigate social service undertakings, with special emphasis on various aspects of community social service centers. This is the first report, which describes the current state of social service undertakings in Britain and America in a concise and essential manner, suitable for reference by all sectors of society—Editor.

Policy

Social service undertakings in Britain and America are purely based on the voluntary contribution of manpower and resources by the people. They complement national policies, assist the government in areas where it falls short, and enhance social welfare. This is their policy and their purpose. However, the terminology differs: in Britain, it is called social service; in America, it is called social work, and recently also social welfare or public welfare. The types of services increase or decrease depending on the time and circumstances, but Britain and America share many similarities, such as welfare for children, adult education, family welfare, labor welfare, assistance for the elderly, weak, and disabled, disaster relief, social insurance, vocational introduction and guidance, medical and health services, mental illness treatment, services for veterans and demobilized soldiers, youth services, rural services, housing and urban planning, consumer cooperation, assistance for travelers, entertainment, etc. Recent American history has focused on various services for domestic Black people and international services, the former to harmonize races, the latter to benefit the world. All of the above are within the scope of the government's existing or future policies and responsibilities. The people, out of benevolence, assist the government's policies through social service. Based on this argument, social service and political construction are closely related and promote the realization of ideal political construction.

Organization

Most social service undertakings in Britain and America are non-governmental organizations. In recent years, a good social service ethos has developed in society, unlike in the past when only religious groups were involved. The organization of various social service groups is mostly divided into a board of directors and an executive department. Whether local or national, the board of directors is responsible for presiding over the organization, while the executive department is responsible for handling affairs. In order to promote the people's service ethos, the government respects these organizations and does not require registration, nor does it supervise or direct them. People in Britain and America believe that this undertaking is voluntary and do not want to be governed by the government, otherwise it would invisibly suppress its ethos. Because the British and American people have a strong sense of responsibility, the boards of directors earnestly manage affairs, and the government can trust them to do so. Therefore, there is no governing body at the local or central level in Britain and America. Although the government establishes or manages administrative agencies or undertakings for social welfare according to the needs of the people, such as the British and American labor departments and social insurance, vocational introduction, and other undertakings, the British Assistance Board, and the American local government welfare departments, these administrative agencies do not govern non-governmental organizations, but only coordinate and cooperate with them as a form of governance, and are not social service undertakings. Therefore, social service undertakings in Britain and America, whether in wartime or peacetime, have developed very rapidly due to their free development, evolving from a broad range of individual efforts to a close-knit cooperation with division of labor. There are social work and fundraising committees nationwide and in various localities in America, and social service committees nationwide and in various localities in Britain. These are joint organizations of social service undertakings, similar to the China Social Service Advancement Association, which aims to promote the division of labor and cooperation to improve work efficiency. For example, during the recent war, six organizations, including the National Catholic Community Service, the National Jewish Welfare Board, the Salvation Army, and the National Travelers Aid Association, jointly organized the United Service Organizations (USO) to concentrate manpower and resources to serve the front and rear, achieving remarkable results and earning a high reputation. They also held joint fundraising events. This is a good example of cooperation. Recently, the British National Council of Social Service is further expanding the strengthening and establishment of local social service committees. The above-mentioned group organizations are organized and systematic groups in British and American non-governmental social service organizations, and their achievements have become increasingly significant. The remaining groups are divided according to the type of service: one, a certain need arises only in a certain place and not elsewhere; two, a temporary need arises and dissolves after a certain period of time; three, there are several groups in various places with a national federation organization; four, various social service undertakings run by religious groups in various places have numerous names, which cannot be listed here one by one. The social service organizations in Britain and America that have a long history and are widespread in various places can be summarized as: (1) YMCA and YWCA; (2) Red Cross (the British and American Red Cross have services covering disaster relief, assistance, culture, transportation, family welfare, nutrition, entertainment, etc. Branches are widespread in various places in peacetime and extend to the military in wartime); (3) Boy Scouts; (4) Friendly Neighbors Association (called Residential Settlement in England and Settlement in America, which does not have a proper translation in the country yet, its content is to serve neighbors); (5) Women's Clubs. Of the above five organizations, the first three are well-known in our country, while the latter two are less known, but their history and achievements are equal to the YMCA and Red Cross. In summary, the YMCA, Red Cross, Friendly Neighbors Association, Women's Clubs, and other four organizations in Britain and America all rely on social service centers as their regular work focus. For example, the local branches of the YMCA and YWCA, the local friendly neighbor houses (Settlement House) of the Friendly Neighbors Association, and the Women's Clubs, except for the Boy Scouts, which provide a wide range of services, all use these types of central locations as the basis for carrying out various services. Recently, the British National Council of Social Service is launching rural service centers. In rural America, 4-H clubs are being launched. 4-H stands for Head (intelligence), Heart (morality), Hand (skills), and Health (body). It is for farmers and young people aged ten to twenty. There are already 1,700,000 members nationwide. This movement is promoted by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry and has been effective in assisting the government in implementing policies in peacetime. There are also club locations. Therefore, social service undertakings in Britain and America have trended towards the social service center model, which is similar to the social service centers run by the author during the war in our country. Local governments in America also have this type of facility called welfare stations. These centers are places where people gather daily, and various services can be widely extended to the people through their organization, not only benefiting the people but also fostering a democratic spirit.

Funding

The funding for social service undertakings in Britain and America comes purely from donations and is not subject to government support. Fundraisers cooperate with local organizations to jointly develop plans each year according to needs, determine budget estimates, and launch unified fundraising. The fundraising period is one month or several months, and they can all obtain the actual reports of social work and the detailed and reasonable expenditure listed to gain social trust. Although many British organizations raise funds from society on their own, they have recently tended towards joint fundraising. In addition to joint fundraising in America, there are also foundation donations or fundraising. Wealthy individuals contribute funds, designate welfare undertakings, and establish associations to manage the funds. The American government levies taxes, but mostly invests the funds in enterprises, using the surplus as funding. If the funds are deposited, the interest is very low. The second is to commemorate someone or launch a fundraising campaign for a certain event to fund designated welfare undertakings, but there are also occasional direct fundraising campaigns. The above-mentioned foundation donations or fundraising are also largely similar in Britain. In America, there is another type of donation that is coordinated with newspapers to appeal to society. For example, on December 9th last year, The New York Times sponsored the New York Social Service Society, the United Jewish Charities, and other six organizations to hold a hundred-case rescue campaign. The circumstances of how a hundred individuals or families in need of assistance were in distress, how to provide assistance, and how much funding was needed were listed in detail in the newspaper, along with illustrations depicting the distressed situation awaiting rescue. Each case required 300 to 1,000 US dollars. In less than ten days, the donations exceeded the amount needed. Donors contributed several dollars, tens of dollars, hundreds of dollars, etc., or designated to donate the funding for one or several cases. This campaign has been held annually since 1912 and has achieved very good results. It is similar to our country's winter relief campaign during the winter season, but its methods are much more advanced.

Talent

The talent in British and American social service undertakings is divided into professional and volunteer. According to Ann Elizabeth, the General Secretary of the American Association of Social Workers, there are currently 100,000 social work professionals in America. Those who graduated from social work schools account for 20%, those who received training after employment account for 20%, and the remaining 60% are those who have not received professional education. Women account for 85% of the personnel, but there is no personnel system. They rely on a passionate heart and can engage in this work for life. The number of professional personnel in Britain has also increased during the war, but statistical figures are not yet available. The ethos of volunteering is booming, especially during the war. For example, in military service and various rear services, women also account for the majority. These volunteer service personnel do not avoid hardship and danger and do not receive compensation. Their service spirit is admirable. Regarding professional education for social service workers, there are as many as 42 social work schools in America, most of which belong to universities, like a college. The social work schools of Columbia University and the University of Chicago are well-run and enjoy a high reputation. Although there are no specialized schools in Britain, a special committee was jointly organized by universities and service organizations in 1918. It designated universities to offer elective courses related to social service and designated social service agencies or organizations for internships, ranging from several months to two years. Certificates or degrees are awarded by the schools, limited to university graduates and experienced social workers or students who volunteer to study. The purpose of this approach is to enhance their knowledge of sociology and general knowledge, and the experience gained from internships is still beneficial. In addition, Britain and America have implemented international exchanges, visits, internships, and research for social service workers, in order to expand their theoretical knowledge and skills. The author, representing our country, has discussed and promoted this with Britain and America and will strive to make it happen.

Conclusion

In summary, British and American social service undertakings are based on: (1) the encouragement of the government, implying encouragement through non-interference, enabling the ethos of public service to flourish; (2) relying on the skills of professional personnel, perfecting skills through action, enabling the widespread development of service undertakings, assisting governance, and benefiting the country and the people. These two cornerstones can serve as a reference for us and are the concluding remarks of the author's observations on this trip.

American Farms Implement Crop Rotation: A certain farm in eastern New York is implementing a four-year crop rotation plan. The method is to plant crops in different areas or rows and change the varieties planted each year in rotation.

### Reader's Opinion: A Personal View on Punishing Traitors

Editor:

After the victory, large and small traitors have been arrested one after another. The central government has clearly stipulated in the regulations on handling traitors that those below the commissioned level who held positions in the puppet regime within the past eight years due to hunger and cold must be judged based on the facts of their crimes, as reported or accused by the people. Only after investigation and verification can they be treated as traitors. The intention is to carefully handle the above-mentioned puppet regime personnel, striving to avoid injustices and promote unity to achieve the mission of national reconstruction. This approach is also painstakingly thought out. However, many troops and local governments have largely failed to appreciate this intention and often act emotionally, arbitrarily listening to the people's accusations and illegally arresting puppet regime personnel, resulting in extortion and blackmail, which is often heard of. If this continues, there will be no peaceful days. Not only will innocent people be harmed, creating opportunities for corruption, but also resentment will deepen. Once forced to take risks, it will hinder local security and the future of national reconstruction. I am a citizen of the country and sincerely cannot remain silent. Therefore, I will present my limited views as follows:

(1) The government should quickly finalize the verdicts for the arrested traitors to demonstrate credibility.

(2) A deadline should be set for the people to report those below the commissioned level who held positions in the puppet regime, and accusations should be stopped after the deadline, so as to concentrate manpower and enhance national reconstruction effectiveness.

(3) Any troops or local governments handling traitor cases should comply with the central government's laws and regulations. Violations should be treated as dereliction of duty to prevent abuses.

Although the above points may have omissions, they are of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. I dare to ask your newspaper to publish them to express public opinion. Jiang Cheng (March 3rd)

Family

### "To Raise Without Teaching is the Father's Fault"

— Tracing the Cause

We often see in the newspapers announcements of "severing the relationship between father and son (or father and daughter, mother and son, mother and daughter)" and "statements expelling bad sons," which invariably say: "Rebellious son (or bad son) so-and-so is willing to become depraved, associating with criminals, and repeatedly refuses to repent... Severing the relationship between father and son, in the future, if he borrows money from others or engages in any illegal activities, it will have nothing to do with me."

Whenever I see such announcements, I always feel that the parents of those "ungrateful sons" view the relationship between parents and children too simply and superficially—almost like friends! And they take it too easy to extinguish the relationship between parents and children with just an announcement!

Is the relationship between parents and children possible? Is there anyone in the world without parents? The physiological relationship between parents and children cannot be eliminated by human power, nor can it be severed by a few lines of announcement. This is impossible in fact, and it is not allowed by the conscience of the parents.

In today's society, where the family is still a unit of society, the children in the family should be well-educated by the parents. No one is born with the habit of "willing to become depraved." If they are "willing to become depraved," it is a failure of parental education. Parents should bear the responsibility for the failure. How can the responsibility be lightly shrugged off with the four words "repeatedly refuses to repent"? Of course, the downfall of a child is also related to the school and society. We cannot place all the responsibility squarely on the parents, but the parents should bear the greatest responsibility, which is beyond doubt. When a child goes astray, society has one more—no, it should be said that it has one more "black sheep." This is the crime of the parents, and they should deeply blame themselves, reflecting on where they have failed to educate their children in the past and how to remedy it in the future. Perhaps the parents' own consciousness and behavior are incorrect and improper. Then, "if their own conduct is not upright," naturally "their orders will not be followed." If so, they must first repent and correct their mistakes, and then cultivate themselves to exert a demonstrative effect in the family. It must be understood that there cannot be a double standard of morality in a family. It is not permissible for parents to smoke opium under the pretext of being old and sick, but not allow their children to smoke; it is not permissible for fathers to have three wives and four concubines under the pretext of having many descendants, but not allow their sons to engage in frivolous activities—all kinds of contradictory phenomena!

When their children go astray, parents simply publish a few lines of announcement to shirk all responsibility. But may I ask, where will your children go? Especially in Chinese society, society has never been responsible for education. Naturally, beggars, vagrants, thieves, and prostitutes will be their inevitable destination. As long as the parents no longer have to spend their money, no longer have to be implicated or disturbed by their children, they will "regard the prosperity or poverty of their children as if they were from a different country."

"To raise without teaching is the father's fault." I believe that this kind of crime of not fulfilling parental responsibilities is even worse than abandoning infants on the roadside. Abandoning infants is certainly cruel, but "expelling bad sons" will cause even more harm to society. However, abandoning infants is a punishable crime under the law, while "expelling bad sons" is not subject to legal sanctions!

Society

### Chinese Women Under Feudal Forces

— Wan Zi

Feudal society is a male-centered society. Women in feudal society have no status, especially since the Chinese feudal system has undergone a particularly long period of development. Therefore, the constraints and misfortunes suffered by Chinese women are particularly profound.

There have also been women in history who have served as the political center of China, such as Wu Zetian. She was very talented and a very outstanding politician, but this was only an occasional event, and when she was in power, she did not change the status of women in society at that time. She acted like a man as emperor, and her officials were all men.

Although the Chinese feudal social history of more than two thousand years has had different ideologies in its development stages, the Confucian thought supported by the ruling class of feudal society has always been advocated and worshiped. Confucius's attitude towards women was "Only women and petty men are difficult to deal with," placing petty men and women side by side, which has some class meaning. Petty men are the ruled class, discriminated against and driven to run errands, and women are no exception. They are supported and played with to survive.

Later scholars promoted Confucius's theory of women and petty men, repeatedly quoting and proving that women are a source of misfortune. This is the "female disaster" in history, and therefore the status of women has continued to decline.

In order to prevent women from resisting or stepping out of the realm of being ruled in thought and action, feudal scholars formulated many "virtues" that women should abide by and also produced some special books, such as Biographies of Heroic Women, Female Rules, Female Analects, and Daughter's Sutras. The summary of these books is no more than the three obediences and four virtues, which everyone knows.

However, these theories obviously still have some women who cannot fully "abide by," and the method of rewards came into being. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, "heroic women" were most valued, and many chastity arches were built during these two periods. However, the punishment for violations was also particularly severe. Murdering one's husband was considered a hundred times more serious than robbery and murder. The "seven grounds for divorce" was an even more incredible law, although this law existed before then.

The highest expression of feudal society's oppression of women is concretely expressed as "lack of talent is a virtue for women." Women were not allowed to read books, only allowed to do things at home, and at the same time had their feet bound, losing their freedom of action forever.

In recent decades, from the Xinhai Revolution to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Chinese women have gained some freedom and liberation, but the feudal remnants have obviously not diminished. This explains why the vast majority of Chinese women—especially in rural areas and small cities—are still in a miserable life and unequal circumstances.

Feudalism and women's issues are inextricably linked. Feudal society has undergone a particularly long period of time, and its roots are therefore particularly deep. Solving the women's issue should also eliminate the remaining feudal forces.

### The Origin of International Women's Day

— Ou Li

International Women's Day originated in the United States.

In March 1909, the American women's community expressed dissatisfaction with the inequality between men and women and held a grand Women's Day in major cities across the country. All women's groups participated. This was the embryo of International Women's Day.

In 1910, the Socialist Women's Congress was held in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. It proposed that March 8th of each year be designated as International Women's Day, with the goal of obtaining women's suffrage and political rights, while promoting the economic and social liberation of women. Since then, women in various countries have held International Women's Day every year.

This is how International Women's Day was born.

### Women Having Talent Is Virtue (Part 2)

— Yang Tongfang

Looking Down on Morality and Ignoring Power

Those who say "Lack of talent in women is a virtue" overlook these two points: First, they do not recognize the social significance of morality, underestimate the scope of morality, and ignore the factors of the times and social changes. A woman who is unprogressive, conservative, and weak is regarded as virtuous. Without a sense of justice or a career ambition, only knowing to be respectful, tolerant, and yielding under the enslavement of men, not showing a bit of personality, not revealing a bit of emotion, not knowing to strive for one's own independent personality, not knowing to improve one's knowledge and economic status through learning and working, and spending a lifetime in ignorance – to call this "virtue" is to underestimate the ideal of morality, no, it is simply misunderstanding the intrinsic and extrinsic meaning of morality. Second, it covets the greatest power in the world – knowledge. We must know that sufficient knowledge is the guide to our good behavior. Without true insight, how can there be expressions of noble behavior? Many heroes and heroines of virtue in ancient times, their heroic and righteous virtues, are worthy of being passed down for thousands of years and will never perish. Which of them did not have rich talent and learning? Yue Wu Mu, Wen Tianxiang, Shi Kefa, and other great patriots in history, their ardent hearts, were all forged by knowledge. They had a very noble ideal of life. They knew where justice and truth lay, who were the enemies, and what could not be compromised. After sighing, "What have we learned from reading the books of sages?", they resolutely sacrificed their lives for righteousness and completed their benevolence through martyrdom.

Moral behavior is a reflection of knowledge and a practice of knowledge. "Knowing" and "doing" are certainly two different things, but there must be a connection between the two to express their significance. Wang Yangming advocated the theory of "unity of knowledge and action," saying that action comes from knowledge. He believed that "some people know but do not act," in reality, it is "not true knowledge." The Father of the Nation strongly advocated the doctrine of "knowing is difficult, acting is easy," even more so to encourage people to strive for true knowledge. In the modern world, China is the most backward in science and has the lowest cultural level. Popularizing the wisdom of the people and promoting culture are urgently needed in the process of nation-building. However, women's education in China is even less widespread. The knowledge of ordinary women is very poor, and they have very few educational opportunities. These ignorant and uninformed women not only cannot participate in social work and become "members of society" who serve the people, but even if they are taught to manage the household and educate their children, they cannot be ideal mothers and wives due to the lack of modern family knowledge. Therefore, the urgent task is to improve women's knowledge level and popularize women's educational opportunities. – Amidst the chorus of "striving for women's suffrage" and "promoting equal economic status for men and women," we must thoroughly discard the reactionary teachings of "lack of talent in women is virtue" that have dominated the minds of the general public in our country for thousands of years and quickly replace them with "women having talent is virtue"!

The So-Called "Talented Women" of Ancient Times

It is said that in ancient China, there were so-called "talented women" whose brilliance was outstanding and intelligence surpassed others, but who were often weak in physique, had unfortunate lives, and drifted throughout their lives.

They met unsuitable partners, or died before middle age. Those so-called "great scholars" in society then said that because they were too intelligent and their talent was too extraordinary, they inevitably had thin virtue. According to the arguments of modern physiologists and psychologists, true geniuses do not belong to them – geniuses should be superior in all aspects, with both body and mind developing to the highest degree. Furthermore, it is also wrong to look at the whole from a part. To draw the conclusion that "lack of talent in women is virtue" based on the misfortunes of a few "talented women" is just as illogical as the saying "beautiful women have ill-fated lives since ancient times." Moreover, the idea that high intelligence and rich talent easily lead to an unsound character is especially absurd. I cannot deny that a small number of women with a high level of knowledge and moderate intelligence may inevitably have lapses in behavior, but this can only be regarded as accidental and is insufficient to prove "lack of talent in women is virtue." In fact, those who make this kind of example are simply admitting that "women who have talent have no virtue." But on the other hand, I cannot deny that women with a higher level of knowledge and intelligence must have higher life ideals than ordinary women, and their thoughts must be more progressive than ordinary women, and their contributions to the family and society must be greater than ordinary women.

Motive Determines the Value of Behavior

Moreover, modern ethicists unanimously agree that the most important thing in determining the standard of moral behavior is the "motive" that creates the behavior. The same good behavior must also be judged by the goodness of the "motive" to determine the value of the behavior. This means that the results of many people's behavior may be very good, but the "motive" is not necessarily good. To make our "motive" good, it is all a matter of "knowing." The good behavior of an ignorant person can only be regarded as accidental, blind, not conscious, not purposeful.

The moral behavior needed by modern citizens should naturally be completely conscious and purposeful: understanding why this matter must be done in this way. Loyal and courageous behavior is good, but

What is the meaning of loyalty and courage? That is something that the ignorant and uninformed cannot understand. It is certainly good to have good behavior, but wouldn't it be even better if the "motive" is also good?

In any aspect, my proposed "women having talent is virtue" has a sociological and psychological basis. I hope that the social circles' view on women's education should not deviate from the social evolution and the requirements of the times, and should re-measure the social and psychological standards of the past. On the one hand, I more enthusiastically hope that women themselves will stand up and demand: popularize women's educational opportunities, improve women's knowledge and skills, strive for independent personality through thorough self-awareness, so as to achieve true political and economic equality for men and women!

### Family Maxims

— Wen Quanlu

Movement generates vital energy, thrift gathers and conserves energy. With these two words, there is no reason why family fortunes will not flourish.

If the family is harmonious, blessings will arise naturally. If in a family, the elder brother speaks and the younger brother obeys, and the younger brother asks and the elder brother responds, harmony rises and fills the household. There is no reason for the family to not prosper. Conversely, there is no reason for the family to not fall apart if the inverse happens.

When brothers are harmonious, even the poorest families will thrive; when brothers are not harmonious, even noble and powerful families will fall.

Random Thoughts

### Trifling Words on Women's Day

— Zhang Wanyu

Today is another March 8th Women's Day. I really want to say some grand and beautiful words, but I can't say them. After thinking for a long time, I can only say a few "words."

Everyone knows that this Women's Day is a day for women to vent their anger. On this day, women, whether they can do it or not, must hold a meeting, give a speech, and march to commemorate it. It's like this every year. In China alone, there have been more than twenty times.

On this day, knowledgeable people stand on the stage and shout loudly, and uneducated people follow behind and yell wildly. After a busy day, when they wake up, they forget everything that happened the day before. Knowledgeable women still have disagreements with their husbands and suffer psychological abuse; uneducated women are beaten by their husbands and suffer physical abuse. Why? Economic dependence is a major reason.

Do women with money always have a good life? Not necessarily. At least they won't be scolded for wanting some money for groceries, or scolded for wanting some pocket money.

Women will never have a good life if they don't recognize their own position, what they should do, and what they need to do. Taking shortcuts and flattering men only results in being labeled as a "flower vase." Knowledgeable women are not necessarily greater or more moral than uneducated women. Rural women, in addition to their primary role of giving birth and raising children, also till the land, cut grass, carry water, and grind flour, and are in no way inferior to men. China can exist on Earth because of the strength of 70-80% of its farmers, and in farming, women and men are equal, so rural women are not disgraceful.

On the other hand, what about knowledgeable women? Those who participate in politics are fighting for power, those who talk about culture are excluding each other, and those who run businesses are undercutting each other. They only look at the shadows in the clouds, and rarely sincerely care about the hard-working women of the masses. They only care about taking advantage of themselves and showing off.

They can't write articles, sew clothes, cook, make rice, take care of children, teach students, lift a hoe, or sweep the floor. They just sit in cars or rickshaws provided by men to do "women's movement," which is really a joke.

Therefore, it's their own fault that they are looked down upon and pushed out by men. Women, don't cover your noses and cry, only hard work is useful. What? This is a trifle, do you want to listen or not?

Marriage

### Proxy Marriage

— Mi Weiliang

——The Man With the Most Marriages

In the court of Kansas City, Kansas, stands a tall, middle-aged man wearing glasses. Beside him is a young and beautiful woman, holding his hand. It turns out that they are undergoing the marriage ceremony. As the ceremony is completed, the middle-aged man gently pats the woman's back and kisses her forehead.

The groom said to the judge: "Thank you, you troubled yourself." At the same time, he gave the judge a five-dollar bill.

"Is this your thirty-eighth or thirty-ninth marriage?" the judge asked him.

"Thirty-ninth marriage," the middle-aged man replied.

This middle-aged man is called Thomas Finnegan. Although he has been married thirty-nine times, he has never divorced, nor has his wife ever died, and each of his marriages is legal.

It turns out that in February 1943, he received a letter from a Miss White, saying: Near Lake Superior, a young lady and a sailor are deeply in love. When they were preparing to get married, the sailor suddenly received orders and needed to go overseas immediately, but they still hoped to find a way to get married. So, a lawyer in Chicago suggested to Miss White that he had heard that the state of Kansas had a law for proxy marriage. So Miss White asked Finnegan if he knew about this matter.

After reading the letter, Finnegan went to look up law books and found that it was true. He also asked a local judge to be the officiant, and wrote to Miss White saying: If this lady is willing to come to Kansas City to hold a proxy marriage ceremony, he would be happy to represent her husband and be a groom in the wedding ceremony. A few weeks later, they held the wedding.

Later, he represented an army soldier in a church and got engaged to a Chicago lady. In the following months, he averaged two marriages per week. Before Japan surrendered, he had already scheduled thirty wedding dates. At that time, there were more than sixty applications to him for this type of wedding.

Most of the wives he married often wrote to him after the wedding, telling him how their lives were after the wedding. Most of them were very happy. However, one wife asked Finnegan to represent her husband and go to court to go through divorce procedures. So he wrote to her, asking her to explain the reasons for the divorce, and hoped that she would consider the matter carefully and not act rashly. At the same time, he also wrote to her husband, telling him his position and situation in this case. In short, Finnegan hoped that they could reconcile.

Before the end of this war, he received letters from three service members, saying that they wanted to get married, but their lovers were serving the country and were far away overseas, so he was also prepared to use his own wife.

Finnegan's profession is a lawyer, but he doesn't want to get rich by proxy marriage. So, he only charges fifteen U.S. dollars each time he gets married. The lawyer is because only Kansas in the United States has this law: people can legally marry by proxy, so many ladies come from thousands of miles away. Some come from Los Angeles in the west, and some come from Corona in the east. Finnegan represents their lovers and acts as a groom in the wedding ceremony, representing these sailors and soldiers overseas to swear. Most ladies have a very good impression of Finnegan: they feel that he is not only clever and intelligent, but also understands human affairs and people's psychology.

As for Finnegan's own wife, she is not jealous of him being a groom in proxy marriages. Once she said to others: "I don't care how many times Finnegan gets married, because he doesn't go on a honeymoon with these girls!"

Arrangement

### Ten Principles of Room Arrangement

—

The post-war world is generally experiencing a housing shortage, and China is no exception, especially Shanghai. Since the recovery, people from the rear have flocked to Shanghai. If you have relatives or friends who have just returned from the mainland and can't find a house for a while, and their finances don't allow them to stay in a hotel, can you not find a way to give them one or two empty rooms? At this time, rearranging the room is urgently needed. Effective room arrangement can sometimes compensate for many shortcomings and make you feel much more pleasant. The so-called "a simple room need not be large"!

The following points are for reference.

(1) If not necessary, do not place tables and chairs in the center of the room, as this is inconvenient for people walking around.

(2) People often like to place cabinets and dressing tables at an angle, which takes up a lot of space and is not as comfortable to look at as placing them straight against the wall.

(3) Do not place tall furniture near the window, or even block the window, as this will hinder the light source and make you feel mentally unhappy.

(4) Bulky items should be placed in larger rooms, as they will make you feel suffocated if placed in small rooms.

(5) A bed without a canopy is more comfortable to look at than a bed with a canopy.

(6) Painting the walls with light colors and cold colors such as lotus root pink and light blue will give you a more spacious feeling.

(7) If the windows are too small, it is advisable to hang a hypothetical curtain on both sides of the window, one or two feet away, to compensate for the lack.

(8) Placing one or two bottles of fresh flowers or goldfish in the room in appropriate places can make you feel much more comfortable.

(9) The lamp must be hung high, in the center of the room. It is not advisable to install it too low, or to hang it in the corner of the room, on the bed, or on the table.

(10) Non-essential items should be stored as much as possible, and should not be piled up arbitrarily in the corner of the room or on the table, as this is not only unsightly, but also makes it difficult to clean the room.

Toys

### Little Cloth Doll

— Lu Shufang

This is a very easy-to-make little toy, which can be used as a small gift to coax children or placed in a sewing basket as a pin cushion.

Materials: Any scraps of fabric, as long as the colors are bright (it is even more beautiful if made of velvet), a small piece of washed white cloth (for the face), a ball of cotton or scrap fabric scraps.

Manufacturing method: Cut down according to the size of the cloth pieces, according to the line points, first sew the body and the bottom of the body together to form a cylindrical shape, fill with scrap cloth or cotton, and then sew the face according to the line points, fill with cotton (the side of the face exposed should be flat), sew and tie the lower end, and then sew the pointed hat on the head, and sew it tightly with the body. Both arms and legs are also sewn together and stuffed with cotton. Arrange them properly, and an interesting little cloth doll is completed. Then sew the hands and feet to form a shape, draw the face, tie a ribbon around the neck, and finally tie a silk rope at the end of the hat, which is completed. It can be enlarged or reduced according to this example in the figure.
