### Marshall Envoy Headquarters Announces National-Communist Agreement Imminent; Task Force Assigned and Preparing to Depart for Changchun

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] This evening, local newspapers stated that the government's basic stance on resolving the Northeast issue consists of approximately five points: (1) Adherence to the ceasefire agreement of January 10th as the standard. (2) The troop reorganization plan should be thoroughly implemented, beginning in the Northeast. (3) Concrete measures should be implemented to restore transportation, and guarantees must be provided. (4) Increase Marshall's arbitration power (final decision-making power). (5) Following this negotiation, both sides should earnestly guarantee implementation, and concrete results must be achieved within ten days. The government has no intention of delaying negotiations until after the recovery of Harbin. The evening newspapers also stated: The CCP's basic attitude toward resolving the Northeast issue also includes the following points: (1) While the January 10th ceasefire agreement should be earnestly implemented, the March 27th Northeast ceasefire agreement should also be earnestly implemented (the contents of this agreement are unclear). (2) After the troop reorganization plan is earnestly implemented, the CCP forces should also receive earnest guarantees. (3) The restoration of transportation should be comprehensive, including (a) all forms of transportation beyond railways, such as waterways, post and telegraph; (b) dismantling fortifications along transportation lines; and (c) abolishing transportation inspections. (4) All signed agreements should be guaranteed for earnest implementation. After reading this, individuals in the capital believe that the government's stated attitude (that a concrete result must be achieved within ten days) is sufficient to fully express that there will be no further delays to alleviate the suffering of the people. Regarding the attitude held by the Communist Party, such as the comprehensive restoration of transportation, it is generally believed that this is something the government desires but has been unable to obtain, because the current state of disrepair of waterway, postal, and telegraphic communication in the recovered areas has been caused by the Communist Party. Therefore, it is still hoped that the Communist Party can provide a resolution. From this perspective, the Communist Party is still intentionally delaying the issues of internal conflict and restoring routes, and the situation remains to be clarified.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] This afternoon, Marshall's envoy headquarters announced: a National-Communist agreement is imminent. It also revealed: the headquarters has assigned an advanced executive task force, which is preparing to depart for Changchun, "ready to implement any possible ceasefire agreement." Brigadier General Byroade will serve as the senior American official in the group, which indicates that after a ceasefire agreement is reached in the capital, the Executive Headquarters will assume an extremely important responsibility in its complex and subtle execution.

[Another dispatch] Tonight, General Zhou Enlai stated: He hopes that a ceasefire agreement can be signed tonight or tomorrow. It was learned from a very reliable source that the ceasefire period will be extended to fifteen days. It was also mentioned that Chairman Chiang agreed to a seven-day ceasefire, while the Communist side insisted on thirty days. After lengthy negotiations, both sides compromised on fifteen days. During this fifteen-day ceasefire period, the Nationalists and Communists will resolve their differences.

[Associated Press Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Military Three-Person Committee will sign an agreement at noon tomorrow. It will be signed by the three committee members: Marshall, Zhou Enlai, and Xu Yongchang, and will take effect immediately after signing.

### Important Issues Resolved, Three-Person Meeting Can Be Convened Anytime: Minister Peng Answers Foreign Correspondents' Inquiries

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Foreign Correspondents' Executive Committee held a meeting at 4:00 PM on the 5th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Nuo. The following is a record of the main questions and answers:

Question: Now that Chairman Chiang has returned to the capital, is it possible that the Three-Person Meeting will reconvene within a few days?

Answer (Minister Peng): Important issues, such as those currently contained in the situation, typically cannot be resolved in formal meetings. Informal consultations have not ceased. If they can be resolved, the Three-Person Meeting can be convened at any time. An agreement had already been reached four months ago, but complications arose during implementation, leading to wasted time and increased suffering for the people. We hope that this agreement must include concrete implementation plans and deadlines to cease conflict, reorganize troops, and restore transportation. These should not be merely principles or slogans. In particular, the restoration of transportation is most urgent. The destruction of railways and highways prevents the circulation of goods, prevents refugees from returning home, and consequently leads to soaring prices and social unrest. The most important thing to save the people from this dire situation is to restore transportation. The government's military actions in the Northeast are truly a last resort. The motive is not to attack the Communist forces, but to restore effective control over Chinese territory. Moreover, the Sino-Soviet Treaty also contains provisions regarding this. The Communist Party's strategy is to delay, but the government cannot allow the situation to be delayed indefinitely because the suffering people are eager for a quick resolution. Given the Communist Party's past behavior, future agreements must be concrete and include deadlines. For example, the restoration of transportation must specify which sections of road must be repaired, and it must specify the repair period so that everyone knows for sure when traffic will resume. We firmly believe in and emphasize the rapid implementation of all agreements and prevent endless disputes over technical or theoretical issues. The most reliable way to prevent wasting time is to strengthen the arbitration power and responsibility of the American representative. Accepting this kind of arbitration is the best expression of sincerity and the best prevention against delays. If the Communist side has a better solution, the government is also willing to consider it. If the Communist Party can agree to earnestly establish and abide by this plan, then the Chairman can issue an order to cease all military action nationwide. Regarding the news of the East Mongolian Autonomous Government, Minister Peng stated that it is not confirmed.

### Nanjing City Actively Preparing to Receive Demobilized Youth Army Soldiers

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Nanjing Youth Army Demobilization Committee stated that approximately 5,800 Youth Army soldiers demobilized from areas near Hangzhou, Wuhu, and Anqing will pass through Nanjing in three batches on the 14th, 15th, and 16th of this month. In addition to the Comfort Team already actively raising comfort supplies to show their condolences, a plenary meeting was also held. The following tasks were decided: (1) Arrange for the Youth Army camp. (2) Affix banners and slogans, publish special editions, and conduct comfort activities such as citizen greetings, greetings from heads of organizations, gifting of comfort supplies, and entertainment for guests. (3) Handle supplies such as food, water, transportation, sanitation, and entertainment. (4) Handle services such as stabilizing prices, answering questions, and guiding tours. (5) Conduct investigations into interests, registration, introductions to transfers to schools or jobs, and provide supplementary education. (6) Launch social activities. (7) Communicate and liaise. It is also understood that the association will also establish a service center in Xiaguan to handle reception work. At that time, it is planned to select 200 students from various schools each day to undertake reception duties. As for the accommodation for the Youth Army soldiers arriving in the capital, it is tentatively planned to temporarily use the coal port of Jardine Matheson & Co. in Xiaguan.

### Central Government Allocates 1 Billion Yuan to Relief Efforts for Northern Jiangsu Refugees

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 5th] The central government's efforts to provide relief to Northern Jiangsu refugees have gradually entered the concrete stage. Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs, who is fully responsible for overseeing the relief work for Northern Jiangsu refugees, telegraphed Chairman Wang Maogong of Jiangsu Province on the morning of the 5th, stating that the central government has agreed to allocate the first 1 billion yuan of the 2 billion yuan in special funds requested by Jiangsu Province for refugee relief. Relief supplies have been arranged through the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, with a large quantity of medical supplies allocated by the Ministry of Health. He also instructed Wang to quickly and thoroughly investigate the number of refugees to prepare for long-term relief measures. After receiving the telegram, Wang convened representatives of the relief associations from various counties in Northern Jiangsu at 3:00 PM to discuss all matters related to the implementation. Minister Gu is scheduled to come to Zhenjiang within days to personally preside over the work and establish an office in Zhenjiang.

### Eradication of Opium in the Ya'an-Pingbian Area of Sichuan Province Concluded

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 4th] Liu Ren'an, the administrative commissioner of the 5th Administrative District of Sichuan Province, recently personally led the security team, along with the local garrison force of the division headquarters, deep into the Ya'an-Pingbian area to forcibly eradicate opium. After a month of intense fighting with the local indigenous opium farmers, it has now come to an end. Liu went to Chengdu yesterday to report the process to the provincial government and the pacification headquarters. According to him, a total of 500,000 acres of opium were eradicated this time. With each acre producing 50 taels of opium, the amount is truly astonishing. All eighteen reclamation farms where opium was planted, except for two that were retained to resettle law-abiding citizens, have been abolished. New Baojia units have been established to plan for the aftermath. Liu also has a plan for governing the border area, stating that future work in the border area should focus on prohibition of opium, indigenous affairs, and transportation, advancing in parallel.

### Nanjing to Erect a Bronze Statue of Chiang Kai-shek

In Commemoration of Leadership and Contributions to the War of Resistance
[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Nanjing municipal authorities plan to demolish the tower built by the enemy and puppet regime in Drum Tower Square and erect a bronze statue of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in that location to commemorate his leadership in the War of Resistance, which ultimately led to the surrender of the Japanese invaders and achieved final victory.

### Plan to Adjust Civil Servants' Salaries to be Implemented After Chairman's Approval; National Defense Committee Approves Sino-Danish Treaty

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The National Defense Committee's routine meeting on the 5th did not discuss the issue of adjusting civil servants' salaries. It is said that at the previous meeting, the committee had decided to authorize the Executive Yuan to organize the measures proposed by the Executive Yuan and the measures proposed by Committee Member Chen Lifu, which would increase salaries based on the cost of living index, etc., and submit them to Chairman Chiang for final approval. Therefore, it is not planned to have the committee discuss and approve this case again. It is understood that the two plans organized by the Executive Yuan have been submitted to the Chairman and should be decided and implemented in the near future.

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The Supreme National Defense Council held a meeting on the morning of the 5th, personally presiding over it. Attendees included Zou Lu, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, He Yingqin, Song Ziwen, Bai Chongxi, Chen Guofu, Wang Chonghui, Chen Yi, Shao Lizi, Wu Dingchang, Wang Shijie, Jiang Menglin, Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Lisheng, Li Wenfan, Chen Lifu, Liang Hancao, and over forty others. The following major resolutions were passed: (1) The Sino-Danish Treaty was approved and submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process.

### An Authoritative Source Meets with Reporters to Discuss the Key to Resolving the Overall Situation; Wu Tiecheng Speaks of the Kuomintang's Eagerness for Peace

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] According to an authoritative source who told our reporter: Today, a small number of newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai revealed the details of the talks between Marshall's envoy and Chairman Chiang and Zhou Enlai yesterday regarding the ceasefire and restoration of transportation. It was stated that Chairman Chiang had agreed to a seven-day cessation of military operations to facilitate negotiations, which was then mediated by Marshall and finalized at ten days. It was also stated that when Marshall continued to meet with Zhou Enlai yesterday afternoon, Zhou felt that the ten-day period was still too short, and the talks did not reach a conclusion. From the above, it can be seen that the CCP still lacks sincerity regarding the ceasefire issue. Because the key to resolving the overall situation today lies not in the length of the ceasefire period or the scope of the ceasefire, but in whether the CCP can abandon its martial concept of seizing power by force, whether it can automatically correct its decadent, backward, anti-democratic, and expansionist feudal ideology, and whether it can abandon its erroneous views of taking advantage of opportunities to carve out territories, avoid troop reorganization, and preserve its strength. If the CCP truly believes that its own inferiority complex and cruelty to the people have placed the Chinese nation in an irrecoverable situation, it should turn over a new leaf, automatically apologize to the people, accept Marshall's goodwill, abide by the January 10th ceasefire agreement and troop reorganization plan, and cease all its reckless actions inside and outside the Guanzhong region that obstruct the government from taking over sovereignty, destroying roads, destroying mines, harming the country, and harming the people. By honoring the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and submitting a list of National Assembly representatives and personnel participating in government work in order to promptly reorganize the government and jointly shoulder the heavenly responsibility of saving and building the country with the Kuomintang, it still has a bright future. If it persists in its errors, even if the government can endure and tolerate it again and again, I fear that the people's anger will be too great and difficult to quell, and the people will automatically rise up in a great campaign of condemnation.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Today, a government official close to Chairman Chiang in the peace talks stated that a Nationalist-Communist ceasefire agreement is expected to be signed today or tomorrow, but it depends on whether the Communist side agrees to the government's proposal that General Marshall be the supreme arbitrator of the agreement. The official declared that if the Communist side rejects this proposal, the Chairman has decided not to negotiate further. He said: General Zhou Enlai strongly opposes several key points within the proposal. His opposition is the only reason why the ceasefire order has been delayed.

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng met with a United Press reporter on the 4th and discussed the views recently expressed by Luo Longji, a representative of the Democratic League. Wu solemnly stated that the Kuomintang's desire for peace is no less than that of any faction. Luo's statement that the United States is promoting fascism in China is laughable. This is truly an insult to the great ally that advocates democracy. Luo should know that the mission of the US military in China is only to assist our country in taking over sovereignty in the Northeast and sending Japanese prisoners of war back to their country. However, he made such confusing remarks, which is very regrettable. Wu continued: All of our countrymen understand the nobility of the United States' mission in China and the correctness of its tasks. Also, when the National Army in Changchun was under attack, Luo did not publicly dissuade the Communist army from attacking. Only after the National Army approached Sipingjie, Gongzhuling, and Inner Mongolia did he advocate a ceasefire. After the National Army recovered Changchun, he wanted to prevent the National Army from advancing towards Harbin and Qiqihar. In short, Luo's remarks do not seem to come from the mouth of a neutral party. It is feared that peace will be difficult to achieve if he appeals for peace with this attitude. It is no wonder that outsiders refer to him as a voluntary spokesperson for the CCP. Wu finally stated: The success or failure of future negotiations depends entirely on whether the Communist Party ceases attacking the National Army in the Northeast and whether it will abandon its delaying tactics of negotiating and not resolving issues with the Kuomintang.

### General Commander Chen Reports at the National Government Memorial Week

(3) Sending Enemy Prisoners Back to Their Country: The total number of Japanese prisoners of war and Japanese residents within China (excluding Northeast China, including Northern Vietnam) is over 1.9 million. On October 25th of last year, a joint Sino-US meeting was convened in Shanghai to determine the plan for sending them back to their country. US Navy landing craft and requisitioned Japanese ships would be used for transportation, and eleven ports would be used: Tanggu, Guangzhou, Haikou, Shantou, Xiamen, Haiphong, Keelung, and Kaohsiung. The General Logistics Headquarters is responsible for handling Japanese prisoners of war and Japanese residents in the interior.

The inspection and command of Japanese prisoners of war and residents when boarding ships, as well as other related matters. Japanese prisoners of war and residents who are being repatriated are allowed to carry 1,000 Japanese yen for civilians, 500 yen for officers, and 200 yen for soldiers, as well as their clothing and personal belongings. If they exceed this amount or have prohibited items, they will be confiscated by the Chinese government and kept as part of the war reparations in the future. All prisoners of war and residents from various locations are required to be completely repatriated by the end of June. As of the end of May, it is estimated that over 1.6 million people have been repatriated.

(4) Collection and Handling of Enemy and Puppet Military Supplies: The country is divided into ten collection zones (Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, Jinan, Vietnam, Guangzhou, Kaifeng, Hong Kong, and Taiwan), and a special commissioner is assigned to each zone to handle the matter. Each zone completed the takeover by the end of March of this year, and three acceptance committees were separately dispatched to conduct acceptance inspections in each zone, which is still in progress. As for the use of enemy and puppet military supplies, plans have been formulated and are being implemented step by step. Those of a supply nature, such as grain, ammunition, and fuel, are used to supply troops nearby according to regulations. Those of a supplementary nature, such as weapons, clothing, and various equipment, are allocated to supplement the needs of the troops. Those of an enrichment allocation nature, such as tanks, vehicles, and horses, are used to enrich the troops. For raw materials in military factories, the factories are started up in advance to engage in production, and the raw materials are uniformly cast, allocated, and utilized.

### Two Chinese Armies Meet in Huadian and Advance Towards Andong Province; Main Force of Communist Army Concentrating on Sino-Korean Border

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] After the official Changchun National Army's left wing moved towards Yongji, it advanced to Lafa, which has the Lanbin Railway and is extremely important as it connects to Harbin in the northwest. The central route has crossed the Songhua River and arrived near Shuangdabei Mountain. Today's Xinmin Daily reports that the National Army had entered Harbin at noon on the 3rd and was advancing towards Liu Liu Haar, but this news has been denied by the official authorities here. The National Army's left wing is currently stalled on the front line of Nong'an, and the National Army south of Changchun is using Sipingjie as its center to clear the surrounding transportation lines. The western route has extended to Liaoyuan, and after conquering Huadian, the eastern route is turning south and advancing towards Andong Province. In the central and southern regions, the situation is quite chaotic. After Haicheng, Dashiqiao, and Yingkou fell, the sound of artillery can be heard in Liaoyang.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] According to official sources, the main force of the Communist Army in the Northeast is concentrating in the mountainous area of Andong on the Sino-Korean border, intending to hold the area for a long time.

[Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch, 4th] The National Army moving south met with the National Army moving north from Hailong in Huadian on the 3rd. After the National Army occupied Huadian, the protection of traffic on the Jihai Road (Jilin to Hailong) is of great value. The National Army advancing towards Lafa Station is advancing eastward.

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department declared on the 5th: The Communist Party's claim that Anshan and Yingkou have been occupied by Communist forces is completely inaccurate. Yingkou has always been in the hands of the government army. Anshan was briefly lost but was quickly recovered within five days (May 31st). The 184th Division is still guarding Anshan.

### Prelude to Execution of Traitor Chu Minyi: A Visit to the Suzhou Third Prison
— Our Suzhou Quick Report, 5th Wu Shouren

After the High Court issued the ruling upholding the original sentence of traitor Chu Minyi, it was widely rumored in the area that the execution would take place on the morning of the 5th. Around 7:00 a.m., about twenty reporters from various newspapers, including those stationed in Suzhou from other cities, gathered at the Third Prison at Shizikou, eager to witness the state of this last remaining major traitor before his execution. Warden Chen Songnian was immediately surrounded by reporters, who pressed him to confirm the news. Chen expressed surprise and firmly denied having any prior knowledge of the execution. The reporters, looking anxious, waited outside the prison for three hours without anyone leaving, while the execution order for Chu Minyi was correspondingly delayed in the Ministry of Justice or the Jiangsu High Court. Therefore, the reporters collectively requested Warden Chen to allow them to tour the inside of the prison. This was originally strictly forbidden by the judicial authorities in the midst of the crackdown on traitors, but Chen reluctantly agreed to the request due to popular demand. However, he laid down three rules: (1) Reporters must remove their press badges during the tour and must not talk or laugh loudly. (2) They must not converse with the prisoners. (3) They must surrender their cameras when visiting the Li and Women's Prisons to prevent the surreptitious photographing of Chen and Chu. All agreed. Under the guidance of Chen, the guard chief Ye Ruiting, and the security chief Yao Qiwen, they entered the prison, which was divided into six sections: Li (rites), Yi (righteousness), Lian (integrity), Chi (shame), the Sick Ward, and the Women's Prison. There were also solitary confinement cells to punish prisoners who violated the rules, a lecture hall for daily ideological training of the prisoners, and a medical room for treating sick prisoners, with Dr. Wu Baogu as the attending physician and Miss Shen Xinnan as the pharmacist. The first section visited was the Yi Prison, with eighteen cells holding about 150 prisoners, all accused of being traitors awaiting review or final judgment. The reporters took a quick look and saw various kinds of traitors, large and small, mostly lying down and reading novels. Their beds were all small two-tiered iron beds. They then moved to the adjacent First Workshop, where sixty-seven prisoners were engaged in making toothbrushes, straw sandals, and clothing. According to Chen, a printing workshop was also being prepared. They then went to the Lian Prison, which had twelve cells and held more than five hundred ordinary criminal offenders, all of whom were working in the workshops. Climbing the stairs, they reached the Chi Prison, which also had twelve cells, but was currently empty. The executed traitor Miao Bin had been imprisoned in cell number twelve during his lifetime. Leaving the Chi Prison, they were led to the newly built washrooms and storage rooms, and then to the Sick Ward. The first thing that caught the reporters' attention was the exquisitely clean medical office. The pharmacist, Miss Shen, was at her desk recording medications. The photographers with cameras scrambled to find suitable angles to take pictures. The Sick Ward had twelve cells and housed more than ten sick prisoners. According to Chen, the current mortality rate among the prisoners was extremely low, but the source of medications was difficult and he hoped that enthusiastic people in society would donate and that charitable organizations would pay attention to this. Finally, they arrived in front of the Li Prison, where the reporters' interest suddenly increased, especially the photographers who were eager to try out their cameras. Chen reiterated his warning, but after repeated requests, he agreed to allow them to photograph the exterior, with them squatting or leaning down, vying to capture the best angle. After about a quarter of an hour, they regretfully put away their cameras. At the first and second cells in front of the responsible officer's prison, they peeked through the small window and saw traitor Chu Minyi reclining against the corner of the right wall, reading a book. He was wearing a yellowish-brown short gown and trousers, with light blue socks and short hair about three or four inches long. His face was pale and frightening. Next to his bed was a small half-table, with a white paper covering the surface, and a complete set of inkstone and writing brush, as well as a small mirror and several books. Qian Yu, the former Chief Prosecutor of the puppet Anhui High Court, and Zheng Bin, the Director of the puppet Taixian Consolidated Tax Bureau, were also imprisoned in the same cell. Cell number one, where the major traitor Chen Gongbo had been imprisoned, was now empty, with only two empty iron beds remaining inside. The Li Prison had a total of thirteen cells, and those imprisoned were all once prominent major traitors, including Chen Zemin, the puppet governor of Jiangsu Province, Chen Fumin, the puppet president of the Jiangsu High Court, and Chen Zhanru, the last puppet county magistrate of Wuxian, father, son, uncle, and nephew all imprisoned together in cell number ten. After about twenty minutes of viewing, they withdrew. Arriving at the Women's Prison, which was connected by a corridor, there were two cells, one large and one small. The large cell housed more than ten female criminal offenders, and the small cell was the solitary residence of Chen Bijun, the traitor. The furnishings were quite neat, with a circular wicker chair, a table with drawers, and other daily necessities, all complete. The cell was unlocked, which was a unique phenomenon in the entire prison. The reporters saw this once red-hot female traitor of the "public residence" faction lying on a rattan couch reading a book, wearing a light gray cloth shirt. She never looked back at the twenty or so uninvited guests. According to the guards, Chen had a volatile temper and would scold at the slightest dissatisfaction, and it was necessary to address her as "Madame Wang" for her to respond, another sign of the traitor's last desperate tricks.

After the prison tour, they were led by Chen to visit the bathroom and kitchen. They were informed that the current standard of food for the prisoners was twenty ounces of rice and four ounces of vegetables per person per day. Collective exercise was permitted for thirty minutes each at 9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Haircuts were given every fifteen days and bathing every ten days. During the two hours of the tour, the reporters had a deep impression, which can be summed up in the four words: neat and clean. It is said that the Third Prison was known as a model prison even before the war. Today, it is even more in line with modern requirements. It is now known that the prison's personnel organization consists of the warden, followed by three sections, each with a section chief, a head guard, and a security chief, followed by a dozen or so guards. There are also accounting, personnel, and military training instructors, medical clinics, and educational offices, each responsible for their respective tasks. Around 12:00 noon, the reporters still had not seen any sign of the execution, so they took a group photo with the warden and dispersed.

### Capital Police Department Issues Order Prohibiting the Sale of Heretical Books by Traitors

(This newspaper, Nanjing, 5th) The Capital Police Department recently issued an order to all its bureaus, strictly prohibiting the sale of traitor autobiographies and prison diaries in the city. Anyone who violates this order will be punished according to law. This matter was suggested to the relevant authorities by our newspaper's president, Pan Gongzhan, during his previous visit to Nanjing. This matter has now attracted the attention of all parties, who agree that it should be strictly prohibited in order to curb heresy.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Plans to Convene Meeting to Discuss Solutions to the Economic Crisis, Shanghai to Hold Separate Production Meeting

(This newspaper, Nanjing, 5th) In order to alleviate the current economic crisis, the Ministry of Economic Affairs plans to convene an economic conference in the near future, inviting well-known figures from the industrial and commercial sectors and experts and scholars. Shanghai will hold a separate production meeting, inviting representatives from various factories to participate and discuss ways to promote production and resolve labor disputes. Regarding the foreign exchange issue, Vice Minister Pan Xulun said that the Ministry does not advocate changing the exchange rate, which would affect prices, as raising the exchange rate would cause complaints from merchants, while lowering the exchange rate would lead to the closure of factories. Therefore, it is advocated that the import tariff rate be revised to solve the difficulties in foreign exchange.

### Major Traitors in North China, Including Wang Yintai, Will Soon Be Indicted, Wife of Traitor Chu Minyi Requests Retrial Again

(This newspaper, Suzhou, 5th) Traitor Chu Minyi has been sentenced to death, and although the Supreme Court has approved the retrial and the ruling has been delivered, his wife, Chu Chen Shunzhen, has expressed her dissatisfaction. At about 11:00 a.m. on the 5th, she submitted a document to the Jiangsu High Court requesting another retrial. The news has caused widespread consternation in all circles, as according to the Special Criminal Procedure Law, no objections can be raised to criminal liabilities ruled by the three-trial court. Even if the extraordinary appeal regulations were used, they could not be utilized by direct relatives but only by the prosecuting attorney or the chief prosecutor of the three-trial court. In order to understand the Jiangsu High Court's attitude towards the case, the reporter specially requested to see President Sun, but he was attending a provincial government meeting in Zhenjiang and was not available. The request will be left to Sun to decide how to handle after returning to Suzhou. However, according to opinions obtained by the reporter from all aspects of the judicial community, it is believed that the possibility of rejection and non-acceptance is greater.

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th) Wang Yintai and fourteen other major traitors who were escorted from Beiping to Nanjing are currently being interrogated separately by the military and the Capital High Court. They will soon be indicted one after another, and a public trial will be held before the 700,000 citizens of the capital. The reporter has learned the puppet positions held by these traitors and briefly reports them as follows: Wang Yintai, 58 years old, Chairman of the Puppet North China Political Affairs Committee. Jiang Kanghu, 64 years old, President of the Puppet National Government Examination Yuan. Qi Xieyuan, 62 years old, Minister of Security of the Puppet Provisional Government, Standing Committee Member of the Puppet North China Political Affairs Committee, concurrently Superintendent of the Puppet Security Department and Commander-in-Chief of the Puppet Security Army. Yu Jinhe, 58 years old, Mayor of the Puppet Beijing Special Municipality, Standing Committee Member of the Puppet North China Political Affairs Committee, concurrently Superintendent of the Puppet Construction Department.

### Local Dispatches

Suzhou

Various Circumstances Before and After the Execution of Traitor Chen

Major traitor Chen Gongbo, along with traitor Chen Bijun, and traitor Chu Minyi, were escorted from Nanjing to the Jiangsu High Court on February 17th. On June 2nd, they were transferred to the Third Prison, and on the morning of the 3rd, Chen Gongbo was executed, totaling one hundred and five days. When traitor Chen was brought to court for interrogation, after the prosecutor carried out the execution, he requested to return to the prison cell to change clothes, wearing shoes and socks and a blue cloth long gown. He then said goodbye to traitor Chen Bijun and traitor Chu Minyi. At that time, traitor Chen's face had changed, but he still pretended to be arrogant. After the sound of gunfire, traitor Chu silently sat cross-legged in the prison cell, frequently reciting Buddhist scriptures in a hoarse and trembling voice, with his hands clasped together and his eyes closed. Traitor Chen Bijun initially cried after the farewell, but after the sound of gunfire, she burst into tears, speaking entirely in Cantonese, crying, "Mr. Wang" has harmed you. My crime is greater than yours (referring to traitor Chen Gongbo), why not sentence me to death? I would rather die together, etc. Later, the female guards ordered her to stop. After the major traitor was executed, the corpse was placed on a wooden board (approximately four feet wide and two and a half feet long), and blood flowed like a torrent. Even in the afternoon, blood continued to seep from the bullet wounds. The face was purplish-white. The corpse was moved from the prison, and the peace was restored. His son, Chen Gan, came to Suzhou on the 4th to purchase a coffin and collect the body. On the day of traitor Chen's execution, his daughter-in-law, Mo Guokang, was publicly tried in Nanjing. It is heard that the execution order for traitor Chu Minyi will also arrive at the High Procuratorate in the near future. Recently, a relative, "the owner of the Caizhi Zhai candied fruit shop," Mr. Jin, hurried to make a shroud for traitor Chu, and specially prepared a genuine "Wuyuan" coffin and a certain cemetery for the burial of traitor Chu.

Kunshan

Wuxi

Police Trouble Case Resolved

The traffic police of Xinan Town in the southern countryside of this county, treating the people as enemies and abusing their power of arrest, used torture, which caused a town-wide shop strike. Representatives were elected to petition various agencies. It is learned that Magistrate Xu sent Li, the military section chief, to the countryside on the 3rd, leading a team to investigate the truth, and all traffic police squad leaders and policemen were detained and transferred to the First Pacification District Headquarters for strict handling according to law. The shops in the town have all resumed business yesterday, and all arrested good citizens have also been released.

Jiangyin

True Cholera Discovered in the City

Recently, the weather has been unstable and epidemics are rampant. A few days ago, tiger plague was discovered in the eastern suburbs, with three deaths in one village. It has now spread to the city. On the night of the 2nd, the daughter of Han Azeng, a resident of Lujiayuan in Chunhui Town, Ah Xiu, only seven years old, suddenly vomited and had diarrhea. She died on the morning of the 3rd. Ah Xiu's grandmother and aunt were both infected. It was only in the afternoon that a doctor was called for treatment, who diagnosed it as true cholera. Cheng's health facilities are lacking, and there is no complete hospital. The spread of the epidemic is worrying. Even preventive needles and medicines are nowhere to be found.

Hefei

Start Inspecting Innovation Efficiency

In order to thoroughly assess the efficiency of the innovation movement and determine rewards and punishments, Chairman Li stipulated that from the 31st to June 6th, the heads of the Party, government, military, police, and educational institutions should appoint senior personnel to inspect the provincial capital and all institutions in Hefei County in groups. It has been previously reported that on the 31st, three groups inspected the provincial capital and six groups inspected the county simultaneously. The targets of the work were (1) implementation of laws and regulations, (2) work efficiency, (3) punctuality, (4) morning meetings, (5) cleanliness, (6) thrift. On the first day, the provincial group inspected the Secretariat, the four departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction, the five offices of Society, Accounting, Health, and Water Conservancy Engineering, and the Provincial Social Service and other five offices, as well as the Provincial Library and various primary and secondary schools. The group inspected the Security and Military Control District Headquarters and other places on the first day. The county groups went to Shushan, Guanting, Sanhe, Wangzicheng, Buli, Changlinhe, and other six districts to inspect. Before leaving, Chairman Li instructed that if any cases of corruption, fraud, or illegal activity were found, they must be reported immediately for strict handling.

### Developing Southwest Economic Industry, Design of the Eastern Sichuan Power Grid Completed, 17 Large and Small Power Plants to Be Constructed

(Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th) In order to develop the southwest economic industry, the National Hydropower Engineering Office of the Resources Committee has recently formulated a plan to weave the eastern Sichuan power grid. This plan, following the great projects of the Grand Coulee Dam in the United States, the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station in the Soviet Union, and the Yangtze River Hydropower Plan in China, is another great and amazing plan, and has now begun to be implemented. The Jialing River near Chongqing, the Longxi River near Changshou, the Dadu River, Qingjiang, and the Min River near Chengdu are rich in water resources and have steep riverbeds, all of which have value to be developed and utilized urgently. In addition to the Dujiangyan Power Plant on the Min River, which is already in the planning stage and will begin construction in the near future, and the power generation plans for the Huodu River and Qingyi River, which are incorporated into the western Sichuan power generation plan, the Longxi River Hydropower Plant in Changshou is the hub of the eastern Sichuan power grid. If the eastern Sichuan power grid can be successfully woven, there can be a total of fifteen large and small hydropower plants and two thermal power plants, with high-voltage transmission lines connecting all plants. The total power generation will not be less than 300,000 kilowatts, which is more than enough to supply the industry and daily electricity needs of various places in eastern Sichuan.

Editorial

### Engineer's Day After Victory

Today marks the first Engineer's Day after victory, and the sixth Engineer's Day since its inception. Engineer's Day was decided upon during the annual meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers in Chengdu in the 29th year of the Republic (1940), and a grand celebration was first held in the wartime capital in the 30th year of the Republic (1941) on June 6th. June 6th was originally the birthday of Yu the Great. We take the date commemorating this historical figure who tirelessly controlled floods and saved the people, a paragon of the people, as Engineer's Day, demonstrating the profound self-encouragement of engineers and the ardent hope of the general public for them.

Today, in Shanghai, a leading industrial city in China, and a city that should redouble its efforts in industrial construction after victory, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Institute of Engineers holds a commemoration for Engineer's Day, filled with indescribable excitement. However, what greets this first Engineer's Day after the victory of the War of Resistance is not newly smoking chimneys, not the construction of great projects, but the streets of the city filled with foreign goods, such as "glass wallets" and "nylon stockings." What a mockery this is to Engineer's Day, what heartbreak! Since China has had modern engineers, the period cannot be considered too short, but facing the national economic crisis of engineers, its severity is even greater than today. The formation of this situation is not the responsibility of the engineers themselves, but because of the decline of this situation, engineers have been unable to contribute much, and we can only feel ashamed, only hate!

What do we want for Engineer's Day? Whether it's a celebration or a commemoration, the first thing is to enable our existing engineers to do their best for the country and the nation in their respective positions, and to have more work opportunities and places. That is to say, we must quickly restore the factories that have stopped work, implement our national industrial plan as soon as possible, build projects, and establish factories extensively. However, under the current "comprador policy," which only knows to encourage everyone to compete in selling foreign goods and stifle domestic products, not only can we not expect the factories that have stopped work to resume work, but even the factories that are currently smoking will shut down. As for the extensive establishment of factories and the construction of projects, it will be like a fool's dream. Faced with the arrival of Engineer's Day, we must once again, without avoiding annoyance, reiterate that we should quickly change the current economic policy filled with "comprador" thinking.

The protection of our national industry, which is not yet solid, cannot be delayed any longer! The National Government has long decided on the principles of the first phase of economic construction after the war: state-owned and private industrial enterprises will be planned and taken care of concurrently, and private capital will be concentrated and foreign investment will be absorbed through dual channels. But what is happening now? The import of cheap foreign goods not only threatens the survival of national industries, but also dries up the lifeblood of our national economy. In the future, even if we want to invest, we will feel that there is no capital to invest. We should quickly stop this trend of blood flowing outwards. Everyone attributes the reason for rising prices to the rampant speculative capital, but with these weak capitals of the Chinese people, and at a time when industry is almost without foundation, there will be "speculative capital" in the market. This fault cannot be borne by those who hold capital, but should be investigated for the reasons why they are not allowed to invest in industry, such as the difficulties encountered by private industrial enterprises? How is it suppressed? What rewards and encouragement does the government give? Only when the foundation of our national industry is gradually solid can our engineers not worry about not having a place to use their talents. We value the state-owned large-scale industries, and we agree with the state-owned heavy industries, but at the same time, we cannot fail to encourage the private operation of general light industries, that is, industries of daily necessities for the people.

Today, when we celebrate Engineer's Day, we must not forget those engineers who are unemployed or have changed careers. China's industrialization is fifty years behind others. We must catch up. The creation of an engineer cannot be achieved in a short period of time. In the future, our nation-building will require a large number of engineering talents. Chairman Chiang has already mentioned this in his book "China's Destiny." For this need, we certainly need to cultivate new talents to shoulder this new mission, but in the past thirty years, the number of modern engineering talents created in our country must be considerable, but after graduation, they often have no way to go, or the working environment is not good, and they turn to other industries. This is a waste for the individual and an irreparable loss for the country. And there seem to be quite a few who are depressed and frustrated, struggling with poverty, illness, hunger, and money. We must cherish these talents for the country. Otherwise, while we celebrate Engineer's Day and say some good words to embellish the occasion, there are truly overlooked engineers who are not paid attention to, which is a bit unreasonable!

### Churchill Says in the House of Commons that a World War is Brewing, Denounces the Soviet Union for Spreading Vicious Propaganda

[Our Newspaper News] London, 5th broadcast. Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, severely criticizing the Soviet Union, and said: A world war is already brewing. Mr. Churchill first stated that the relationship between the Soviet Union and Western democracies has deteriorated, and the Soviet Union's vicious mutual propaganda has given the British people a very bad impression. In the past year, the Soviet Union's espionage and other activities have aroused opposition from one-third of the people in Europe. A great war is brewing, and Germany is now developing in two different ways, one is Sovietization, and the other is growing up according to the democratic methods of Western Europe.

Following Mr. Churchill, Prime Minister Attlee also delivered a speech, the first sentence of which mentioned relations with the Soviet Union, which was not discussed when sending the telegram.

### Time, Time, Never Comes Again. If the Soviet Union Values Peace, the Four Countries Should Conclude a Convention. Bevin's Full Speech in the House of Commons

[United Press, London, 4th dispatch] The House of Commons began a two-day debate on foreign policy today. Foreign Secretary Bevin announced Britain's foreign policy in a long article of 9,000 words. According to the draft: (Our newspaper received the broadcast yesterday and has published the main points) The Soviet Union should accept the proposal of U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes to conclude a four-nation convention to monitor Germany's disarmament for a period of twenty-five years. I dare to tell the Soviet Union now that if you value peace above all else, you should not miss this opportunity, lest time never comes again. I think that if the four-nation convention can be implemented faithfully and diligently, it can create a situation where the security will be far greater than supporting a small number of vassal states as a buffer against aggression. At the Paris Conference on June 17, if the four foreign ministers fail to reach an agreement on the peace, I will strongly advocate submitting the peace treaty issue to a full peace conference of all relevant countries. The situation has reached an intolerable point, and we will have to declare to the twenty-one countries that actively participated in the war that because the four foreign ministers cannot agree, the countries will be in a state of war forever. Although Byrnes' plan was rejected by the Soviet Union, the United States should not be afraid. At least there are other countries in Europe that not only welcome this proposal, but also believe that it can give people the greatest hope for resolving misunderstandings and restoring trust.

France

The request for the Saar region cannot be hastily abandoned until after studying the entire issue of the German border. However, the British government, in the final solution, definitely supports the transfer of the Saar to France in addition to the issues of reparations and other factories, etc., but would rather consider the entire German issue before taking the final step.

Soviet Union

The declaration that if the United States and Britain withdraw their troops from Italy, the Italian government can seek compensation from the Soviet Union is something I cannot agree to. I also oppose the Soviet Union's request to cede Trieste to Yugoslavia. I am convinced that nothing could give us greater confidence in peace at the next Paris Conference than the Soviet Union's preparation and willingness to resolve the issues of Austria, Italy, and the Danube River basin together. In the Middle East, both the Soviet Union and the United States recognize that maintaining Britain's position in the Middle East is of great importance to world peace, but ultimately a regional organization suitable for the UN security system should be developed.

Regarding

The Soviet Union, I dare to speak on behalf of the workers of Britain and its dominions. I do not believe that the Soviet system can represent the interests of workers, just like the democratic parliamentary system of Britain. However, there are many issues related to the Soviet Union's attitude towards Britain, which can at least show a kind of realistic thinking. The basic goal of the British government is to enable the League of Nations to carry out effective work.

Danube

The issues of navigation rights on the river and sovereignty over Trieste were major obstacles to peace at the recent Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. I cannot represent the government in making concessions on these important Central European issues. The Soviet Union's proposed border line between Italy and Yugoslavia, including Trieste, would leave no Slavic-speaking people in Italy, while Yugoslavia would have more than 500,000 Italians. On this issue, only the United States and Britain have attempted to propose a compromise, while the Soviet Union has taken no action. I cannot cede Trieste to Yugoslavia. Trieste must be an international port, not a gambling tool in international politics.

Britain

Tried to conclude commercial agreements with Romania, Hungary, and other countries, and was met with obstacles everywhere. Britain will not allow its representatives to take any action that would hinder the Soviet Union's legitimate relations with these countries, but please the Soviet Union reciprocate in the same way. Regarding the Dardanelles Strait, I am not aware of any fundamental dispute. The Montreux Convention allows Turkey to reorganize the military equipment of the strait. Britain is willing to consider amending it, but Britain is eager to avoid any way that would harm Turkey's true independence or turn it into a vassal state.

### Byrnes Scheduled to Go to France, Foreign Ministers' Conference Not Postponed, Soviet Union Insists on its Own Views on Danube River Navigation Issues

[U.S. Information Agency, Washington, 4th dispatch] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes declared at a press conference today that he is scheduled to depart for Paris on June 13 to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The people accompanying him are the same as those who accompanied him to Paris last time, including Senators Connally and Vandenberg. In answering reporters' questions, Mr. Byrnes believed that there was no reason to postpone the Paris Conference scheduled for June 15.

[French News Agency, Paris, 4th dispatch] The representatives of the four foreign ministers recently continued to meet to discuss the issue of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Bulgaria, but failed to reach an agreement. Soviet representative Gusev said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had requested that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Bulgaria should be carried out at the same time as the withdrawal of Allied troops from Italy. Regarding the issue of navigation on the Danube River, the Soviet representative insisted on his own views, saying that only the coastal countries could participate. This was consistent with the attitude adopted by Foreign Minister Molotov at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, but the representatives had closer opinions on the plan to establish a Danube River Navigation Commission.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th dispatch, United Press] Byrnes declared at a press conference that he had submitted the draft peace treaty with Austria to the Soviet Union, France, and Britain so that they could study it before the next Foreign Ministers' Conference.

### UN Social and Economic Committee, Our Representative Zhang Pengchun Proposes to Improve World Living Standards

[French News Agency, New York, 4th dispatch] When the UN Economic and Social Council held a plenary meeting today, Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun proposed to establish small committees in each region where the standard of living has not reached the ordinary standard to be responsible for designing several methods to reduce the results of the instability caused by non-industrialized areas in the world. The significance of these regions supplying industrialized countries with a large number of raw materials and markets is self-evident. Various future developments that could endanger international peace may be seen in these regions.

### Stilwell's Blunt Words

Americans Need Permanent Peace, Those Who Say Otherwise Should Be Shot

[United Press, Boise, Idaho, 4th dispatch] Former Commander of the China-Burma-India Theater, General Stilwell, said today: "We need permanent peace, and anyone who says otherwise should be shot." The U.S. preparation plan should not be changed. Stilwell is currently the commander of the Sixth Army, stationed in San Francisco. Mr. Stilwell fully supports President Truman's plan to merge the Navy. According to reports: If you want to call me the Navy, the Army, or the Marine Corps, it's all the same.

### Freedom of Speech

U.S. Supreme Court Stipulates that Newspapers Have the Right to Criticize the Judiciary

[U.S. Information Agency, Washington, 4th dispatch] The U.S. Supreme Court ruled yesterday that U.S. newspapers have the right to criticize the judiciary (at least under certain circumstances), because freedom of speech is a traditional right of a free society.

### Stettinius Relinquishes His Position

[United Press, New York, 5th dispatch] Stettinius has transferred the position of U.S. Chief Representative to the UN to Deputy Representative Johnson. When the Security Council meets to discuss the report on Spain, Johnson will attend. Mr. Stettinius said: There are no other plans besides vacation.

### On the Spanish Issue, the Soviet Union Will Oppose the Investigation Committee's Report

The Security Council Meets Today [Our Newspaper News] New York, 5th broadcast: The UN Security Council will reopen tomorrow. U.S. Representative Stettinius will be temporarily replaced by Johnson after resigning. The issue to be discussed at tomorrow's meeting is the Franco-Spanish issue. According to well-informed sources, Soviet representative Gromyko will raise strong opposition to the Investigation Committee's recommendations. The Soviet Union believes that the Security Council should take action against Franco and should not shift responsibility to the UN General Assembly.

Republican Government Leader Says Franco is Actively Building Ships

[United Press, Mexico City, 4th dispatch] The leader of the Spanish exiled Republican government, Giral, accused today that Franco currently has two warships with a displacement of 34,000 tons, which have been assembled and can be used, and two more warships are under construction.

### Saying Yugoslavia is Generally Mobilizing, British Foreign Office Unable to Confirm, Secret Troops in Germany Dissolved

[United Press, London, 4th dispatch] A Foreign Office spokesman declared today: London newspapers headlined that Yugoslavia has generally mobilized, but the Trieste report is not enough to confirm this statement. The situation in that area is expected to be tense, but there is no need to worry.

[Reuters, Wuppertal, 5th dispatch] British military authorities here revealed yesterday that the semi-secret Yugoslav Royal Army, which was training in the British occupation zone of Germany, has been ordered to disband. This is because the personnel of the army obstructed the plan to send Yugoslavs back to their country, and after British intelligence personnel found evidence that they were privately selling military equipment, it was decided to disband them. According to reports, the army has 45 generals, 1,500 officers, and 15,000 soldiers, commanded by former Yugoslav cabinet member General Zivkovic. They were originally prisoners of war captured by Germany, and 90% of them supported King Peter.

[Reuters, London, 4th dispatch] Angora Radio broadcast today that a reporter from the Anatolian News Agency in Athens said that activities have recently increased on the Greek-Yugoslav border. There are 1,000 Soviet troops in the Monastir area, stationed in villages close to the border. Communist troops are also active in Western Macedonia. Note that this report has not yet been confirmed.

### French Actress Sentenced for Being Pro-German

[Reuters, Paris, 5th dispatch] French actress Corinne Luchaire was close to Germans during the German occupation, dancing, drinking, and making merry with them, behaving unlike a French citizen of standing. Yesterday, the Paris court sentenced her to lose her French citizenship for ten years.

### Trial of Major Japanese War Criminals, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Ballantine as Witness for the Plaintiff

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th dispatch, United Press] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State and expert on Far Eastern issues, Ballantine, has been appointed as the chief witness for the plaintiff in the trial of major war criminals. Mr. Ballantine has come together with Dr. White from the Catholic University of Washington, who has been invited as a special advisor to the Chief Prosecutor of the International Tribunal, Keenan.

### To Maintain the Dignity of the Monarch, Britain Opposes the Trial of the Japanese Emperor, the Soviet Union Opposes Maintaining the Japanese Emperor's Face

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th dispatch] Authoritative sources here say that the British side is currently exerting extremely strong pressure through senior diplomats to prevent the Japanese Emperor from suffering insults that are inconsistent with his imperial status. Ever since rumors spread that the Japanese Emperor would be regarded as a war criminal and tried, British representatives in Japan and other local diplomats have fought hard against this view. Britain believes that any plan to put the Japanese Emperor in a state that is undignified or embarrassing is a direct attack on the monarchical system. However, the Soviet side has indirectly expressed that it does not want to maintain the face of the Japanese Emperor.

### President of the International Bank, U.S. Journalist Elected

[United Press, Washington, 4th dispatch] The publisher and editor-in-chief of the Washington Post, Meyer, was elected today by the twelve directors of the International Bank, composed of thirty-eight countries, as the president of the bank. After taking office, Mr. Meyer will have the right to use the bank's $7.5 billion in funds to revive the industries of war-torn countries and develop industrially backward countries. Mr. Meyer declared, "The world is deeply concerned about the famine situation, but we must pay equal attention to the fact that the world is lacking industrial production." Mr. Meyer will take office soon.

### Can the Indian Interim Government Be Formed in a Few Days?

Muslims Meet to Discuss

[Our Newspaper News] London, 5th broadcast: Whether the Indian interim government can be formed will be revealed in a few days. Starting today, the Muslim League, under the leadership of Jinnah, will hold continuous secret meetings for two days to discuss the British proposal in order to decide whether to participate in the Indian interim government.

### The American Invention of Flying Wing is Approaching the Speed of Light, Almost Invisible in the Air

[Central News Agency, Hawthorne City, California, 4th dispatch, United Press] The U.S. Army Department today released the structure of a small Northrop flying wing powered by two jet engines. Mr. Northrop designed the aircraft to be able to pass through the enemy's aircraft wings at a speed approaching the speed of light, cast into a solid wing piece, and made entirely of magnesium. The beauty of this wing lies in attacking enemy aircraft, cutting off their wings or tails. When the aircraft is flying in the air, it is almost invisible, because there is no fuselage. We can only see a wing that looks like a knife edge whistling across the high sky. The way the pilot controls the aircraft is unimaginable in other types of aircraft.

### Italian Citizens Vote to Decide to Adopt a Republican System, Savoy Royal Family Announces Its Submission

### Soviet Influence Deepens in Central Europe: All Slavic Nations Have Become Dependent; Whether This Will Stop is Still Unknown

[United Press International, Washington, 4th] According to sources in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia: Slavic nations in Central and Eastern Europe have now formed a bloc and become dependent on the Soviet Union. This proves that the Soviet Union has, in a short period after the war, organized these countries and made them lean towards the Soviet Union. The speed of its success has understandably concerned Western democratic nations, especially regarding how far the Soviet Union intends to expand its sphere of influence westward. Regardless of whether the Slavic nations form a bloc or not, there is no doubt that Soviet influence has deeply penetrated Eastern and Central European countries. The active support of Czech President Edvard Beneš in organizing the bloc is particularly noteworthy. In the past, the unity of the Slavic people was mostly theoretical, but according to Beneš, it will become a reality in politics and culture in the future. A rather complex key issue is that most Slavic countries fall within the sphere of influence that the Soviet Union has long wanted to establish, that is, from the German port of Stettin in the north to New Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and the Adriatic Sea in the south. Hungary and the Balkan countries are also within this sphere, except for Greece and Turkey. Most Slavic people are located east of the 15th meridian, including Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Croatians, Serbians, and Bulgarians, in addition to Russians. Looking at a map, the area east of the 15th meridian corresponds to the Soviet sphere of influence from Stettin to the Adriatic Sea. Whether this situation is accidental or has greater significance is something we cannot know unless the Soviet Union indicates whether it intends to extend its sphere of influence to the English Channel. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union wants to control Austria, but whether it will stop there after controlling Austria is difficult to predict. Whether the Soviet Union's ambitions have limits or will continue to expand is unknown. We must know that the Soviet Union has more than one way to expand its influence. One of them is to promote communism in various countries to establish Soviet governments, which is also a reason for the concern of Western democratic nations. The Soviet Union is still thinking about gaining a foothold in the Mediterranean, and there are also several major issues in the Far East that need to be resolved urgently. Unless the Soviet Union's ambitions are unlimited, we believe that the time when it will be satisfied in Europe is not far off.

### The Chief of Reform, The Number One Chinese Traitor, Liang Hongzhi is Interrogated, His Confessions are Mostly Absurd and He Uses Fallacious Arguments

[Report from this newspaper] Liang Hongzhi, the leader of the puppet "Reformed Government" and the number one Chinese traitor who first colluded with the enemy and betrayed the country in the Hua Zhong area, was interrogated for the first time yesterday afternoon at 3:30 p.m. by Judge Liu Yugui of the Special Criminal Court of the High Court, along with Prosecutor Dai and Assessors Qiu and Cao. The court ordered a postponement of the trial.

Liang Hongzhi, whose courtesy name is Zhongyi, is 64 years old and from Changle, Fujian. When he was brought to trial yesterday morning, he was wearing a blue Indian silk long gown, yellow socks, black cloth shoes, and had a shaved head with white hair. His face was fleshy, and he was hard of hearing in both ears. When he entered the court, he carried a Japanese-made notebook, which contained many pages of defense information. He also brought a black leather eyeglass case, and he put on old glasses when reading the documents, looking like a Confucian scholar. After reading, he carefully put them away and constantly straightened his collar with his right hand. According to his confession, he has four or five family members, and all his property has been reported to the Military Statistics Bureau. He said that he organized the "Reformed Government" because the central government could not recover the occupied areas or move people inland, nor did it implement a scorched earth policy. The Japanese invaders looted, robbed, burned, killed, and raped with impunity. The land of three provinces and two cities in central China, which accounts for a quarter of the country's population, is the essence of the country. In order to preserve the country's vitality and alleviate the suffering of the people, he entered "hell" and willingly did so. Then, he answered the charges listed in the indictment one by one, using fallacious arguments and making broad statements about merit and demerit, which were rebuked by the judge. He then said: "I have no military force to take over the customs." Subsequently, his lawyers, Zhu Hongru and Li Guozhen (Zhang Shizhao did not arrive), submitted four documents from the Military Statistics Bureau and other organizations, and applied to summon Xue Dake as a witness.

Change to the National Flag

The judge asked: "When did you start discussing the organization of the puppet regime and with whom?" He answered: "In the spring of the 27th year with Chen Jintao, Chen Qun, and others." Asked: "Did you contact Tadayoshi Matsuzawa and Shiyuu Minamoto?" He answered: "I don't remember. Chen Qun contacted the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Military Headquarters." Asked: "Did you talk to Mamoru Shigemitsu?" He answered: "No, the Japanese Embassy sent a Secretary Shimizu to contact us." Asked: "Who was responsible for the two departments of the puppet Reformed Government?" He answered: "In addition to me being the head of the Executive Yuan, Wen Zongyao was the head of the Legislative Yuan, Chen Jintao was in charge of the Ministry of Finance, Ren Yuandao was in charge of the Ministry of Pacification, Hu Chengtai was in charge of the Ministry of Justice, Chen Qun was in charge of the Ministry of Interior, Chen Lu was in charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Huang Zihui was in charge of the Ministry of Industry, Chen Zemin was in charge of the Ministry of Education, and Jiang Shaomei was in charge of the Ministry of Railways." Asked: "Did you change to the Five-Color Flag?" He answered: "Because the Japanese army insulted the Chinese people and the national flag, I changed to the Five-Color Flag." Asked: "How many people were in the Ministry of Pacification?" He answered: "There were four divisions, and the commander was Ren Yuandao, with a nominal strength of 20,000, but in reality, Liang Hongzhi during the trial (photographed by Yu Chuangshuo) was not up to this number." Asked: "How was the tax collected?" He answered: "It was collected by Shao Shijun's Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Tax Bureau, with a monthly income of eight or nine million." Asked: "How much capital did the Japanese side have in the joint Japanese-puppet Hua Zhong companies?" He answered: "I don't know. We cooperated to regain sovereignty."

Indiscriminate Issuance of Counterfeit Money

Asked: "What about the Hua Xing Bank?" He answered: "It had a total of 50 million, with the Japanese contributing half." Asked: "How much Hua Xing currency was issued?" He answered: "We requested 20 million, and 6 million was approved. In reality, only 3.07 million yuan was issued." Asked: "How were the Hua Tie and Telecommunications companies distributed?" He answered: "They were jointly used by China and Japan." Asked: "What about the Salt Affairs Agreement?" He answered: "Initially, the salt production was completely monopolized by the Japanese Navy, and the people suffered greatly. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance negotiated and established a joint venture." Asked: "What was the work of the puppet Anti-Smoking Bureau?" He answered: "It was run by Zhu Yao. The Japanese sold alcohol, and we banned it." Asked: "Was the tobacco tax 20 to 30 million?" He answered: "Only 1 to 2 million." Asked: "What did Wang Jingwei come to Shanghai on April 5th of the 28th year to talk about?" He answered: "We didn't talk about politics, just went through the motions for an hour." Asked: "On April 6th of the 27th year, you went to Ping to meet Wang Kemin, and Wang came to see you again on the 27th of the same month. In September, both parties sent representatives to Dalian to organize the Joint Committee of the Puppet Chinese Government?" He answered: "Yes, the purpose was to (1) implement the exchange of goods (coal, rice) between the north and south; (2) jointly deal with the harsh demands of the Japanese army." Asked: "Did you and Wang Jingwei meet in Nanjing on the third day of the 28th year to jointly prepare the puppet national government?" He answered: "No, we only discussed this on March 2nd of the 29th year." Asked: "What impeachments did you make during your tenure in the puppet Control Yuan?" He answered: "The biggest one was the rice case of Zhou Naiwen and others." Asked: "What was the result?" He answered: "Nothing." Asked: "What did you do as the head of the puppet Legislative Yuan on November 20th of the 33rd year?" He answered: "Only revised one or two regulations and detailed rules of various departments."

Husband and Wife Console Each Other

Asked: "When did you turn yourself in?" He answered: "On July 15th of last year, I entrusted a friend to deliver a letter of surrender to Director Dai of Chun'an, Zhejiang. A month later, I received an order from Chairman Chiang to go to Nanjing to handle the handover and work in the advance headquarters until October 20th, when I surrendered to the Military Statistics Bureau." The interrogation ended at 5:40 p.m. After being received, his wife comforted him. Liang's attitude remained optimistic.

### Initial Meeting of the Bureau After the Supplementary Registration of Grain Decides to Conduct Another Inspection

[Report from this newspaper] I recently interviewed Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Wu Kaixian, to inquire about the exact amount of grain registered in the city. According to reports: The total amount of grain registered for the first time was about 440,000 dan. The supplementary registration, which was carried out for the second time, was just completed the day before yesterday. Because the various trade associations had to submit the figures for the supplementary registration to the bureau yesterday, the exact amount is still unknown. However, the Bureau of Social Affairs has decided to send personnel to conduct a supplementary inspection to prevent private accumulation or deception. As for Rong Yongming, the owner of Wu Chang Rice Store, who was detained again for price gouging, he is still being held at the police station. The method of disposal has not yet been decided.

### Grand Gathering at Kang Le Restaurant; Journalists Welcome Veteran Journalist; Dean Yu Discusses Newspaper Affairs and Encourages Reporters to Work Harder

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, Pan Gongzhan, president of this newspaper, and Cheng Cangbo, president of Xinwen Bao, held a tea party at Kang Le Restaurant to welcome Dean Yu of the Control Yuan, who recently came to Shanghai from Nanjing. Those invited to accompany them included Wang Yunsheng, Hu Pu'an, Xu Jilun, Wang Xiaolai, Zha Liangjian, Hu Jianzhong, Zhou Qianchong, and more than fifty others. Dean Yu, with his flowing silver beard and simple blue cloth gown, was energetic and approachable. Yesterday's weather was extremely hot, and he fanned himself non-stop, but his speech was passionate and powerful, reminding people of his fierce and unparalleled style when he advocated revolution in the early Republic.

First, Cheng Cangbo gave a speech, praising Dean Yu as "the ancestor of the press," and said that during the Chongqing bombings, Yu did not change his enthusiasm for protecting the press. When the heads of various newspapers gathered to discuss publishing a joint edition, it was at Yu's private residence.

Dean Yu then stood up and gave a speech amidst warm applause, briefly stating that Shanghai has the most newspapers in the country. For decades, Shanghai has always been the key to many major events, so Shanghai is really Shanghai for newspaper reporters. All newspaper reporters should know the situation of the past eras of autocracy, warlordism, and the Anti-Japanese War and understand the meaning of the current new era. This time in Shanghai, he was excited to see the development of Shanghai's newspaper industry and the vitality of newspaper reporters, which have exceeded the past. The higher the news value of Shanghai, the higher the status of Shanghai. The fate of China also lies here. During the Anti-Japanese War, the spirit of hard work in the Chongqing press was inherited from the spirit of the Shanghai press before the war. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been successful, all sectors of the country are still paying attention to Shanghai newspapers, because Shanghai has better conditions for machinery, printing, etc. than other places. I hope all comrades will recognize this point and not give up easily. We must know that this position is of great importance to the country and the world.

### Those Who Win the Hearts of the People Prosper, Those Who Lose the Hearts of the People Perish

Newspapers are the army of the people. Newspapers occupying a place is the same as the army occupying a place. At the beginning of the enemy's invasion, they came to Shanghai first and tried their best to trample on Shanghai's newspapers and cultural institutions because they knew that this was a great force. However, newspaper reporters do not just serve newspapers, but serve humanity. If a newspaper deliberately makes improper claims, it will not be welcomed by the people, and its power will be lost. Therefore, the power of newspapers is great, but the authority of the people is even greater. For thousands of years, those who win the hearts of the people prosper, and those who lose the hearts of the people perish. Colleagues should follow this principle, take big steps, and move forward bravely. When I ran a newspaper in the early years of the Republic, all the staff members went to the army, and the newspaper could hardly be published. I told them: "A pen is more precious than many guns. If you really want to be a revolutionary, a pen is more powerful than many guns." Today, the responsibilities of reporters are even heavier. I deeply hope that they will work hard.

Then, Zha Liangjian, the president of the local court, said that the relationship between the press and the judiciary is very deep. Before the Pacific War, court personnel and newspaper reporters suffered the most coercion, inducement, and even assassination. In this new era, new world, and new China, consular jurisdiction has been abolished, and the court feels that its responsibilities are even greater. I hope that the press can cooperate with the court to lay the foundation for the rule of law. Xu Jilun said: He was also a reporter for the Shishi Xinbao back then and deeply admired Dean Yu's spirit of running a newspaper. To this day, he still does not miss a newspaper and does not miss a news item. Wang Xiaolai said: Newspaper reporters can be "members of the supervisory committee," assisting in correcting mistakes, which is twice as effective. Wang Yunsheng said: The Shanghai press should inherit the spirit of the Anti-Japanese War and work hard for national construction. He recalled that Dean Yu once had a debate with Liang Qichao because Liang praised the abundance of talent in the Pearl River basin, which was refuted by Yu, who came from the Yellow River basin. If a split occurs today, there will inevitably be a north-south dispute. Dean Yu should advocate more for the north, because the government must not abandon the north. (At that time, Dean Yu replied that this debate was forty-two years ago.) Hu Jianzhong said: If the press can cooperate with the work of the supervisory and judicial branches, the results will be great. He also said that running a newspaper today has become a kind of enterprise. The era of writers and political commentators running newspapers has really passed. As for yellow journalism, the press should be vigilant and resist it for the sake of the country, society, and the integrity of the newspaper.

### No Politeness for Grain Loan Fraud

Dean Yu Answers Reporters

Dean Yu answered this newspaper's questions: (1) Regarding the grain loan fraud case, it is under strict investigation. If it is true, then "we will not be polite to them!" (2) Regarding the treatment of civil servants, it should be based on the cost of living index, but the burden on the national treasury is too great. This matter will be determined soon and will be announced soon. (3) To investigate the takeover matters in various places, the Control Yuan will send seven investigation teams to investigate in various places, but the candidates have not yet been decided.

### The Wife of Murderous Demon King Wu Shiba o, A "Red Person" Who Covered the Skies with One Hand During the Enemy-Puppet Period: Interrogating the Wealthy Widow She Aizhen; Denying All Accusations with Claims of "I Don't Know" or "It Didn't Happen"; Afraid of Losing Face? Frantically Waving Hands to Prevent Reporters from Taking Pictures, Saying, "What's There to Photograph?"

[Report from Our Newspaper] She Aizhen, the wife of the puppet special agent and demon Wu Shiba o, who, along with Jin Jiqing, the wife of the traitor Li Shiqun, was known as one of the two great rich women of Shanghai during the enemy-puppet period, was interrogated yesterday afternoon at the Special Criminal Court No. 2 of the High Court in Ti Jian Bridge by Judge Yang Ding and Clerk Li Jinzhang, with defense provided by lawyers Yu Zhongluo.

She wore a black silk patterned cheongsam, her hair in a bun, with pointed-toe black cloth shoes and light yellow gauze stockings, a white gauze handkerchief in her hand, and a fair and clear complexion. During Judge Yang's questioning, she calmly replied, denying each accusation with either "I don't know" or "It didn't happen." When photographers tried to take pictures, she either turned her head away or covered her face with her handkerchief, revealing her embarrassment. As she was being escorted back to prison after the interrogation, photographers surrounded her again. She waved her handkerchief frantically, running and muttering, "What's there to photograph," and "How annoying," causing the onlookers to burst into laughter.

In court, She spoke pure Shanghainese, stating: I am forty-six years old, from Guangdong, and live at No. 49, Lane 749, Yuyuan Road. I worked as an accountant in the security guard team of the Waiting for Work Headquarters. I have one son and one daughter. All my assets have been reported to the Military Intelligence Bureau. Regarding the reported value of my assets being 500 million yuan, She claimed this was not true. She added that it might be due to the current price increases. I married Wu Shiba o when I was thirty years old, at which time Wu was working in a gambling house. In the 28th year of the Republic [1939], I joined the puppet organization and became the captain of the 76th Headquarters' security guard team, under the jurisdiction of Li Shiqun. After my husband went in, he couldn't come back, and in May of that year, I moved in to work as an accountant, but this was merely a "showing face" position, in name only. Wu Shiba o knew how to read, but not fluently. His acquaintance with Li Shiqun was through a friend's introduction. My motive for joining was because Li Shiqun told me that "Mr. Wang" would be coming to Shanghai to protect the people of the occupied areas, so it was necessary to organize a security guard team to protect "Mr. Wang." At the time, I didn't know it was the Investigation and Statistics Bureau. I only met Chen Bijun once. I knew Zhou Fohai, Li Shiqun, and the wives of Ding Mocun, etc., but there were no sworn sisterhoods. I didn't join any gangs and didn't take any apprentices. I am completely ignorant of gang hierarchies. As for the accusations that I served as a staff officer and deputy director of the 76th Headquarters, there is absolutely no such thing. I am just an ordinary woman. As for training special agents, I have no ideas myself, so how could I train other people's ideas? As for arresting and killing political prisoners, I don't understand politics, I have no opinions. Wu Shiba o never fired a gun or executed anyone when he was around. As for the kidnapping, extortion, gambling monopolization, and earthmoving, these things were likely done by others during the chaotic situation, and the responsibility was placed on the 76th Headquarters. Wu Shiba o's actions were all under the orders of Li Shiqun. The internal organization was complex, and I didn't advise, so I don't know clearly. Wu Shiba o was just a captain. He resigned after a year, and Li Shiqun suspected him of wanting to betray him, so he detained him for over fifty days. On the third day after his release, he went with Li Shiqun to Suzhou and was killed by the Japanese. This was on the nineteenth day of the twelfth lunar month in the 30th year of the Republic [1941].

Madam Fang Yexian Asks for Justice

When the judge asked about the 76th Headquarters' mass killing of Bank of China employees, She said she didn't know. At this point, Fang Dai, a witness, was called to the stand. Fang sobbed as she testified: I am fifty-five years old, from Ningbo. My husband, Fang Yexian, was the manager of the China Chemical Industry Society. On July 25th of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], he was kidnapped by men from the 76th Headquarters and his whereabouts are still unknown. I am submitting a statement asking for justice. The defendant was questioned about this, and She claimed she didn't know. She also said: Wu Shiba o didn't do illegal things when he was around. At that time, if someone committed a crime, the superiors would also take care of it, and everything wasn't that simple. Please investigate in detail.

The court then confronted She Aizhen with the statement given to the Military Intelligence Bureau by Shen Fenggang, the director of the 4th Division of the 76th Headquarters, which stated that Wu Shiba o's actions were all participated in by his wife. She Aizhen responded by asking whether Shen did more things or Wu did more things, and requested that Shen Fenggang be brought in for confrontation.

When the prosecutor asked about harming Central Government personnel, She said: I have never harmed anyone. At that time, "Li Shiqun, Mrs. Li," "Ding Mocun, Mrs. Ding," etc., all lived inside the 76th Headquarters. What great power did I have to manage anything?

Regarding Wu Shiba o taking apprentices, She equivocated, saying: They were recruited by Li Shiqun. There were only fifty security guards, including Zhang Guozhen, who was later killed by the Japanese, and Pan Da and Xia Zhongming, who were also figures in the Special Agent Headquarters.

Yesterday was an investigative hearing. At this point in the interrogation, the court ordered a postponement for further questioning. The defense lawyer requested permission for the defendant to meet with her family, which the court granted. She then whispered with her daughter for several minutes before being escorted back by the bailiffs.

### Fire in Eastern Shanghai: Several Dead and Injured

### "The Tiger of Jiangyin," Truly or Falsely Drunk? Zhang, the School Principal Who Survived the Tiger's Mouth, Resolves Not to Consider Private Favors; Shimoda Jiro to Be Sentenced on the 8th

[Report from Our Newspaper] Shimoda Jiro, the principal culprit in the Jiangyin Massacre, "The Tiger of Jiangyin," was brought in for interrogation again yesterday afternoon by the First Pacification Military Court. At the previous public trial, Shimoda admitted that there were indeed underground workers killed in the Jiangyin Gendarmerie on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival last year, but denied that he had participated in the matter himself, and presented former squad leader Oimota Seigi, Ozaki Fukuzo, Horita Kunio, and Ozaki Kenichi as four people who could prove that he was drunk and asleep at the time of the incident, and asked the court to investigate. When the court opened yesterday afternoon, defendant Shimoda Jiro was brought in first. Shimoda was wearing a grass-green military uniform, holding a military cap, and wearing long yellow leather boots, appearing quite calm. The presiding judge questioned him in detail. After questioning about the drinking situation at the time, the first witness, Oimota Seigi, was brought in for questioning. Oimota replied that he did not know whether Shimoda was drinking. Then the second witness, Ozaki Fukuzo, was brought in, who claimed that he did not know whether Shimoda was drunk. However, he heard that many people were drunk. Then the third witness, Horita Kunio, was questioned, who said that he saw Shimoda and others drunk that night, because he saw him arguing with [name unclear]. The presiding judge then asked whether the fourth witness, Ozaki Kenichi, should be summoned again. Shimoda said it was not necessary, they were all young and afraid to speak in court. Then Zhang Yuren, the principal of Jiangyin Middle School, who witnessed the massacre, was called as a witness. Zhang was over fifty years old, pale and thin, wearing glasses. He stated definitively that the eleventh and twelfth people killed that night were killed by Shimoda. He was the thirteenth person. Because he served as an enemy agent on the surface but was actually an underground worker, he was on good terms with Shimoda, so Shimoda saved him and hid him in the toilet. Shimoda was indeed his lifesaver, but because Shimoda killed too many people in the past, he resolved not to consider private favors and came here to testify. Prosecutor Lin presented a conclusion stating that the witnesses presented by the defendant had no definite proof on whether the defendant was drunk, and their words were contradictory. On the other hand, witness Zhang Yuren, who witnessed the massacre, was indeed arrested and his life was saved by the defendant, so he would not make false accusations. Please sentence the defendant according to law. Obligatory lawyer Qian Naiwen stood up to defend, saying that the defendant's past killings were not involved in this case. What should be discussed now is the incident of August 15th. It was the Mid-Autumn Festival that day, and it was after hearing the news of surrender. The defendant may have been drinking to relieve his sorrow. As for Zhang Yuren's statement about the situation at the time, it seemed too detailed, which aroused suspicion. Finally, the presiding judge announced the end of the debate in this case and scheduled the sentencing for 2 PM on the 8th of this month.

### The Ministry of Education Is Planning to Distribute 6,000 University Students from Nanjing, Shanghai, and Zhejiang; Many National Universities Feel That School Buildings Are Insufficient

[Special Report from Nanjing] During the War of Resistance, about 100,000 patriotic youth joined the army, including public officials and students. Among them, about 10,000 were university students and high school graduates or those with equivalent education. By the end of May, they will be discharged from the army and need to be distributed to various national universities for further study by the Ministry of Education. There are more than 8,000 such students in Chongqing. The staff of the Ministry of Education stationed in Chongqing is handling the distribution and placement of these students near Chongqing, following the Minister's instructions. In Zhejiang, there are 1,854 such students. The local authorities have sent a letter to the Ministry of Education, reporting the number of students who need to resume their studies and requesting the Ministry to distribute them. Including the students from the temporary university preparatory classes and preparatory classes in Nanjing and Shanghai, the total number is about 6,000, who need to be distributed to various universities. The person in charge of Nanjing Central University stated that the university has 4,100 students, and the current school buildings can only勉容容容容容容 accommodate 4,000 students. With the addition of hundreds of students to be enrolled after the summer vacation, the school buildings are really not enough. Although there are national schools in Shanghai, such as Jiaotong, Jinan, Tongji, Shanghai Medical College and Business College, and Fudan, because there were not many original students before, the school buildings are not spacious. At this time, there are more students than before the war, and some school buildings were destroyed during the War of Resistance. They also feel that the school buildings are not enough to accommodate new students, so each school considers the school buildings to be the biggest problem at present. The Ministry of Education is making every effort to plan and allocate the distribution of 6,000 university students, hoping that each school will accommodate more. Because the distribution is mostly at public expense, it must be a national school. If distributed to private schools, the public expense will be more difficult to bear. (壹)

### Homer of Provence

— Xi Shou

Provence is a province in southern France, with a sunny climate, dry land, and beautiful scenery, famous for producing olives, grapes, mulberries, and oranges. The local language is resonant, harmonious, and rich in vocabulary, capable not only of expressing concrete and moving objects, but also of conveying the most subtle thoughts and the most elegant sentiments. The customs are quite different and possess a Greek flavor.

Frangois Mistral was an optimistic and honest farmer who, at the age of fifty-six, remarried a young girl named Adelakle (or Delaide) as his wife, and she gave birth to this Homer of Provence.

On September 8, 1830, this future great poet was born at the Mas de Juge in Maillane and named Frederic. He spent his childhood in the fields, feeling the beauty of the southern countryside from a young age, listening to all the proverbs and songs of Provence, and absorbing the wisdom of his fellow provincials. Frederic Mistral reluctantly left his hometown to study in Avignon, and later transferred to Aix to study law. After graduating from law school, he hurried home one night in August. His father allowed him to choose his own career. Several months later, he said:

"Filled with this kind of surging wave, this force of Provence fills my heart, and I instinctively incline towards all literary inspiration or governance. An independent and unrestrained spirit protects me, and nothing can disturb me. One evening, while sowing seeds, I saw the farmers singing in the furrows as they followed the plow, and it was then that I began to write the first poem of Mireille."

Since he engaged in literature, he made it his vocation to apply the Provençal language to literature, and all his works were written in the local dialect. Furthermore, on May 21, 1854, he joined with six other southern poets, Joseph Roumanille, Theodore Aubanel, Anselme Mathieu, Alphonse Tavan, Paul Giera, and Jean Brunet, to found the Felibres Association at the Chateau de Fontsegugne near Avignon. The word "Felibres" is borrowed from a popular hymn, PO-rison de Sainto Anselme. This song depicts Jesus in the temple discussing with the seven wise men (Sept felibres). The purpose of the association is "to preserve the Provençal language, spirit, free pace, national honor, and outstanding wisdom." Their writings were published in L'Almanach provencal, founded in 1855. The leaders of the association were Mistral, Roumanille, and Aubanel. After the publication of Mistral's collection of poems, Mireille, in 1859, it was praised by all members, and he rose to become the leader. He devoted his life entirely to the Felibres movement with his unparalleled talent, tireless spirit, and selfless attitude.

Mistral's poems were never written sitting in a study, but rather in the wilderness, pacing and breathing in harmony with nature, while reciting his poems. He rarely stopped to record them in a notebook because he had a strong memory. In his masterpieces Mireille and Calendal (1867), there is the robust breath of Provence, the muscular movements, the free and simple character, the large intestines, the fertile plains, the northern wind of the south, the wildness of the mountains and the sea, as well as the customs, traditions, and scenery of Provence.

In the era of wandering bards, the era of Villon, the Renaissance era, the classical era, and the romantic era, those poets also explored the Greek customs, and only sang about salon women, palace maids, and young women being spied on or spying on their lovers, mostly following a single model. It is rare to see someone like Mistral singing about women. The protagonists Vincent and Mireille in his Mireille are like Romeo and Juliet. The young girl Mireille shows elegance, shyness, love, and respect. Her radiant spirit and pure beauty shine throughout the poem.

"Mireille, in her fifteenth spring… the pleasant sunshine opened her up, her face was fresh and innocent, with two dimples on her flower-like cheeks. Her gaze is like a drop of nectar that dispels sorrow… her rising breasts are like a large peach, not yet fully ripe. She loves to play, she is very lively, but a little bit wild! … Ah! Seeing such beauty, one can swallow a cup of water in one breath…"

The musician Gounod set Mireille to music as an opera, which spread widely throughout the world.

In 1855, his father passed away, and Mistral personally managed the Mas de Juge. In the spring of 1858, he traveled to Paris for the first time, where he was introduced to Martin by Adolphe Dumas. Martin read his poems and praised them endlessly.

Mistral worked on Calendal for seven years, and the final section of the poem took almost six months to write; but he still dared not let go easily, because he wanted to carefully polish the words and find a more resonant rhyme… He was truly a brave poet. The protagonist of the poem is a boy from Cassis – a young fisherman who catches whitebait. Because he loves a woman named Estérelle, he becomes a hero and does many extraordinary things. Once, he wanted to become rich and invented a fishing device that could drive all the fish in the sea near the dock. Another time, a robber in the Araules valley was chased into his den by Calendal… Calendal was truly a formidable child! In the limestone cliffs of Lu, there is a cypress that is so high that it is unattainable, and no logger has ever dared to go up there. Calendal dared to go up, and he lived there alone for a month. During this month, people only heard the sound of axes chopping trees. Those huge old trees fell one by one into the abyss. When Calendal came down, there was not a single cypress tree left on the mountain… Later, because of these many merits, this little fisherman finally won the love of Estérelle.

Mistral translated most of his works into French himself, and the French literary world considered him one of the great writers. In 1861, he received the Academic Prize, and in 1863, he received the Legion of Honor. In addition to the above-mentioned advantages, Mistral's works also have linguistic and ethnological value. From 1878 to 1886, he also published two volumes of the Provençal-French dictionary, entitled Lou Tresordoufelibrige, which is the best dictionary of the Provençal language and has been reprinted. From 1899, he began to organize the Arles Museum (Musee arlesien), which was established in 1909 in the Laval-Farré mansion in Arles. In 1905, Mistral received half of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Other major works include the novel Nerte (1884), the tragedy La Reine Jeanne (1890), the memoirs Mes origines, memoires et recis 1906, the poems Lis Isclo Dor (1876), Le POEME du Rh one (1897), Communion des Saints (1859), and Les Olivades (1912).

Mistral passed away on February 23, 1914, at the age of eighty-four.

Mistral's poems can be said to be untranslatable. Now, let us tentatively translate a poem from his masterpiece Mireille as follows, to conclude this article. The translation can only convey the original meaning, but cannot express the beauty of the original text, which is naturally expected. Magali, ah, my love, Magali, please lean your head against the window and listen to this morning music. The drums and violins play together. The sky is full of stars, but the wind is already silent. The stars saw my love and immediately gradually faded. "It's just the branches murmuring, I'm really worried about your morning music! I want to throw myself into the chestnut sea and become an eel in the rocks." "Ah, Magali, if you become a fish in the waves, then I am the fisherman, and I will catch you again!" "Oh! If you become a fisherman, when you cast your net, I will become a bird and fly to the wilderness." "Ah! Magali, if you become a bird in the sky, then I am the hunter, and I will shoot you down." "Ah! Magali, if I become a poor corpse, then I will become the earth and embrace you well!" "Now I finally believe that you are not teasing me. This is my glass ring, beautiful youth, for you as a souvenir!" "Ah, Magali, you bless me! Once they see you, ah, Magali, look at those stars, they have all been extinguished."

### The Land of Banyan Trees and Red Lychees

— Ke Di

Living in the atmosphere of war, I am often involuntarily driven on unexpected journeys. I remember it was the early summer of 1942 when I bid farewell to the mountain city and headed southeast along the rugged and dangerous southwest highway. In order to adjust the hardship and fatigue of the journey, I was able to stay briefly along the way, appreciate some memorable customs and local conditions, and embellish this tired journey: in Guiyang, the secluded and beautiful Huaxi; in Guilin, the dangerous and unique peaks and the misty Li River; in Hengyang, the turbid and rapid Xiang River and the faint shadows of the peaks of Mount Heng... I once stayed and traveled, and the differences in customs and languages in various places added more interest.

Because at that time the enemy's constitution was frantically harassing the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway area, not only did it prevent my progress, but it also increased the sudden danger to life, so I was once again thrust into the refugee group and began my third escape. Starting from Shangrao overnight, climbing over the Fen Shui Pass at the junction of Fujian and Jiangxi, bearing hardship and danger, I walked into the land of banyan trees and red lychees - Fujian.

Initially entering such an unimaginable realm, everything aroused my new and special feelings. In my mind, I always imagined that it must be a place with a very harsh climate, with many miasmas and epidemics, and that everything was relatively backward. However, my ideal was corrected by the facts I faced, and gradually curiosity gave rise to love.

I love to look at the huge, shady, evergreen banyan trees. In their shade, I often invite my friends to have pleasant picnics. I love to listen to the powerful songs of the boatmen on the Min River fighting the rapids when they are beaching their boats, which makes people feel the hardship of life. And the most attractive things are the specialty waxberries and lychees, which can be exchanged for incredibly cheap prices for things that are unparalleled in freshness, which everyone will greedily indulge in.

Due to the constraints of work, I lived in this land of banyan trees and red lychees for more than half a year. My psychological state gradually changed from novel exploration to passionate love. I learned the complex Min language, I loved to listen to the strange Fuzhou local dramas, I loved the Yan River by Yong'an, I greedily bathed in the famous hot springs of Fuzhou, and imperceptibly my living habits and hobbies were assimilated by my environment.

Now, in the fragmented memories, I occasionally extract some quiet dream shadows, but after all, it is always worth savoring.

### Construction and Art

— Wang Yachen

In the past eight years, Shanghai artists have contributed the least to the country, but we have not given up on our work at the base. We also dare to say that we have made considerable efforts at the base.

From today onwards, we must move forward on the road of construction. To build a modern country, material and spiritual aspects should advance simultaneously. The two are like the left and right hands, indispensable. Therefore, in emerging countries that are launching material construction, they should not forget to promote spiritual construction. In China, where it is urgently necessary to promote science, art should also be actively promoted.

Before the past eight years, science, agriculture, medicine, and engineering were the most important, and art was too neglected. After various tests during the Anti-Japanese War, we should not forget a psychological foundation. We know even more that the upward development of national life is half based on culture.

The revitalization of art depends on the government and society on one hand, and on the artists on the other. The government should plan, promote, and reward, while the artists should research, produce, and even create. With such cooperation, results can definitely be achieved. At the same time, everyone in society should bear the joint responsibility of promoting it.

Shanghai already has an art association organization. After careful and thorough preparations, a grand exhibition of works will be held first in this city. As for the work to be done in the association, such as the preparation of art museums, the publication of art periodicals, the roving exhibitions in various places, and the art propaganda to the international community, etc., we hope that every artist will exert their own enthusiasm in order to assist our national construction with collective efforts!

Long Continuous Serial

### Double Swallows Flying Together (46)

— Zhao Qingge

In the blink of an eye, it was the winter solstice. The weather in Beijing was much colder than in Jingzhou, and the houses were all iced up. Zhihua was somewhat unable to withstand the onslaught of the severe cold, and inevitably became lazy in her studies.

One day, Zhang Xian wanted to teach Lihua how to practice her stage movements. Lihua was learning the play "The Drunken Concubine" at this time, and Zhang Xian asked her to take off her cotton clothes and wear only a single shirt, and then have her perform a few waist-bending postures. Lihua refused, so Zhang Xian forced her. Lihua finally learned half of it, but couldn't hold on and fainted to the ground! When she woke up, she found herself being held tightly in Zhang Xian's arms, and still only wearing a single shirt. So the memory of a few months ago immediately floated into her mind again. She pushed Zhang Xian away in uncontrollable rage, picked up her cotton clothes, and walked out. But Zhang Xian also changed his face and shouted sternly:

"Keep practicing! You're not allowed to leave."

Lihua didn't listen, stubbornly answering him:

"I will leave! See what you can do to me? You bad person, you don't deserve to be my teacher!"

These words angered Zhang Xian. Without saying anything, he grabbed Lihua with one hand and whipped her body hard with the horse whip used on the stage with the other. Pitifully, that already frozen and hungry flesh was beaten with bloodstains, covered in cuts and bruises!

Lihua rolled on the ground. In extreme pain, she couldn't help shouting loudly for help, but there was no response at all. Because this was also a condition that Zhang Xian had agreed upon with Mrs. Mo in advance. He stated that he had the right to beat his apprentice and that no one else was allowed to interfere. Therefore, even though Mrs. Mo heard Lihua's cries, she couldn't come over to stop or persuade her.

"Will you listen or not?" Zhang Xian deliberately stopped and loudly "justified" his question to Lihua. "Now give me practice again from the beginning!"

Lihua didn't dare to disobey, so she had to crawl up, but couldn't stand up! Her limbs trembled with pain. Zhang Xian thought she was resisting him, so he angrily and forcefully whipped her buttocks again. At this time, Lihua shouted loudly, her eyes went black, and she fell down suddenly, her soul floating out of her body like catkins!

Seeing this, Zhang Xian was afraid that he would cause a life-threatening disaster, so he had to stop, pick up Lihua, and put on her cotton clothes for her. He sprayed her awake with cold water. Then, pretending to be panting, he called Mrs. Mo over.

"This young lady of yours has a really big temper. After being beaten a couple of times, she gets so angry that she almost dies. I won't dare to teach her anymore in the future. Please hire someone else!" Zhang Xian said, picking up his huqin and preparing to leave. Seeing Lihua's dying look, Mrs. Mo, although feeling sorry for her daughter, couldn't help but endure the pain and let her daughter overcome this learning difficulty in order to realize her own vain dreams. In addition, she didn't suspect that Zhang Xian had abused Lihua. She completely believed Zhang Xian's words, and she knew that Lihua's temperament was indeed not good. So not only did she not blame Zhang Xian, but she apologized to Zhang Xian and repeatedly asked him to forgive Lihua and continue teaching her. Moreover, she voluntarily offered to increase the tuition fee to forty hanging coins per month starting next year.

### Unstable Situation and Relaxed Credit; Gold Prices Rise Steadily; Rumors of Further Appreciation for US Dollars

Yesterday, the situation was unstable, and people were still eager to buy. The market opened above 1.8 million, and demand exceeded supply, gradually rising to 1.845 million. After that, it slightly retreated, falling to around 1.825 million after 10:00 AM. The Central Bank allocated 288 bars at a price of 1.82 million. After that, the situation was mediocre, and it hovered around 1.83 million. After 2:00 PM, forward delivery trading opened, stimulated by rumors of higher exchange rates for US dollars. The credit was also loose, and it closed at a high price. As a result, it closed higher than the previous closing price, rising by 13,000, decorated gold by 195,000, silver ingots by 2,200, and silver dollars were sold for 1,350 yuan. The shadow credit was loose, and interest rates ranged from 14% to 17%.

For foreign currencies and US dollars, buying sentiment was slightly eager. From the morning opening of 2,320, demand exceeded supply, and it once rose to around 2,340 yuan before slightly leveling off. At noon, it struggled around 2,330 yuan. In the afternoon, it initially leveled off and then strengthened, and as a result, it closed higher than the previous closing price by 15 yuan. The buying price of Hong Kong banknotes slightly increased, and as a result, it rose 7 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong telegraphs were strong at 430 yuan, and rupees were weak with a supply at 530 yuan. The official exchange rate for US dollars was flat, and it was still difficult to settle payments with designated banks.

### Bullish Government Bonds Being Sold Off; Default by a Certain Firm Settled; Collateralized at 6,000 Yuan

Government bonds continued to trade yesterday. The Unified B bonds opened and rose to 6,150 yuan. After opening, there were still many parties selling off. Midway, it once fell to 5,650 yuan, and then gradually leveled off. At noon, it hovered around 5,800 yuan.

After closing, a certain firm's bullish "default" was settled, with a collateralized price of 6,000 yuan. The Unified C bonds rebounded to a buying price of 6,000 yuan.

### The Joint Trust Considering Establishing a Bill Acceptance Office in Shanghai

The Joint Bill Acceptance Office, which was established in Chongqing in 1944 under the guidance of the Joint Treasury, has been operating effectively to date. It is reported that Secretary-General Xu Baoguo of the office, in order to alleviate the current difficulties in industrial and commercial finance, recently discussed the establishment of a bill acceptance office in Shanghai with relevant parties.

### Inspecting Financial Businesses

After the Ministry of Finance abolished the Special Commissioner's Office in Shanghai, it decided to establish an office in Shanghai to facilitate the management of financial businesses in the city. The principles for inspecting the operations of banks and native banks have already been determined, and this office will be responsible. Dai Mingkong, Director of the Currency Department, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and went to the Bank of China's office yesterday morning to handle official matters and discuss the inspection of financial institutions in the city. It is reported that although the Central Bank's National Financial Institution Inspection Office has moved to Shanghai, it is responsible for inspecting financial institutions outside of Shanghai. The inspection work within Shanghai will be handled by the Ministry of Finance itself, and Dai's visit to Shanghai is related to this.

### Cotton Yarn Trading is Sluggish

Yesterday, the yarn market was weak. Initially, "Double Horse" brand yarn was quoted at 1.3 million yuan, but there were no actual sales, only a small number of transactions among dealers. The price gradually dropped to 1.28 million yuan. Other 20-count medium and small yarns also fell by 10,000 yuan. Due to the lack of buyers for 42-count two-ply yarn, holders were determined to sell at a lower price. Although the price was 100,000 yuan lower than before the holiday, only three to five bales were sold. At noon, Fangjian Textile Mill, as usual, opened yarn sales, with prices for 10-count to 40-count single yarn reduced by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and prices for 32-count two-ply and finer yarns reduced by 100,000 to 300,000 yuan. Additionally, there were two categories of yarn and thread offered for tender.

Yesterday, New York's American cotton telegrams continued to rise by three to eleven points. The near-term price was US$28.28, the forward price was US$28.79, and the spot price for middling cotton was US$28.87. The local cotton market has virtually come to a standstill. As the price of yarn continues to decline sharply, both manufacturers and cotton merchants are taking a wait-and-see approach, resulting in very few transactions.

### Tea Market Sales are Strong

May and June are the months when new teas from various producing areas enter the market one after another, so customers are vying to purchase them. Tunxi and Suian are also green tea production areas in China. This year's new "fried green" tea has arrived in Shanghai in recent days. Dealers are negotiating with holders, but holders' attitudes are bullish. As a result, Tunxi tea is difficult to agree on for the time being, but the new Suian "fried green" tea has been agreed on, with an opening price of 130,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). Market sentiment is firm. As for other varieties, shops and stores in this street and in Suzhou and Wuxi still have a strong appetite. At the same time, Tianjin and other areas, due to excellent sales, also plan to purchase actively. In the foreign tea market, Jardine Matheson is also continuing to inquire about Fine Eyebrow green tea.

### Coal Market Shows Slight Loosening

The market for bituminous coal has been strong for days. The large holders who were previously suppressed have all taken advantage of the high prices to sell, and new entrants are also limiting their purchases to actual sales volumes due to various rumors, so the market has slightly loosened. Bituminous coal blocks have immediately returned to equilibrium. The sales of various grades of anthracite coal are still brisk, especially Yangquan anthracite coal, where the holders are all small players with insufficient capital. The market price continues to fall as these holders are forced to sell at a loss.

### Rayon Declines, Silk Continues to Rise

Although there has been some attempts to boost rayon prices in recent days, they have often risen only to fall again. Yesterday, the highest price for 110-denier Tianqiao Bright rayon in the morning was 1.345 million yuan, but the transaction price was 1.323 million yuan. In the afternoon, it was even weaker, closing at 1.3 million yuan. Miscellaneous brands also fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Mill-direct transactions were limited, and individual lots were stable. Yesterday, the asking price for "Gan" brand rayon was slightly higher by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, but there were no buyers. The price of silk "Meiya" bed covers was 10,000 yuan higher than the previous day, and "Dacheng" crepe continued to be 20 yuan higher than the previous day.

### Sugar Market Prices Increase Slightly

Yesterday, the sugar market was weaker as the Taiwan Sugar Company opened sales of medium-grade sugar. The guild set the opening price for medium-grade white sugar at 70,500 yuan to 70,750 yuan, a slight decrease of a few thousand yuan compared to the previous weekend. The company's warehouse receipts were priced at 68,000 yuan to 68,500 yuan. The Taiwan Sugar Company opened sales of over 10,000 bags of medium-grade white sugar at 66,500 yuan, an increase of 500 yuan. Numbered goods were opened at 52,000 to 54,000 yuan for hundreds of bags of "Diaoqing" sugar.

### Pig Sties Reduce Commission - 3.5% of Value

(Our report) Since the livestock market was ordered to close, the original pig sties have been preparing to resume business, as reported in the previous issue. It is now learned that the business they operate is largely the same as the market, but to reduce costs and suppress meat prices, it has been agreed that the commission charged will be uniformly 3.5% of the value, including all tying, trimming, weighing, and lifting fees, with no additional charges. It is said that the livestock market's commission was 3% of the value, but it was also necessary to charge 3% for tying and other fees, for a total of 6%.

### Encouraging Trading with Floating Capital - Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks Perform Well

Initially, popular Chinese stocks were sluggish. At the low prices, Yong Yarn was 5,600 yuan, Meiya 4,100 yuan, Jingfu 288 yuan, Xinguang 267 yuan, and Qinxing 210 yuan. However, after floating capital generally activated small, less popular stocks, they soared and were not easily bought. Some of the floating capital had to return to the popular stocks, so they recovered from weakness and closed at high prices. As a result, Yong Yarn and Meiya rose slightly, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose by more than half a percent. The less popular, small stocks varied depending on their assets and age, with investors making different choices, rising by 10% to 20%. After the market closed, the buying price for old, less popular stocks such as Xinho (Xinho has a 1-for-4 bonus share announcement) was raised even higher. After noon, there were even higher bids outside the stock exchanges for various stocks. Foreign stocks also performed well after initially being flat. The activity of securities firms increased, which contributed to this. Yi Yarn, which had retreated from around 11,500 yuan to 11,000 yuan, was finally pulled up to over 12,000 yuan. British-American Tobacco rose from 10,100 yuan to slightly below 11,100 yuan. Other stocks were also slightly brought up to close. As a result, Yi Yarn and British-American Tobacco rose by about 10% compared to the previous day's close, and the rest by about half a percent.

### Goods Arriving from All Directions - Rice Prices Continue to Fall - People's Food Problem Gradually Eases - Hope the Authorities Carry Out Original Intentions

Yesterday, the rice market digestion remained stagnant. Japonica rice, "Yangke" rice, and indica rice gradually fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Lower-grade rice lacked buyers. Only white rice was flat due to limited supply. New wheat and flour had already appeared, causing a shock to the market, with prices plummeting by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The edible oil market digestion was weak, with prices falling sharply by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. New broad beans arrived from all directions, causing a sharp drop of 10,000 yuan. Soybeans also fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Wheat bran fell by 500 to 600 yuan. Soybean cake sales were strong, falling by only 500 to 600 yuan. Red sorghum fell by 1,000 yuan. New wheat had no buyers. Wheat prices were bearish. Yesterday, according to the industry market, the amount of rice arriving in Shanghai included 7 types of rice, totaling more than 10,000 dan. The types and quantities are as follows: White Japonica 3,197 dan, Du indica 148 dan, Bo rice 1,429 dan, Wu rice 2,919 dan, Early rice 1,421 dan, White rice 310 dan, Yang indica 606 dan.

### The Food Department's Purchase of Over 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice has Arrived in Shanghai

[Our Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Haisu" ship, which had long been rumored to be carrying a large quantity of foreign rice to Shanghai, entered the port at dawn yesterday morning. After unloading public goods at the Qiujiang Wharf, it moved to the China Merchants North Warehouse Wharf. The ship carried 32,883 bags of foreign rice and another 951 bags from Haiphong, all purchased by the Food Department. Unloading began yesterday afternoon. Officials from the Food Department visited the municipal government yesterday afternoon to discuss the supply plan for this batch of rice. It is reported that it has been decided to adopt the same supply method as the recent wheat flour sales, which is to entrust rice shops to supply at a fair price. It is said that the current price of Haiphong rice is about 20,000 yuan per dan.

### US Price Control Bureau Cancels All Price Limits on Silk

[Reuters Washington, 5th] The US Price Control Bureau has just stopped the price limits on the following items, including silk, silk fiber, silk thread, imported red dates, cardamom, disinfectant, insecticide, dried fish, cloves, ginger, and other miscellaneous goods. Also, effective immediately, the price limits for all canned food manufacturers have been raised by 9%. The price limit for machinery and equipment used in the printing industry has increased from 12% to 20% since January of this year. The Production Administration announced yesterday that effective immediately, the price limits for all plain or printed cotton blankets, regardless of whether the raw material is American cotton or Asian cotton, or cotton mixed with 5% wool, are all increased by 7.5%.

### Overseas Chinese Return to Invest - Manufacturing Vehicles, Electrical Appliances, etc.

[Associated Press New York, 4th] According to the Chinese official news agency in Nanjing: "A well-known overseas Chinese industrial company in the United States, with a capital of 100 million yuan (national currency), plans to establish factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other Chinese cities to manufacture bicycles, automobiles, radios, and other daily necessities.

### White Tung Oil Exports are Slightly More Active - High Costs and Inconvenient Transportation - Difficulties Ahead for Export

White tung oil export trade has been interrupted for eight years since the war, and it is not easy to recover. Before the war, the average monthly total was around 5,000 to 6,000 tons. Since Shanghai was recovered last year, only a few thousand tons have been exported up to the previous month. Last month, due to the slightly lower price of Hankou tung oil, goods arrived in Shanghai one after another, and exports gradually became more active, totaling about 1,500 to 1,600 tons, which is incomparable to pre-war levels. However, looking at world prices, China's prices are uniquely high, so foreign trade cannot be developed without adjustment. Recently, a considerable amount of Hankou tung oil is still arriving. Dealers are opening at 64,000 to 65,000 yuan and selling at 66,000 to 67,000 yuan. Hongjiang tung oil remains the same. Qufeng Zheng Hong is at 100,500 yuan, Dachang Fengxi Deputy is at 80,000 yuan, Xiao Hengqing is at 78,000 yuan, Dayou Feng is at 76,000 yuan, and Xu Rongchang Liu Qingyuan Feng is at 73,000 to 74,000 yuan. The sales market is not active, and the market has little fluctuation.

It is also noted that the China Vegetable Oil Factory has tung oil refineries in Chongqing, Wanxian, Hankou, Changsha, Hong Kong, Kowloon, Wuzhou, and Shanghai. The largest of these is the Wanxian factory, which has a monthly production capacity of about 2,000 tons. The other factories can also produce 500 to 1,000 tons. In addition to supplying some for domestic sales, the rest is sold to Europe and the United States, with Hong Kong and Shanghai serving as separate transshipment centers. One thousand tons were exported from Shanghai last month, with each ton calculated as 2,000 city dan, and each dan priced at 67,000 yuan. One thousand tons have already been exported from Shanghai this month, totaling 5,600 barrels. According to the person in charge of the factory, the cost and export price cannot be balanced due to the inability to reduce domestic prices, the lack of transportation, the waste of time, and various restrictions on equipment and materials. To break the deadlock, it depends entirely on reducing costs and connecting transportation. Most importantly, if the shipping industry can restore bulk cargo barge transportation, a large amount of tung oil can flow in, not only preventing it from being frozen but also increasing overseas sales, earning foreign exchange, and consolidating the international trade market.

### Chinese Tea Sales to Britain

British Information Service London, 5th The London Daily Herald reports that Chinese tea will be sold in Britain this autumn. The Food Department has approved an import of 2.5 million pounds for this year, which is equivalent to 30% of the level from 1936 to 1938.

### Commercial Summary

Cotton Cloth Due to tight credit and sluggish sales, the market transactions are very rare. Fine cloth is brought down by 500 to 1,000 yuan, but white cloth and linen yarn are slightly stronger by 1,000 yuan because the summer season is approaching. According to previous reports

Lychee Seedlings A letter from Longxi said that a bumper harvest was expected, but according to recent follow-up news, the situation has changed suddenly, with only about 30% to 40% of the harvest, so the new market is expected to be not too small.

Hardware Large hardware black and white iron pipes have arrived in the first batch, and each store has a large amount of goods. Promoters are holding them as scarce goods, and the market has not seen a decline. Small hardware is in short supply, and door locks and drawer locks are constantly setting new prices.

Seafood Sea salted products, fennel, fragrant vegetables, and Ningzi are rarely inquired about, and the trend is stagnant. Sago, tapioca, seaweed, laver, and agar-agar are oversupplied, so they have declined. Coix seed, black moss, Ge Xian rice, and Qian Yuan fish skin have sporadic sales, and it is feared that it will be difficult to establish a foothold. Xianglian, wood ear, dried shrimp, and pickled mustard are actively traded. However, Longkou vermicelli stands out, with scarce arrivals and high heat, so the trend is quite firm.

Wood After the holiday, transactions are still rare and the market is soft. However, sellers are still waiting and watching, and prices are still holding. It is also heard that several tens of thousands of feet of Lauan wood will arrive in Shanghai soon.

Cigarettes It is rumored that the import of tobacco raw materials is prohibited. British and American cigarettes are selling well, and prices have risen. Old Knife Yunlie and Chinese cigarettes are also showing strength because British and American cigarettes are firm.

Chemical Raw Materials The prices of various goods are flat. Only caustic soda is in high demand and the price is rising daily because it cannot be imported. Insurance powder and bleaching powder are declining daily.

Correction The promoter of the Fair Dyeing and Weaving Factory listed in this newspaper's New Enterprise Survey was Tian Fengfeng. It is now learned that Mr. Tian's name is Fengqi, and he is the general manager of the factory. This is especially corrected.

Engineer's Day Special Issue

### Some Current Problems for This Year's Engineer's Day

-- Zhao Zukang

This year's June 6th is the Sixth Engineer's Day, coinciding with the first year of victory in the War of Resistance. It seems that we engineers have two special meanings in commemorating this festival: first, a review of our contributions to the War of Resistance, and second, an encouragement for us to take responsibility for national construction. During the eight years of arduous War of Resistance in China, our engineers worked tirelessly and made continuous efforts. In terms of industry, factories, ordnance factories, etc., were established to create machinery and products to reduce the difficulties of material and military supply shortages; in terms of transportation, important railways were built; Highways and airports were built to facilitate the transportation of military supplies. This kind of contribution originally belongs to the immortal achievements of our entire engineering community, but compared with the contributions of the engineering community of the Allied countries, it seems inevitably insignificant. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, how should we continue our efforts to strive for the world's first-class technical level, which is commensurate with our country's first-class power status? This is the understanding we should have in reviewing the contribution of the War of Resistance. The meaning of national construction is very broad. Economic construction, such as developing resources, developing transportation, increasing production, and prospering cities and rural areas, are all the tasks of our engineering community, and are even more arduous than the work of the War of Resistance; It is not easy to talk about economic construction because of the current transportation difficulties in China, production stagnation, high prices, and surging labor disputes. However, we must use the latest scientific and technological technologies to develop reserves, while putting labor on the right track and giving full play to its effectiveness, so that the land can be used to its fullest extent and people can do their best, so that the country can move towards prosperity and happiness. This is our inspiration for taking responsibility for national construction. Now, based on my thoughts at the moment, I will briefly list some special ways in which we can work hard as follows:

(1) Study the use of atomic energy All engineering technologies develop with scientific inventions. For example, with the invention of steam, engineering machinery mainly uses steam; with the development of electricity, engineering machinery mainly uses electricity. During this war, atoms have been used as a tool of destruction. After the victory, European and American countries have spared no effort in studying the lack of atomic energy. In addition to military needs, they are also studying how to apply it to general machinery. In the United States, there is already a proposal to drive an atomic train. According to this trend, it will not be difficult to have one day when the use of atomic power is universal. We engineers are in this atomic age, and it seems that we should catch up, pay special attention, and cooperate with the government, industry, and engineering colleges to establish atomic research institutions to study the combination of atomic science and engineering applications.

(2) Participate in the work of developing Northeast resources The resources in Northeast China are extremely rich in salt, and the Japanese have devoted themselves to operating them and achieved success. During this war, the enemy used it as one of the bases for invading us. The northeast is rich in phosphorus, mainly coal and iron; agricultural products are mainly rice, wheat, sorghum, and soybeans; the vast forests can be used for timber; the railway network is far denser than in the interior. Heavy industries such as steel, munitions, machinery, and textile mills account for 70% of the country. Therefore, the Northeast has long been noted by the great powers. It is now heard that 80% of the machinery in heavy industry has been dismantled and transported. The population of the Northeast, on average, is not dense, with a total of only 30 million people. If it is proportional to the south of the Great Wall, it can be increased three times. Therefore, those of our engineers who have ambitions should go together and participate in the active development work, and be advocates for other employees.

(3) Leading worker training to maintain discipline - Discipline training is as important as technical training. Without technology, the project is difficult to be perfect; without discipline, the efficiency of work cannot be increased. After the victory. Taking Shanghai as an example, due to the high cost of living, workers in various industries have successively gone on strike to demand increased wages. Some of them have seen a decline in production due to increased wages, so the capital side is unable to maintain it, closing factories or reducing working hours; those factories that have not resumed business are deeply wary and remain closed. This situation has ultimately led to both sides being injured, which is really worrying for the future of national industry. We should know that the hardships of life are a common phenomenon after the war. Workers' treatment should be adjusted as necessary at any time, and the work must be done by our engineers to lead the masses, guide them well, in order to stimulate patriotic sentiments, change the atmosphere, and move together towards the road of construction. It is the great fortune of the country.

### Ports and Our National Construction

— Shi Konghuai

A nation's people's livelihood, economy, and culture all depend on transportation for progress. The development of modern transportation is changing daily and improving monthly. On land, there are railways and highways; in the air, there is air transport. However, up to recently, especially at this moment, the focus of China's transportation is still on waterways. And the hub of waterway transportation is naturally the port. All international trade inflows and outflows, as well as the collection and distribution of large quantities of goods, are handled here. More than nine months have passed since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, but industrial production remains stagnant, prices are still difficult to lower, and the suffering of the people's livelihood has not been alleviated. The most significant reason for this is the failure to restore transportation and the inability to ensure smooth transportation. Therefore, it is an obvious fact that all future construction should focus on transportation first. Given the current poverty of our country's material and financial resources, discussing aviation and manufacturing a large number of airplanes is simply unrealistic. When it comes to railways and highways, with the current high cost of materials, even repairs are difficult, let alone construction. Even railways such as the Pinghan Railway, Jinpu Railway, and Beining Railway have not yet been fully unblocked. Various highways are also underutilized due to a lack of vehicles and small carrying capacity. However, waterways and ports are the easiest to restore. The shipping of the Yangtze River has seen a daily increase. Although the port of Shanghai was devastated by artillery fire, the recovery of prosperity has been rapid. This is because ports are not easily damaged, and waterways are mostly formed naturally, not requiring a large amount of human labor to build. Moreover, China has many waterways and ports; this is a natural advantage. Therefore, fully utilizing waterways and ports, developing transportation, and using it as a precursor to all construction is most appropriate given our country's national conditions and current economic and financial situation.

The more complete ports in our country are Shanghai, Guangzhou, Qingdao, etc. However, Shanghai is the most prominent in international trade. Therefore, the urgent tasks at present are: (1) Dredging waterways to facilitate shipping. During the Anti-Japanese War, the ports, waterways, and docks were not dredged, and the riverbed has inevitably silted up. Not only that, but the ships and equipment used for dredging were also transferred and lost by the Japanese army. It is easy to imagine the difficulty of undertaking eight years of undredged projects with incomplete equipment. It is necessary to replenish equipment and work hard to complete the mission. (2) Repairing docks and warehouses to accommodate ships and goods. Historically, it is only natural that maritime transport is frequent after wars. The warehouses and docks used in peacetime before the war are now insufficient after the war. It is necessary to add more docks and warehouses so that ships have docks to berth at and goods have warehouses to store. (3) Adding large and small ships to facilitate passenger and cargo transportation. The total tonnage of our country's ships before the war was not very large, and it was greatly damaged during the war. In addition, after the abolition of unequal treaties, foreign ships cannot travel on the Yangtze River and along the coast. The feeling of a ship shortage is inevitable. It is necessary to actively add ships to meet the needs. (4) Improving loading and unloading equipment to seek agility and economy. The loading and unloading equipment in our country's ports is very simple, relying entirely on manual handling. Currently, wages are so high, and work efficiency is so low, making it difficult to lower commodity prices. Moreover, the rate of loading and unloading goods at the docks after the war is much slower than before the war. It often takes a long time to load and unload 1,000 tons of goods, not only increasing unnecessary expenses but also affecting the flow of materials due to the slowness of loading and unloading. It is necessary to actively install mechanical loading and unloading equipment to allow ships to depart from the port earlier and materials to circulate quickly, thereby reducing the cost of loading and unloading goods invisibly and turning to lower prices. All of this relies on good port management; not only Shanghai but also ports everywhere should strive to achieve these goals. If we can persevere and forge ahead, we can revitalize international trade externally, and internally, agricultural and industrial products from all over the country can flow freely. The carrying capacity of ships is far greater than that of airplanes, trains, and cars, and their cost is lower. Therefore, considering the current national conditions, the primary focus of construction should be on ports and waterways. Our country has undergone military upheavals, and all undertakings need to be revived. The way to revive is to construct. The materials for construction, such as the machinery needed to revitalize industry, the wheels needed to improve transportation, and the materials needed for various construction projects, almost all now come from abroad. And the goods that come from abroad must first arrive at the port and then be transported inland from the port. Therefore, the port bears a huge responsibility and is the key to the country's revival. This is one reason. The port is the throat for the entry and exit of goods. Not only must maritime and waterway transport be smooth, but also inland transportation, such as railways and inland waterway transport, must be as integrated as all the blood vessels. Therefore, there must be sufficient railways and sufficient inland waterways to connect with each other. In this way, the smoother the cargo transportation, the more prosperous the port, and the greater the demand for railway and other transportation. Therefore, the port is the central hub of all transportation and the mastermind of all other transportation construction. This is the second reason. Furthermore, it concerns the communication of domestic and foreign cultures, the revival of the economy, the exchange of materials, the promotion of commerce, and the increase in tariff revenue, all of which depend on the development of the port. Therefore, the port is in the most important position in the country's construction. If we say that the grand plan for building the country should begin with the construction of ports, who would say it is inappropriate?

### Huangpu River Tunnel Problem

—— Dr. Zheng Hua at a Youth Conference

Yesterday (the 5th) at 2 PM, the Engineering College of Zhejiang University invited Dr. Zheng Hua, a consultant of the Ministry of Transportation, to give a lecture at the Shanghai Youth Association on Sichuan Road on "The Huangpu River Tunnel Project." More than 500 students, engineers, and guests from the school attended. Dr. Zheng has served as the chief of the Design Section of the Ministry of Railways and the director of the Capital Railway Ferry Project Office. He has very profound research on bridge, tunnel, and ferry engineering. In light of the city's active promotion of the plan to connect Pudong and Puxi, Dr. Zheng's opinions are worth our careful consideration. Dr. Zheng believes that building bridges, whether high-level or flat-level, are difficult to be suitable given the existing circumstances. High-level bridges have too long approach bridges, which will inevitably cause inconvenience, while flat-level bridges are even more difficult to realize due to the heavy boat traffic in the Huangpu River. As for building tunnels, low-level tunnels are difficult to construct, costly, and have long approach roads. Dr. Zheng suggests building high-level tunnels. The method is to make multiple sections of the tunnel on the shore using steel plates and reinforced concrete. After dredging the riverbed with a dredger, the prefabricated tunnel sections are transported to the construction site and sunk section by section to form a tunnel connecting Pudong. The top of the tunnel is just at the bottom of the river to avoid obstructing navigation. The tunnel is built near Zhongzheng Road, with the entrance located near the Bund of Nanjing Road, sloping downwards 60 feet to Zhongzheng Road and then turning 90 degrees to cross the river. Dr. Zheng estimates that this project will cost only 6 million US dollars and take about 18 months. The project is not difficult, the construction cost is not high, and there is no need to rely on foreigners for technology, capital, materials, and craftsmen. It is a very good and appropriate solution. Dr. Zheng also believes that this tunnel project does not require foundation work in terms of geological conditions, and the procedures are very simple. After Dr. Zheng finished speaking, people from all walks of life put forward opinions for discussion, and the meeting adjourned at around 3 PM.

### DDT

— Shao Fu

The weather is hot, bedbugs and mosquitoes are out in force, sleepless nights, and listless days are a great suffering.

Friends mistakenly believe that those of us who are internal affairs reporters can avoid such a disaster, which is a fallacy, because when we finish writing at 4 AM and return home, we are exhausted, and the bugs and mosquitoes wreak havoc. It's truly a matter of life and death.

The craze for DDT is justified.

Which brand is effective? It's sad to say that this expense, up to now, has cost me more than 20,000 yuan. As a result, every night I still toss and turn, dripping with DDT! Dripping with DDT!

I know that I am not the only one who has been cheated. Mr. Director of the Health Bureau, can you crack down on those slippery goods and prove the effectiveness of those that actually work!

### Foreign Methods of Evicting Tenants

Three landlords in New York City have been imprisoned for the following crimes:

The first one - dressed two children as demons, wearing strange robes made of metal fragments, clanging chains, and told them to hide in the attic and make mournful, ghostly crying sounds.

The second one - dug a small hole in the tenant's bathroom wall and offered people free "peep shows".

The third one - buried explosives under the house and detonated them to "scare away tenants they couldn't evict".

China - Shanghai - Nanjing - are all experiencing housing shortages. Isn't it the same abroad? Chinese landlords and sub-landlords always talk about "connections" (條子). Don't foreign landlords want money? Looking at the three landlords above, aren't they the same in the East and West? Their purpose is nothing more than to evict the tenants they can't evict, and the purpose of evicting tenants is nothing more than to sell the house or rent it to someone else. In the end, isn't money the root of it all?

However, the first method is almost childish and playful; the second method is too "ugly"; the third method is a bit too extreme. So, the result is that they are taken to the authorities! After all, it's not as effective as our noble countrymen borrowing the power of authority to oppress tenants!

### Yellow Croaker Market

— Bing Shi

In late spring, there is a large gathering period in the ports of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River - this is the season for fish spawning. The general people of our country's inland rivers, using conservative fishing techniques, probably want to know the excitement of this popular food distribution center.

The season comes as people plan, and the embankment is filled with dust and a suffocating smell. The houses, however, are brand new, with bright red backgrounds and black characters: ×× Fish Company, attracting a group of "helping ocean spawning" people; teahouses have become exchanges. The number of people coming in and out is visibly increasing, and their faces are filled with tension and joy. Sit down and have a cup of tea, and someone will come up and chat with you. Once they start talking, they talk so forcefully. Usually, the cheeky young men who tell jokes are also leaning against the table, seriously listening to the discussion about water, climate, wind direction...all of which are talking points. In the din of voices, there is a rich aroma of wine. Small punts carrying cargo to the inland rivers are parked in the inner harbor, neatly arranged. Contrasted with the turbid yellow river water and the green edge of the embankment, it can be said to be a beautiful scene.

The harbor is docked with small sampan-shaped boats, pitching up and down with the white waves. When the tide recedes, they are stranded on the sand. The flags of ×× Fish Company are hung at the stern of the boats. These sampans are called "fresh-catching boats". On the earthen city wall by the river, people are always looking out, searching in the surging river water. The wind sends chills from time to time. People do not flinch. The river water hits the scales and slams into the beach. If the masts of the masts appear at the intersection of water and sky, the people on the earthen city wall go crazy. They will never relax their goal until the black spot is clearly identified as a fishing "ocean-going boat". The "fresh-catching boat", which is lazily lying across, welcomes the "fishing boat" with all its strength like a scale bar. Waves fly everywhere, vividly showing a rowing competition.

A fishing boat entering the port is a great fortune. The fishmongers are agitated, vying for each other. The owner of the fishing boat, having a whole hold full of lovable fish, puts on airs. They are very proud. The fish they catch are their fortune. Otherwise, how can they return with a full load? The fishmongers, in order to collect commissions, inevitably slap the table, and in the end, their face is the referee and the winner. After passing the inspection of the garrison and responsible authorities, it is time for the crew on the fishing boat to enjoy themselves. The fishmongers set up a special banquet to welcome him - the "shore-landing wine". The squinting, smiling fishmonger accompanies his wealth creator with great enthusiasm.

The fishing boats return with a full load. Relying on the power of the wind-driven sails, they are packed inside the port, head to tail like cherry blossoms lying down, and the upright masts are as numerous as the chimneys in the factory area. The soaked fish nets are hoisted high, like iron nets in the war zone. After the rain clears, the wet sails hang on the masts. Groups of people with fish scales all over their bodies began to move around, buying goods, drinking, gambling, and prostituting themselves... creating a night market under the petrol lamps.

From a distance, a strong fishy smell emanating from the fish market becomes more and more intense. The sounds of "Yo! Yo!" never stop, and groups of people carrying and backing rush back and forth. Empty baskets and baskets are all filled with yellow fish. All kinds of stalls are set up on both sides of the narrow streets, making the passage even narrower. If there is a pile of rubble or a small open field, it will not be deserted. Selling plaster, small snacks!... Naturally, there are also disguised gambling stalls, emerging at the right time. "One for ten thousand profit", "One Two Three", etc., piles of people here and there. If you want to gamble up and down, you are guaranteed to lose all your money.

Local hotels and shops are renovated. Prostitutes and singers... also rushed to do business.

The physique of the fishermen is healthy and strong. The two protruding eyes are bright and piercing. They are very talkative, and the flavor of fishing is often expressed in their mouths. Before the spawning season, they went to the vast ocean. During the spawning season, yellow croakers float on the surface of the sea, forming a huge school of fish. The sound of splashing can be heard from a long distance. The leader is the "fish king". The fishing boat that discovers the school of fish lets the fish king swim past before lowering the net. The "fish king" must not be offended.

The fate of fishing is entrusted to gods and Buddhas. The fate of the whole boat is also entrusted to gods and Buddhas. There is no reliance in the vast water and sky, no connection. After the spawning season, the fish sink deep and will never be eaten again. The happiness of a year depends on this one spawning season.

### Strange Procession

— Sima Huan

Nowadays, such a procession is often found on the street. In front is a white triangular flag with the words "Patrol Team" written on it. Behind are marines, military police, police, and soldiers of the garrison headquarters. The uniforms are different, and the colors are not consistent.

This is a security force to maintain public order, but it has a shortcoming: no air force.

Following the example, it seems that each of the four classes of people - scholars, farmers, workers, and merchants - should also send a representative to participate.

### Mirror

— Bian Shan

In a small barbershop, I suddenly saw a strange face of myself. I thought to myself, there couldn't be a funhouse mirror in a barbershop, right? In fact, it didn't seem like a funhouse mirror, because standing in front of a funhouse mirror would first make me feel dizzy, and there was no such effect here. Moreover, what was reflected in the mirror was indeed not a long face or a short, fat body, which made me even more suspicious: Is my face so unusually ugly? - Yes, I don't have a very handsome face, but I know that my facial features are always regular. However, what I am being told here is that my face is so strangely distorted. Is there anything missing? No. But it seems to have liquefied my face! My face is definitely not like this!

I was suspicious, perhaps when a person needs a haircut, there is a sense of slovenliness and ugliness. But I looked at the faces of others, the faces of the barbers, etc., and then looked in the mirror; I knew that this was a very dishonest mirror!

Therefore, when the barber finished my haircut and then took another small mirror and put it behind me, deliberately wanting me to take a look in the mirror, I immediately shook my hand; why should I be deceived again?

Back home, there was a broken mirror in the drawer. I took it out and looked at it, and I knew that this was my original face. Although it is so small, broken, and incomplete that it cannot show my whole body, this is a clear and correct mirror!

This poor mirror that was discarded in the corner of the drawer has now begun to regain its owner's love. It gives me a new revelation: A blurred or distorted full picture is not as good as a partially correct view! Because the latter can illuminate half of the face and then the other half; while the former is always blurred and incorrect.

Brief Collection of Three or Two Sentences

### Court Hearing Pass Costs 1,000 Yuan on the Black Market

— Wuling Ren

The Nanjing Police Department arrested a magician and sent him to Tangshan Road by truck, ordering him to walk back to the city to show a slight punishment. Tangshan is 30 miles from Nanjing, and it takes eight hours to walk back. The method is good; but for friends who originally lived in Tangshan, it is an opportunity. If you want to get a free ride home, you might as well go and see a free performance by the magician.

Black market for hearing passes at the Capital High Court has been discovered. To get a hearing pass, you need to spend 1,000 yuan. Therefore, the conscription office of the Ministry of Military Affairs suggested to the High Court that attendees should present their organization's badges to avoid the black market. If this method is implemented, the black market can be eliminated, but whether they believe it will reduce the congestion of attendees, because badges will not speak.

The Drama and Film Association has set up a wooden box in the Sichuan Road Post Office specifically for reporting those who have defected to the enemy. The association has scheduled to open the box on the afternoon of the 6th. Once the reported persons are verified, they will be reported to the authorities for strict punishment. Of course, some people are inevitably worried about this. I think there is no need to worry, fortunately there is still a stage of "verification".

In the ten months after the victory, the poisons and utensils seized in the city were burned in public in the Bund Park on the 63rd Festival, including four opium beds, several packets of opium bubbles, worth more than one million yuan, a jade opium pipe, and several ivory tobacco holders. A gentleman takes money in a proper manner, so this should be used for medicine. Since it is not waste, it should be used. It is a pity to set it on fire. Fortunately, it is only "four pieces" and "several packs".

Shen Guiqin, the wife of Ren Shuidao, a member of the Propaganda Committee of the puppet Propaganda Department, filed a lawsuit with the court for divorce because she deeply hated her husband's deeds. Among the families of traitors, she seems to be the first to resolutely demand a divorce because she disapproved of her husband's actions.

### Gold Bars for Houses, Spring Breeze Delight Tower

— Feng Yi

Recently, a child was bitten by a mouse at No. 21 Shou'an Lane, Maigao Bao Road, Baxianqiao. After being discovered, he was sent to the hospital, where he was dying and in danger due to excessive poisoning. Rats eating people seem to be no longer a strange talk, but rats in Shanghai biting people to death is still news.

It is said that the children of Chairman Yang, known as the King of Many Children, all use number plates as identification. Every time they go to school, they must be sent by two large trucks, which shows the large number of them.

It is well known that the Xinya Hotel on the Great World Road has become a cultural market for tabloid news. However, coincidentally, the Chunfeng Delight Tower in the southern city has become an economic market for gold bars for houses. It is divided into categories, bungalows and apartments. All good and bad conditions are based on the amount of gold bars as the standard. Every day, those who manage and run between them are bustling with activity, and the strange phenomenon of the Shanghai Bund also takes shape.

According to small merchants who "sell mobile glass": American cigarettes are made by the ubiquitous Jews, and many Jews come to major model offices to sell Western clothing materials, claiming to be British and American goods, but in fact, they are mostly Dongyang brand goods from the enemy-occupied era.

According to people from Chongqing: At present, during the repatriation, most people are still staying in Chongqing because it is difficult to return the coffins. They are all very anxious. Therefore, there are recent rumors in the market that someone is using "driving corpses to return home" as a slogan to solicit business. Some people even claim to have witnessed it with their own eyes, saying it is very convincing. Whether it is true or false, let's not talk about it for the time being, but it also shows the feelings of Jiang Laos in Chongqing.

### My Husband

— Li Fen

In my house, there are five people in total, including myself. My husband is a businessman, leaving early and returning late. My second uncle works as a cashier at the bank. The bank has a club, and my uncle often hums a couple of Kunqu Opera pieces. Listening to him sing Li Qi from "Selling the Horse," he becomes quite proud, and also teaches me to sing "Cassia Branch." When my husband comes home, he also sings Zhao Chong. My eldest daughter likes to play the flute and has been taking lessons from a teacher for two months; she has memorized the score and can already play it on stage. She has learned "Crying in Prison" and "Writing a Petition." When it comes to after-dinner evenings or Sundays, everyone gathers together and sings at the top of their lungs. Sometimes we invite our sisters to enjoy it, which is very enjoyable. Fortunately, it doesn't cost much money and is much more refined than playing cards or dancing.

"Selling the Horse" cannot be considered pure Kunqu. True Kunqu comes from the "Zhui Bai Qiu" anthology. The lyrics are particular about literary elegance; the melody emphasizes the four tones. If even one word is sung incorrectly, it is considered a big mistake. The teacher pays special attention to correcting the pronunciation; learning it well requires a lot of effort.

However, what I personally find most valuable is that my husband was originally naturally impatient, always rushing around busily, and had a hurried demeanor. He often had a displeased look towards his family members. Since engaging in Kunqu entertainment, he has returned from extravagance to simplicity. He sometimes says to me, "In the past, I liked playing cards. Needless to say, I lost, and even when I won, I had to treat guests, costing double. Eating, drinking, and seeking pleasure seemed very foolish. Moreover, prices are high, and it's not easy to earn money. If I can just get by and have peace of mind, that's enough." So this year, we hired a flute teacher again, specifically to teach tunes of "Righteousness, Harmony, and Obedience." He has already learned "Drunken Beauty," "Breaking the Willow," "Yang Pass," and "Jealous Qiao." Once, at a Kunqu gathering hosted by the Kong family at Songyun Villa, he boldly sang a piece, earning applause from everyone.

My second son, Cheng, is sixteen years old this year, and his voice is clear. He likes to sing the role of a young official, so he is learning the tune "One String of Eight Yang." At the beginning, when he sings "Carrying the whole world of mountains and rivers on one shoulder," he sings the last word as "picking up" [挑, tiāo], and everyone laughs. He says, "If the load is placed on the shoulder, shouldn't you pick it up?" I told him that this is when Emperor Jianwen was in distress, sighing on the road. But he is young, and perhaps in the future, he will be able to learn the melodies very well.
