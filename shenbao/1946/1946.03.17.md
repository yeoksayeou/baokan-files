[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] The Second Plenary Session held its 18th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 16th. 311 members were in attendance, with President Chiang chairing. After the Secretariat read the minutes of the 17th meeting, the Chairman presented a report on the Political Consultative Conference, examining Report No. 1, namely the draft resolution on the PCC report, and submitted it for discussion. Gu Zhenggang, convener of the original review committee, reported on the review process. Jiang Dingwen, Li Wenzhai, Xiao Zheng, and others successively put forward amendment suggestions, which were discussed and passed with amendments. Subsequently, the Chairman presented Review Report No. 2, namely the draft resolution on issues such as the National Assembly and the Constitution Draft, and submitted it for discussion. Convener Lin Bin explained in detail, and Sun Ke then reported to the Assembly on the principles for revising the Constitution Draft, the latest consultation situation, and the three agreements reached on the 15th evening, namely (1) The National Assembly is a tangible organization that exercises four powers, (2) The abolition of item 6 of Article 2 of the PCC's "Principles for Revising the Constitution Draft," and (3) The abolition of provincial constitutions in favor of provinces drafting autonomous regulations. As for the Legislative Yuan's power of consent to the President's appointment of the Premier of the Executive Yuan and the Control Yuan's power of consent to the President's appointment of political officials, no agreement has yet been reached. Wu Jingheng then put forward opinions: (1) The power and responsibility to enact the Constitution belongs to the National Assembly, and no one can restrict the statutory powers of the National Assembly representatives, (2) The agreements of the "Five-Five Constitution Draft" consultation meeting, the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session, and the opinions put forward by various parties and factions should all be sent to the National Assembly for reference, (3) After the Constitution is enacted, legal procedures must be followed to avoid ridicule from China and abroad. After the speech, President Chiang made a speech, elaborating on the Premier's legacy, the Three Principles of the People, and the Five-Power Constitution, stating that the National Assembly should be tangible and should exercise four powers, and the five Yuans should be separate and not mutually restrained, so that they can each be independent and exercise their five powers. The Chairman then announced the vote, which unanimously passed, and handed the case over to the Central Standing Committee for responsible handling. After a break, the draft resolution on the review report on the Northeast issue was discussed. After the Chairman explained, the vote was announced and passed. The case was handed over to the Central Standing Committee for responsible handling. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.

The President Attends the National Assembly with Dual Capacity

At 3:45 PM, the 18th meeting continued, chaired by Dai Chuanxian. First, the Presidium presented a report stating that regarding the qualification of the Party President to attend the National Assembly in the future, after the Presidium's deliberation, in addition to naturally attending and guiding the Assembly in the capacity of the Head of State, he should also be one of the Party's representatives to the National Assembly. Therefore, the President's attendance at the National Assembly should be in a dual capacity. The Chairman submitted this case for discussion, and after Wang Zhengting, Sun Ke, and others spoke and discussed it, the Assembly unanimously stood up and passed the Presidium's deliberation. The Presidium's three proposals were then passed: (1) The procedures for generating government members are as follows: Government members are nominated by the Chairman of the National Government and appointed by the plenary session of the Central Executive Committee. If the candidates from various parties cannot submit their lists before the closing of the Second Plenary Session, then they will be nominated by the Chairman of the National Government and appointed by the Standing Committee. (2) Since the war has ended, the Supreme National Defense Council should be abolished immediately, and the Central Political Council should be restored to serve as the Party's highest guiding organ for politics. Its organization and candidates will be nominated by the President and decided by the Standing Committee. (3) The procedures for generating the Party's representatives to the National Assembly are as follows: A. The Party should have 220 representatives. 150 of these are allocated to the Central Committee. The Central Executive Committee members, alternate Executive Committee members, Central Supervisory Committee members, and alternate Supervisory Committee members present at the meeting will use the anonymous limited consecutive voting method to select two-thirds of the names from the list of all members of the Sixth Central Committee (i.e., each person selects 100 names), and those with more votes will be elected. B. 70 names are allocated to party members and Youth League members who are not members of the Central Committee, but who hold important responsibilities in the Central or local governments and have struggled for the Party and achieved remarkable results (including members of the Legislative Yuan's Constitution Drafting Committee), who will be selected by the Standing Committee. Zhang Daofan, on behalf of the Presidium, explained the selection methods for Standing Committee members and Central Committee members of the Party in the National Assembly, and the election began immediately. The Presidium appointed the following members of the National Assembly Election Supervisory Committee: Huang Shaoqi, Li Qian, Huang Shao Gu, Hu Shuhua, Liu Hengjing, Li Yongxin, Li Ciwen, Wang Junying, Deng Qingyang, Dr. Yao Yue, Tang Shizun, Lin Bin, Xiong Bin, Qian Yonghe, Gesang Zeren, Ma Hongbin, Ding Delong, Li Yannian, Zhang Yi, Zhao Lanping, etc. The members of the Standing Committee Election Supervisory Committee were: Liu Wendao, Li Mingyang, Zhang Weizhen, Li Jingzhai, Cui Zhenhua, Wang Zizhuang, Zhang Zhen, Zhu Xiuxia, Liu Keshu, and Dang Zhen. After the election, the Chairman announced that many important proposals had not been fully discussed and that the closing date of the plenary session would be extended by one day. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

### Government Reorganization Scheduled for Implementation Next Week

[Another Dispatch] According to local newspapers: Chen Lifu is rumored to be appointed as Minister of Interior. The Minister of Interior will be a powerful position in the reorganized government, as he will act as the Premier when the Premier is absent.

[United Press, Chongqing, 16th] Today's newspapers report that the government will establish a Women's Department. It is also stated that the People's Freedom Protection Law has been implemented on the 15th of this month.

The three American engineers arrived here en route to China to assist the Resource Commission's design work.

### Following the Direction of Democratic Politics and Establishing the Norms of a Modern Nation: The Plenary Session Passes a Resolution on the Political Report

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] The Second Plenary Session passed a resolution on the political report at its 17th meeting. The full text is as follows: Since the First Plenary Session, Japan has unconditionally surrendered, and major changes have taken place in the domestic and international situation. The government, in order to achieve victory and peace, signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Furthermore, recognizing the need for peaceful nation-building, it convened the Political Consultative Conference. This is indeed a major period in the history of our Party. After reviewing the Executive Yuan's complete work report and the achievements in governance since the First Plenary Session, this Assembly believes that the Executive Yuan's work has failed to meet the requirements of this major period. The reasons for this are not one-sided. The government's ineffective implementation of the policies set by the Sixth National Congress, especially the many errors in financial and economic matters, are undeniable. In addition to resolutions on foreign affairs, political consultation, finance, and economy, the following are the main points of review and reform proposed for general administrative work, combining the Assembly's review proposals and discussions:

"Review Section"

(1) For many years, bureaucratic capitalism has long constituted the greatest political malpractice, especially with perfunctory behavior and abuse of power for personal gain being prevalent. As a result, officials do not know what their responsibilities are, and they do not respect principles and policies. This malpractice has become completely exposed since the victory. Various tasks during the recovery period were mostly unprepared. Some of the receiving personnel violated laws and disciplines and lost popular support, all as a result of habitually disregarding principles and not respecting the national system. This Assembly expresses deep sorrow and desires the government to strive for correction. The unreasonable treatment of public education personnel and military police is a major reason for low efficiency and lax discipline in recent years. The Sixth National Congress has already made a solemn decision on this, but the government has paid little attention. This must be effectively resolved in the future.

(2) The excessive size and complexity of institutions and the discrepancies in laws and regulations have resulted in unclear authority and responsibility, reducing effectiveness. Adjustment should be made promptly, distinguishing between retention and abolition.

(3) The mismatch between personnel and policies is an abnormal phenomenon in politics. The lack of distinction between political officials and administrative officials, political officials not knowing the policies they should implement, and the advancement and retreat of administrative officials not being fully in accordance with regulations have led to a weak sense of responsibility and rendered the government incompetent.

(4) Local self-government is the central task of the tutelage period, and successive Congresses have solemnly resolved this, but for several years the government has failed to effectively implement it, so that local self-government still has no foundation when constitutional government is about to be implemented today.

"Improvement Measures"

Regarding Reform of the Political System

(A) Regarding the reform of the political system, in order to seek progress in politics, reforms must be urgently sought in the political system, policies, and personnel, following the direction of democratic politics and establishing the norms of a modern nation. In terms of the system, institutions must be simplified, authority and responsibility must be clarified, the spirit of hierarchical responsibility must be implemented, and a sound civil service system must be established. The participation of non-Party members in government organizations should not be based on the Party's reasonable and effective reform of the national administrative structure, the main points of which are as follows:

(1) The National Government is the highest organ for deciding state affairs. All design bureaus, review committees, and specialized committees of the former Supreme National Defense Council should be abolished and merged.

(2) The various ministries, commissions, and administrations of the Executive Yuan should be rationally adjusted and divided according to their duties, so that name and reality match, authority and responsibility are clear, redundant branches are eliminated, and superfluous personnel are eliminated. After the return to the capital, the number of central personnel should be reduced in stages to replenish local manpower. However, alternative employment and career changes must be found for the laid-off personnel.

(3) The separation of military and civilian affairs is the norm of modern nations. Active military personnel should not concurrently hold civil administration positions. All matters involving military supplies should be handled by military agencies through civil administration agencies.

(4) The police are tools of the rule of law. In the future, the quality and treatment of the police must be improved to establish a sound police system.

(5) To clarify politics, a sound talent system must be established: 1. Political officials must be responsible for their policies. If policies fail or are poorly implemented, they must be held accountable. 2. Administrative officials must be long-term in their positions. The government must promote talent, eradicate the evil habit of appointing personal favorites, and should implement periodic transfers to gain experience. As for the improvement of treatment, all false systems, annuity systems, and pension systems must be clearly stipulated. In order to implement a sound talent system, in addition to the national budget, the authority and responsibilities of the Examination Yuan and the personnel departments of various agencies must also be systematically adjusted.

Regarding vigorous implementation of policies

(B) Regarding the vigorous implementation of policies, the policies of our Party's past Congresses have all been correct. The poor performance of governance is not due to errors in policy, but to ineffective implementation or distortion during implementation. The political program decided by the Sixth National Congress is still the guideline for future governance. The Peace and Nation-Building Program decided by the Political Consultative Conference is generally in line with our Party's policies, and we should lead all parties and factions to promote its implementation. However, in view of the current internal and external situation, this Assembly believes that protecting national sovereignty externally, clarifying officialdom internally, and stabilizing people's livelihoods are the foundations of current governance. Ensuring national unity and solidarity, protecting people's rights, and eradicating bureaucraticism and bureaucratic capital are prerequisites for clarifying officialdom. Actively restoring transportation and order to restore production and replenish supplies are prerequisites for stabilizing people's livelihoods. Therefore, the following matters that should be implemented immediately are solemnly proposed:

(1) Based on the principle of maintaining the integrity of territorial sovereignty and the determination to uphold international peace treaties, espionage on the true friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

(2) Adjust the border governments and make as much use as possible of border compatriots to participate in central and local administration in order to implement our Party's border policy.

(3) Effectively implement the military restructuring plan and urge the Communist Party to fulfill its agreements in order to achieve the goal of nationalizing the army.

(4) Governments at all levels must not arbitrarily establish orders without the consent of people's representative bodies at all levels and the approval of higher-level governments.

(6) The government should promptly investigate the damages suffered by the people due to the war and formulate compensation methods.

(7) All factories and mines recovered in the recovery area should resume production within a specified period. At the same time, new industries should be actively developed, first to settle demobilized officers and soldiers and public education personnel who have contributed to the war of resistance, and to mobilize national manpower to engage in local production projects and the construction of various public works.

(8) Immediately stipulate the implementation steps and methods for "land to the tiller." The government will issue land bonds, purchase land from large landlords, and distribute it to demobilized soldiers and poor farmers. It will also effectively support owner-farmers, protect tenant farmers, and rapidly implement effective agricultural loans based on methods such as taxing urban land according to assessed value, returning price increases to the public, and purchasing land at assessed value to stabilize rural areas.

(9) Investigate the wealth of those who profited from the war, impose heavy taxes on them, investigate the stolen property of illegal receiving personnel, and carry out the requisition of wealth and foreign exchange from the super-rich, especially strictly implement a moderate and reasonable progressive income tax system.

(10) Protect the property of overseas Chinese in diplomacy and support the businesses of overseas Chinese in the economy.

(11) Effectively improve the treatment of public education personnel and military police.

(12) The Water Conservancy Commission should effectively formulate plans and actively carry out river and river management to prevent possible floods.

(13) Conduct a national household registration and property census.

Regarding personnel innovation

(C) Regarding personnel innovation, with a system and policies, political innovation is still empty talk without sound personnel. Today's political malpractices are half in the system and half in personnel. The following are the main points of personnel innovation:

(1) Those who have been sanctioned or escaped the law due to attachment to rebellion and corruption shall never be employed.

(2) Those who have no achievements in their positions should be replaced.

(3) Statistics on corruption cases of receiving personnel. The relevant supervisors in charge should be dismissed immediately.

(4) One should not focus on historical relationships or emotional relationships, but on talent as the standard.

(5) Political officials should be judged by their understanding of policy and their ability to implement it.

(6) Content, or conduct a special examination, as the standard for appointment.

(7) One person, one position. Dual positions must not be allowed unless absolutely necessary. The above three major recommendations are all aimed at those that must be implemented immediately. This Assembly deeply hopes that the government will be aware of the seriousness of the domestic and foreign crisis, understand its duties, and diligently perform its duties, and no longer regard them as a mere formality. This is our deepest hope. (End)

### Responsible Persons of Trade Associations in the Recovered Areas During the Enemy and Puppet Period:

Whether they are Traitors Has Been Explained

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 16th] The question of whether the responsible persons of trade associations in the recovered areas during the enemy and puppet period are traitors has caused some doubt. According to reliable information, this issue has been decided by the Judicial Yuan's Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference. Whether a person who served as the chairman, director, or supervisor of a trade association within the jurisdiction of the enemy and puppet regime is a traitor should be determined based on whether they committed any of the criminal facts listed in the Punishment of Traitors Regulations, and cannot be determined in general terms.

### Exporters Active, Beijing Pig Bristle Prices Rise

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Financial circles report: Due to the fixed exchange rate, exporters in the Southwest, Northwest, and Beijing-Shanghai areas have become very active. Various countries are now competing to purchase furs, pig bristles, and tung oil from China. The price of pig bristles in Beijing has risen to 360,000 yuan per dan (3 to 4 inches), pig hair to 42,000 yuan per dan, cowhide to 85,000 yuan per dan, and sheepskin to 1,200 yuan per sheet, and prices are still expected to rise. Furthermore, the source of cattle in Beijing is extremely scarce, and it is reported that there is a buying spree in Bengbu.

### Robberies Occur Frequently in Beijing

Authorities to Strictly Arrest Undesirable Elements

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Robberies have occurred frequently in Beijing recently. At 8:45 this morning, the Laotian Shiyin Building on Zhonghua Road was robbed by three armed bandits who took away 14 taels of silverware and more than 100 gold-plated rings. This is a laughingstock. It is reported that the authorities will strengthen the crackdown on stray soldiers and idle people, and strictly arrest undesirable elements who once served as company officers in the puppet army who have escaped the net.

### Relief Deployment, Large Quantities of Supplies to be Transported to Northeastern Provinces, Madam Chiang is Planning to Care for and Educate Children

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Political news, after the government received the official news of the Soviet army's withdrawal from Shenyang, it has prepared to transport large quantities of supplies transported by the Relief Administration to China to the provinces of Cambodia via Qinhuangdao, to relieve the refugees who are suffering from famine due to war and banditry, some poor teachers, students, poor laborers, unemployed miners, and the families of martyrs who fought against the Japanese and puppets in various parts of the Northeast over the years will all receive relief in the form of flour or clothing, medicine, and milk powder. Plague has been discovered in the three major cities of Northeast China. Nine people have died in Changchun, two have died in Harbin, and four have died in Sipingjie. The Soviet army has taken epidemic prevention measures along the railway line, but due to the lack of medicines, the effect is minimal. After learning of this news, the government is consulting with the Relief Administration to send epidemic prevention experts to Changchun to provide relief. It is reported that Madam Chiang strongly advocates saving the Northeast refugees with food and medicine, and has personally requested Song Ziwen, Xiong Shihui, and Zhang Jia'ao to find ways to do so as soon as possible, because she once represented President Chiang to the Northeast and listened to the painful appeals of refugees in various parts of the Northeast.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Chongqing News: Madam Chiang is planning to provide relief to poor children in the recovered areas and refugee children withdrawn from conflict areas, and will promote child care work in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan.

### Marshall Urges Aid to China, Reported to the President on the Far East Situation the Day Before Yesterday

[This Newspaper Report] Washington, 16th Broadcast: Marshal Marshall said at a press conference that the National Government has a total of 250 divisions, including 39 divisions trained by the United States. Marshall urged the United States to assist China as much as possible when the Nationalists and Communists are united, including material and financial assistance. He said that China's unity is necessary for world peace, and that the United States is best suited to assist China in achieving this stable situation.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th] Marshal Marshall arrived in Washington this morning and refused to comment on the current situation in our country. Those who went to the airport to welcome him included our Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming, US Army Chief of Staff Marshal Eisenhower, Deputy Secretary of State Acheson, and other senior Army officials. Despite the fatigue of the flight, Marshal Marshall was in good spirits when he got off the plane and smiled at the welcoming crowd to express his gratitude. At noon, Marshal Marshall, accompanied by Berns, met with President Truman and talked for an hour. He will hold a press conference on the morning of the 16th.

[French News Agency, Washington, 15th] Berns made a speech at a press conference today. Regarding the issue of the nine eastern provinces of China, Berns said that the United States currently has no intention of submitting this issue to the United Nations Security Council for appeal. Berns declined to disclose the content of his conversation with Special Envoy Marshall this morning.

[United Press, Washington, 15th] Marshal Marshall returned to Washington from China today and immediately met with President Truman, with Secretary of State Berns and Presidential Military Advisor Admiral Leahy also present. Marshall made a preliminary report to Truman on the situation in the Far East, lasting 65 minutes. The content of the conversation was not disclosed. According to White House Secretary McIntyre, Marshall told the President about his current work in China and future plans, and will provide a detailed report before returning to his post. The date of his return to China has not yet been determined.

### After the Continued Retreat of Soviet Troops from Changchun and Harbin, Sino-Soviet Negotiations Will Reopen; the Situation in Northeast China is Expected to Become Clear in the Near Future

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 16th] Chongqing News: With the National Army’s control over Shenyang, the turbulent situation in Northeast China is gradually becoming clearer. The world's anxiety over the issues of war spoils and economic cooperation on Northeast China's land will, after the continued withdrawal of Soviet troops from Changchun and Harbin, reopen the door to negotiations. This can already be glimpsed in the following news: (1) Both the United States and China have indicated that they do not intend to bring the Northeast China issue before the United Nations General Assembly. (2) Unofficial diplomatic activities between Washington and Chongqing, and between Chongqing and Moscow, concerning the resolution of the Northeast China issue, will undoubtedly be based on President Chiang's solemn statement that "economic cooperation must be discussed after the Soviet troops withdraw from Northeast China," as Soviet troops have already begun to withdraw from Northeast China. (3) Chongqing diplomatic circles deeply appreciate the Chinese government's painstaking efforts to safeguard world peace and maintain Sino-Soviet relations, and praise the President's statement as prudent, practical, and respectful of friendly nations' dignity, a sentiment shared by the Soviet Union. (4) President Chiang's statement implicitly suggests that the issue of war spoils in Northeast China and Sino-Soviet economic cooperation in Northeast China may be resolved separately; the former should be reserved for further deliberation and joint decision by the Allied nations, while the latter should be based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty, implementing previous agreements and engaging in sincere cooperation. (5) This morning, it is widely rumored in the capital that senior Northeast China officials in Chongqing are preparing to fly directly to Northeast China in the near future, and it is also revealed that some prominent figures from Northeast China residing in Chongqing will be invited to return home to assist the government, pacify refugees, and oversee the takeover. In light of all this, it is optimistic to expect that a clear and comprehensive solution to the Sino-Soviet dispute will be reached before the Qingming Festival.

[United Press, Chongqing, 16th] Sources close to the Kuomintang have revealed that the Soviet Union will use Northeast China as collateral to negotiate with the United States. Judging from various signs, if the United States is willing to share the secrets of the atomic bomb with the Soviet Union, provide substantial loans, and make certain concessions, such as allowing the Soviet Union to establish land, sea, and air bases in Korea, so that the Soviet Union can ensure its security in the Far East, then the Soviet Union is prepared to withdraw its troops from Northeast China and provide the National Government with facilities to fully restore its sovereignty in Northeast China. If the United States refuses, the Soviet Union will repeatedly stall and continue to station troops in Northeast China, waiting for the Chinese Communists to gain strong control, establish an "autonomous regime," and implement Sovietization. In this regard, the Soviet Union has already discussed the "Manchurian Soviet" plan with the Chinese Communists, instructing them to launch an "autonomous" government in Northeast China to control the region and prevent National Government officials from promoting administration. According to this plan, the "autonomous" regime will be under the command of the Chinese Communists, and the Soviet Union will assist in forming a powerful army. The Soviet Union's actions are intended to prevent the United States from establishing a "defense line" in the Far East.

The committee's second report also revealed that three other scientists had also supplied highly confidential information to the Soviet Union. One is Jereson, Deputy Director of Production Management at the United Nations Ordnance Corporation, a state-owned company that manufactures chemicals and explosives. One is Nightengale, a telephone technology expert used in the construction of military air stations. One is Xu Jia, a PhD in Physics from McGill University, who was hired by the Navy to study submarine detection. Ross did not plead when charged in court with violating the National Secrets Act, and bail was set at 10,000 yuan, with the trial scheduled for the 22nd.

### Churchill's Speech at New York Welcoming Banquet: Soviet Union is Exerting Pressure on Iran and Turkey; The Security Council Should Handle It Immediately

Denies Ever Advocating a British-American Alliance

[United Press, New York, 15th] British wartime Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech at a welcoming banquet held at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel here tonight. Present were ambassadors from nineteen countries, including the Iranian ambassador, but the Soviet Union did not participate. Before and after the speech, there were marches and demonstrations, with a mixture of booing and cheering. Churchill made a V-sign for victory and waved and smiled amid applause. Demonstrators carried posters that read "Britain Kicked Out Churchill, America Refuses Churchill!" and shouted "Churchill Wants War, We Want Peace!"

Churchill's speech advocated that the United Nations Security Council should handle the issue of the Soviet Union's failure to withdraw its troops from Iran, and that if the Soviet Union continues to exert pressure on Turkey, the Security Council should be asked to announce a verdict on the issue of the Dardanelles Strait. The United States and Britain proposed to the Soviet Union at the Potsdam Conference to jointly guarantee the complete freedom of the Dardanelles Strait in peacetime and wartime, which Turkey would also gladly accept. However, the Soviet Union considered it insufficient. This is the first public announcement of the discussions on the Dardanelles Strait issue at the Potsdam Big Three Conference.

When discussing British-American relations, Churchill declared that he had never asked Britain and the United States to conclude a military alliance or military treaty. He only asked them to unite as brothers and form a free and independent friendly union. The growing closeness between our two countries is unstoppable, and the harmonious cooperation between the two countries is the main hope for maintaining world peace and human goodwill. This fact cannot be denied. He does not believe that war is inevitable or imminent. He does not believe that the Soviet rulers want to start a war at this time. The British and American people universally express sympathy for the Soviet people. If the Soviet government fails to use this feeling and instead disappoints and frustrates people, the responsibility will be entirely on them.

The Soviet Union has no reason to feel that its efforts in the war have not been adequately rewarded. Although its losses are regrettable, its gains are considerable. Germany and Japan, the two major enemies of the Soviet Union, have been defeated. Japan was almost entirely defeated by the United States alone, and the Soviet Union recovered almost all of its lost territories from forty years ago without firing a shot. In the West, the Baltic states and a large part of Finland have been incorporated into the Soviet Union. The Curzon Line is no longer an issue.

He was invited to freely express his views in this free country. He knows for sure that the hope expressed in his last speech to promote friendship between the two countries will be realized, not because of any speech, but because of the trends of personnel and the trends of fate. The situation has changed drastically in the past ten days, and the situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse, making it impossible for people to speculate. After he returns home, he may give another speech on the new situation. As for the recent events, there have been many misunderstandings, which he fully agrees with. He sincerely hopes that the Soviet Union will be peaceful and prosperous and occupy an honorable position in the world organization, which will not be diminished in the slightest. Whether the Soviet Union can do so depends solely on the decisions made by a few capable people under the guidance of their famous leader.

Churchill mentioned his speech in Fulton, Missouri, saying that he would never withdraw or change a single word.

New York Had Anti-Churchill Demonstrations

[Reuters, New York, 16th] When Churchill toured here yesterday, posters reading "No American Wants to Die for Churchill" and "No Third World War" were found on Broadway.

Police estimated that about 1,000 people in the demonstration were communists, and leaflets were distributed at that time with the message "Churchill Wants Your Children."

### Britain and the United States Maintain Close Contact to Clarify Tensions; Marshall May Be Sent to the Soviet Union as a Special Envoy

[Central News Agency, London, 15th Special Dispatch] According to the Washington dispatch of the London Evening Standard today: The US Secretary of State and the British Foreign Secretary believe that in order to clarify the chaotic relationship between Britain and the US and the Soviet Union due to the situation in Iran, they have telegraphed each other to discuss the possibility of taking three actions: (1) President Truman can send a special envoy to Moscow to meet with Stalin. This special envoy may be Marshal Marshall, who has just returned to the US from China. (2) Britain and the US can jointly invite Molotov to Washington to hold a three-foreign-minister meeting to discuss all important issues. (3) All matters are left to the Security Council to handle, which will be held in New York on the 25th. Which of the three paths will be taken depends on the nature of the Soviet response to the British and American notes.

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Secretary of State Byrnes told reporters yesterday that it was not convenient to comment on the Iranian issue for the sake of the interests of the United States and for the sake of our country's foreign policy.

### Nehru Says Strong Countries are Playing Tricks

[United Press, Bombay, 15th] Indian Congress leader Nehru, who will certainly occupy a key position in any independent Indian government in the future, told reporters today that "any aggression by any strong country against Iran or Turkey will be strongly condemned by Indian public opinion. The tricks of imperialism have caused two world wars, and some strong countries are still continuing to play these tricks."

### Sunday Forum: On Establishing "Provinces"

— Tao Qiwu

(1)

To gather tens of thousands of people into an army, it is necessary to organize them into several divisions, divisions into brigades, brigades into regiments, and regiments into battalions, companies, platoons, and squads. Only with proper order and a clear system can they be controlled, managed, deployed, and used in combat. Otherwise, they would be a disorganized mob, incapable of forming an army. The same applies to the implementation of governance by administrative organs. Below the central government, there are upper-level, middle-level, and lower-level administrative regions, delineated to facilitate the implementation of public affairs and ensure that principles are upheld, laws are established, and orders are enforced, ultimately achieving good governance. The "province" discussed in this article is one link in the upper-level administrative region.

Researching the "province" issue focuses on two key aspects: first, the "provincial area," which defines the spatial position of the "province" and specifies the scope of its authority; and second, the "provincial system," which stipulates how to exercise its authority within a certain area. The two are interrelated and inseparable.

(2)

The principles for dividing local administrative regions must respect historical elements. Within a country, each local people's group has its own special beliefs, languages, customs, habits, economic relationships, and ways of life. Over time, these gradually become a natural union, like an organism. If groups with different customs, habits, languages, and beliefs, and without economic ties, are forcibly combined into one, or if groups that are similar or have close relationships are forcibly divided into two, it will be enough to destroy the cohesion of the aforementioned organism, causing it to lose its spirit of cooperation and autonomy. Secondly, for the sake of facilitating governance, it is necessary to consider natural geographical features, population density, cultural level, and transportation conditions to create appropriate divisions.

The current provincial areas in our country undoubtedly violate the above two principles. For example, the people's lives, languages, and economic situations in Jiangnan and Jiangbei of Jiangsu are different, but the two are forcibly combined into one province. Furthermore, the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi Province make transportation difficult, but they are combined into one province, making governance extremely inconvenient. At that time, the alien rule, in order to accommodate the military situation and facilitate control, deliberately violated historical feelings and geographical environment, resulting in confusion and complexity. It should be re-divided and corrected.

In addition, the current "provincial" areas are too large, making governance inconvenient and conducive to separatism, hindering unity. Therefore, attention should also be paid to reducing the area so that the spatial distance between the people of the whole province is reduced, contact is closer, opportunities to exchange opinions and participate in public activities are increased, political knowledge and ability are easily enhanced, and autonomy interest and sense of responsibility are easily cultivated. This point is particularly important for future construction of "provinces."

Based on the above reasons, provincial regions should be reduced in size and the unreasonable phenomena that are contrary to historical feelings and geographical environment should be corrected. The simplest method is to re-divide the current provincial regions according to historical evolution, geographical features, cultural, transportation and economic conditions. In this regard, I quite agree with Professor Zhang Qiyun's proposal. Except for the nine northeastern provinces which have been re-divided and will no longer be adjusted, the provinces in this part of the country, such as Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangxi, and Guizhou, can be divided into two provinces, north and south, according to the east-west mountain ranges and rivers; Shandong, Henan, Gansu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Yunnan can be divided into two provinces, east and west. (For details, see Zhang Qiyun's recent paper published in the Chongqing Dagongbao; this article does not intend to discuss it in detail.) As for the provinces of Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Qinghai, Kangding, Xinjiang, and Ningxia, I believe that the status quo should be maintained temporarily, and adjustments should be sought after local stability and social progress.

(3)

The area is only the body, and the system is the soul. If the provincial area is only reduced and the provincial system is not improved, and the "autonomous status of the province cannot be established, then under the current system, provincial affairs must be presided over and taken care of by the central government. With China's large area, the central government directly manages hundreds of local units; the remote areas must have difficulties in control and management. Therefore, it is inevitable to set up supervisory agencies above the province, becoming a disguised revival of the large provincial area, just like the reduction of prefectural areas in the Tang Dynasty, and the occurrence of circuits above the prefectures that are the same. Therefore, in order to achieve good results in reducing the provincial area, it must be supplemented by the establishment of a provincial autonomy system. According to Article 16 of the Outline of National Reconstruction: It is stipulated that "when all counties in a province have reached full autonomy, it is the beginning of the constitutional period. The National Assembly shall elect the governor of the province as the supervisor of the province's autonomy. As for the national administration within the province, the governor shall be under the command of the central government." The local administrative system resolved by the recent Political Consultative Conference also intends to determine the "province" as the highest unit of local autonomy. In modern democratic countries, the upper-level local administrative regions all have considerable autonomous organizations. Therefore, to make the provincial system sound, the most important point is to cultivate the autonomy interest and sense of responsibility of the people of the whole province, and to support and develop its organic nature. After the "province" is recognized as a local autonomous unit, the powers of the provincial council should be expanded to include at least: (1) the power to pass the provincial budget; (2) the power to legislate and review provincial single-line regulations; (3) the power to resolve provincial taxes and provincial public bonds; (4) the power to resolve the raising of provincial autonomous funds; (5) the power to impeach and denounce provincial officials; (6) the power to select the provincial governor; and (7) the power to suggest reforms to provincial administration (the current power to listen to reports, consult, and question is not enough).

(4)

In addition to having a popularly elected council and a popularly elected governor, "provincial autonomy" must also have three conditions: First, it must have autonomous finances. Finance is the mother of all public affairs. Without autonomous finances, no autonomous undertakings can be carried out. The so-called autonomy will become empty talk.

In November of the thirtieth year of the Republic of China (1941), the National Government promulgated the revised outline for the implementation of the financial revenue and expenditure system, stipulating that the national financial revenue and expenditure should be divided into two systems: national finance and autonomous finance. Since then, the province as a level has no financial resources, and everything is controlled by the central government. Its due powers must also wait for the central government to distribute them at any time, and they are no longer fixed. Every move, every affair, and every object must rely on the national treasury to allocate funds. Under this situation, the provincial authorities become either unable to do anything or unable to do anything because there are no funds. Therefore, illegal taxes and fees (such as the goods transit tax levied by various provinces during the war) or the transfer of county autonomous funds are inevitable. In the past wartime, the government transferred the land tax to the central government in order to enrich military rations and food for the people, and abolished the "provincial finance" as a timely move. Now that the war is over and a full-scale demobilization is underway, and the autonomous status of the province will soon be recognized, the "provincial finance" should still be restored, and its financial resources are roughly as follows:

(1) Tax revenue (including land tax, land improvement tax, slaughter tax, business license tax, use license tax, behavior control tax, land tax), (2) special tax revenue, (3) penalty compensation revenue, (4) fee revenue, (5) trust management revenue, (6) property and rights revenue, (7) provincial business revenue, (8) provincial business surplus revenue, (9) subsidy revenue, (10) property and rights sale revenue, (11) provincial public bond revenue.

The proportion of the above provincial financial revenue allocated to its affiliated counties and cities should be determined by the provincial council, and the funds required for matters entrusted by the central government should be allocated separately by the national treasury.

### Chief Prosecutor of the Far East International Military Tribunal Arrives in Shanghai to Investigate War Crime Evidence

Keenan, the head of the International Prosecution Section of the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo and Chief Prosecutor of the Far East International Military Tribunal, led a group of members of the International Prosecution Section, including Hawks Hurston, Locke Liverlan, and Ningbao, flew to Shanghai by special plane from Tokyo yesterday morning, and arrived at Jiangwan Airport at about 5 pm, and went to the residence to rest. It is said that Keenan and others will meet with Mr. Xiang Zherong, our prosecutor who flew to this country four days ago, to investigate war crime evidence and consult witnesses. After a brief stay, he will fly to Chongqing with Mr. Xiang to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang. It is scheduled to return to Tokyo in ten days. Mr. Mei Ruao, the judge representing our country at the International Military Tribunal, will fly directly from Shanghai to the east, because the Tokyo Military Tribunal will begin hearing war criminals next month. The reporter visited Mr. Xiang Zherong at his residence in Huamao Apartment and asked about the organization and recent situation of the Far East International Military Tribunal. According to him, the Tokyo Military Tribunal was organized by the Allied Headquarters, and nine countries, including China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, were invited to participate. Each country sent one prosecutor and one judge to form an organization. All major Japanese war criminals who have committed one of the following crimes: (1) violating peace, (2) violating the laws of war, (3) violating humanity, will be brought to trial by the International Military Tribunal and sentenced to the punishment they deserve. The Military Tribunal is now actively preparing the indictments of the war criminals, and the formal trial will begin next month. During the trial, the International Tribunal will give the defendants as much opportunity as possible to argue their case. Civilized countries under the rule of law should give the defendants considerable protection within the scope of the law. Therefore, the war criminals being tried can hire lawyers to defend them, and if they have not hired one, the court will appoint a defense lawyer. However, all the crimes of each war criminal can never escape the legal responsibility, because it is to punish the warmongers and to protect the permanent peace of the world and the happiness of mankind.

### British Tram Employees Welcome Released Representatives

### Labor and Management Reach Agreement, Water and Wood Industry Strike Resolved

Woolen Industry Dispute in Negotiation

The water and wood industry strike in this city has been resolved. Tens of thousands of employees have all returned to work, and labor and management have reached an agreement on wage issues. Carpenters receive 4,000 yuan per day, plasterers receive 3,900 yuan per day, and apprentices receive 40% of the regular wage, which is 1,600 yuan. Meals during working hours are still provided by the management.

The labor dispute in the woolen industry is still at a standstill due to the second occurrence of fighting. According to custom, the income of the industry's employees is divided into two types: Lijin (a kind of tax) and wages. Lijin is a kind of profit-sharing method, which depends on the level of business and the amount of clothes made. Generally, employees rely on this as their main source of income, and the wages are very meager, ranging from 5,000 to 15,000 yuan. Now the employees of the industry, because the fixed income of wages is too meager, demand the following improvements: (1) In the Nanjing Road area, the wages of first-class employees are 100,000 yuan, second-class employees are 90,000 yuan, and apprentices are 80,000 yuan. In the Linsen Road area, the wages of first-class employees are 80,000 yuan, second-class employees are 70,000 yuan, and apprentices are 60,000 yuan. In the Hubei Road area, the wages of first-class employees are 60,000 yuan, second-class employees are 50,000 yuan, and apprentices are 40,000 yuan. (2) Double salary and bonus for two months will be issued every December. (3) Meals will be provided by the management. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs will convene labor and management tomorrow to hold negotiations in order to resolve the issue as soon as possible.

Shenxin Workers Request Resumption of Work Six to seven thousand veteran workers from the fifth, sixth, and seventh factories of Shenxin Textile requested resumption of work. Yesterday, they sent more than 20 representatives to the Bureau of Social Affairs to request relief. According to the workers' representatives, "During the War of Resistance, the enemy occupied the factory. We were unwilling to work for the enemy and left. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the factory should take care of us and enable us to resume work as soon as possible. If the factory cannot arrange for us to work for the time being, it should also provide us with relief." It is heard that the factory has agreed to provide relief as appropriate and is discussing the methods. In addition, the wooden machine part of Hailong Woolen Mill has not started work, and more than 100 workers have been unemployed. Yesterday, they also sent representatives to the Bureau of Social Affairs to request resumption of work.

### A Perfect Match, Double Happiness at the Door: A Record of Du Yuesheng's Two Sons' Wedding

Cars on Taixing Road Form a Long Snake Formation, Lidu Garden is Unprecedentedly Lively [Special Report from this newspaper] Mr. Du Yuesheng held a wedding for his fifth son, Weihan, and sixth son, Weining, at Lidu Garden on Taixing Road yesterday. The ceremony was scheduled to be held at 3 pm, and the reporter rushed to the scene by car around 2 pm. The cars on Taixing Road were already connected in a long snake formation, entering the entrance one by one, disgorging their owners, and leaving the exit in turn, circulating endlessly. Rickshaws and tricycles could not find a gap to enter.

The entrance of the hall was densely packed with reception staff. It was difficult to squeeze to the signing place, write the name, receive a golden shield-shaped congratulatory badge and a small package of cigarettes, and rush into the hall. I only heard the people at the door shouting, "Quickly pin the congratulatory badge on the lapel, otherwise you will be refused entry." The guests did so one by one, and crossed into the hall in a crowd. It was inevitable to have a full tour of the hall to know that the host, Mr. Du Yuesheng, did not come due to illness, and everything was replaced by his eldest son, Weifan.

In the hall, I only felt that there were dark heads everywhere. Every available seat was occupied, every advantageous gap was filled, but the guests kept coming in droves, men, women, old, young, military, political, industrial, and commercial...people from all walks of life inevitably tended to bow three times to the platform.

Flower baskets filled both sides of the platform, congratulatory banners were stacked, and patched every corner of the hall, in the center of the platform, a red banner with the word "Doctor" sent by Chairman Chiang was hung high, and the names of Song Ziwen, Yu Youren, Sun Ke, He Yingqin, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Kong Xiangxi, Qian Dajun...and other senior officials of the National Government were inlaid on the left and right. On the platform, golden shields, silver tripods, tall towers, and square frames were layered up one by one, like a gold and silver mountain, interweaving with the gold-lettered red banners on the wall to form a dazzling background. The Central Film Studio placed eight huge mercury lamps at the four corners of the hall, and eight strong rays of light were sprinkled on the platform and the aisle for the bride and groom. The camera stood high on the left corner of the platform, aiming the lens at the platform. More than a dozen Chinese and foreign photographers, holding camera cases, were busy looking for a suitable position.

At nearly three o'clock, the marriage officiant Qian Dajun, the introducers Huang Jinrong and Jin Tingsun, etc., appeared one after another. The master of ceremonies, Tang Zuanzhi, sang the beginning of the wedding into the microphone. After the officiant, marriage officiant, introducers, etc. took their seats, the wedding march began to play.

The grooms, Weihan and Weining, then stepped into the hall with a high head and broad strides, appearing in front of the platform. They were both wearing black ceremonial dresses, ironed flat, and they both looked quite fat, with Weihan being shorter. Then the brides, Yan Renyun and Chen Qingzhen, appeared with six flower-bearing little angels. They were both accompanied by someone, wearing pure white satin dresses, both with pearl flowers on their heads, and the veil hung to the ground, gently and slowly to the front of the platform. The two pairs of newlyweds began to form a neat row. The photographers began to mobilize, the silver light flashed, vying to leave this precious page.

Mayor Qian raised his voice and read the marriage certificate, the bride and groom exchanged ornaments, personally affixed their seals, and the officiant, marriage officiant, introducers, etc. stamped their seals one by one. The steps of the procedure were carried out quite quickly and skillfully. Then Mayor Qian gave a speech, saying: "Today, Mr. Du Yuesheng's two sons are holding a wedding at the same time, which can be said to be a double happiness. However, marriage is not only for bearing children, but also for seeking a fulfilling life and seeking progress in career. Fortunately, both pairs of newlyweds have complete education and will be able to love and help each other in the future, and their happiness will be infinite."

At this time, the atmosphere in the entire hall was boiling and the temperature was extremely high. Mayor Qian was sweating profusely when he finished his speech and hurriedly wiped it with a towel. Then Xu Jiching gave a congratulatory speech on behalf of the guests. Finally, the officiant Du Weifan thanked all the people presiding over the wedding ceremony and the guests on behalf of his father. The wedding ended in the bowing of the bride and groom to each other, and a commotion started under the platform. Red and green paper strips were scattered on the two pairs of newlyweds, and colored pieces of paper flew under the strong mercury lamps, reflecting brilliant and dazzling sparks, leading them to a path of eternal happiness.

### Deliberations on Establishing "Provinces"

(Continued from page 2)

(V)

Article 10 of the Outline of National Reconstruction stipulates: "During this period, the powers of the central government and the provinces shall adopt a balanced system. Matters of a nationally uniform nature shall be assigned to the central government, and matters of a locally adaptive nature shall be assigned to local authorities, without leaning towards either central autocracy or local decentralization."

"Provinces are recognized as the highest units of local self-government, possessing provincial assemblies, autonomous financial powers, and, moreover, autonomous undertakings. The most glaring shortcoming of the current provincial government organization law is its failure to specify what provinces should actually do. It merely states: 'Comprehensively manage all provincial affairs,' which is broad and vague. I personally believe that as national reconstruction work actively unfolds, provincial-level undertakings, except for nationally uniform affairs such as national defense, military affairs, justice, diplomacy, currency, and finance, which should be centrally planned and managed, other matters to be handled should be explicitly stipulated in the organization law, listing outlines as targets, so that the provincial authorities know what to do. In the future, when provincial governors compete in elections, candidates can also base their platforms on these outlines, publicizing their proposed methods to achieve the goals set in the outlines, and win the sympathy of voters. The scope of 'provincial undertakings' is generally as follows:

(1) Completion of province-wide household registration surveys and Baojia system reorganization; (2) Completion of province-wide land surveys, measurements, and land registration organization; (3) Completion of a province-wide health network; (4) Completion of a province-wide education network; (5) Completion of a province-wide telephone, highway, and waterway network; (6) Completion of province-wide wasteland reclamation, soil improvement, disaster prevention, and small-scale water conservancy projects; (7) Promotion of province-wide cooperative enterprises and public financial institutions; (8) Protection, initiation, assistance, and improvement of province-wide fishing, salt production, animal husbandry, sericulture, textile, and all rural sideline industries; (9) Widespread establishment of province-wide elderly care, childcare, and relief services; (10) Assisting province-wide people in finding employment, ensuring that farmers have land to cultivate, laborers have jobs to do, and entrepreneurs have opportunities to develop. With 'provincial' undertakings, autonomy will not be merely empty talk. The progress and expansion of provincial-level undertakings, taken as a whole, will also constitute the progress of the entire nation.

(VI)

According to the current provincial government organization law, the chairman of the provincial government is appointed by the National Government from among the members of the provincial government. The heads of the civil affairs, finance, construction, and education departments are appointed by the National Government upon the recommendation of the Executive Yuan from among the members of the provincial government. This is the legal stipulation, but in practice, the members who also serve as department heads are mostly confidants of the provincial chairman. The members of the provincial government are political officials, but if a member also serves as a department head, based on the order of appointment, they should be considered political officials concurrently serving as administrative officials. In the future, the provincial government should adopt a governor system instead of a committee system. The provincial governor will still be a political official, elected by the people for a fixed term. The staff agencies below them, whether the heads of the civil affairs, finance, construction, and education departments, or the heads of the secretarial, security, social affairs, land administration, agriculture and forestry, and food bureaus, should all be uniformly designated as administrative officials, selected by the central government's competent departments and nominated by the Executive Yuan for approval by the National Government. They should not advance or retreat with the political officials. In this way, various local self-government undertakings can be continuously promoted without being affected by political tides. This should also apply to the heads of bureaus and sections below the county level.

In executing their duties, the heads of provincial and county departments, bureaus, and sections are still subject to the supervision of the provincial and county magistrates, and shall act in accordance with the general administrative regulations of the provincial and county governments. However, they shall not be dismissed unless they are punished according to law or impeached by the provincial assembly. According to the above regulations, the successors of those who are dismissed shall still be nominated and appointed by the central or provincial competent authorities in accordance with the law.

Throughout history, the "provincial" level has been the most problematic in Chinese local government. For thousands of years, it has never been satisfactorily resolved. The reason for Zhu Yuanzhang's success was centralism, leaving nothing for the local governments to do. Decentralization, on the other hand, led to secession. Dr. Sun Yat-sen pioneered the theory of balanced powers. In my opinion, the explanation of balanced powers should be two-fold: on the one hand, it should stipulate that "matters of a nationally uniform nature shall be assigned to the central government, and matters of a locally adaptive nature shall be assigned to local authorities." On the other hand, it should maintain a balance between rule by people and rule by law, considering both the administration of law and the management of people. The above proposal to regard "provinces" as the highest units of self-government, with finances, undertakings, and powers, establishes the status of the province in terms of law. In terms of people, the provincial and county political officials are supervised by elected assemblies (of course, active military personnel should not be allowed to run for election), while provincial and county administrative officials are controlled by the central government, truly maintaining a balanced state, allowing the "province" to be fully engaged in governance while still being subject to effective central control and reasonable supervision, avoiding repeating the historical cycle.

### School Principal Knows Killer of Drunk Man

Japanese National Denies Committing Murder

[Our Dispatch] At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, Judge Zhong Xianda convened a session of the Second Criminal Division of the District Court to try a murder case. The case involved a Japanese national named Koyama Seishi, a 26-year-old male who had worked as an employee of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine Company in Henan during the enemy occupation. After the Japanese surrendered, he came to Shanghai and lived at 30 Wenhua Villa, Shikumen Road, at the home of his friend Wazaki Kunio, an employee of the Ryusen Coal Mine Company. Other Ryusen Company employees, such as Nakaike Hitoshi, also lived there. Nakaike introduced him to Yoshida Masuzo, who pretended to be a watch repairman. Koyama also met a Chinese man named Chen. The two obtained seven watches from Yoshida and two from Nakaike, which they sold to a store designated by the US military in the former French Concession. The money they earned was used up. Later, Yoshida pressed them for payment, and Koyama decided to kill him. On December 12 of last year, on the pretext of going to withdraw money together, he lured Yoshida to a liquor store on US Road, got him drunk, took him to a nearby deserted place, hit him on the head with a stone, and slit his wrists with a knife until he saw him dying, before fleeing. Later, Yoshida recovered and managed to walk to the Fifth National Elementary School, where he collapsed. The principal, Iguchi Tsuguaki, discovered him, took him to the former Japanese Army Hospital for medical treatment, but he eventually died from his injuries. Before he died, he claimed that he had been harmed by Koyama Seishi. The 3rd Company of the 3rd Independent Battalion of the Military Police arrested Nakaike Hitoshi and Koyama Seishi. They were handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. At the first hearing yesterday, Koyama Seishi vehemently denied the charges, claiming that he had been at the Volga Cafe set up by Fang Qiang drinking tea between 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., and that he had danced with a dance hostess named Yuri at the New Dance Hall. Judge Zhong ordered a postponement for further investigation and remanded the defendant in custody.

### Movie Theater Ticket Prices Adjusted

[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Film Industry Association recently requested the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to raise movie ticket prices, aligning them with those of Peking opera theaters. However, the bureau did not approve this request because the number of shows and expenses of movie theaters and Peking opera theaters are quite different. It has now been stipulated that, starting yesterday, the prices for first-run movie theaters will be 1,800 yuan for the best seats, 1,600 yuan for the balcony, and 1,400 yuan for the main hall. Second-run theaters will charge 1,100 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 900 yuan. Third-run theaters will charge 700 yuan and 500 yuan, and fourth-run theaters will charge 600 yuan and 400 yuan.

The municipal government stipulates that the entertainment tax should be 50%, up from the previous 30%. However, it is said that some movie theaters did not collect and pay the tax to the municipal government in February. The municipal government has now decided to order them to collect and pay the tax, or face closure or revocation of their licenses.

### Drifting Mine Found in Waters Off Sheshan

[Our Dispatch] Although the Allied US Navy has assisted in efforts to clear sea mines, it is difficult to completely clear them due to the vastness of the waters. Recently, they have been discovered from time to time. This is extremely important in relation to the navigation of ships. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company immediately publicizes such news upon receipt, so that all drivers pay attention. A few days ago, the Hai Gan, returning to Shanghai from Tianjin, discovered a floating mine while passing through the waters off Sheshan, north of Sheshan, at 32 degrees 15 minutes north latitude and 122 degrees 30 minutes east longitude. This has been announced.

### High Court Trials of Traitors, Arguments Concluded in Four Cases, Verdicts Set for the 23rd

The Provisional Criminal Court of the High Court at Tilanqiao held a panel hearing yesterday afternoon to try four cases of traitors. Arguments were concluded in all cases, and verdicts are scheduled to be announced at 2:00 p.m. on the 23rd of this month.

Chen Bohua: Served as a standing committee member of the puppet Lianglu Party Department, a counselor of the puppet Ministry of Social Affairs, and deputy director of the Shanghai Office. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution against Chen in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Punishment of Traitors, because Chen repeatedly held puppet positions and admitted to the charges. The defendant claimed that he was ordered to carry out underground work before the victory, using his puppet positions as cover, and that he contacted various "cells" after the recovery to participate in demobilization work. He requested a particularly detailed investigation. After separate arguments by lawyers Huang Jiyuan and Zhu Yongkang, he was ordered to be remanded in custody pending judgment.

Gu Guoxiong: Served as an intelligence agent for the Nanshi enemy military police, claiming to be a former policeman who was transferred to a tea service role by the enemy military police. Defense lawyer Huang Jiyuan also argued that Gu only served as a tea server for the enemy military police and should not be included in the Regulations on Punishment of Traitors, requesting an acquittal. The court ordered him to be remanded in custody.

Lu Xiling: A native of Jiashan, 24 years old, served as a clerk in the puppet Jiashan County Government in 1939. Between December 1942 and May 1944, he served as an informant for the Jiashan enemy military police, looting food and endangering the people. The High Court had sent a letter to the Jiashan District Court for investigation. The reply presented more than a dozen pieces of evidence of the defendant's crimes. Presiding Judge Liu Yugui read them out to him one by one, and the defendant did not deny any of the facts. After a final defense by lawyer Wang Shanxiang, the court ordered him to be remanded in custody.

Su Dehuai: 31 years old, a native of Anhui, joined the puppet Peace Army's 36th Division, serving as a second lieutenant adjutant, and later as a lieutenant medical officer. After the victory, he was arrested by the Lianglu Police Team for riding the train without a ticket and handed over to the court. The defendant is currently seriously ill and on the verge of death. He also confessed to serving in a puppet position. Lawyer Wang Shanxiang, appointed by the court, argued that the defendant served as a lieutenant medical officer, which was an appointed position, not the head of an agency, and should not be included in the Regulations on Punishment of Traitors. The court ordered him to be remanded in custody pending judgment.

### Municipal Government News Release Group Renamed News Liaison Group

### Three Allies of Salley are Arrested in Shanghai One After Another, Orloffsky Under Surveillance Due to Illness

Four days ago, the General Headquarters of the Army secretly ordered the local military authorities to arrest three French and Russian police officers who had previously worked for the French Concession Police and had cooperated with the Japanese. All of them were allies of Salley and had spied on our intelligence during the war, providing it to the Japanese. One of them, Anmerinoff (Russian), had also worked for the Japanese Military Police on Rue Petain, which specialized in torturing and arresting our patriotic compatriots. One of them is former Deputy Chief Inspector Tong Bairu of the former French Concession Police, who was arrested on the 14th. It is said that Anmerinoff was captured by our authorities a month ago. Another person named Orloffsky, residing at 38 Lane 3, Rue Amiral Bayle, was found to be suffering from asthma and bedridden when the Garrison Headquarters went to arrest him the day before yesterday.

### Supply Continues, Speculation Decreases, Gold Prices Become More Stable, Hong Kong Telegraphs and Rupees Settle Accounts

Gold experienced a firm opening followed by a turn to weakness yesterday. The Bank of China continued its supply of 480 bars at a price of 1.6 million, and with this supply, the momentum was curbed. Credit was not as abundant as in previous days, and it became difficult to sustain in the afternoon. It opened at 1.64 million in the morning, struggling around 1.65 million for a while, but fell slightly due to selling pressure. At the time of the Bank of China's supply, it was around 1.62 million. After the supply of 1.6 million was secured, confidence was stabilized, and it retreated to the 1.6 million level, hovering around 1.59 million at noon. In the afternoon, there was continued selling pressure, and it stabilized slightly after reaching 1.57 million. As a result, it closed down 40,000 from the previous close. Jewelry gold was 172,000, silver ingots were 1,600, and silver dollars were being sold at 880 yuan. The implicit interest rate was initially loose and then tightened, with interest rates ranging from 0.18 to 0.22. The scope for speculation is narrowing daily, and it will be difficult for any disturbances to arise in the short term.

Foreign exchange US dollars were calm and narrow in range, with a sluggish process. It struggled around 2,050 yuan in the morning, but weakened slightly as the gold market became weak. However, the number was small, and it was still hovering around 2,020 yuan until noon. The situation dissipated in the afternoon, and there were even fewer transactions. As a result, it retreated 35 yuan. The Bank of China's US exchange rate was still listed at 2,020 yuan. Hong Kong tickets for old goods were boosted by 5 yuan due to the settlement of Hong Kong telegraphs by yarn merchants. New goods were stable after flatlining. Speculative funds continued to be collected. The 1936 issue rose to 125 yuan, and the 1937 issue rose to 123 yuan, and then became slightly erratic. As a result, it rose 10 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphs were 455 yuan, and rupees were 555 yuan, with both settling accounts.

### Foreign Exchange Opening Leads to Gradual Import and Export Activity

Since the Central Bank publicly opened applications for foreign exchange, import and export merchants in the city have been flocking to designated banks to apply for foreign exchange, causing extreme congestion. However, merchants are unfamiliar with the procedures, resulting in many having to make several trips. In reality, import merchants who import according to regulations face fewer restrictions. If the imports require permits, they must first apply to the "Imported Goods Management Office" for an import permit before applying for foreign exchange. For exports, exporters must first sell the foreign exchange earned from exports to designated banks before declaring the goods for export. Currently, imports ordered by merchants from Britain and the United States include automobiles, coal, cotton, cotton cloth, Western medicine, tobacco, white paper, and industrial raw materials. The cost of these goods, including shipping fees, is still lower than the market price, and they are expected to arrive in Shanghai successively starting next month.

The city's export trade has been stagnant since the outbreak of the Pacific War. Now, with the official opening of foreign exchange, it is reviving. It is reported that countries in Europe, America, and Southeast Asia are currently in strong demand for our country's native products and handicrafts. To date, merchants from Britain, the United States, Belgium, and Southeast Asian regions such as Singapore, the Philippines, and Manila have sent telegrams to the city's Chamber of Commerce requesting trade introductions. The required Chinese native products and industrial products include more than twenty types such as porcelain, pottery, stone ornaments, batteries, straw hats, leather goods, peppermint, camphor, knitwear, and pork.

### Bulls Profit and Take Gains; Chinese Stocks Gradually Decline; Speculative Funds Attack Foreign Stocks

Government bonds are stable with no special changes. Only popular Class C bonds rose and fell by one hundred yuan, ultimately closing with a slight increase of twenty yuan. Classes A and B fell by eighty yuan, Class D by fifty yuan, and Class E by thirty yuan. Chinese stocks were initially stable but then declined. After some fluctuation, all stocks weakened slightly. This was partly due to securities firms taking profits. Foreign stocks failed to compete with Chinese stocks in recent days, but yesterday speculative funds from securities firms suddenly entered the market, resulting in favorable gains for Ewo Cotton, Ewo Brewery, paper companies, and Asian stocks, which rose by about ten percent, favored by those taking profits in Chinese stocks. Other stocks did not perform as well, with limited gains. In the afternoon, due to it being Saturday, there were few transactions in Chinese stock futures, with only Yung Shing Cotton calling for 4,000 yuan, Meyer & Co. at 3,080 yuan, and King Fook at 238 yuan, with few transactions.

### Cashing Foreign Currency Bonds

New Regulations Established

The Shanghai office of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank received a notice from the headquarters that, in order to standardize the procedures for cashing foreign currency bonds, the following regulations have been established: For the payment of principal and interest on gold bonds, if the amount in US dollars is less than ten dollars, or in British pounds is less than two pounds, it should be paid in national currency. If the amount is ten US dollars or more, or two British pounds or more, if the holder wishes to receive the original currency, in addition to filling out the application form for redemption and interest payment of government bonds, they must also fill out a list of applications for drafts and submit them together for verification. The aforementioned procedures for cashing foreign currency bonds have now been announced and are being implemented.

### Malayan Exchange Rate Determined: 1.56 Malayan Dollars Equivalent to 1,000 Legal Tender Yuan

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 15th Dispatch] The joint meeting of the responsible person of the Bank of China, the Director of the British Exchange Control Bureau, and our Consul-General has determined the exchange rate: 1.56 Malayan dollars equivalent to 1,000 legal tender yuan. This official exchange rate will be effective from the 18th of this month after the resumption of remittances from overseas Chinese to their home country. Each overseas Chinese family may remit 45 Malayan dollars to their home country each month. According to the Director of the Exchange Control Bureau, "family" refers to a single unit, including the head of the family, their spouse, and their children. Other relatives or non-lineal relatives of each family constitute another unit and have the right to remit separately.

### Yarn and Cotton Market Flat; Sales Obstructed by Rain

Yesterday, the yarn market fluctuated slightly. In the morning, Shuang Ma (Double Horse brand) briefly rose to 1.08 million, but soon returned to 1.06 million. Weaving factories temporarily took a wait-and-see attitude and did not purchase due to inconvenience in sizing and dyeing caused by the rain. Customer sales were also hindered by the rain, resulting in a very flat market sentiment and little price change. The closing price was similar to the previous day's price. The Textile and Construction Company opened sales of serge, woolen fabric, thread, silk spinning, blankets, and other items totaling 26 types yesterday.

Yesterday, the New York cotton report showed a drop of 4 to 28 points. The near-term price was 26.67 US dollars, the forward price was 26.37 US dollars, and the spot price of Middling cotton was 27.19 US dollars. There were no telegrams from Bombay regarding Indian cotton. The local cotton trade saw a significant decrease in activity because there were no special developments in the yarn and cloth market. The Textile and Construction Company has made considerable purchases in recent days, leading to a slightly cautious outlook. Only private Su Lun Yarn Factory purchased 200 bales of Middling cotton, and the Shen Hsin First Factory purchased 200 bales of Nantong Taicang cotton. No other factories or cotton merchants were reported to have made purchases. There was little change in market prices.

### Remnant Enemy and Puppet Yarn and Cloth Case to be Submitted to the Political Council

(This Newspaper News) The case of the city's dyeing, weaving, yarn, and cloth industries requesting the return of remnant enemy and puppet yarn and cloth was rejected by the Enemy Property Review Committee multiple times. The approval for the return of property to Yung Hsin, Yung Chang, and other five companies, which had been submitted to and approved by the Handling Bureau, was also invalidated. All yarn and cloth factories in the city were dissatisfied and urged their respective trade associations to fight for their rights according to the law. It is reported that in addition to jointly telegraphing the Second Plenary Session of the National Political Council to appeal, the trade associations also jointly hosted a reception for the political councilors in Shanghai last night. More than a dozen people including Zhang Shizhao, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Tingrui, and Tao Baichuan attended. The councilors inquired in detail about the circumstances of the purchase at the time, the process of applying for the return, and the changes in the authorities' approval and rejection. It is heard that the proposal will be submitted to the Second Session of the Political Council, requesting the government to provide a reasonable solution. The three trade associations also plan to send representatives to Chongqing to present all the details to the relevant authorities.

### More American Cotton Arrives in Shanghai; Coal Briquettes Also Imported

The Ara Mazu, managed by the Hua Lun Foreign Firm, arrived yesterday morning from bays such as Mobile, Houston, and Galveston, carrying 14,000 bales of cotton, purchased by American Annin and American Fruit companies. There were also 7,200 cases of relief canned food. It berthed at floating dock numbers 23 and 34 for unloading. Additionally, the Apex Victory, also managed by the firm, arrived from Mobile Bay with 10,460 bales of cotton and is expected to arrive today, scheduled to berth at Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading.

Coal briquettes were imported again yesterday. The British ship Mary Lyon arrived from Qinhuangdao with over 9,000 tons of coal briquettes, arriving at Yangjiadu Zhongzhan Wharf at around 4 pm yesterday to unload.

### Lingering Spring Rain; Grain Prices Continue to Rise

The rice market was cloudy and rainy, and the owners were very firm. However, store sales were sluggish, and the market was tight in the morning and weak in the afternoon. Japonica and indica rice increased by 500 to nearly 1,000 yuan, with some rare varieties commanding high prices, as supply and inventory were both exhausted, leading to a rapid increase of another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The supply and demand for flour were both scarce, temporarily remaining stable. The oil market was still acceptable, with a continued increase of nearly 1,000 yuan. Soybeans from Fujian were selling very well, with another increase of 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts remained unchanged, wheat bran was stable, soybean cake sales were strong, with a price increase of over 200 yuan. Corn was stagnant and flat, and vegetable cake dropped by 300 to 500 yuan, with flat sales.

### Tea Market Remains Sluggish

The tea market, which has been weak for more than a week, has not yet shown any signs of recovery. This is mainly due to the lack of purchasing power from buyers. In terms of price, because most owners who profited are eager to sell and seek cash, the market sentiment for some varieties continues to decline.

### Coal Market Declines

The coal market declined because the supply was abundant and sales gradually slowed, leading to a soft market sentiment. Many parties were selling off, and there were few buyers, causing prices to decline. Coal dust and white coal dust experienced the biggest drops. White coal lumps are still in short supply, so the decline was slight. Due to the impact of rainy weather, there were not many shipments of firewood and charcoal, so the price remained stable at the original level.

### Goods from the Upper Yangtze River Flood into Hangzhou, Causing a Sharp Drop in Firewood Prices

Hangzhou News: With continuous rain, the water level of the Qiantang River has risen sharply. Native products from the Upper Yangtze River, such as timber, firewood, charcoal, and oil, have arrived in Hangzhou in large quantities.

Currently, miscellaneous firewood in Hangzhou is 2,300 yuan per load, pine firewood is 1,400 yuan per load, and green charcoal is 7,000 yuan per load, all of which are more than double the prices in Shanghai.

### Copper, Tin, and Hardware Soften; Only Refined Tin Remains Firm

The decline has been most pronounced in lead, with a drop of about 40%. Pure copper is currently selling for 3.2 million yuan per ton, a decrease of 20%. All other goods have declined, with only refined tin remaining firm.

### 30,000 Boxes of Soap Distributed to Small Retailers

The city's 3,000-plus small retailers of tobacco and foreign goods previously protested against the Enemy Property Handling Bureau's distribution of goods only to large retailers, demanding fair distribution to all retailers, large and small. The Bureau has responded by offering 30,000 boxes of assorted brand soaps for distribution to small retailers for sale.

### Zhejiang Education Department Organizes National Education Work Competition

Civil Education Class as the Center of the Competition

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou News] The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education believes that the National Education Work Competition held by various counties in previous years has not been widespread or seriously implemented, so the effect has been minimal. This year, it should continue to be held to achieve perfection. Therefore, it has issued the "Notes on Matters That Should Be Attended to in the National Education Work Competition Held by Various Counties This Year," and ordered the various commissioner's offices and county governments to earnestly comply with them. The notes are outlined below: (1) This year, each county should focus on strengthening the civil education class in national schools at all levels as the center of the competition. (2) National schools at all levels, the chiefs of various townships and villages, and personnel involved in promoting adult education should all participate in the competition. (3) The competition standards for national schools at all levels are whether the civil education class is effectively implemented in accordance with regulations, and whether the number of students in adult classes or women's classes is sufficient. The competition standards for township and village chiefs are to assist national schools at all levels in recruiting students for adult classes and women's classes. The competition standards for other personnel are the results of assisting schools in various counties in handling civil education. (4) The competition period is from March 15th to December 15th. (5) Before the end of December, each county should select the three best schools and the three most effective township and village chiefs and other personnel, fill out three report forms in detail, and submit them to the commissioner's office for verification and reward. The next best will be verified and rewarded by the county government, and the worst will be punished as appropriate, and the names of the rewarded and punished schools and individuals will be publicly announced. (6) Before the end of January of the 26th year, each commissioner's office should select the three best counties, together with two copies of each county's report form, filling in the number of schools, the number of classes held in the upper and lower halves of the year for adult classes and women's classes, the number of students, and the percentage of the total number of out-of-school people in each county, and forward them to the Education Department for verification and reward. (7) The commissioner's offices and county governments may, in accordance with these notes, formulate additional competition measures to supervise and implement them.

The matter of accommodating returning students from the rear was also discussed. Currently, there are more than 6,000 middle school students from the rear studying in the province. In addition to the collective relocation of the 12th Middle School to the east, there are more than 4,000 students who need to be accommodated. However, some school buildings are occupied by military units and agencies, and appeals should be made by the Provincial Council and the Provincial Education Association to the relevant competent authorities to have the troops withdraw. A committee should be established to conduct a thorough and thorough investigation in order to restore the school buildings and accommodate the students from the rear.

### City Elementary Schools Request Improved Treatment; Petitioned the City Government Yesterday

Deputy Mayor He Received Them, But No Results Were Obtained

[Our City News] The Municipal Elementary School Teachers and Staff Association, requesting the city government to improve treatment and increase education funding, hosted a press conference the day before yesterday to report on the progress and issued an open letter to citizens from all walks of life, appealing for assistance. At ten o'clock yesterday morning, they sent representatives Chen Yuxian, Wang Liben, Fan Xixuan, Yu Zhengchao, and Cao Junshi to the city government to petition. Deputy Mayor He Dekui received them.

Proposed Three Demands. First, the representatives put forward the following three demands: (1) Issue subsidies based on the basic salary, according to the cost of living index; (2) Education funding should account for 20% of municipal expenditures; (3) Currently, each person is borrowing 150,000 yuan. Deputy Mayor He replied that, constrained by central government orders, the improvement of the treatment of teachers and staff cannot be implemented alone, and the other two items cannot be achieved with the current municipal financial situation, and so on. Finally, he earnestly instructed the representatives to convey to the teachers and staff that education is the most important thing, to be mindful of the difficult times, and to endure the temporary pain, and if the government has the strength, it will certainly try its best to find a way, and so on. The conversation continued until 12:30 PM, but no concrete results were obtained. The representatives then withdrew.

Another Meeting Convened. It is heard that the association is now scheduled to convene a joint meeting of directors and representatives again next Tuesday at 4:30 PM at Bide Elementary School to report on the progress and discuss future actions.

[Further News] The delegation of teachers and staff of municipal secondary schools in this city did not petition the city government yesterday. It is because the delegation had previously sent members to petition, but no results were obtained. How to proceed in the future will still be jointly and consistently determined with the Municipal Elementary School Teachers and Staff Association.

### National Education Classes

The City Will First Open 400 Classes

[Our City News] In this city, there are many children who are out of school, and only half of the school-age children are enrolled. There are an estimated two million illiterate adults. In order to alleviate the lack of education and eliminate illiteracy, the City Education Bureau plans to use the school buildings of public and private primary and secondary schools to open national education classes. In the near future, 400 national education classes will be opened, which will increase the number of enrolled children by 20,000 and the number of enrolled adults by 40,000. Public and private school buildings and school equipment will be used as much as possible, and the original school teachers and staff can also serve concurrently.

Children's Classes in the Afternoon, Adult Education Classes in the Evening. Appropriate public and private primary and secondary schools will be designated to start classes earlier and open national education classes. Tentatively, children's classes will be held in the afternoon and adult education classes in the evening. The number of classes will be determined by the Education Bureau. The curriculum and teaching hours of children's classes are the same as those of ordinary primary schools. All public and private primary and secondary schools may be designated by the Education Bureau to establish half-day primary schools and mass education classes, collectively referred to as national education classes. Half-day primary school classes should give priority to accepting newly enrolled children.

Curriculum and Teaching Hours for Mass Education Classes. Mass education classes should try to enroll out-of-school adults. Each class will have a standard of 50 people, and the number of classes will be determined by the Education Bureau. The curriculum and teaching hours of half-day primary school classes are the same as those of full-day schools. The curriculum and teaching hours for mass education classes are planned to be 50% for national language, 25% for general knowledge, 20% for arithmetic, and 5% for music. The total number of hours for the entire period should not be less than 200 hours. It is heard that the measures for promoting national education to alleviate the lack of education and eliminate illiteracy have been approved by the 24th Municipal Affairs Conference.

### Basketball League Finals; Gymnasium Packed; Hualian Team Defeats Sakor; Leading All the Way with a Score of 65 to 49; Championship Within Reach; Performance Exquisite

Last night, the Hualian basketball team defeated the Sakor team, organized by personnel from the U.S. Naval Headquarters, with an exquisite performance. The result was 65 to 49, with Hualian leading 37 to 25 in the first half. Afterwards, Hualian will face the Enkas汕 team twice. Barring any accidents, the championship of the Shanghai Basketball League Group A is firmly in the hands of Hualian.

Unprecedented Grandeur. From 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon, fans flocked to the city gymnasium. By 7:00 PM, it was so crowded that there was no room to stand. It is estimated that there were about 4,000 fans, with the second and third floors completely full. It was truly an unprecedented grand occasion for basketball games in recent years. Mayor Qian and City Government Secretary-General Shen attended the game with their wives. The Garrison Headquarters also sent guards to maintain order. Every time Hualian scored a basket, cheers thundered.

Zhenzhong is the Main Player. All six players of Hualian took to the court. Li Zhenzhong was still the main player. He was brought back in the second half, and the situation was stabilized. Bao Songyuan was also particularly outstanding. The whole team can be said to have performed at its best. Sakor still had some fight in the first half, but was in a state of confusion in the second half. After the game, the person in charge seemed to admire Hualian's performance, but blamed the slippery water-cement floor, saying that they would not play here again next time. Smooth Progress. Referees Qu Honglu and Liu Hesheng. Hualian first used the five tigers of Zhenzhong, Guangyi, Xuechong, Chengzhang, and Liangxiong. Sakor's He Tuolais first scored, and Chen Xuechong immediately returned a goal. Anderson scored two. Six to two was the only lead Sakor had in yesterday's battle. Afterwards, the wonderful shots of Hualian's Chen Xuechong and Wu Chengzhang were seen. Six to six, until each had twelve, Hualian suddenly gained momentum. Li Zhen commanded calmly, and the whole army progressed smoothly. At the end of the first half, they led with a score of 37 to 25.

An Irresistible Force. In the second half, Zhenzhong rested and Bao Songyuan was brought on. Sakor took advantage of the situation and the score gradually approached, from 39 to 32 to 41 to 35, with a difference of only three goals. Zhenzhong re-entered the field and Zhang Liangxiong retired. The momentum was indeed stronger, and Hualian became an irresistible force, defeating Sakor with a score of 65 to 49.

Although yesterday's game was said to be extremely exciting, the slippery court was indeed a reality. Chairman Chang of the Basketball Committee spoke to Mayor Qian about this point. Mayor Qian is the chairman of the Sports Association, so he has agreed to find a way to lay the floor in a short period of time.

### Today's Soccer Postponed

All the schedules for today's soccer league have been postponed due to the wet and unusable field. The date of the Group A East China Qingbai match has not been determined. Next week will be the Mayor's Cup.

### Special Education News; New Initiatives in International Cultural Cooperation (Part 1)

National Normal College Establishes Educational Materials Room

In order to study education, cultivate excellent teachers, the Ministry of Education resolved in 1938 per the decision of the Supreme National Defense Council to restore higher teacher education. Aside from reorganizing the departments of education at the National Central University, Zhejiang University, Southwest Associated University, Northwest Associated University and Zhongshan University into Normal Colleges, they tentatively created an independent, national teacher training institution in Lantian, Hunan, called the National Normal College, to serve as a model for the nation. The college was established seven years ago. Under the leadership of President Liao Shicheng, who took over the leadership, the college has been painstakingly managed and has achieved remarkable results. Recently, the college agreed with Columbia University in the United States to exchange research data, which is a rare new initiative in international cultural cooperation during the war. The college has specially set up an Educational Materials Room to handle this matter. Although the Educational Materials Room has not been established for long, its work has been effective. The current situation of the room will be explored and recorded below, to inform readers.

Reasons for Establishment

In the spring of 1944, Columbia University in the United States, in order to promote international cultural exchange, entrusted Dr. Wu Yifang, the president of Ginling Women's College, to introduce the matter to Dr. Liao Shicheng, the president of the National Normal College. They agreed on several methods for exchanging research data, the main points of which are: (1) To exchange subscriptions to educational periodicals published in China and the United States since the outbreak of the war; (2) To exchange purchases of new educational works published in China and the United States in recent years; (3) To compile and exchange catalogs of educational publications published in China and the United States since the outbreak of the war; (4) Columbia University's Teachers College Library will donate one copy of each of the important educational books in its collection that have duplicates to the National Normal College. In order to carry out this exchange work, to promote international cultural cooperation, and to collect domestic and foreign educational materials to facilitate educational research, the college specially established the Educational Materials Room in the spring of 1945 to handle this matter.

Current Staff. After the establishment of the Educational Materials Room, President Liao hired Dr. Zhu Youguang, a professor at the college who graduated from Columbia University, as the director. Mr. Feng Zengzhu is the clerk.

The internal advisors of the room have also been appointed by the president (in order of stroke count of surnames): Wang Shilu, Zhu You, Ruan Yanming, Meng Xiancheng, Guo Yicen, Cheng Zongchao, Zhang Wenchang, and Qian Yaxin. As for the external advisors and correspondents, they are still being selected and hired. In addition, in order to handle various affairs, Qiu Weicheng, Liu E'ye, Lu Jingxiu, Chen Renyu, and He Chang, five students from the Xupu and Lantian Student Relief Committees, were successively requested to come to the college to take charge of drawing, clipping, document writing, and managing books and newspapers, respectively.

### Random Notes on Following Marshal Ma's Inspection Tour (4): Influential Figures of the Past Will Become Pillars of the Peace Era

— Sent by Zhang Jianmei

Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Beiping

The Xuzhou meeting on the evening of the 2nd lasted from 8:00 PM after dinner until 12:00 AM. During the meeting, everyone argued until their faces were flushed, and even Marshal Ma couldn't help but lose his temper. The New Fourth Army in this area hoped for the following: (1) The Communist army would withdraw from the eastern section of the Longhai Railway in exchange for the Guomindang army's garrison north of the Grand Canal. (2) The Communist army would garrison the cities they had surrounded. (3) Obstacles on the transportation lines would be removed. (4) The government army would withdraw from the Zhongxing Coal Mine, and the coal mine would be managed by merchants. The final result of the three-party negotiations was: (1) All obstacles hindering traffic on the transportation lines would be removed, but the fortifications that did not hinder traffic would be preserved. (2) Both the Communist and Guomindang armies would withdraw from the Zhongxing Coal Mine, which would be jointly managed by the government, the Communist Party, and merchants, with the assistance of American engineers. According to Director Gu Zhutong, three thousand government troops were surrounded in this mine, and the Communist army had already seized two of the three mine shafts. The remaining mine shaft could not be used because the drainage equipment was isolated, and water was accumulating in the mine daily. If it was not resolved quickly, the mine shafts would be flooded.

Zhou Enlai's Speech: Clearly a Match

At the Xinxiang meeting on the afternoon of the 3rd, the Communist representative of the initial executive group initially used the Guomindang army's withdrawal from Meng County to relieve the siege of Yongnian and Dongming in southern Hebei as an exchange condition. Marshal Ma instructed that each issue should be resolved rationally and individually, and should not be entangled with each other, which would only increase disputes. The intelligent Mr. Zhou Enlai then stood up to speak, explaining that according to the ceasefire agreement and the order of the executive headquarters, the military and civilians in all besieged cities should be able to receive food supplies, and transportation should be restored as soon as possible. As a result, a problem that had been entangled for many days was largely resolved. The reporter should also report that Yongnian had been besieged for several months, and it is said that the bark of the trees in the city had been eaten clean. Recently, there have been reports of cannibalism, and it was truly a situation that had to be resolved.

The Taiyuan meeting that evening was the second most intense debate since Xuzhou. However, the principles of supplying food to the besieged military and civilians and rapidly restoring transportation were established.

The trip to Guihua on the afternoon of the 4th was more of a visit. The Sui-Bao area was generally peaceful. The recent Guihua team had also returned to Beiping and had not returned. It is said that the commander gave a speech at the welcome banquet, stating that under the premise of peace, he did not want to mention some minor conflicts. His only hope at present was to restore transportation as soon as possible. Zhou Enlai's speech was also well-matched. He said that he had ordered the Communist troops not to mention any more minor incidents.

Review of Peace: Approaching the Last Day

That evening, during a visit to Yan'an, Ma, Zhang, Zhou, Mao Zedong, and Zhu De exchanged opinions extensively on domestic and foreign issues, without discussing any specific problems.

The 5th was the last day of the peace review. Ma, Zhang, and Zhou met with the Hankou team and the government and Communist military officers in the secluded and beautiful Yang Sen Garden in the suburbs. Although conflicts in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui had ceased and things were peaceful, the Communist army led by Li Xiannian, due to a lack of food, requested to move to Wuhe in northern Anhui to find food, which caused the military three-person group a great headache. The government side was deeply afraid that the transfer of tens of thousands of troops over a thousand miles would affect public morale and local order. Minister Zhang Zhizhong immediately asked Commander-in-Chief Guo Chan to assist Commander Li Xiannian in solving the food problem. If necessary, the government could also provide them with loans to purchase food. As for the future, whether Li's troops would move to Wuhe County in northern Anhui would be decided after returning to Chongqing. This issue was not a new one. Large armies were gathered in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and the food of the people was completely exhausted. As early as then, Li Xiannian's troops requested to move to Wuhe to find food. The Hankou executive team sent an English telegram to the Beiping executive headquarters, and the translator translated "Wuhe" as "Wuhu." Government Commissioner Zheng Jiemin was very angry when he saw it. "What? You want to send 40,000 troops to Wuhu? Do you want to seize Nanjing?" As a result, the issue was put aside.

"The most amazing thing is that a ceasefire situation was created in the shortest possible time. This miracle signifies understanding and goodwill, which is a most important factor." (Marshall)

The past eighteen years of Chinese history are like a large circle formed by two lines merging together. Initially, one line went east and one line went west. They once became completely different north and south poles, but finally they met and merged at one point.

"Personal feelings are partial and unimportant." "In this stage, perhaps some people will have to be sacrificed, but this sacrifice is beneficial to the majority." (Marshall)

Here, let us review the figures who once dominated the scene and who should become pillars of peace in the future!

Going to Zhangjiakou: First Meeting with General He Long

On the first day in Zhangjiakou, I saw He Long for the first time. In the fierce Sui-Bao battle, he had not died in battle as rumored. Of medium height, he looked neither fat nor thin, a rather sturdy middle-aged man. He always had an unpretentious, rough pipe in his mouth. When he spoke, the short mustache on his lips moved slightly, and his Hunan accent, which was similar to Sichuan dialect, expressed his strong will, boldness, and mischievousness. His signature was also flamboyant, full of heroic spirit. His criticism of the ceasefire order was: "Very good." And like most Sichuan people, he especially prolonged and emphasized the word "very." He did not feel any difficulty in implementing the troop reduction plan, saying that the surplus officers and soldiers could go home to farm, and those who did not have land would be given money. He fiercely criticized Li Shouxin's troops in a sarcastic tone. This conversation with him did not take place in Zhangjiakou, but at the Jining airfield. "We don't even have a house at this airfield," General He Long said with a sigh and full of hope, "In the spring, we plan to build a few houses." The desire for peace and construction had clearly risen in the heart of a general who wanted to crush the existing society. In Zhangjiakou, at the same time as seeing He Long for the first time, I saw Xiao Ke, commander of the Communist Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Military Region, and Nie Rongzhen, commander of the Hebei-Shanxi-Chahar Military Region. Xiao Ke had a long, thin face and was gaunt, like a slightly older high school graduate from a small county town, with a bit of a rural air. Nie Rongzhen was a fair-skinned scholar, gentle and refined, wearing an expensive fine woolen military uniform. It is said that he had studied in France and was also a handsome figure in the Communist army.

Chen Yi of the New Fourth Army: Saying that from now on, they will only argue

General Wang Yaowu, who became famous in the Battle of Xuefeng Mountain in western Hunan, is now in the besieged city of Jinan, which has a diameter of thirty or forty miles, shouldering a very arduous task. Unfortunately, due to the short time in Jinan, I was unable to hear his conversation. I only asked him to sign his name at the airfield. The characters were written in a very generous manner, and the character "Wu" was almost written as the character "Sheng," with an extra dot. Chen Yi, the commander of the Communist New Fourth Army, was tall and burly, with a round face and glowing red complexion, wearing a grassy green coarse cloth military uniform. This general, who boasted of "leading 300,000 troops," is said to have studied electrical engineering in France. The day before Ma, Zhang, and Zhou arrived in Jinan, he and Li Yu, chairman of the Communist Party of Shandong, flew from Linyi to Jinan together. Wang Yaowu and He Siyuan personally greeted them at the airport. That night, Wang and He held a grand banquet. After drinking and eating heartily, "Zuo Min!" (Wang Yaowu's courtesy name) Chen Yi, with a flushed face from drinking, said, "From now on, we are only allowed to argue, not to fight." He Siyuan added, "We only argue indoors and don't make noise outside." In his conversation with reporters, Chen Yi did not admit that the Communist army of Shandong was surrounding the Guomindang army. "If you say it is a encirclement, isn't there a larger Guomindang encirclement outside the Communist army's encirclement?" He also refused to express his opinion on the troop reduction, believing that it was still too early.

Director Gu Zhutong: Arousing Infinite Memories

In Xuzhou, we saw Director Gu Zhutong. He is probably the pacification director with the greatest power. The jurisdiction of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters not only includes the complete provinces of Shandong and Jiangsu from the Yellow River to the Yangtze River, but also extends to northern Anhui and eastern Zhejiang, with twenty armies, which will be reorganized into twenty divisions. However, he does not feel any difficulty, saying that the reorganization will begin on the 16th. Not long ago, he suffered from typhoid fever, and his complexion is still a bit sallow. On the morning we left Xuzhou, we were received by Director Gu. The current surging tide of peace has rekindled many of his memories. He said that he had been old friends with Zhou Enlai and Ye Jianying for more than twenty years. After the Xi'an Incident, he presided over the Xi'an Executive Headquarters. At that time, he had two tasks: one was to be responsible for reorganizing Zhang and Yang's troops, and the other was to negotiate military and political issues with the Communist Party. At that time, he had a week of negotiations with Zhou Enlai. The theme of the negotiations was also the nationalization of the army and the democratization of politics. Unfortunately, no results were achieved. All the negotiation processes were recorded in his wife's own handwriting, secretly treasured, and never made public. After ten years, now witnessing the success of the ceasefire and the political consultative conference agreement, he sincerely feels happy. He judges that the Communist Party will implement the agreements of the political consultative conference on ceasefire and troop reduction, because every far-sighted Communist will realize that without doing so, the Communist Party has no future.

Liu Zhi Welcomes Marshal Ma: Enthusiastically Arriving in Xinxiang

Director Liu Zhi rushed from Zhengzhou to Xinxiang to welcome Marshal Marshall. He still had a round face, a radiant complexion, and retained the aura of a "lucky general." At the Xinxiang meeting, he said, "I am a soldier, and obedience is my bounden duty. I obey all the orders of the Executive Headquarters," which left a deep impression on people. Although Liu Bocheng, commander of the Communist 129th Division and commander of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, was most easily recognized by one eye, several of our colleagues did not find him. It is said that someone asked him if he had the sincerity to implement the ceasefire order, and his answer was, "If I had no sincerity, I would not have come at all." While Ma, Zhang, and Zhou were holding a meeting in Xinxiang, we took a break to visit General Ma Fawu, who had just been released by the Communists. He had been a student of the Peking Union Medical College, gentle and refined, almost like a pastor. He refused to say anything about the circumstances of his capture and the situation in the Communist area, saying that he had been sick there all the time and was still not well. Finally, he told a long story about his military service and the history of the War of Resistance.

On the night of arrival in Taiyuan, we were very tired and went to bed early. After midnight, someone from the Chief Executive's Office of Foreign Affairs knocked on the door, saying that Governor Yan wanted to see us. Everyone hurriedly rubbed their sleepy eyes, dressed, and got into the car to enter the city. That night, Governor Yan was wearing a brand-new yellow woolen military uniform specially made to welcome Marshal Marshall, with shining spiked riding boots, and the three-star general's collar badges were also glittering. However, the general, who had been the master of Shanxi for thirty-five years, was indeed old. He walked with a trembling gait, and looked at us young people with an expectant but lonely gaze from under his large glasses. The next morning, before Marshal Marshall was about to board the car to go to the airport, Governor Yan, as if he had suddenly remembered something he had forgotten, found our four reporters again in the reception room and told us his newly discovered political philosophy: "To eliminate the threat of war, we must first have a correct understanding, that is, under different standpoints, there are absolutely no common interests, personalities, and right and wrong. It is wishful thinking to ask the other party with a different standpoint to keep their promises. Not keeping their promises is precisely their personality, precisely their revolutionary means. We should forgive them." In a hurry, none of us were able to understand this heartfelt conversation clearly. Was he trying to raise everyone's awareness? Or was he teaching Jesus's doctrine: "Love your enemies"? In the conversation the night before, a reporter asked Governor Yan if he had spoken with Liu Bocheng. "Not yet!" he said. "He was my old subordinate. I commanded him in the early days of the War of Resistance. We are very familiar."

Communist Officer Chen Geng: Reuniting with Zhang Zhizhong

On the evening of the 3rd, on the stairs of the Fuxing Hotel, I also saw Chen Geng [chief of the Communist army in southern Shanxi], short and wiry, wearing a gray military uniform, greeting warmly. Later, Minister Zhang told reporters that Chen Geng was from the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy. They had not seen each other for more than ten years. That night, Chen Geng specially went to his room to talk for a long time, very affectionately. Over the years, how many superiors and subordinates, teachers and students, who had parted ways, shook hands again in the torrent of peace!

General Zhou Enlai: Received in Guihua

Arriving in Suiyuan, I saw General Fu Zuoyi. He was still as energetic as the reporter had seen him in Shabam during the War of Resistance, wearing a soldier's uniform. At the tea party welcoming the three guests, many people were looking for General Zhou Enlai. Fu introduced at this time, "This is General Zhou Enlai." Everyone laughed. Zhou Enlai's speech was always beautiful. He said, "We have always admired Commander Fu's achievements in the War of Resistance. The misfortune of history has made us stand against each other, causing the people of Suiyuan to suffer. I would like to extend my condolences to the people of Suiyuan. Now we are at peace, and we will always be at peace. Let the past be the past!" In this moving scene of peace, two months ago, when Suiyuan and Baotou were stained with blood, how could the parties involved have imagined it?

In Yan'an, I saw General Zhu De for the first time. Although he was over sixty years old, he was still as strong as a bear. Wearing a gray cotton military uniform covered with dust and oil stains, he was no different from a soldier, and even no different from a cook. At the evening party in Yan'an, he represented the Communist Party and said, "We, the Chinese Communist Party, with all our enthusiasm, are willing to realize China's peace, democracy, unity, and construction under the leadership of Chairman Chiang." Looking back, last year, just after Japan surrendered, Zhu De sent Chairman Chiang a telegram full of sparks, referring to "your government" and "your army." We can easily realize how much progress Chinese history has made in the past six months of unreasonable warfare!

Hankou Welcome Party: Marshal Ma Praises Guo and Li

At the welcome dinner in Hankou, Commander-in-Chief Guo Chan and Communist Commander Li Xiannian's faithful implementation of the ceasefire order and sincere cooperation won Marshal Ma's praise. General Guo Chan was the old garrison commander of Hankou. He was not tall, had a fair complexion, and was very sturdy. This time, Director Cheng Qian of the Wuhan Executive Headquarters went to Chongqing for a meeting, and he temporarily took the place of the host. Commander Li Xiannian said that he had been to Hankou twice. After the ceasefire, he had become very familiar with Hankou. He was from Huangpi, had a thin face, and looked like he was malnourished. The situation of his troops was in contrast to Chen Yi's situation in Shandong. He got along very well with the executive team. Marshall reported at the banquet, "I received a letter from General Li, expressing his regret for Colonel Ford's departure from the Guangshan team, and promising that he would continue to cooperate closely with his successor, Colonel Colebrook. I believe that this is a ray of light in a pessimistic atmosphere. I express my thanks for that special sincerity." (February 13)

### US Air Force Personnel Awarded Chinese Medals

Our people should recall that in July 1943, Madame Chiang had a trip to the United States. The crew of the plane she took back to Chongqing after her visit to the United States were awarded the "Order of the Cloud and Banner" by our government for their meritorious service to China. The picture shows the scene of the award ceremony held at the Chinese Embassy in Washington. (At the far left) is Major General Mao Bangchu of the Chinese Air Force, who is shaking hands with and congratulating flight engineer Blossom. The crew of Madame Chiang's plane were all aviation officers of the Western Airlines, under the jurisdiction of the US Army Air Transport Command. Standing in the back row in the picture, waiting to be awarded medals, are this group of them.

### Gold and White Rice in Guangzhou

— Special Correspondent Liang Feng

Report by Air from Our Guangzhou Correspondent

Victory has left people with beautiful dreams and endless hope. It seems that with the arrival of victory, the burdens of life can be put down, and even the old dreams of past peace and happiness can be relived. But half a year after victory, not only has this burden not been lifted, but it is generally going uphill.

Indeed, since Guangzhou's liberation, the prices of goods have risen day by day, especially in the last ten days, the fluctuations in gold and rice have been the highest in the country. According to the reporter's investigation, in mid-February, the price of gold per tael hovered between 130,000 and 140,000 yuan, and the price of white rice (medium grade) per dan only increased from 18,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan. However, in these ten days, the degree of its surge is truly alarming. The highest price of gold per tael has broken through the 190,000 mark and risen to 200,000 yuan, an increase of 60%. What about white rice? The highest price has risen by 100% compared to mid-February, with only four taels available for every hundred yuan. The price of gold and white rice in late February is listed below:

From this, we can see the current standard of living in Guangzhou. But what is the reason for its soaring prices? Is it a food shortage panic? Or is it that unscrupulous merchants, seeing that a large amount of rice for Guangzhou will soon arrive, are trying to make a profit before it arrives? Yes; the former only accounts for a very small part, because the city's grain reserves are still enough for two months. However, the manipulation by the latter is the key to the problem.

Speculators, citing the tense situation in the Northeast, spread all kinds of news that would drive up the price of gold, and bought large quantities of gold, causing the price of gold to soar. Because the price of gold soared, it stimulated the prices of goods, and rice also skyrocketed, rising step by step, with each market higher than the last. When citizens saw the price of rice rising rapidly, they all panicked and bought it, so that the price of rice per dan rose by several thousand yuan in one day. A fearful mood filled the entire city of Guangzhou. The soaring price of gold stimulated food prices, and food affected people's livelihoods, resulting in starving people lying dead in the streets, reaching more than thirty a day, and phenomena such as workers going on strike. This phenomenon hides a social crisis. Although the authorities have discussed countermeasures to stabilize grain prices, investigate and deal with hoarders, and strictly manage grain merchants; and although there are tens of millions of dan of rice and flour for Guangzhou, people feel that distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. Moreover, solving the people's livelihood is the key to social order and stability. If the people's livelihood cannot be solved, society will not be peaceful. Therefore, how to actively stabilize prices? How to effectively relieve the unemployed? These are the current important issues in Guangdong.

### Hengyang and Lingling Disaster Areas: Existing on the Brink of Starvation

— A Report from Bingfan

Our Newspaper's Changsha Dispatch, Second Day

"Please kill me, cut open my stomach and see what's inside!" - a robber pleaded to County Magistrate Wang -

On February 24th, this reporter joined Director Yu of the Hunan Provincial Relief Branch on a trip to Hengyang and Yongzhou to survey the disaster. Three jeeps traveled through the northern countryside of Hengyang via the Yunheng Road, arriving in Hengyang that day. The next day, they passed through Qiyang, spending over three hours visiting before arriving in Lingling that evening.

Not a Soul in Sight, Encountering Only Three Cows

Along this hundreds-of-li stretch, the entire area was a disaster zone. There were few people to be seen in the villages. The suffering farmers had torn off the roofs of their houses, leaving only sections of broken walls. Farming tools were nowhere to be found. It was said that the fields hadn't been harvested in years. From a distance, there were only endless grassy slopes and desolation. Along this long stretch, we only encountered three cows. Old and young people, shivering and trembling, walked along the distant paths. They clasped their hands, held out their bowls, and headed towards the porridge kitchens. This reporter asked a child at the Third Porridge Kitchen in Hengyang:

"What does your family do?"

"Farm, alas!"

"And your father?"

"Resting at home."

"Do you have food to eat?"

The child shook his head, indicating that they hadn't had food in recent times.

Passive relief is not the solution. Director Yu did not strongly advocate "eating porridge." The focus should be on addressing the root causes: those who can work should work, and those who cannot should be sent home and helped to get there. The disaster victims did not want money; they wanted work. This reporter met a refugee from Hubei heading to the porridge kitchen. He was asked, "Why don't you go home?"

"What is there to eat at home? What is there to wear?" Indeed, this reporter had no answer. Going home would also mean waiting for relief. The important thing is to find work.

A Set of Clothing Lost Two Lives

The bandit scourge has passed, but the suffering remains with the people, and epidemics are about to break out. Now it is a drought, and the fields are cracked open. Since Hengyang's recapture, there have only been two rainfalls: one in the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, and another the night before this reporter arrived in Hengyang, when there was a downpour. The common people in the streets and villages knelt on the ground, thanking Heaven that day. They banged on iron pots and other instruments to thank the Heavens for giving them food to eat.

Zhang Daxiang was a noted writer in western Hengyang several years ago. Now, even small writings are impossible. A family of a dozen had scattered to various places in search of food. The young children were left at home crying, collapsing into their grandmother's arms. Zhang Daxiang secretly sold his wife's pants and upper garment on the street to buy two measures of rice to comfort the children: "Don't cry, we'll have food to eat tonight." When his wife returned and learned of this, she argued with her husband. The children hugged their mother's legs, crying themselves hoarse. Afterwards, Zhang Daxiang returned to the room to find his mother hanging. He did not cry but stared blankly as he rushed out and jumped into a pond to his death.

Even Carrying a Bushel of Rice Means Being a Target for Robbery

Robberies and killings are common in the countryside of Hengyang. Someone who has gone to great lengths to carry a bushel or two of rice from afar is constantly at risk of being robbed in secluded areas. The county government has captured dozens of these rice robbers. One robber told County Magistrate Wang: "Please kill me, cut open my stomach and see what's inside!" We passed through Qiyang, originally not intending to stop but to go straight to Lingling. The people gathered at the station, a sea of humanity, tens of thousands of heads. They wanted relief. Director Yu got out of the car and distributed six tons of wheat flour, then visited the porridge kitchen. From the Dongjiang Bridge to the porridge kitchen, for more than a li, the refugees surged like a collapsing mountain, supporting the old and carrying the young, walking with bent backs. It was said that on the opening day of the porridge kitchen, there were only a few hundred people. The next day there were several thousand, and the third day more than ten thousand. Now there are over thirty thousand. Some looked like skeletons, others had scabies festering like bitter gourds, with a foul odor. Miss Conliff from America touched the upper garment of a refugee child and shook her head at Director Yu.

The villagers of Huangyun Township in Youyang sent a petition to the county government requesting "famine relief certificates" or "coffins." They could only seek survival or seek death.

In the newspaper, we found an announcement that read as follows:

Li Ermei's Announcement: The undersigned's original husband, Rong Ying, unfortunately died by gunfire after being seized as a forced laborer by the Japanese invaders last year. Their two sons are still young, and the grandmother is old and without food. The paternal grandfather, Tan Bole, hired her youngest son to continue the family line, but he provided no support to the children. Amidst this great drought, the undersigned, a woman, can hardly support the household. Driven by hunger, she has no choice but to sever ties with Tan Miao and marry Chen Quanzhi from this village as a concubine in order to support her children and provide her grandmother with 15,000 yuan, which is now urgently needed for sustenance. Besides asking relatives to make a statement, this announcement is hereby made.

Filling the Stomach with Fern Roots: No Bark or Roots Left

Upon arriving in Lingling, we went to Gongxin Township to assess the disaster. Gongxin Township has 24,000 people, of whom it is said that 20,000 have no food to eat. Villagers ran over from the rubble and knelt on the roadside begging us: "Heavenly Lord! Please save us!" Tears rolled down their cheeks. Director Yu, unable to hold back his own tears, offered sympathy and comfort. Miss Zhai Qiwen seemed deeply distressed. She reached out to help them up. They lived in thatched huts built on the burned-out fields, eating tree bark and grass roots: ground orchids, kudzu roots, olive bark, rush, goose buds, fern roots, as well as chaff and bran. The fern roots are one or two feet long, three or four fen in diameter, black, and dug from the mountains. Director Yu asked them what they were eating. An old woman pointed to a basket of fern roots in her hand and said, "We eat this!"

A Three-Year-Old Child is Worth Only 10,000 Yuan

In the streets of Lingling, early in the morning, there was a strange trade. Bamboo baskets were placed on both sides of the street. Sitting in the baskets were children, some two years old, others three, four, or five years old. A bamboo ring was stuck on their bodies. The children were half aware and half unaware, playing with the bamboo rings. The adults stood by, looking at the passers-by with mournful faces. The buyers were all from out of town (such as guests from Guilin). If they saw a child who looked pretty, they might take one back with them. Some sold children after a few days, while others gave them away for free.

A local named Zhang Xinshan secretly sold one of his three-year-old children for 10,000 yuan, which he regarded as a good deal. After returning home, his wife drowned herself. The two children asked for their mother, and after that, nothing more was heard.

Remaining in Her Chamber, an Eighteen-Year-Old Became a Prostitute

There was also a tragic news item: Li Ermei, an eighteen-year-old girl, was waiting to be married and was living with her aunt. Her aunt's family was eating grass roots, so they sold her to become a prostitute. She had been sold for just three days when this reporter met her once and spoke with her. She always kept her head down. In the dim light, her hair hung in front of Li Ermei's chest.

This is not the end. The people on the Hengling Road continue to suffer and die like this. This reporter can only write this report with a sympathetic heart, hoping that all sectors will extend a helping hand and give this dispatch a practical conclusion. U.S. Army Medical Corps Lieutenant Colonel Luo Limou helped complete a new type of X-ray

### New Type of Battlefield X-ray Equipment

U.S. Army Medical Corps Lieutenant Colonel Luo Limou helped complete a new type of X-ray machine. The machine is extremely lightweight and can be transported to the front lines by air. It can detect the location of bullets or shrapnel within the human body within forty seconds and record their depth, allowing surgeons to know where to begin. The total weight is 399 pounds, and it has its own generator. This machine has been used in many United Nations war zones.

### Local Dispatches

Songjiang: Preventing Criminals from Disrupting the County. The County Government has received confidential reports that a few criminals are disguising themselves as vendors and engaging in sabotage in the urban area. To prevent this, the authorities ordered the relevant departments yesterday (the 14th) to pay close attention. Before the national identity cards are issued, all vendors in the urban area must register with the relevant township offices, obtain household registration certificates from the Baojia system, and have the township office stamp them to ensure caution. Starting this month, all vendors must carry this certificate with them for inspection at any time.

Hangzhou: River Tide Eroding Dike, Urgent Need for Repair. Hangzhou has been experiencing continuous rain. The dike has been eroded by the river tide, and the situation is very dangerous. About three miles outside the city from Qingtai Road, the field water and the shore have merged. Further ahead, the high ground has become low-lying. The sandy land in the Qibao area has mostly subsided, and the villagers have moved into the dike. Further into the river, the south bank vaguely reveals Zhe Mountain. The water and sky are the same color. The river tide is surging, and the yellow water has entered the dike. There are many gaps in the dike, and the situation is extremely dangerous. Continuing towards Jianggan, the sluice gate bridge is seen, with very rapid water flow. According to people from Xiaoshan, the river dikes along the shore were previously dug for trenches and have not yet been filled. At this time of water crisis, the villagers are extremely anxious and urgently hope that the water conservancy authorities will quickly find a way to repair and fill the gaps to avoid a major disaster.

Kunshan: Effectively Suppressing Price Hikes. The County Price Evaluation Committee convened a meeting on the 14th to suppress rampant price increases and decided to take effective measures. (1) Those who do not sell at the evaluated prices will be fined six hundred times the amount exceeding the evaluation. The fine will be kept in the county treasury and used to fund local projects. (2) All shops must clearly mark the prices of goods. Those who violate this will have all their goods confiscated, sold at auction, and the proceeds used for project funding.

Wuxi: Military Detention Center Inmates Escape. The military detention center, located in Guan Jian Lane in the city, is headed by Director Chen Yuanzu. Currently, it holds 76 inmates, all involved in cases of opium, robbery, military theft, banditry, and endangering the public. Many of the cases have not been adjudicated. At around 9 p.m. on the 14th, it was discovered that 17 prisoners, including convicts and those awaiting sentencing, had dug two holes in the wall of cell number one in compound A and escaped without a trace. The city gates were closed early, and a search was conducted everywhere. At around 1 a.m., two individuals, Lu Jiating and Zhao Chengde, were found at the train station. The remaining 15 fugitives, including Yu Shuyuan, are still being actively pursued.

Authorities Strictly Prohibit Inciting Strikes. Labor unrest has been frequent in this area recently. The number of labor disputes that were mediated last month totaled as many as 21. The First Pacification Zone Headquarters believed that labor unrest was closely related to social security, especially collective strikes, which were even more important. Yesterday, it issued a proclamation strictly prohibiting inciting strikes, and those who violate it will be prosecuted for endangering social security.

Wuchang: Criticism of Provincial Government Mismanagement at the Assembly. The Hubei Provincial Provisional Assembly recently sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Control Yuan, criticizing the Hubei Provincial Government for five points of mismanagement: (1) Taking the lead in concealing the Central Government's intentions, suppressing the order to suspend the collection of arrears in taxes and instead strictly limiting the collection at the same time. (2) Condemning subordinates’ corruption. County magistrate Chen Wen of Chengfeng County, County magistrate Wang Bin of Shishou County, County magistrate Li Chengzhong of Daye County, the manager of the supply office, Tai Yuncheng, etc. who were investigated and found to be corrupt, were allowed to escape because the provincial government delayed prosecution. Ye Jingxiong, a confidant of the provincial chairman Wang Dongyuan, also only had an arrest warrant issued for privately selling tens of thousands of yuan of received materials. (3) Indiscriminate withdrawal of transferred funds and also sending Director Wu of the Department of Finance to attempt bribery at the assembly. (4) Appointing private individuals, even those with notorious track records and pending arrest, to important positions. (5) Blocking news and suppressing public opinion.

Movies and Theater

### Shanghai Needs a "Children's Theater"

— Tang Shaohua

Theater is not just a simple form of entertainment; it contains a profound educational significance. Because theater is education through art, it can directly influence the audience. Many people have mentioned these theories before.

What we are now bringing up is the relationship between theater and children's education. Theater not only educates adults, but its impact on children may be even more profound.

In our country's past, there was the famous story of Mencius' mother moving three times. The actions of the neighbors could invisibly influence the sage Mencius. It seems unquestionable that theater, through the artistic form of performance, can guide ordinary children. Children love to learn and imitate, and the education they receive in their youth has a significant impact on their future. Therefore, if theatrical art can be used as a tool to educate children, the effect will definitely be great.

Talking about using theater to promote education for children, the first thing to study is naturally the issue of advocating children's theater, and even more practically, the need for a "children's theater." With a children's theater, children have a place to be educated, and then the required children's theater will emerge and be created.

The "Children's Theater" is said to have originated in the first anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution in 1918. Because the Soviet Union pays the most attention to propaganda, they once declared: Using "Children's Theater is the most effective tool for educating children to become future soldiers." Children's theaters are also very common in the United States. Someone in Hong Kong once launched this movement, and the results were quite good. Now, speaking of Shanghai, which is known as an international metropolis, although there are many theaters for adults to enjoy, no one seems to have mentioned "children's theaters." Therefore, this writer wants to make a suggestion, hoping that accomplished people in social education and theater movement will jointly launch this "children's theater" movement. We believe that this is not only fortunate for the children of Shanghai, but also very beneficial to the entire country and society.

Theater Review

### The Theater Chronicle (Performed by Guanghua)

— Shao Zijie

We should thank the theater workers for pioneering and planting seeds for the theater movement. The road of the theater movement is tortuous and difficult. However, the young workers work hard, tirelessly, enthusiastically, and foolishly for the theater, nurturing poignant sadness. What is shown in "The Theater Chronicle" includes the success of theater movement workers, as well as the failure of theater movement workers, the glory of theater movement workers, and also the disgrace of theater movement workers, and... This is not only a milestone in the theater world. What is presented in the whole play should also be the vicissitudes of the theater movement workers. Yun Ni's death, Ruo Yan's fall, Lu Xiankui's anxiety and depression about the economy of the theater troupe, Tang Qianqian's corruption, and Meng Hui Jiang Han, etc. working calmly for the theater, the workers of the theater movement illuminated the road of the theater, their bodies laid the cornerstone of success. Without stepping over the bodies of these people, the Chinese New Drama Movement will not reach its destination.

The playwright not only portrayed the blood and tears of the theater movement workers, but also illuminated the obsolescence of the times. Mr. Feng Zhi's preventing his daughter from acting, the police station's ban on men and women performing together, and the actors being stopped by the military police for shouting "The Northeast is ours," without theater, the transformation of the times would not be so fast. This further proves that the blood and sweat of the workers in the theater has not been in vain.

There are enough characters in the whole play, but the playwright handles them so harmoniously, orderly, and unified. In the collective creation, there is no flaw in the tradition. The director rehearsed the whole play very well. Ding Cong's device and Shen Yan's lighting made the stage design so soft and lovely. On the whole, the actors can cooperate appropriately. Lan Ma's Lu Xiankui does have extraordinary success. Zhai Yu's Meng Hui, and Dai Yun's Ren Juequn are also very good. Wan Su's Yun Ni acted subtle enough when she played a female student in the first half of the play, but she was not enough when she played a movie star in the second half of the play.

### Tan Muqian's Spoken Drama

— Lu Ping

The reason why I like "Spoken Drama" is not because people say it, it is novel, it is more advanced than "Beijing Opera" and "of Du Opera". I think the former has flesh and blood, and can reflect the reality of evil and the compactness and concreteness of party feelings, unlike Beijing Opera, which is so abstract, not like "of Du Opera", the thousand-story uniformity of the reason. Although the current stage of "Spoken Drama" also has many unsatisfactory places, these are not enough to hinder its progress, its growth and development. In order to hope that Spoken Drama has a better future in China, the author wants to say a few words here about the bad habits in the current Spoken Drama world.

Spoken drama seems to have such a phenomenon at present: 1. As long as it can sell seats, it is thought that the script is very good. 2. As long as there is a performance, it is thought that you are great, and it is thought that you have reached the task and mission of spoken drama. At first glance, the reason seems to be very right. Being able to sell seats and having performances are naturally the main conditions for developing drama,

What is worth our attention and vigilance is that the plays that can sell seats often cater to the psychology of people with low tastes, so they are not necessarily good plays; the theater troupes that have performances often do not care about the quality of the script and the needs of reality, so they are not necessarily good theater troupes. The key to the problem is whether the content of the script is progressive and whether the performance of the theater troupe is faithful. In other words, if you forget the lofty goal of the New Drama Movement—anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, and promoting democratization and scientification—no matter how well this script can sell seats, and how the theater troupe continues to cultivate and work hard for the New Drama Movement, such a script and such a theater troupe are still not what China needs in the future.

Sound criticism and accepting criticism are also very important for the New Drama Movement. Because criticism of a play can on the one hand enable readers and audiences to understand the theme and characteristics of the work step by step, how to accept the thoughts entrusted by the playwright, and on the other hand enable playwrights to grasp the highest准则 of drama writing at this stage, so that actors, directors, and those responsible for lighting, special effects, etc., pay attention to future work. It is a pity that this principle is still rarely done in various places today. In recent years, this problem has occurred in the rear, and there have been many unfortunate tragedies. Some newspaper offices have been beaten to pieces for publishing articles criticizing drama, and some authors who wrote drama criticism have been beaten until their skin was broken and bleeding. In this way, those who can write dare not write, but those who cannot write get up to write nonsense and blow their own horns. It is hoped that this phenomenon can no longer exist in the drama world in the future.

Introduction to Theater People

### Shen Fu

— Lu Zi

If it were not for forgetful audiences, they would surely remember the two films that were once a sensation — "Free Land" (starring Chen Yanyan and Ouyang Hongying) and "A Match Made in Heaven" (starring Bai Lu and Han Langen). Due to these two films, they would also think of the big director Shen Fu. Fatty Shen was not only a popular director of Lianhua Film Company before the war, but also completed three masterpieces in the extremely difficult working environment in the rear in recent years—"Small People's Rhapsody," "Full House of Gold and Jade," and "Twenty-Four Hours in Chongqing." These three scripts have been performed in various places in the rear, and their box office success can be said to have broken records. Both insiders and outsiders unanimously praised them as masterpieces. Among the three plays, "Twenty-Four Hours in Chongqing" is even more wonderful. The content depicts the statues of people from all walks of life in Chongqing within twenty-four hours, and it has been performed twice in Chengdu.

At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, Shen Fu and Bai Yang formed the Film People's Troupe and entered Sichuan, rehearsing many spoken dramas, such as Thunderstorm Sunrise Wilderness, etc. In "Sunrise," Shen also played Manager Pan as an actor. Later, Wen Songkang and Qin Wei re-established the Northwest Film Studio in Xi'an and sent people thousands of miles to invite Shen Fu and He Mengfu to participate in the cooperation. Mengfu then shot his new work "Wind and Snow Taihang Mountain" (starring Ouyang Hongying and Xie Tian) on the spot. Shen Fu went to the northwest to shoot his self-written and directed "Long Live the People," but due to major problems with transportation and materials (the source of film was cut off after the outbreak of the Pacific War), he had to shelve it midway. This play took a lot of his effort, and he said to himself, "It is a lifelong regret that I cannot complete it." He also rehearsed many spoken dramas in the "Western Electric" Troupe.

Three years ago, the Central Film Studio specially hired him as a screenwriter and director. His three masterpieces were completed after entering Zhongdian. He is a top red director in Chongqing. Shen Fu's ability to achieve today's position is not an accidental opportunity. First, he has good cultivation and treats people sincerely. None of the friends who have worked with him do not respect him. If there is a personnel dispute in the theater troupe, as long as Shen Fu comes out to mediate, there will be no problem at all. He is now forty years old. His wife is from Suzhou, beautiful, virtuous, and gentle, but unfortunately her health is not very good and she often has minor illnesses. But unexpectedly, Shen, a big man, is meticulous and very considerate of her. Recently, after Shen Fu rushed to finish Xie Tian's "Night Tide on the Bund", followed by Yang Hansheng's "Heroes of the Grassland", he will probably fly to Beiping in the middle of next month to shoot his new film script "Hero Mother" and "Emei Spring Dawn". Audiences in Pinghu, who have been away for a long time, please wait patiently for the good film!

Spoken Drama

### A Casual Discussion on "Model Teacher for All Times"

— Wucun

Drama movement, in recent years, taking wartime capital Chongqing and the enemy-occupied Shanghai as its bases, has exhibited a vigorous scene. Although the environments of the two are completely different, the playwrights, tempered by the cruel reality, are consistent in their efforts to approach truth. This tendency is especially obvious among the playwrights in the rear. They not only understand hate but also understand love; not only whip and accuse but also turn to encourage and praise. We have seen Mr. Cao Yu's "Metamorphosis," an upward and positive drama that we have worked hard to perform. Now we have read Mr. Yuan Jun's "Model Teacher for All Times."

After eight years of bitter fighting, lives were devastated. In the midst of widespread warfare, we have seen many admirable and moving deeds and people. The arduous and outstanding spirit and the awe-inspiring integrity of some educators are just one example. Mr. Yuan Jun set aside various questionable and contemptible phenomena in the War of Resistance and used the keen observation and warm sympathy of an artist to complete a sacred statue for us. Professor Lin Tong of the university, as portrayed by Mr. Yuan, has light and heat, but at the same time, he is a flesh-and-blood character who has been through ups and downs. In this regard, he is more familiar and approachable to us than Ding Huofu and Commissioner Liang in "Metamorphosis."

Around Professor Lin Tong, Mr. Yuan Jun also wrote about some of the dregs of the times, those professors who could not bear poverty and snobbery and changed their careers to business. This is not only for setting off but also for unearthing the truth. "Model Teacher for All Times" is realistic but full of lofty ideals. The author moves us with a full and vivid brush and encourages us with unrestrained enthusiasm, elevating and uplifting our spirit.

Now "Model Teacher for All Times" has been performed by the Central Drama Troupe at the Lyceum Theatre. It is in Chongqing, and I believe "Model Teacher for All Times" will be even more appreciated by the people of Shanghai.

Review and Introduction of Drama

### Apricot Blossom Rain, South of the Yangtze River (Yu Ling)

— Zijie

"Our people, both military and civilian, must deeply realize the suffering of our compatriots in the occupied areas to what extent they have reached... Our compatriots should think about these compatriots who cannot seek death and have no way to serve the country, and they will know how urgently they need our rescue..." —Excerpt from Chairman Chiang's Announcement to the Military and Civilians on the Seventh Anniversary of the War of Resistance—

Six years ago, I finished reading Mr. Yu Ling's "Night Shanghai" in tears. Today, I am fortunate to read Mr. Yu Ling's recent work, "Apricot Blossom Rain, South of the Yangtze River." These two plays should be related. The characters presented in the latter are also the protagonists of the former. If "Night Shanghai" depicts the suffering in the early stage of the War of Resistance, then the latter portrays the misery in the semi-occupied areas. I did love the reality in "Night Shanghai," but now I must say that I love the situation in "Apricot Blossom Rain, South of the Yangtze River" even more. Regardless of what "Night Shanghai" indicates to us, "Apricot Blossom Rain, South of the Yangtze River" should be a good play that targets reality.

The story unfolds in the semi-occupied Tonglin area south of the Yangtze River. In order to realize its goal of controlling Tung oil, the enemy spared no effort to use the two traitors, Lu Tong and Mei Yu, to try to buy the Mei family's Tong Garden. However, Mei Lingchun, the owner of this Tong Garden, a loyal country gentleman who had just fled back to his hometown from Shanghai, firmly refused. On the evening of the autumn tung oil harvest, the Tong Garden was suddenly burned to ashes under the enemy's flames, but the guerrillas had already rescued all the tung oil the day before. Mei Lingchun, looking at his home that had been robbed again, finally let his daughter, Menghui, officially join the political work team in anger. On the day when the tung oil was fully loaded on the boat for the guerrillas to be transported back to the rear, he also encouraged his son, Meizhu, to join the air force in the rear. Mei Lingchun's contribution to the victory of the War of Resistance cannot be erased, and the whole play shows more of the bright side. Sincerely, what "Apricot Blossom Rain, South of the Yangtze River" tells us is mostly encouraging. In the promotion of the War of Resistance and national construction, the effect of "Apricot Blossom Rain, South of the Yangtze River" should be quite significant.

Savoring the events in the play from familiar shadows, painful bloodstains reappeared in ancient memories. Thanks to Mr. Zi Ling for writing these into a play. From this, I believe that people can gain a deeper understanding of the suffering of the occupied areas. As the play says: "The compatriots in the occupied areas are enduring like this, guarding like this, and looking forward to the counter-offensive like this, urgently waiting for rescue. Let the rear everything be for the counter-offensive, rescue the people in the occupied areas, and recover the occupied land. Remember... remember my words, don't forget everything is for the counter-offensive, rescue the occupied areas..." This should be the cry of the dying, but Mr. Yu Ling shouted it out for the people in the occupied areas. Fortunately, the War of Resistance has been won. Now the problem facing us is national construction. I think we should no longer discriminate. True people have patriotic hearts.

### A Record of the Song Yun Collection

— Zhuang Yifu

In recent times, scholars who study and admire opera have different preferences. However, few practice Kunqu Opera. Moreover, at a time when the country has not yet been restored, one cannot avoid the feeling of derelict fields. I have been living in the countryside for three years, lying drunk in my hometown, and I no longer play this tune. After my illness, I abandoned it even more. Since the victory came, the stench of war was swept away, and I was ordered to guard Shanghai. I came to the sea again and stayed at the Song Yun Villa. The host and hostess are deeply fond of Kunqu Opera. They often ascend the high building of Bai Xue, invite old friends of Qingxi, gather to perform songs, and meet two or three times a month. This spring (24th), they held a grand event again, and the Kunqu Opera friends who came to Shanghai from the new rear were all happy to attend. After several years of separation, we reunited in one hall; the flute playing in the song, the wind and flowers flying everywhere. We exhausted the fun of the day and night, and finally got twenty-four dramas. The host can be said to be as hospitable as Kong Beihai and as fond of music as Wei Liangfu.

On that day, the gong was struck, and the garden tour was sung in order. Tavern. Thinking of the mortal world. Sugar cane forest. Chat. Qin Tiao, and Chen Miaochang, sung by Yan Gong, an old man of seventy-three, was full of charm. The clear sound was emitted, delicate, rounded, and appropriate. Yan has recently taken on courses at the Shanghai Municipal Experimental Drama School, which is rare. Next was A Fool's Dream, Picking Paintings, Taking In, and A Good Time. Zhang Genglin's Cui Shi was quite difficult to sing in the high pitches. Wang Xunzhi's Liu Mengmei was also clear and elegant. Then there was Listening to the Bell, Sending Yu, Looking Home, and Unloading the Seal. Zhu Xihua's Tang Minghuang showed sparseness in both singing and recitation. Moreover, the final Wuling Flower was bright but not high-pitched, surpassing others. Zhu Xizhen and Gong Lingzun's Sending Son, with Xu Boyou's flute, suddenly became an excited sound, like a sad spring rushing into a valley. The listeners held their breath, and the steady dialogue was just the remainder. Sheng Cheng, who played Su Wu in Looking Home, used a woman's voice to express the old age, and also vividly showed the lonely minister outside the border, looking forward to the palace with earnest heart, which was also commendable. The guests on the seats, such as Yao Jilang, Chen Naiwen, Wang Shuguang, Cai Shuliu, and Li Xitong, were all focused. At this point, the torch had been lit. Zhao Jingshen's pre-booked Pan Fu was postponed again due to his absence. Therefore, Gongci brought forward the Neiting Benqi Double Meeting to suppress the carriage. Zhu Yaowen's Jingzi was very fluent. I sang Li Qi, which was not my profession, especially with the water, gold, and Zhishuang flutes going together, I felt very weak. Writing the Complaint was performed by Shen Yiyi as Zhao Chong, and the host's wife, Mrs. Kong, played Guizhi. Shen was one of the few female actors who played male roles, and Mrs. Kong used the delicate and charming voice of a boudoir girl, making the listeners hold their breath. When the song ended, the people were quiet, almost making the orchid not fragrant and the jade platform lose its color. Three times we added Zhao Jingshen's Bao Tong, the taste was endless. After the banquet, a small banquet of Pan Fu was held, reopening the scene and satisfying the interest in the song. Xia Huanxin's ballad served as the finale. It was almost midnight when it dispersed. When the wine was exhausted and the song was tired, I wrote a few words and returned them to the host, to mark my presence.

### Notes on Affixing Stamps

It has been five months since the implementation of direct taxes in this city. However, many merchants and companies often neglect or do not understand the affixing of stamps on capital accounts, resulting in fines of more than 20 times or less than 60 times the tax payable. According to item 16 of the Stamp Tax Law, the deed of joint venture business is calculated according to the stamp duty ratio of 40 cents per hundred yuan. The remarks column states: "The contract or articles of association mutually concluded in this item. Minutes. Stock. The ledger of ten thousand taels, etc., if another stock or share certificate is issued, the ledger of ten thousand taels should be affixed according to item 15 of this table, the book used by the business, that is, four yuan per year. If two or more copies are concluded separately, stamps should be affixed according to the amount of capital contributed, that is, four per thousand. If it is a sole proprietorship, stamps should also be affixed on the account book according to the capital amount of four per thousand. Each share of stock is affixed with a stamp duty of 40 cents per hundred yuan of the face value, which is also calculated proportionally. After the stamp is affixed, it does not need to be affixed again every year. It is hoped that merchants and companies with such circumstances who have not affixed stamps will make up the stamps to avoid repeating the same mistakes and being punished. It will be too late to regret it. Net governance.
