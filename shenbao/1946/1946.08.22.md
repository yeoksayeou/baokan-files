### Important Resolutions Passed by the Central Executive Committee: Vigorously Stabilize National Prices; Mobilize Party and League Forces to Assist in Implementation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] The Central Executive Committee held its 38th regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 21st, attended by Chen Guofu, Wu Tiecheng, Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Lisheng, Xiao Zheng, and others. Bai Chongxi presided, and Committee Member Song Ziwen made a special trip from Shanghai to attend. In addition to discussing routine matters, Committee Member Song reported on the resolution of the previous week's Supreme National Defense Council's provisional meeting to abolish export taxes and gave a detailed account of the situation in the Shanghai market since the change in the exchange rate and the listing on Monday. The Standing Committee members Xiao Zheng, Duan Xipeng, Pan Gongzhan, Lai Lian, and others made a temporary motion on measures to stabilize national prices after the change in the exchange rate, which was resolved as follows: (1) The government's responsible authorities are instructed to strictly implement the price stabilization proposal. (2) The central government will issue a general order to party and league branches throughout the country to assist the government and promote local trade associations to work together to achieve the task. During the discussion, some committee members considered the various measures to encourage exports, such as the recent change in the exchange rate, to be appropriate. They were particularly pleased to learn from Committee Member Song's report on the Shanghai market situation in the past two days that the Shanghai trade associations were quite aware of the overall situation and able to cooperate with the government's policies to help stabilize prices. Although a small number of prices were slightly affected, the overall situation was a good sign. However, the committee members were concerned that price stabilization should be nationwide, not just in Shanghai. Other provinces and cities should also be unaffected by the exchange rate, so that while encouraging exports, the people's livelihoods would not be affected by the negative consequences of price fluctuations. Furthermore, during the heated discussion, some committee members believed that to achieve the effect of stabilizing prices, attention must be paid to the following three categories, which must absolutely not be increased in price: (1) daily necessities similar to rice, coal, oil (fuel), salt, sugar, cotton yarn, etc.; (2) state-owned enterprises and public utilities, such as transportation, electricity, water, telecommunications, etc.; (3) standard goods for general price conversion, such as gold. If the above three categories do not increase in price, other goods will have no excuse. The government should use various methods to prohibit the increase in the above three categories, and then various prices will not fluctuate due to changes in the exchange rate. In this way, people's livelihoods will not be affected, the cost of living index will not continue to rise, and workers' wages will not need to be increased. Therefore, the government should also issue a simultaneous order to factories and workers throughout the country, prohibiting them from demanding wage increases under any pretext. In this way, the cost of domestic goods factories will not be affected, and there will be no reason for product price increases. The goal is to ensure that the result of the exchange rate change is that the price of foreign goods increases, so that the government's policies truly benefit factories and the people. In addition to instructing the government to strictly implement the price stabilization policy, the central government will immediately mobilize the national party and league forces to assist in its promotion in order to fully implement it.

### Minister Peng Issues Statement: Closely Monitor Unscrupulous Merchants, No Price Gouging Allowed

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department issued a statement to reporters today on the issue of price fluctuations, stating: For several months, due to price changes, adjusting the exchange rate has become a unanimous request of the national industrial and commercial sectors. On August 19th, the government revised the new rate. Although the Shanghai market fluctuated slightly the next day, it has stabilized in recent days. However, Nanjing and other places continue to see fluctuations. Originally, the prices of domestic products such as rice and grains are unrelated to foreign exchange and should not rise with the exchange rate. Moreover, this year has seen good harvests everywhere, and there is no shortage. The materials controlled by the government, such as coal, salt, and sugar, have already been instructed by the Executive Yuan not to increase in price. All public utilities have also been firmly instructed by the Yuan not to increase prices. Gold has also been supplied by the Central Bank as much as possible, and the increase is minimal. Therefore, there is no reason for a general rise in prices. The government has issued a general order to provincial and municipal governments to closely monitor and not allow unscrupulous merchants to take advantage of the opportunity to raise prices. The central party and league headquarters have also issued a general order to party and league branches in various places to mobilize party and league forces to assist the government, persuade the public to sanction unscrupulous merchants, and hope that the media will promote just arguments and stabilize prices. It is particularly hoped that industrial and commercial figures will deeply understand that the government's policy is purely to protect industry and commerce, and not to raise prices unnecessarily to undermine the government's policy and put themselves in an unfavorable situation.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] Mayor Ma Chaojun of Nanjing ordered Chen Jianru, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, to jointly discuss price controls with the police bureau, the municipal chamber of commerce, and various trade associations on the 20th.

### Silk Exports Expected to Increase After Exchange Rate Change

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] After the exchange rate adjustment, the authorities still plan to adopt a subsidy method for the purchase of raw silk, while the purchase of tea and tung oil may be discontinued.

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 21st Dispatch] Zhejiang Province is a silk-producing area. Since the exchange rate change, raw silk exports have a [missing word]. Currently, the market price of high-grade American raw silk is US$16, and low-grade is US$9. The recent selling price has slightly fallen back. High-grade raw silk still has considerable profit, and France also has considerable demand. Therefore, if Chinese silk can improve its quality, there is hope for the future. The depressed silk industry in Hangzhou has a glimmer of hope.

### Central Bank Law Under Careful Study by the Legislative Yuan

### Utilizing and Controlling Materials to Coordinate Price Stabilization: Director Long of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Announces Measures

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] Long Dajun, Director of the Control Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, told reporters on the 21st that the government's adjustment of the exchange rate is intended to help domestic production enterprises, especially the export industry. After the announcement of the new exchange rate, some import and export prices have been affected, which is expected. However, other commodity prices should not follow suit and rise. The current volatility is a temporary psychological effect and is expected to stabilize in a short period. The government is confident in stabilizing prices. The various departments under the Executive Yuan are currently using the materials they control to coordinate efforts. For example, the Ministry of Finance is using its large amount of gold, the Ministry of Food is using its bulk food supplies, and the Materials Supply Bureau is using its large quantities of daily necessities. The materials controlled by this ministry (Ministry of Economic Affairs) include cotton yarn, cloth, coal, vegetable oil, etc. Minister Wang and Vice Ministers Pan and Xiao are very concerned about stabilizing prices. Today, they have ordered the Textile Industry Management Committee, the [missing word] Textile Company, and other private textile factories to reduce their selling prices as a lead. At a minimum, they should maintain the original price and not increase it. The coal prices of the Fuel Management Committees in the Shanghai and Tianjin areas have also been ordered to be suppressed and not allowed to increase. Vegetable oil factories are also taking the same measures. As for the Taiwan Sugar Company under the Resources Committee and the China Edible Oil Company under the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has also sent letters requesting them to take the same measures. In addition, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has also issued a general order to the municipal governments of major cities to strengthen price controls. Price increases of certain important daily necessities should be prevented, and the provisions of the Regulations on the Suppression of Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiations and the Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce in Extraordinary Times should be strictly followed. Regarding wages, governments at all levels are also requested to find ways to stabilize them in order to coordinate with the stabilization of prices. Finally, Long emphasized that if the people can sincerely cooperate with the government and abide by the price control laws and regulations, the expected results can definitely be [missing word].

### Zhou Enlai Visited the Ambassador Yesterday to Exchange Views on the General Situation Again

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] The return to Beijing of Ambassador Stuart is generally hoped that they can bring about a revival of peace. However, with the current military situation deteriorating so badly, it is not easy to reverse the tide. Ma himself also feels deeply troubled. On the 20th, Ma and others discussed matters in Beijing until late at night before dispersing. On the 21st, Zhou Enlai was invited to the US Embassy to meet with Ambassador Stuart, accompanied by Wang Bingnan. They left at around 6:00 PM, after a two-hour meeting. In addition to the peace issue, the Anping incident was also discussed, but no results were obtained. After the meeting, Wang Bingnan told reporters: "We exchanged views on the general situation, but this move indicates that the CCP has not stopped negotiations aimed at a peaceful resolution." Stuart Leiden asked Zhou Enlai about the truth of the Zhangjiakou broadcast. Zhou explained that it was only the announcement of the general mobilization order for the liberated areas and not a declaration of war. Marshal Ma drove to the Dajiaochang Airport this morning to personally welcome General Peterson, the US Undersecretary of the Army, who came to Beijing from Shanghai. He hosted a banquet at the residence in the evening to welcome Peterson. Eight of Peterson's staff members were present. According to US sources, the General's visit has no political significance.

[United Press, Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] The CCP side announced today that a nationwide ceasefire is a prerequisite for discussing the formation of a coalition government. News from Guling says that Chairman Chiang can invite the CCP to participate in the reorganized government. The CCP side said that first there must be a ceasefire, and then the government should be reorganized in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart Leiden have returned to Beijing separately this time, reportedly intending to start from the political aspect and make a final effort to save the overall civil war. According to unconfirmed news: Marshal Ma brought Chairman Chiang's intention on this trip, asking the Communist Party to nominate certain ministerial candidates to participate in the coalition government. However, the CCP headquarters in Yan'an has announced that there will be no discussion of a coalition government without a ceasefire. According to Wang Bingnan, a CCP spokesman here, the CCP has no intention of overthrowing the government and has not declared war, but demands an unconditional ceasefire.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] According to sources close to Ambassador Stuart Leiden:

Chairman Chiang told Ambassador Stuart and Special Envoy Marshall in recent conversations that he does not wish to create a Chiang Kai-shek II to take his place, because the end of World War II has already destined totalitarian politics to [missing word].

The Chairman places great trust in peace and democracy and wishes to establish a new governmental system in China. Because he believes that it is time for China to implement democracy. Special Envoy Marshall told the Chairman during the negotiations that oppression, bribery, and bureaucratic habits are hindering the current government's position and should be eliminated. However, regarding this, Special Envoy Marshall can only offer suggestions.

### The Communist Party's Statement to Be Issued Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] The Communist Party's statement on Chairman Chiang's declaration has been delayed for a long time. On the 21st, it was once again rumored that it would be issued at 5:00 PM, but it did not materialize. According to a Communist Party spokesman, the statement may be issued on the 22nd. The content of the statement will be nothing more than two points: (1) The Communist Party is not afraid of a war; (2) It still does not reject negotiations.

### CCP Personnel in Beijing Can Still Move Freely

[Reuters, Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] The CCP personnel here are currently expanding their residence, and do not seem to be fleeing to the Red capital of Yan'an, but rather intend to stay for a long time. Zhou Enlai is still driving his jeep through the streets as usual. There are no guns mounted on the car, and there are no guards. CCP personnel can still freely make phone calls to various places. Anyone who calls 21364 can get a Communist Party staffer on the line. On the surface, the situation at the CCP office is the same as in the past two months, and there is no [missing word] tension.

### Communist Army Calls for Mobilization of the People, Who Suffer First

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 21st Dispatch] After the broadcast of the Communist Party's call for the mobilization of all military and civilians in the "Liberated Areas" to join the army and participate in the war was re-broadcast by San Francisco on the evening of the 20th, with the Communist Party having declared war on the government, all parties here were extremely shocked. Some people seemed to take this very seriously, and commodity prices soared accordingly. For example, flour was 25,000 per bag yesterday, but is now 30,000. The common people have already tasted the bitterness. The Communist side of the Military Mediation Department has repeatedly denied this, saying that the Communist Party's specific expression has not gone beyond the Liberation Daily's editorial of the 16th, but it does not deny that the situation has reached the most serious stage, and even worries about the safety of their (Military Mediation Department Communist Party personnel). A certain relevant authority on the other side also said in a rather serious tone, "The Communist Party representative of the Taiyuan group burned all of its documents yesterday, which is a noteworthy phenomenon."

### National Army Will Not "Suppress" the Communists, Responsible Parties in Beiping Express

[Agence France-Presse, Beiping, 20th Dispatch] News came from Nanjing from foreigners that the National Army would "suppress" the Communist Party. This statement was denied by responsible parties here, who said that those who issued this message do not understand the current political situation in China and the history of the past 20 years. The goal of the Chinese army is to complete the political unification of the country.

### CCP Establishes Administrative Body in Harbin; Yan'an Radio Announces the Six-Point Program

[United Press, Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] Yan'an Radio announced today that the CCP has established an independent administrative body in Harbin called the "Democratic Northeast Provisional Supreme Administrative Body," with 86 members elected from all walks of life, in order to "unite all levels, build a peaceful and democratic new Northeast, and support the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the Potsdam Declaration, and the Sino-Soviet Treaty." Its political program is as follows: (1) Unite at all levels to build a democratic new Northeast. (2) Establish democratic and autonomous local governments. (3) Protect and encourage private industry and commerce, welcome investment, develop public enterprises and cooperatives, improve the lives of farmers and workers, and implement reasonable and unified tax rules. (4) Strengthen the People's Army and the People's Volunteer Army. (5) Replace fascist and enslaving education with democratic education. (6) Guarantee individual freedoms of speech, publication, thought, assembly, belief, election, residence, and occupation. The broadcast concluded: "Men and women of all countries have the legal right to reside in the Northeast."

### Peng Xuepei Discusses Government Reorganization Steps, Proceeding in Accordance with the Political Consultative Conference Agreement

[United Press, Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei said today that the government will continue the policy that began before March, allowing non-Kuomintang members to [missing word] enter the government, but believes that the CCP does not want to participate at this time. When asked whether Chairman Chiang had invited the CCP to join the government or had received the opposite answer, Peng first denied it, and then said that he did not know, saying that the "steps for government reorganization are continuing in accordance with the various agreements of the Political Consultative Conference." Various basic conditions, such as the cessation of conflict and the reorganization of the army, have not been implemented, so the subcommittees of the Political Consultative Conference cannot be convened. I am not aware of any plans to convene national leaders to resolve political issues. Chairman Chiang mentioned several conditions before accepting a coalition government, but these conditions have long been accepted by the CCP. There is still some hope that political issues can be resolved through political methods, but it is impossible to say when they can be resolved. The main dispute is over the issue of whether the CCP or the government will rule the counties in northern Jiangsu. Regarding the question of "whether the government supports a referendum to allow the people to decide," Peng replied, "No." Regarding the question of "how much longer can China argue with the current environment before economic bankruptcy," Peng replied, "Regardless of the CCP's division, the economic situation has made significant progress." The reporter asked, "Is the Political Consultative Conference dead?" Minister Peng thought for a moment and smiled, "The conference is neither dead nor alive."

### Government Memorandum, the CCP Has Not Replied

(United Press, Nanjing, 21st Dispatch) It is rumored that the CCP is currently mobilizing to resist the National Army, but the government will not "attach importance" to it. Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei explained to the press today that the meaning of the Chinese word "mobilization" is different from that in Western countries. The declaration from Yan'an a few days ago was intended to call on residents of the CCP area to cooperate and form the main force of the militia. When asked if the declaration from Yan'an was a declaration of war, Minister Peng replied firmly, "No." He also said that there are no major battles in China except for the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. However, it cannot be ignored that the CCP intends to launch a full-scale offensive. The government issued a memorandum instructing the CCP to stop attacking Datong, otherwise the National Army would attack Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, or Chengde. The CCP has not replied. The government's air force has not attacked or bombed Zhangjiakou or the airfield there. Minister Peng also reviewed the military situation, saying that the Communist army, disregarding the ceasefire agreement, has launched a large-scale offensive on various lines in Shanxi Province, approaching the outskirts of Datong, and is preparing to attack Taiyuan with all its strength. The Communist army in eastern Henan has reached east of Kaifeng, occupied Qi County, and is pointing directly at Kaifeng. The government army has launched a counter-offensive. The Communist army in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway is retreating along the railway, and another 20,000 people are currently threatening Xuzhou. The current war is actually a "full-scale rebellion by the CCP." Although the Communist army continues to attack, the government is still proceeding with its military reorganization plan. In areas south of the Longhai Railway where there are no battles, the military reorganization process has reached the first stage, and thousands of officers have retired.

### Executive Yuan to Convene Provisional Meeting Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] The Executive Yuan was originally scheduled to convene a provisional emergency meeting at 5:00 PM on the 21st, but the meeting was not held as scheduled because the time was pressing and the notification was not complete. It has now been set to be held at 8:30 AM on the 22nd, presided over by President Song himself. All ministers will attend, and it is reported that important decisions will be made on the political situation.

### Fu Jingbo Visits President Song

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] The talk of the government reorganizing itself has become heated. Fu Jingbo, the private advisor to US Ambassador Stuart Leiden, visited President Song Ziwen at the Executive Yuan at 6:00 PM on the 21st. At that time, Minister Yu Dawei was also present. It is reported that this may be related to the reorganization of the government.

### TASS Issues Statement Denying Alliance with the CCP

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 21st Dispatch] The news published in the Chinese newspapers in Beiping, saying that the CCP, on the one hand, and the Soviet Union, on the other hand, and the Mongolian People's Republic have established a military alliance, has been absolutely denied by TASS, which said, "The agency is responsible for stating that this rumor is completely unfounded and is being maliciously spread."

### A Colorful Record of Mount Lu

— Our newspaper's dispatch from Guling, 20th day — Fang Canglang

Like a riddle, talk of a conference emerged in both Nanjing and Guling five days before Chairman Chiang's announcement. It was rumored that the government, recognizing the obstacles to reconstruction in various regions, the separation of north-south transportation, leading to production decline, unemployment, panic, rural decay, and educational stagnation, deepened the current extreme economic crisis. Therefore, it would convene representatives from various parties and factions, societal luminaries, and leaders from the cultural and educational fields at Mount Lu to discuss countermeasures and avert this disaster. Such an action would be timely. Soon after this rumor was revealed in the newspapers of Nanjing and Shanghai, people in general in those cities believed that if such a conference could be realized, it might be beneficial in the short term to resolving all the unreasonable current situations in the country. This reflects the people's nationwide desire for peace. Before long, although a few individuals with ulterior motives, remembering the bright precedent (the Lushan Conference nine years ago, which decided on the major strategy of resisting Japan and laid the foundation for victory), feared the end was near and actually covered their ears at the sound of thunder, murmuring and speaking a lot of "big principles" against the "conference." However, their panicked expressions were evident on paper, causing laughter. In fact, since Chairman Chiang's announcement on "August 14th," the people have had a clear understanding of the government's stance on resolving domestic disputes. The government has clearly stated that it will convene the National Assembly on November 12th of this year. This is sufficient to illustrate that even if the government holds a "Lushan Conference" or a "Nanjing Conference" before the National Assembly is convened, it will only be, as mentioned above, to discuss improving the domestic economic situation, review the gains and losses of educational reconstruction, and discuss ways to restore transportation. It will absolutely not use the conference as a way to disadvantage any opposition party. This is something that anyone with even a little political common sense knows. A legally recognized government in the world has the right and should, when facing extreme difficulties in governing, constantly listen to the opinions of law-abiding opposition parties and societal luminaries in order to improve the current situation and benefit the people. Opposition is unnecessary, and fear reveals a guilty conscience. Besides, this conference is still a mystery to this day.

Two days before Zeng Qi, leader of the China Youth Party, left the mountain, there were reports that the government would soon expand its base. Zeng Qi of the Youth Party and Chen Jinghan, who was independent, would join the government and take on important positions. Moreover, the news of "Zeng Qi joining the cabinet" appeared in the newspapers. It was reported that after Zeng Qi left the mountain, someone asked him when he would join the cabinet. Zeng replied with a smile, "That's truly news." Later, according to a gentleman familiar with the so-called "expansion of the government base," he told reporters that although there was talk of expanding the government base, it might not be realized at present. Most of the news such as "reorganization of the government" and "expansion of the government base" that is published in the newspapers is speculation. As for the news reported that "Zeng Qi joins the cabinet," perhaps Mr. Zeng Qi intends to take some time to visit the Beijige Temple in Jiming Temple after returning to Nanjing and reveal this news in advance to aid conversation. Because Mr. Zeng Qi has his own purpose of forming a party and the motivation to sympathize with the government's proposition, not necessarily to become an official, let alone "joining the cabinet." As for the saying that Mr. Chen Jinghan will soon join the government and take on an important position, it seems very likely at first glance. This is because after the Northern Expedition, shortly after the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the government intended to invite Mr. Chen Jinghan to Nanjing for assistance, but at that time, Mr. Chen seemed not to care for officialdom and ultimately did not accept. Now, twenty years later, Mr. Chen is still an independent societal luminary. Today, with the government actively implementing political democratization, this saying seems credible. However, it is a question whether Mr. Chen, who has always been indifferent and content with simplicity, can accept the invitation in the near future.

Marshal Marshall arrived at Mount Lu at 4:00 p.m. on the 16th of this month. This was at a serious juncture when the KMT-CPC negotiations had reached a stalemate, and at a dangerous time when the Communist Party was planning to openly attack and insult him. However, the great Marshal simply said, "They are just naughty children," and showed no displeasure. After Marshall came to Mount Lu for the fourth time, not only did he not fall ill, but he appeared more relaxed, happy and optimistic than the previous three times. Some say this is the greatness of Marshall. At 2:00 p.m. this afternoon, Marshall left Guling for the fourth time and flew to Nanjing again. He will make the final efforts for China's peaceful future with Ambassador Stuart, who returned to Beijing today, to realize their final hope.

### Investigation Team Goes to Xianghe to Hear Communist Report

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Beiping, 21st day] The 25th group dispatched by the Military Mediation Department to investigate the Anping incident, after listening to reports for several days, set off for Xianghe on the morning of the 21st to hear the Communist side's report. Our newspaper's reporter accompanied them. Although it was scheduled to return to Ping that night, they have not returned as of the time of submission, possibly because the procedures have not been completed and they are staying overnight in Xianghe. In addition, the three members of the Military Mediation Department held consecutive meetings on mediating the conflict on the Pingjin Highway. An agreement was reached at noon on the 21st, and a liaison group was sent to the conflict site near Xianghe to mediate, so as to facilitate the investigation and reduce disputes.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 21st day] The 25th group investigating the Anping incident set off on the 21st.

### Belgian Ambassador Visits Chairman to Present Honorary Degree

Italian Ambassador and Others Return to Nanjing Separately

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Guling, 21st day] Chairman Chiang and his wife hosted a banquet for French Ambassador Meyrier and his wife, Belgian Ambassador Delfosse and his daughter, and Mrs. Marshall as a guest in the garden of the Xingyuan at noon on the 21st. The Belgian ambassador went to the Xingyuan at 12:30 p.m., representing the National University of Liege in Belgium, to present the Chairman with an honorary doctorate certificate, and at the same time, representing the Belgian government and its people, to express his admiration to the Chairman.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st day] Italian Ambassador to China, Fenotti, and Afghan Minister to China, Habibullah, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 21st. Canadian Ambassador to China, Oderan, Belgian Ambassador to China, Delfosse, and Dutch Charge d'Affaires, Yang Lianshan, are scheduled to return to Nanjing from Guling on the 22nd.

### Persons Who Previously Held Pseudo-Positions in Beiping City Ordered to Stop Employment

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Beiping, 21st day] It is reported here that the various agencies in Beiping received an order from the Executive Yuan on the 19th, stating in brief: All current civil servants who have served in pseudo-organizations, and who are not underground workers, shall be suspended from their positions from the date of the order. The suspension period is one year for those with delegated positions (the same applies below for pseudo-positions), two years for delegated chiefs, two years for recommended positions, three years for recommended chiefs, three years for simplified positions, and four years for simplified chiefs. During the suspension period, no agency may employ them. If those who have passed the examination and selection are found to have held pseudo-positions, they will all be suspended from their positions according to their positions. The heads of the competent authorities are ordered to strictly comply. However, the heads of various agencies seem quite confused by this order, because most of the lower-level employees in the various agencies were past or had held pseudo-positions. Taking the municipal government as an example, if all are suspended, at least two-thirds or more would be affected, and government affairs would inevitably be greatly affected, so it is being carefully studied.

### Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces Mobilized to Encircle and Suppress Bandits in Taihu Lake, Suzhou Water Police Captain Talks About Recent Situation of Lake Bandits

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Suzhou, 21st day] The banditry in Taihu Lake has now been valued by all parties. However, as to how strong the bandits are, people have different opinions so far and have not obtained accurate statistics. Our newspaper's reporter in Suzhou interviewed Zhang Shaohua, the current captain of the Second Detachment of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, who is familiar with the situation in the water area, on the 21st to inquire. He answered as follows: (1) Taihu Lake spans three provinces, with numerous harbors and scattered islands. Over the years, both suppression and appeasement have been used, but because it is so easy to move around, it has not been eradicated. Now, the highest military authorities have decided on a countermeasure, preparing to mobilize Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to encircle and suppress them. (2) The momentum of the lake bandits recently seems to have not been as rampant as in the past. The main leaders, such as Yang Yanbin and Wu Zhilong, have only a total of more than 1,000 people. The weapons are all kinds of equipment, but not sophisticated enough. (3) Recently, water transportation in Taihu Lake has disappeared, and the bandits' supplies have been cut off, causing them to shift their target to the lakeside rural areas to loot the villages. The residents along the lake hate them like enemies, which will speed up the bandits' self-destruction. (4) The lake bandits do not have a fixed nest, and only rely on more than a dozen large sailboats that they have plundered to roam around. (5) Vice Commander-in-Chief Tang once discussed with me and encouraged me to make contributions, but the strength of my team is not yet strong. If heavy weapons can be allocated, it will definitely be able to give the lake bandits a fatal blow. (6) The previous rumor that Yang Yanbin abandoned his men and fled to Qingdao has now been confirmed to be untrue.

### Huai River Water Level Unprecedentedly High, Severe Disaster Situation in Northeastern Anhui, Five Million People Already in a Tragic Situation

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Bengbu, 17th day] (Delayed) The water level of the Huai River has now reached 20.18 meters, breaking the highest record of 20.17 meters in 1931. Fortunately, the flow of the Huai River itself this year is only 6,500 cubic meters, otherwise the Yellow River water flowing into the Huai River from the Huayuankou through the Jialu River and Ying River, with 8,000 cubic meters per second, would not be able to be accommodated, and the disaster situation would be unimaginable. Now the flow of the Huai River is close to the maximum of 15,000 cubic meters, and the disaster situation is serious, exceeding that of 1931. The 18 counties in northeastern Anhui have all been submerged in water, highway traffic has been cut off, and the Jinpu Railway has many places where the water is level with the rails. It is estimated that at least 5 million people in Anhui are completely in a tragic situation. Yesterday, in the mud and rain, the reporter inspected a hundred li of the Huai River. A dike on the northeast bank of Linhuaiguan was dug open by the Communist army 15 days ago to clear the shooting range. Near it, another dike was broken open in the wind and rain yesterday, and the water was surging. The victims are building houses on the newly repaired dike top, facing the yellow water, and wailing everywhere.

[Our newspaper's correspondence from Hefei] A traveler returning from northern Anhui said: In northern Anhui counties this summer, there was torrential rain for a month. The Shahe, Huai River, and Quan River were all flooded with Yellow River water, and the water level rose to the same level as the dikes. The accumulated water of several feet in the counties could not be discharged, reaching the dike roots, and there was no soil to rescue, resulting in the collapse of the Shahe, Huai River, and Quan River. Houses drifted away, and fields were submerged. Now, in Fuyang, Yingshang, Huoqiu, Shou County, and Fengtai counties, for hundreds of li, it is a vast expanse of water. The farmers in various places fled to other villages for food. The tragic scene of sinking is unbearable to look at. The various counties are now forming Yellow River Disaster Relief Committees to discuss major relief measures: (1) Telegraph the provincial government to exempt the disaster areas from this year's military tax and public grain; (2) Telegraph and allocate one-fourth of the grain (1944) stored in various villages along the banks of the Shahe and Huai River for immediate relief and rescue; (3) Telegraph the Anhui Relief Sub-Administration to quickly allocate a large amount of materials to save the suffering; (4) The local areas in various counties are automatically launching donations to handle immediate relief.

### Han Civilian Ship Industry Raises Funds to Manufacture New-Style Wooden Boats

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Hankou, 21st day] It is learned that Wang Daomin has invented a new type of wooden boat that uses the reciprocating impact of water power to move forward, without the need for manpower or other coal-fired steam engines and other engine parts, and the speed is also very fast. It has now been successfully tested and is being mass-produced by the Civil Ship Industry Association with raised funds.

### Misunderstanding Between Chauffeur of Soviet Embassy in Nanjing and Police Officer

Soviet Embassy Protests

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Nanjing, 21st day] People here do not overemphasize the incident in which the Soviet Embassy submitted a written protest to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs due to a misunderstanding caused by a car obstructing traffic, requesting punishment of the offending police officer. It is generally believed that the occurrence of this matter was purely a misunderstanding, which will not be difficult to understand after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs investigates and handles it. According to reports, this incident occurred on the evening of the 18th. Soviet Embassy Secretary Fedelin went to Confucius Temple at about 8:00 p.m. in an embassy car to shop. The car was parked in front of a watch shop, and the guard police officer drove it away because it was obstructing traffic. The car driver, a Soviet named Mitrofanov, could not speak the language. Many onlookers gathered. Some ignorant people even messed with the (embassy) license plate, touching the national flag in front of the car. The driver immediately got out of the car to straighten it, and when he got back in the car, he used too much force, causing the glass to shatter in the chaos. The guard police officer, fearing an accident due to the large number of onlookers, took the driver to the police station. As the foreign affairs police officer had not returned, he ordered him to leave on his own. Later, the driver and an embassy interpreter came together, but as they did not get the point, they soon left. It is heard that the Soviet Embassy's protest document contained the following words: "Protest strongly against the illegal behavior against embassy personnel and the Soviet national flag," and demanded that the offending police officer be given appropriate punishment.

The China Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Tai-Jia Cotton Planting Guidance Zone, this year, in addition to extensively planting American cotton on more than 9,000 mu in Tai and Jia counties, also planted German cotton on its own farm for improvement trials. It is now known that due to proper cultivation, the growth is excellent. If the weather is normal, the estimated yield per mu can reach around 200 jin. Therefore, technicians from the China Textile Company and agricultural associations from nearby counties have been sending personnel to visit and discuss fertilization and cultivation methods for areas with poor soil fertility as a model for improvement.

Editorial

### The Most Important Issue of Rural Reconstruction

In recent months, this newspaper has published many articles on agricultural reform and land issues. Last Sunday, we published Mr. Ge Kexin's essay, "The Land Problem in Northern Jiangsu." This is not only because we believe that agricultural reform is the fundamental economic problem in China today, but also because it implies that China's greatest political problem lies here as well. Especially after the "liberated areas" of the Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Eastern Henan, and Southern Shandong were recovered by the National Army, the resolution of rural problems became even more urgent.

China's industry, commerce, and even finance and taxation policies will be fruitless if they do not first focus on rural revitalization and agricultural reform! We want to call the attention of the great men and gentlemen: China's agriculture needs reform. China's agricultural reform is both technical and livelihood-based; neither is complete without the other. Without the reform of China's agriculture, China will never be modernized!

Recently, there has been an organization called the Sino-US Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group, which is currently conducting in-depth inspections in the Chinese interior. The task of this group is to study and design technical reforms for China's agriculture. The principle of technical reform is to make Chinese agriculture scientific: to make cultivation tools and methods scientific, to make seed and fertilizer improvement scientific, and to make flood, disaster, and insect prevention equipment and systems scientific. "Scientific" is just an abstract term; in concrete methods, it means applying machinery and instruments. Ninety-nine percent of agricultural workers are ignorant farmers, so to complete China's agricultural reform and make China's agriculture strive for science, we must simultaneously find ways to change China's rural life.

There are many aspects to changing China's rural life, such as the development of the rural economy, the popularization of farmers' knowledge, and the improvement of farmers' lives. Although there are many aspects, we must have a principle. By grasping this principle, we can achieve our ideals.

We believe that the most important way to change rural life in China is to bring farmers' lives into contact with "machines." We must first bring about a fundamental change in the lives of farmers before we can enable them to coordinate and apply modern science. However, bringing Chinese farmers closer to machines in their lives and creating a new kind of change cannot be achieved through words or theories. Propaganda through words and theories is too empty and abstract. On the one hand, it cannot arouse farmers' interest and produce practical results. On the other hand, it takes too long and is not economical. In today's urgent need for reform, it is difficult to wait. We believe that concrete "machines" must be inserted into the actual lives of farmers, allowing them to be close to "machines" in their daily lives, which will naturally change their ability to live and their concepts of life.

We believe that the best and most effective way to bring farmers' lives closer to "machines" is to start with the development of rural transportation. We should take advantage of the opportunity of the United Nations to transport relief agricultural materials to China and demand the supply of mechanical tools for developing rural transportation as soon as possible. At present, rural transportation in China is still in a primitive stage, with little difference from the Middle Ages. Land transportation is still by foot or sedan chair, and water transportation is still mainly by folk boats with oars, sculls, poles, and sails. One can only travel seventy or eighty miles or one hundred miles in a day. The waste of time and manpower is appalling! This stagnation of folk transportation tools in the primitive stage can also be said to be a major reason why Chinese society has not been able to progress in recent decades. If there were highways between cities, towns, and villages in China that could accommodate vehicles, and waterways that had steamships for transportation, and the government promoted and manufactured bicycles and the simplest motorized freight vehicles, and manufactured and supplied the simplest motors to be installed on the sterns of folk boats, so that the journey that originally took ten hours could be reached in three or four hours, then the vitality of rural areas and farmers could be greatly enhanced. On the one hand, the implementation of government orders, the spread of culture, and the popularization of knowledge will surely achieve great results; on the other hand, because the transportation between cities, towns, and villages is shortened and facilitated, it will also greatly stabilize social order and develop the rural economy, so that various rural side businesses such as vegetables, fruits, poultry, eggs, etc., will be greatly prospered because they are profitable. If the rural economy can be circulated and restored, it can indirectly improve the lives of farmers and raise their cultural standards.

The fundamental spirit of modern science is to seek to use the least amount of time and manpower to achieve the maximum effect. It is impossible to preach scientific theories to farmers. If the actual lives of farmers can come into contact with "machines," it will naturally change their concepts of life. On the one hand, rural transportation is convenient, and on the other hand, agricultural machines are introduced to the countryside as much as possible, so that cultivation work gradually becomes mechanized, and farmers' concepts of life will naturally become closer to "machines" and "science." By that time, all agricultural technology reforms will be easier to promote, easier for farmers to understand and accept.

However, this kind of reform of rural life cannot be popularized and effective unless the government promotes and presides over it with great interest and energy, with huge expenses and patience. Now the Chairman has decided to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars to promote cooperative enterprises, which is really the best thing. We believe that this kind of cooperative enterprise should first be fully implemented in rural areas. The detailed rules for its implementation still need to be studied in detail by the government. Here, we can only offer opinions on the fundamental principles.

At a time when China's economic crisis is about to turn, if we ignore the reform of rural life, ignore the reform of agricultural production, fail to bring farmers' actual lives into contact with modern science, and fail to use the cooperative system to improve the production and marketing methods of agricultural products, then all technical reforms will be difficult to achieve, and China's general industry and commerce will be like rootless duckweed, and it will be difficult to hope for prosperity, and even the political stability that China needs most will be dragged into the distant future!

### The Soviet Union Demands Joint Control of the Straits, Agrees to Sweep Through Asia; Contents of US Note to the Soviet Union Released Yesterday; The Soviet Union's Attempt to Create Two Worlds Will Inevitably Lead to War

[Compiled News from Our Newspaper] According to our newspaper's monitoring of Washington radio on the 21st, the contents of the US note to the Soviet Union regarding the issue of the Dardanelles Strait have been released today. The note opposes the Soviet proposal for joint defense of the straits by the Soviet Union and Turkey. Although the United States agrees that the relevant powers can conduct detailed negotiations on this matter, this basic position will definitely be maintained. From President Truman to the members of the cabinet, everyone unanimously feels that the Dardanelles Strait is extremely important for peace in the Near East, and they feel that the Soviet Union's request is not only about jointly controlling the straits, but is actually an attempt to control Turkey and then control all of Asia. The main points of the note are divided into three points: (1) The United States denies that the control of the straits is only a matter for the Black Sea countries; (2) The defense of the straits should be solely responsible by Turkey, and if attacked, the United Nations Security Council should come forward to deal with it; (3) The control of the Dardanelles should be placed under the United Nations. The note points out that although the United States is not a signatory to the Montreux Convention, the United States will definitely participate in any changes to the convention, because the United States feels that the cooperation of the great powers in the future and the peace of the world all depend on the resolution of this matter. The United States believes that the Soviet Union's request to control the Dardanelles is actually motivated by ulterior motives, because the fortifications of the straits alone are of no value in this era of atomic energy and air force. No navy would be so foolish as to enter this Black Sea, which is surrounded on all sides and has no way out. The Soviet Union is well aware of this, so the Soviet Union's request is actually intended to control Turkey, and then control the entire Middle East and sweep through Asia, thereby creating two worlds. This will inevitably lead to war, so the United States is determined to firmly oppose any Soviet demand for the Dardanelles Strait.

At the same time, according to a Reuters dispatch from London, the British note to the Soviet Union will also be sent out in a day or two. The content is roughly the same as the US note, and the note is currently being sent to Foreign Minister Bevin, who is now in Paris, for review, so it will be sent out later. As for Turkey itself, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Ankara, the Parliamentary Committee unanimously passed a reply to the Soviet Union, which will be sent to the Soviet chargé d'affaires in Turkey. According to reliable sources, Turkey will ultimately accept the convening of an international conference to resolve the issue of the straits, within the scope of not harming its sovereignty and independence.

### US and Yugoslav Relations: In a State of High Tension; US Plane Attacked, Washington Protests Twice; US Troops Hold Review on Italian-Yugoslav Border

[Compiled News from Our Newspaper] Relations between the United States and Yugoslavia remain in a state of high tension, with one wave subsiding and another rising. The shooting of US patrol soldiers in the Trieste US military defense zone has not yet been resolved, and the United States has submitted a note protesting the attack on a US plane by Yugoslav planes, forcing it to land in Yugoslav territory. Moreover, this type of incident has occurred three times.

According to a US Information Service dispatch from Washington, the State Department announced on the 20th that the US ambassador to Yugoslavia had been ordered to submit a note to the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry, "strongly" protesting the attack on August 9 by a Yugoslav fighter plane on a US C-47 aircraft forced to fly over Yugoslav airspace due to bad weather. The note reiterated the demand for the immediate release of the passengers and crew on the plane.

Regarding this matter, the Yugoslav government has given a reply that is superficially gentle but actually tough.

At the same time, according to a Reuters dispatch from Trieste, US General Lee John, the Supreme Deputy Commander of the Allied Forces in the Mediterranean region, inspected the 14th Infantry Battalion and Heavy Artillery of the US 88th Division in Venice, only eight miles from the Morgan Line, and read the President's speech to 12,000 officers and soldiers. He also said that he would soon go to the Morgan Line to inspect the outposts. The Morgan Line is the boundary line between the Allied and Yugoslav-controlled areas in the province of Venice Giulia. During the review, British and American planes also soared in the sky. Although this was scheduled earlier, it cannot be interpreted as a military demonstration by the United States against Yugoslavia, but at a time when relations between the two sides are deteriorating, this parade, which showcases its own military power, is not without its profound implications.

### Yugoslavia Suddenly Recalls Ambassador to Greece

[Reuters, Athens, 21st] Officials here declared that the Yugoslav government has recalled its ambassador to Greece. London has not yet learned the reason, but it is known that the Yugoslav representative adopted a hostile attitude when the Paris Peace Conference discussed Greek territorial claims.

### Iran is Torn and Asks the United States to Mediate

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 20th] According to official sources, Iranian Prime Minister Saed-na met with US Ambassador Alan this morning and urged him to pay attention to the fact that Iran is in a dilemma due to British activities in southern Iran and Soviet activities in the north. He does not support Soviet forces in Iran and hopes that the forces of Britain and the Soviet Union can be balanced. He hopes that the United States can actively mediate this.

### Draft Peace Treaty with Japan: It is Reported that Britain and the United States Have Drafted It; Acheson Says He Has Not Heard of It

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st, Associated Press] US Acting Secretary of State Acheson said that he doubted the truth of the report from London that British and American officials had drafted a draft peace treaty with Japan. He told reporters that he knew nothing about it, but at the same time, reliable diplomatic sources said that British and American officials were working on discussing this issue in London. So far, all discussions have been conducted in London.

### German Steel Industry Taken Over by British Occupation Forces; Krupp Factory Also Included

[Associated Press, Hanover, Germany, 20th] The British military government announced today that the entire German steel industry in the British occupation zone, including the Ruhr area, has been taken over by the British military. Among them, the Velen-esche Stahlwerke steel plant is very large, and it supplies almost half of the crude steel used in the area. The world-famous Krupp factory has already been taken over by the British.

### Polish Government Anti-Democratic; Britain and the United States Protest; Demand Guarantees for Democratic Parties

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] The United States has sent a tough note to Poland, protesting the country's government's adoption of "repressive policies hindering normal democratic political activities." According to Acting Secretary of State Acheson's announcement today, the note accused the Polish government of undermining the Polish Labor Party by "arresting personnel, inspecting news, administrative interference, and other oppressive acts," and demanded that the government provide the necessary guarantees to allow normal political freedoms before the general election in early November. At the same time, according to a London dispatch, the British government has also sent the same note to the Polish government, demanding that all democratic and anti-fascist parties be allowed to participate freely in the election. The note specifically pointed out the arrest of many important members of the Polish Peasant Party.

### Bevin Serves as Chairman of the Plenary Session of the Peace Conference; Listens to Statements from Non-Member Countries; Albania Demands Guarantees for Balkan Security; Egypt Hopes That the Separation Between Egypt and Italy Can Be Readjusted

[Compiled News from Our Newspaper] Our newspaper listened to a broadcast from Paris on the 21st: The plenary session of the Peace Conference was held today, with British Foreign Secretary Bevin serving as chairman. The agenda stipulated that Albania, Mexico, Cuba, and Egypt would present their opinions. Iran and Austria may also express their views today. The first to present their opinion at the conference was Albanian representative Hoxha, who requested that Albania be the 22nd member of the Peace Conference, and further reduced Italian armaments to guarantee peace in the Balkans, and that Italy pay Albania 350 million gold francs in compensation, equivalent to US$875 million. In his speech, Hoxha vigorously attacked Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris. It is reported that Tsaldaris has repeatedly attacked Albania at the Peace Conference. Hoxha refuted this, believing that the Greek Prime Minister used false books to slander the Albanian people. He also said that the current Greek regime deliberately used conspiracies in an attempt to disrupt peace in the Balkans. Tsaldaris completely denied the rumors from the Yugoslav side that Greece had suggested dividing Albania with Yugoslavia, but Albania ridiculed it as a fact. Hoxha strongly stated that Albania's borders should not be changed in any way.

The conference opened at 2:35 p.m. today, and the Mexican representative immediately delivered a speech. After the Mexican representative's speech, the Egyptian representative continued to speak, stating that until June 10, 1940, "we had maintained the best and closest relations with Italy. We hope to see the current separation between Egypt and Italy caused by the war readjusted and confirmed."

### Czechoslovakia Demands Hungarian Territory, Area Exceeding 40,000 Acres

According to Reuters: Czechoslovakia is requesting the Peace Conference to cede approximately 44,000 acres of Hungarian territory to Czechoslovakia, in order to expand the Slovak capital Bratislava's seaport along the Danube River. The land requested by Czechoslovakia is located on the south bank of the Danube, facing Bratislava across the river, encompassing five villages. According to the 1930 Hungarian census, these five villages have a population of approximately 7,523. Czechoslovakia is submitting this request in the form of an amendment to the draft peace treaty with Hungary, which has already been submitted to the secretariat of the Peace Conference.

[Our Newspaper's Report] In addition, the Czechoslovakian delegation has also proposed adding a clause to Article 4 of the draft peace treaty with Hungary, stating, "Czechoslovakia has the right to forcibly transfer up to 200,000 Magyar residents into Hungary, and Hungary should accommodate these residents within its territory and recognize them as Hungarian citizens." The implementation of this proposal will be aimed at establishing an agreement between Czechoslovakia and Hungary, in accordance with the agreement passed on February 27, 1946, six months after the peace treaty comes into effect.

### Italy's Proposed Memorandum Effectively Rejected

Italy submitted a memorandum to the Peace Conference requesting that the wording of the preamble to the Italian peace treaty be toned down. The Italian side believes that the preamble should not treat the country as having fought against 21 member states, but should acknowledge the achievements of the Italian partisans in overthrowing Fascism, and Italy's 18 months of joint operations against Germany. Yesterday, after a lengthy debate by the Italian Territorial and Political Committee, it was not approved. The Peace Conference further issued a warning that although defeated countries can present their opinions on the draft peace treaty, they do not have the right to participate in changing the draft peace treaty.

### United States Proposes New Clause to Resolve Trieste Issue

The nine committees handling the draft peace treaties for the five countries at the Paris Peace Conference currently have twelve amendments awaiting their consideration, but during the discussion period, the delegations of various countries are still allowed to submit amendments. According to the United Press: Yesterday, the U.S. delegation submitted a new clause to the Peace Conference regarding the Italian peace treaty issue, advocating for the establishment of the Free Territory of Trieste and the establishment of a temporary government, pending the United Nations Security Council's ability to establish a permanent regime in the region. The Brazilian delegation, on the other hand, advocated delaying the resolution of the Trieste issue for one year, during which time it would be studied by a Four-Power Special Committee. This Brazilian proposal reflects the dissatisfaction of many small countries with the artificial creation of an international zone around Trieste. In view of the constant occurrence of unfortunate incidents near Trieste, it is almost impossible to bring the issue up for open discussion in the General Assembly at present.

### China Opposes Outer Mongolia's Admission to the United Nations

[Reuters, New York, 21st] China today opposed the application of the Mongolian People's Republic for membership in the United Nations. The applications of five other countries have also not been unanimously accepted by the Credentials Committee. The Soviet Union opposes the applications of Siam, Ireland, Portugal, and Iceland, while the United States opposes the application of Albania.

### United Nations Secretariat Moves to Long Island to Office

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] The United Nations Secretariat has today completely moved from Hunter College to its new temporary headquarters at Lake Success, Long Island, and will be fully operational from tomorrow. The Security Council and other UN agencies currently located at the Henry Hudson Hotel will also be fully operational from tomorrow. However, the Security Council and other agencies there will also move to Lake Success on Long Island within days. All activities of the United Nations will be concentrated at this new temporary headquarters in the next three to five years, with the exception of the United Nations General Assembly. The General Assembly is scheduled to be held on September 23 at the former site of the World's Fair, ten miles from the Lake Success headquarters, and the United Nations Permanent Headquarters Survey Committee will submit five possible permanent headquarters sites for discussion by the General Assembly.

### Eisenhower Flies Back to Washington

[United States Information Service, Washington, 20th] U.S. Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower, who traveled to Brazil, Panama, and Mexico on official business, has flown back to Washington.

### U.S. Public Opinion Poll

Advocates Establishment of World Government to Control Armed Forces of All Nations

[United States Information Service, Washington, 20th] According to the American Institute of Public Opinion: The majority of American voters favor United Nations control of armaments. The question in the public opinion poll was: "Do you think the United Nations should be strengthened into a world government with the power to control the armed forces of all nations (including the United States)?" The number of those in favor was more than twice the number of those opposed.

### Protracted for Five Months, Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations Finally Fail, Sudan Issue is the Key

[Our Newspaper's Combined News] Anglo-Egyptian negotiations have been going on for five months, and London has repeatedly disseminated optimistic news, but the result has finally been a failure. According to a Reuters dispatch from Cairo: The Egyptian delegation has rejected the British proposal to sign a new Anglo-Egyptian treaty. If this is the case, there may be a political crisis in Egypt, as Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky Pasha had previously stated clearly that if the negotiations for a new treaty failed, he would submit his resignation, which would lead to a cabinet reshuffle.

According to a French News Agency dispatch from Cairo on the 20th: Those in charge here are not surprised by the British proposal being rejected by Egypt. The Anglo-Egyptian negotiations have been protracted for five months, and the failure of the negotiations has become a foregone conclusion since the recent British note was delivered to the Egyptian government. In the early stages of the negotiations, Britain had allowed for a complete withdrawal of troops, but was unwilling to immediately relinquish its military position in the Nile Valley and the Suez Canal Zone. The deadline for the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt has been discussed for a long time. According to Egyptian sources, an agreement could be reached on this point, so the main reason for the failure of the negotiations is not here, but rather that Britain still insists on its original stance regarding the future of Sudan and refuses to compromise. According to a Reuters dispatch from Alexandria: Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky Pasha declared that the Egyptian delegation's decision will be delivered to the British representative tomorrow, at which time it will be clear whether Egypt will propose a compromise or other demands. Sidky Pasha also told a news conference after the meeting: "There is still hope for the future, and no rash decisions have been made." The British side also does not tend to be extreme, and there is still a tendency to continue negotiations.

### Mountbatten Reassigned to New Position

[Reuters, London, 20th] An official spokesperson stated: Supreme Allied Commander Southeast Asia, Lord Mountbatten, will soon be reassigned to a new position in the Navy. He will travel to Sweden and Norway in early September and return to the country at the end of the month, and will not return to Singapore.

### Truman's Yacht Sails to Bermuda

[United Press, on President Truman's yacht in the mid-Atlantic, 21st] President Truman, having caught a cold in the rain, has abandoned his plan to cruise the coast of Maine on the yacht Williamsburg, and has set off for Bermuda today, planning to enjoy its warmth and sunshine. He is expected to arrive at his destination tomorrow.

### Opening in Cambridge

Over Two Hundred Experts Attending, Lauterpacht Elected Vice-Chairman

[Reuters, London, 20th] The International Law Conference has opened in Cambridge, with 250 legal experts from around the world attending. United Nations Secretary-General Lauterpacht was elected Vice-Chairman. British representative Lord Porter delivered a welcome address and discussed the evolution of international law, believing that the occurrence of war has strengthened national consciousness, which has inevitably delayed the unification of international law. The United Nations organization and the International Court of Justice are institutions that can help the development of international law. U.S. representative Corbett believes that the development of international public law requires each country to sacrifice part of its sovereignty for international institutions. Excessive self-esteem cannot allow countries to become partners in world order.

### Bikini Test Proves the Amazing Power of Atomic Bombs, "Button Warfare" Has Begun

— Translated by Da Chun from a United Press Special Report

Although the atomic bombs used in the Bikini test each had their own ingenious designs, some of the results were common. These results can all be called "atomic laws."

First, the impact of the atomic bomb decreases in direct proportion to the distance from the point of the explosion. Within a certain distance, the results are very brutal, but on the periphery, compared to the point of explosion, the results can be said to be very weak.

The heat at the time of the explosion, according to scientists, was 100 million degrees Fahrenheit, but within 1,000 feet, it would cool down unimaginably. On ships far from the explosion, the highest temperature was only 125 degrees, and the animals on board were not burned. The winds, which had a speed of 1,000 miles per hour, also slowly dissipated. Waves, which were expected to be up to 100 feet high, were only seven feet high when they were nearly three and a half miles away from Bikini Island.

Another point that has been proven is that none of the five bombs used this time failed to explode. These are the characteristics of atomic bombs, which have been demonstrated time and time again in New Mexico, Japan, and Bikini. More important to the world in the future is the combat power of the atomic bombs shown in these tests. (1) "Button warfare" has begun. For the first time in the history of the Navy, one person can press a button and destroy a fleet, while preventing rescuers from getting close. (2) The atomic bomb is a perfect weapon for destroying harbors.

Lieutenant General Blandy, commander of "Operation Crossroads," believes that a friendly ship can drop an atomic bomb in a crowded harbor, "like a hen laying an egg." Such a bomb can destroy shipping and flood the land three miles inland with 100 million tons of radioactive seawater.

Once people are soaked in this radioactive seawater, their skin will bleed, their hair will fall out, their white blood cells will burst, and their legs will become so weak that they will wobble when they walk. In any case, if a person is exposed to too much atomic radiation, they will die, and there is no way to cure them.

Blandy said: The Baker test clearly showed that U.S. harbors need more security arrangements. He also said: "Someone has said that the best weapon to defend against atomic bombs is a screwdriver. It is best to find it in a wooden box and disarm it before the bomb explodes." In the officers' quarters of the warships, a group of officers were discussing a fleet that could operate underwater - not like today's submarines, which only submerge when necessary - but a truly underwater vessel. The Germans almost completed this new weapon at the end of the war, and the U.S. Navy is now using the German model for testing. Perhaps the third and final Bikini test in 1947 will see a new naval weapon of the atomic age.

### Under Cross-Examination by Defense Attorneys, Puyi Loses His Composure, Stares Blankly at Questions and Cannot Answer. Our Demand for Extradition Still Has Some Twists and Turns

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th Dispatch] Puppet Emperor Puyi suddenly lost his memory this afternoon under the rigorous cross-examination of the lawyers defending the 27 major Japanese war crime suspects. Puyi answered only "I cannot remember" to ten to fifteen questions. Puyi used this kind of noncommittal answer to respond to questions related to important stages in the puppet emperor's life. He could not even remember the month he left Tianjin for Lushun Port, and forgot the date he ascended the puppet throne. The angered defense lawyers repeated the same question carefully and repeatedly, but always received the reply "I cannot remember." During the two cross-examinations, the angered lawyers requested the court's assistance in ordering the witness to answer the questions. The lawyers asked him four times, "Are you saying that you never said that?" Puyi replied four times, "I cannot remember what I said." Initially, the defense lawyers attempted to interrupt Puyi's testimony and force him to admit the chaotic state of China in 1920. Puyi replied, "He only heard that Japanese plainclothes soldiers were causing trouble everywhere in China." He refused to answer the defense's question about whether the situation in China at that time was good or bad, but said, "Good or bad is only a matter of comparison."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Regarding the extradition of Puyi, news from Tokyo indicates that there may still be some twists and turns. According to diplomatic sources, the Soviet Union had originally agreed to transport Puyi from the Soviet Union to Shenyang by plane and then hand him over to our side. To date, the original plan has not changed. The only difference is that Puyi was originally in Soviet territory, but is now in Tokyo testifying. What our side wants to extradite is not limited to Puyi alone, but also intends to extradite the people in his court.

### U.S. Bomb Experts Arrive in Sweden to Help Resolve Missile Mystery

[Reuters, Stockholm, 20th] U.S. top air combat experts General Doolittle and General Sarnoff unexpectedly arrived here at the same time today. General Doolittle is currently the Vice-Chairman of Shell Oil Company. The official explanation is that Doolittle came to Europe to inspect Shell Oil Company's European branches, while Sarnoff is the Chairman of RCA Corporation, and came to inspect the European market. The two arrived in Sweden just as mysterious bombs were repeatedly discovered in the Swedish sky. Swedish Defense Chief of Staff Colonel Kampff announced tonight that he would consult the two experts and, if necessary, provide them with the full report for their reference. General Doolittle came here from Oslo, where he met with King Haakon of Norway. Doolittle stated that he came to negotiate business, but that he was willing to use his knowledge and experience to help the Swedish authorities resolve the missile mystery. He pointed out that during the war, the origin of German aircraft could be detected in Britain, and he expressed surprise that the Swedish authorities had not yet identified the traces of the missiles. General Sarnoff also said that today radar can be used to determine the range, height, and location of the bombs. Although the operating radius of radar is only 50 to 100 miles, if radar is installed on an aircraft, the operating radius can be greatly increased, allowing pilots to detect the source of the missiles. General Sarnoff said that he is willing to help the Swedish authorities resolve this mystery.

### Congress Party Chairman Urges British Troops to Withdraw from India, Negotiations for Provisional Government Still Underway with Muslim League

[Our Newspaper's Combined News] The organization of the provisional government in India is still under discussion. According to Reuters, the Congress Party Parliamentary Committee held two meetings on the 20th, but Nehru has not yet submitted the list of cabinet members for the provisional government to Viceroy Wavell. According to news from New Delhi, it may not be submitted to the Viceroy until Thursday or Friday, and negotiations are still underway with Muslim representatives. At the same time, Nehru held a reception for reporters on the evening of the 20th and expressed the Congress Party's attitude towards the Muslim League after the Calcutta riots, saying, "I have never intended to overwhelm the Muslim League. Our policy is not to intimidate or overwhelm anyone, but only to influence them." Jinnah said that I refused to discuss the long-term peace and stability plan, and the government's attitude towards the Central Council. I can only say that Jinnah's memory is wrong. As for the responsibility of the provisional government to the Central Legislative Assembly, I have explained that the provisional government cannot practically violate the opinions of the Central Council, or request the authority of the Governor-General of India to suppress the opposition government, but can only coordinate and cooperate with the Central Council. Nehru continued, "We deeply hope that the British troops will withdraw from India as soon as possible. The sooner this is realized, the happier we will be, because we do not want to be threatened by British force." "I firmly believe that once the British troops withdraw, it will make it easier for us to address reality and reach mutually beneficial agreements. No matter what unfortunate conflicts or inability to coordinate occur at present, this situation must end one day. All of us Indians must go to the goal together and complete the independent and prosperous India."

### Japanese Coffins Distributed at a Great Discount but Still Lack Buyers

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st Dispatch] The Japanese authorities in Kamakura Prefecture recently sold wooden coffins at a low price of 50 yen each through local distribution agencies, but there were still very few buyers. The local authorities explained that the original intention was to benefit the people, but now they have suddenly discovered that jumping into the water to commit suicide and "other suicides" have not occurred as previously predicted. Most residents of the coast angrily demanded that the authorities explain the reason for entrusting the sale of coffins to the distribution agencies. The local authorities explained that this was not to promote death or encourage suicide. And 13 residents have benefited from this low-priced coffin, otherwise the market price is usually 300 yen per coffin.

### Britain Will Never Give Up Mandate over Palestine, Plans to Submit Request to United Nations Committee

[Our Newspaper's Combined News] According to the United Press from London, the British government announced on the 20th that it would request the United Nations Trusteeship Council next month to appoint Britain to exclusively administer Palestine. According to reliable sources, this step is necessary because since the dissolution of the League of Nations, the League's mandate given to Britain over Palestine no longer exists, and Britain certainly does not want to give up this mandate. However, according to the United Press, a spokesperson for the Colonial Office stated that there would be no decision on Britain's future policy on Palestine until the British-Jewish-Arab round table conference opens at the beginning of next month. After the meeting, the British proposal can be sent to the United Nations Trusteeship Council for review.

### Acheson's Proposal Rejected on Whether to Control Japan

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st Dispatch] The Allied Council for Japan this morning voted down, by a majority vote, Chairman Acheson's proposal at a special meeting last week to invite the other seven countries that participated in the Pacific War to send representatives to informally attend the meetings of the Four-Power Council for Japan to discuss the issue of the occupation of Japan.

### U.S. Fleet to Participate in Mediterranean Exercise, Diplomacy Relies on Force as Backup

[French News Agency, Washington, 21st] The Department of the Navy announced today: British and American fleets will soon conduct joint exercises in the Mediterranean. The U.S. fleet participating includes three cruisers, one aircraft carrier, and one destroyer. The aircraft carrier will be the 45,000-ton Roosevelt.

[United Press, Washington, 21st] From Trieste to the Black Sea, U.S.-Soviet relations are becoming increasingly tense. The U.S. Department of the Navy has now announced that two senior naval generals have departed for Europe for a "routine inspection," and the Mediterranean region is also within the scope of the inspection. The two generals are Admiral Mitscher, acting commander of the Atlantic Fleet, and Vice Admiral Sherman, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. Regardless of their purpose in going to Europe, the fact that U.S. ships will conduct exercises in the Mediterranean can ultimately demonstrate the strength of the U.S. Navy as a backup for U.S. diplomatic claims.

### The Port of Trieste in a State of Semi-War

— Special Compilation by Our Newspaper Editorial Office

The Trieste issue, one of the major international disputes, has been argued over for many years and remains unresolved. At the last meeting of the four foreign ministers, it became the focus of contention again. The United States and the Soviet Union have held daily discussions on the issue of the port's ownership without reaching a conclusion. Some believe that the success or failure of the foreign ministers' meeting can be seen as hinging on the resolution of this issue, highlighting its importance. Hereafter, we will elaborate on the historical and geographical background of the Trieste issue and its evolution for reference.

Background of the Port of Trieste

Italy and Yugoslavia, to resolve the dispute over the eastern border of the Adriatic Sea and the Fiume issue, signed the Treaty of Rapallo in November 1920. The demarcation of the southern Italian border was partly based on this treaty. Trieste, located northwest of Fiume on the north of the Istrian Peninsula, is a crucial port at the northern end of the Adriatic Sea. The Istrian Peninsula and the region north of it are almost entirely inhabited by Slavs, while Trieste is mostly inhabited by Italians, resembling an island isolated in a sea of Yugoslavs.

After World War I, the Port of Trieste was originally part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, composed of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, could not inherit the area, and it became part of Italy. At that time, the partiality of Britain and France towards Italy was primarily due to Italy's participation in the war being a major factor. The secret Treaty of London in 1915 stipulated that Trieste would be incorporated into Italy. When the Allies signed the armistice treaty with Austria-Hungary in November 1918, Italy suddenly used force to occupy the border defined in the secret Treaty of London, and even went beyond the confines of Fiume Port, which was within the secret treaty's limitations, making it difficult for Britain and France to handle. The actions of the special forces organized by the fervent Italian poet D'Annunzio are still fresh in our memory. Italy's purpose in occupying the Port of Trieste was to gain control of the Adriatic Sea, preventing the Yugoslav navy from ever expanding. At that time, Yugoslavia's power was isolated. Although it had the desire to recover the area, it lacked the strength to do so. After this war, with the support of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia's attitude towards the Trieste issue suddenly became tough. Its reasoning was that since Yugoslavia was one of the United Nations, it should also enjoy the rights enjoyed by all United Nations countries. Therefore, Yugoslav troops had the right to remain stationed in the liberated areas.

Post-War Developments

Since the end of the European War, the issue of the southern Italian border, centered on Trieste, has suddenly become serious. To contend for the territory of the Port of Trieste, the Italian and Yugoslav authorities initially engaged in mutual recriminations. Italy accused Yugoslavia of having ambitions to seize the Port of Trieste by force, while Yugoslavia argued that Yugoslav troops had the right to remain stationed in the liberated areas. Subsequently, actions were taken. In May of year 34, troops led by Yugoslav General Tito invaded Trieste. Soon after, British and American forces stationed in Italy advanced to the Yugoslav border. The Yugoslav troops withdrew from the occupied area without resistance. General Tito's wish became a bubble, but he was clearly unwilling to accept it.

Anglo-American-Yugoslav Agreement

In order to resolve the territorial dispute, Britain and the United States signed a tripartite agreement with Yugoslavia, defining the northwestern border of Yugoslavia. The area from the southern region of Trieste, north through Gorizia, with the entire Venezia Giulia, would be under the jurisdiction of General Alexander, the Supreme Commander of the United Nations forces in the Mediterranean. The area east of this border would be entirely under the rule of the Yugoslav government. At the same time, a small portion of the Yugoslav troops (approximately two thousand) would remain stationed in the area west of this border to form a joint management agency directly under the command of General Alexander, up to Villach (i.e., Carinthia) on the Austrian border, which had already been designated as the dividing line between the British and American occupied areas and Yugoslavia. However, like other international disputes, there were behind-the-scenes forces maneuvering behind the Italian-Yugoslav border dispute. Yugoslavia was backed by the Soviet Union, while Italy was supported by British and American forces. Under such circumstances, the dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia intensified.

Border Investigation Team

In late February of this year, representatives of the foreign ministers of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France held a meeting in London and formed an investigation team to go to the disputed areas between Trieste and Yugoslavia for an on-site investigation, based on ethnic and economic geographical characteristics, to demarcate a new border between southern Italy and Yugoslavia. While the four-nation border investigation team was conducting its investigation, the Italian, Yugoslav, and fascist alliances held demonstrations demanding that the investigation team hand over Trieste and all of Venezia Giulia to Yugoslavia. At the same time, the Italian National Committee, with the goal of liberating Venezia Giulia, also held demonstrations to counter the pro-Yugoslav demonstrations. On one hand, Italian troops arrived in Venezia Giulia to prevent Yugoslavia from coveting its territory. On the other hand, British cruisers arrived at the Port of Trieste to enhance its defenses. As a result, the situation on the Italian-Yugoslav border became tense again. Recently, conflicts have occurred almost daily, and the Italians in Venezia Giulia feel they can no longer live in peace. Now, the world is watching the development of the four-power foreign ministers' meeting with keen expectation, seeking to resolve the Trieste issue, where a spark is enough to start a prairie fire.

### Thrift Campaign Inaugural Meeting Held Yesterday—No Legal Coercion, Emphasis on Voluntary Spirit

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Thrift Campaign Committee held its inaugural meeting yesterday afternoon in the auditorium of the YMCA. More than 200 people attended, including Mayor Wu, Kong Xiangxi, Xu Jiyin, Yan Yaoqiu, Zhu Ping, etc. The meeting began at 3:00 PM with music. Mayor Wu served as chairman. After the formalities, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating that the key point of this thrift campaign is to avoid legal coercion and instead have all sectors voluntarily establish methods, encourage each other, and awaken all sectors. The mayor also pointed out that the prices of essential daily necessities in the city would not be affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, so the cost of living would not increase as a result. This is a good opportunity to promote production. In the future, if we can advance both increased production and thrift, it will be the most practical way to save the country.

Subsequently, Mr. Wang Guanqing reported on the preparations, stating that the committee was organized in accordance with the sixth item of the "Shanghai Municipal Thrift Campaign Implementation Outline." The preparatory committee held two meetings and decided that this thrift campaign would emphasize the voluntary spirit of the citizens. Various people's organizations would voluntarily establish thrift covenants and implement and supervise themselves. The committee would have one chairman, concurrently held by the mayor; two vice-chairmen, concurrently held by the speaker of the municipal council and the chairman of the municipal party headquarters. In addition, the municipal government has appointed 414 committee members from relevant agencies and social figures. A standing committee will also be established, composed of 25 standing committee members, and a secretary-general will be appointed.

### Kong Xiangxi's Speech: "A Rich Family's Meal, a Poor Person's Ten Years of Grain"

The mayor then invited Mr. Kong Xiangxi to deliver a speech, stating that when he was in Chongqing, he proposed the slogan "Increase Production, Economize on Consumption." After the Great War, even wealthy countries like Britain and the United States have been vigorously promoting thrift. Clothing and food are much worse than before. However, this kind of restriction is not due to government laws but to the self-restraint of the people. Our country upholds the teaching of "abandoning life to take righteousness." Knowing that weapons training is far inferior to others, we still bravely fought the war, arousing international admiration and becoming one of the five powers. However, since the restoration, many situations have been disappointing. Taking food and drink as an example, our country does not have enough food and relies on American assistance, while wealthy families still indulge in extreme luxury. It is truly a case of "a rich family's meal, a poor person's ten years of grain." Hunan, Henan, Shanxi and other places are filled with starving people. At this time, if we do not economize, where is our conscience, where is our morality? However, thrift is still a passive effort. To actively seek ways to build the country, we must strive to increase production so that domestic goods can be promoted throughout the country, exchange for foreign exchange, and then purchase necessary machinery and tools. Then, the slogan "Nation-Building Will Succeed" will definitely become a reality one day.

### Xu Jiyin on Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

Xu Jiyin's speech focused on thrift in the areas of clothing, food, housing, and transportation for individual citizens, stating: Clean and tidy clothes are sufficient, there is no need to strive for exquisiteness. Food should focus on hygiene. There is no need for lavish meals with meat, which can harm the stomach. For housing, one should adapt to the environment, and there is no need for luxurious mansions. For transportation, it is not necessary to always take airplanes or cars when not necessary. Sometimes walking can strengthen the body. Xu reiterated the principle of "frugality to cultivate integrity," saying that those who are diligent and thrifty in society will surely succeed, while "arrogance and extravagance" is the gateway to "licentiousness."

Subsequently, under the chairmanship of Mayor Wu, motions were discussed, regulations were passed, and Yan Huiqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Cheng Zhongxing, Xu Jiyin, Guo Yunguan, Zha Liangjian, Zhu Xuefan, Tang Tianen, Jian Qiu, Chen Tingrui, Feng Youzhen, Xi Yushu, Fu Xiaofeng, Cao Jun, Lu Ganchen, Jiang Baolian, Shao Rugan, Wu Kaixian, Xuan Tiewu, Zhang Wei, Zhao Zengjue, Gu Yuxiu, Zheng Tianmu, and Wang Guanqing were elected as 25 members of the Standing Committee. In addition, draft proposals such as demonstration cases for promoting thrifty living proposed by the New Life Movement Promotion Association and the outline of social thrift measures were all submitted to the Standing Committee for discussion. The General Assembly also decided that each guild should formulate its own thrift measures and submit them to the Standing Committee for the record.

### Wang Zhuchen's Case: Materials Were Evaded Long Ago—Reception and Investigation Team Reviewed Work Yesterday—Inspected Wang's Factory After the Meeting

[Report from Our Newspaper] The reception work investigation team held a meeting yesterday morning to review past work and revise future plans to promote the rapid progress of the investigation work. The discussion on the case of Korean Sun Tianyu planting enemy ammunition was the longest. The committee members put forward their opinions and decided to continue investigating the case. Wu Wangji, Zhang Qingzhen, and Fan Zhengbo were sent to inspect Sun's factories, residences, and warehouses on Peikai'er Road, Beidang Road, and Seymour Road at 4:00 PM on the same afternoon, together with representatives from the Ministry of Economic Affairs' special commissioner's office and the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau. However, due to Fan's committee member having another important matter, only the automobile repair factory in Wang Zhuchen's case at No. 10 Beihai Ning Road was inspected for a week. The investigative inspection of Sun's case is scheduled to take place this morning. According to Wu's committee member who returned from the inspection: The enemy and puppet materials concealed by Zhuchen were evaded long ago, and the German consultant technicians who had an extremely important relationship in the case were also missing. Only the materials in Sun's case were sealed up and there were records, which was different from Wang's case. Furthermore, it is learned that among the 89 receiving units in the city, 11 units have not yet submitted reports. The investigation team has sent letters to each unit, requesting submission within three days of receiving the letter. It is also heard that the reports sent by the receiving agencies to the group have been reviewed by the secretariat and various committee members. Only the report of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau is still being reviewed because the scope is too broad and the records are more cumbersome.

### Deputy Director of the Puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, Su Chengde, Case Concluded Pending Judgment—Mao Jiafu and Jin Shounan Sentenced to Two Years and Six Months

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mao Jiafu, the procurement director of the Xingtai Grain Bank affiliated to the Enemy Army Management Mitsubishi Trading Company, purchased food for the enemy. Jin Shounan, the assistant manager and chief accountant of the Puppet Litai Commercial Savings Bank, disrupted finance and harmed people's livelihood. Yesterday, the High Court Gu sentenced them to two years and six months of imprisonment, deprived them of public rights for two years, and confiscated all property except for the necessary living expenses for family members.

Su Chengde, who successively served as the director of the Fourth Hall of the Puppet Special Agent Headquarters, the district chief of the Nanjing District, the puppet Central Supervisory Committee member, the deputy director of the Puppet Qingxiang Bureau, and the deputy director of the Puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, destroyed our underground work and persecuted former city party committee member Zhang Xiaotong, etc. His crimes are clear. The case was concluded yesterday by the High Court, and the judgment is scheduled to be announced on the 28th of this month.

### Dai Yingfu to be Sentenced on the 28th—Fang Jintang Filed a Public Prosecution

Also, Dai Yingtian, the puppet Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau chief, is scheduled to be sentenced on the 28th.

Fang Jintang filed a public prosecution with the High Procuratorate Office on suspicion of being a traitor. In addition, Zhang Sengeng, etc., were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence.

### Zhou Bangjun Retried Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhou Bangjun, the general manager of Shanghai Chinese and Western Pharmacy, was retried by the High Court yesterday. Zhou wore a dark blue silk robe, yellow leather shoes, and glasses, holding a black bone gold-faced folding fan, and his attitude was calm. He smiled and answered the court's questions, saying: Regarding the "Sino-Japanese Cultural Association," he was hired as an honorary director but did not participate in internal work or meetings, so he was not familiar with the purpose and work, etc. Chen Ya'fu was the secretary-general of the "Anti-British and American Association." At that time, he was forced to join and did not dare to refuse due to the environment. During that time, he only went to the International Hotel once to attend a dinner party. He did not participate in the puppet people's assembly convened by the association at the Racecourse. As for participating in the Baojia organization, it was because the area around Nanjing Road was sealed off by the enemy due to the bombing incident, and the residents were cut off from food. At that time, the defendant lived upstairs in the Chinese and Western Pharmacy and was also in the affected area. Later, someone initiated the organization of Baojia, and idle people participated. The purpose was only to lift the blockade and provide relief to the starving people. The chief director of the Baojia Preparatory Office was Yuan Ludeng, and the deputy directors were Yu Hualong and the defendant. Later, the association was reorganized and directly affiliated with the Public Works Department. The committee members included British, American, Japanese, and Chinese people. He did not participate. Regarding introducing Wang Yongkang to Chu Minyi to serve as puppet officials, he only learned about it after seeing the indictment. At that time, Chu Minyi wanted to build the Sanzang Memorial Tower in Nanjing and raise funds, and talked to the defendant about this matter. Because Wang Yongkang believed in Buddhism, he introduced Wang to Chu. He did not know how Wang served as a puppet official later. As for the matter of providing the enemy with automobiles and Western medicines, the enemy troops came to the factory and took them away themselves, which was forced and not voluntary. Subsequently, Wang Yongkang and Yu Hualong were brought from prison for questioning, and another witness, Bi Gaokui, was summoned but did not arrive. The court ordered the case to be retried at a later date.

### Wu Yonghua and Others Rescheduled for Questioning

On the same day, multiple cases were also investigated: (1) Wu Yonghua, the chairman of the puppet Automobile Dismantling and Parts Industry Association, purchased hardware and automobile engines for the enemy for the assembly of suicide boats. (2) Jian Xun, the leader of the water patrol team of the puppet Wu County Police Bureau, harmed the local area. After the victory, when he was arrested and escorted to Shanghai, he took a gun and shot the escorts during the journey in an attempt to escape, but was eventually captured. (3) Zhang Jinzhang, the vice chairman of the puppet Gaoqiao Maintenance Association, harmed the local area. (4) Xue Youwen and Hu Chengsem, detectives from the puppet Shanghai Putuo Road Police Station, arrested our underground workers. They were previously sentenced by the High Court and are now returned for retrial, but the summoned witnesses did not appear in court yesterday. All of the above cases were rescheduled for questioning.

### Direct Tax Bureau Decides to Implement Three Measures to Support Industry and Commerce and Stabilize Prices

After the central government announced the news of adjusting exchange rates to stabilize prices, all sectors of the city have been studying the implementation of this policy. The reporter visited the director of the city's direct tax bureau yesterday to ask for his opinion. It is said that the government's adjustment of exchange rates and support for the development of industry and commerce is an established policy. Direct tax is closely related to the development of industry and commerce, and the cultivation of tax sources must be based on solid foundations. Upon learning of the implementation of the policy of adjusting exchange rates, I immediately decided on three measures and strictly ordered my subordinates to handle them: First, the investigation, reporting, and taxation of this tax has always been to strive for fairness and reasonableness, and absolutely no harassment is allowed. The working attitude of the investigators must be gentle and sincere, and they must be kind and amiable to the merchants, and provide good explanations. They must take the position of the tax and fulfill their responsibilities of safeguarding. Second, strictly prevent speculation and profiteering, and raising prices from the middle. With this exchange rate release, unscrupulous merchants will inevitably take the opportunity to stir up trouble. The bureau has secretly ordered attention and will take effective measures to stop it in accordance with the tax law. Third, respond to the city government's crackdown on vendors. Recently, there has been a proliferation of vendors in the city, which has had a significant impact on the business of legitimate shops and firms. The bureau had planned to crack down on them for a long time. Now that the city government has decided on measures, the bureau has strictly ordered the area offices and collection offices to pay close attention to handling them in accordance with the tax law. In short, I will take the position of direct tax to effectively safeguard the development of industry and commerce and strive to stabilize prices in the city.

### Houcheng and Other Six Stores Suspended from Registration Certificates for Selling Black Market Sugar Privately

The amount of Taiwan sugar distributed by the Social Affairs Bureau every week has increased steadily since the sixth phase. The registration procedures for the eleventh phase of sugar distribution have already been completed since yesterday, but the black market for sugar is still rampant. It is clear that unscrupulous merchants are using the distributed sugar to engage in private black market transactions. It is learned that the bureau has been dispatching cadres to conduct secret investigations in all directions for days. It has now been found that Houcheng (No. 25 Jiaxing Street), Zhongxing (No. 16 Sijing Road), Kangle (No. 272 Huanghe Road), Huifeng (No. 7 Mianyang Lane, Lima Road), Tianming (No. 4, Ji'an Lane, Luxiangyuan Road), and Guangtai (No. 3, Fumei Lane, Guangqi Road) all have private black market transactions. After verifying the facts, the bureau immediately revoked their business registration certificates. It also continues to send personnel to conduct secret investigations in order to thoroughly eliminate the black market for sugar. According to the person in charge of the bureau: This punishment is still lenient. If the above-mentioned situation is discovered again in the future, severe punishment will be given. It is also hoped that citizens will assist the bureau in cracking down on the black market at any time.

### A Large-Scale Theft Organization Was Cracked Down—More Than 10 Million Yuan Worth of Stolen Goods Were Pulled Out—More Than Ten Thieves Were Arrested, All of Whom Were Young Students

[Report from Our Newspaper] The director and deputy director of the Changshu Branch Bureau received a tip a few days ago that a large-scale theft organization was operating in their jurisdiction. They urgently ordered Section Chief Wang to supervise the section members and police chief Zhang Xiang to investigate with Wang, Ding Fanglong, Hao Tingjie, and Zhang Huiyu. On the 19th, Jiang Dongping, the leader of the giant theft gang, was arrested near Fuxing Middle Road. After being interrogated at the bureau, they learned from his confession the residences of his accomplices. More than ten accomplices, Zhou Zhugeng, Yan Xiang, Shen Feng'e, etc., were successively arrested, all of whom were young students. More than 10 million yuan worth of stolen goods, including suits, radios, watches, bicycles, and electric clocks, were recovered one after another. The police station is now hoping that all owners who have lost property will come to claim them.

### Postage Increase Inevitable—How Much Increase Has Not Been Determined

[Report from Our Newspaper] The reporter recently visited Wang Yuguang, the postal agent of the city post office. According to him, the current postage is only 400 times higher than before the war, which is far from the multiple of general commodity prices. Therefore, ordinary letters are also sent as express letters or registered mail, which is a waste of manpower and resources. Therefore, increasing postage is necessary and inevitable. However, postal service is a national matter, and the increase must be consistent. The Ministry of Transportation has made this proposal, but when it will be implemented and to what extent the increase will be, the bureau has not heard of it. The rumors of nine times and five times are all speculation.

Shanghai Restaurants' Commissioned Donations

[Our Newspaper's Report] The "Miss Shanghai" election event the night before last sold 894 tickets, generating an income of 17,888,000 yuan. However, because of the complimentary cold drinks included with the tickets, New Celestial Forest charged 5,000 yuan per guest (including donation), the total expenses for the evening, if offset against the ticket income, may not be enough. Furthermore, although only 890 tickets were sold, the actual number of attendees was nearly 3,000, which added some additional expenses. The neighboring Shanghai Restaurant benefited greatly from the event that evening and has apparently volunteered a portion of their revenue to the refugee association, which may provide some small compensation. In total, the revenue from the "Miss Shanghai" competition is expected to be in the neighborhood of 200 million yuan.

### China's Papermaking Industry - Conditions Far From Sufficient - Papermaking Expert Ruan Chuanzhe - Completes Inspection and Returns to the US Tomorrow

Mr. Ruan Chuanzhe, a papermaking expert and current Vice Chairman of the American Fitzburg Paper Company, returned to China from the United States at the invitation of the Resource Commission to inspect the state of the domestic papermaking industry. He has now completed his work and is scheduled to fly back to the United States tomorrow. Mr. Ruan has been back in China for almost two months, having visited several paper mills in Tainan and the Northeast. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and told a Central News Agency reporter that in order to develop China's papermaking industry, it is essential to resolve the political situation, improve the economic situation, and, in particular, curb inflation. Mr. Ruan continued, saying that to develop China's papermaking industry, there is a lack of various favorable factors. For example, the lack of raw materials and the lack of organization are the main reasons. However, he believes that these obvious unfavorable factors can be overcome, and the national papermaking industry has a bright future. When asked what steps we should take to maximize the benefits of developing China's papermaking industry, Mr. Ruan strongly emphasized that training the necessary talent, establishing streamlined organizations for the paper industry, and learning and adopting the scientific methods used in the United States are all important steps. Currently, we lack well-trained talent, raw materials, and organization. We must study how to overcome these deficiencies. Mr. Ruan continued, saying that from an economic standpoint, China's papermaking industry should not head toward a competitive path. For example, manufacturing newsprint is a very unwise move because it is a highly competitive product. Canada is the leader in newsprint production. The quality of newsprint produced in that country is extremely good, and the price is very low. Even with the massive production capabilities of the United States, it is inferior to Canada in terms of newsprint manufacturing. The simple reason is that the raw materials for papermaking in the United States cannot compete with those of Canada. Mr. Ruan left Fujian Province 25 years ago to study the papermaking industry in the United States and is an outstanding papermaking engineer. He expressed hope to return to China again in the future, but he cannot determine when at this time. As for the inspection he conducted during this return to China, he has prepared a report to be submitted to the Resource Commission.

### US Pilot Murder Case - Yamaguchi Testifies - Claims Trial Was Fair on the Day

[Our Newspaper's Report] The US military court re-examined the case of the former Japanese occupation army in Hong Kong murdering US pilot Major Hok the day before. Yesterday's court proceedings consisted of testimony and arguments favorable to the defendant.

Defendant Captain Kyoichi Yamaguchi, one of the judges of the Japanese military court at the time, claimed as a witness that the trial of Hok on that day was fair, and the death sentence was in accordance with Japanese law. He was a member of the 23rd Army Military Law Department and was dispatched from Guangzhou to Hong Kong to participate in the court because the other two judges were purely military personnel, so he was responsible for most of the interrogation. At that time, Hok admitted to destroying a 30-ton steamship but requested leniency on the grounds that he was nervous due to the initial bombing of Hong Kong. The evidence provided in court at the time was sufficient, including reports from the military police and the Military Law Department of the Army Headquarters. In addition, the Tokyo Operations Department also had an order authorizing the trial of the case. Yamaguchi then testified for another defendant, Captain Hiroko Asakawa, stating that although Asakawa was responsible for prosecuting Hok, her position was not as a prosecutor because the head of the judiciary of the Hong Kong military government at the time, Major Saboru Shii (who is said to have passed away), was transferred to North China before the trial. Therefore, Asakawa was only ordered to act as an agent.

After Yamaguchi finished testifying, the defendant's appointed defense attorney, Major Boding, defended the defendants in the case, stating that according to Japanese military law, Hok's trial was completely fair, and the Emergency Measures for Flight Crews Regulations promulgated by the Japanese government at the time only stipulated the death penalty. The first defendant, Lieutenant General Hisaichi Tanaka, although the commander of the 23rd Army and Governor of Hong Kong, did not have the power to reduce the sentence. His chief of staff, Major General Harunami Fukuchi, ordered the trial of the case in accordance with Japanese law and had an authorization letter from Major Saboru Shii to prove it. As for Captain Hiroko Asakawa, she did not participate in the preparation before the prosecution of the case. She was only designated as an acting prosecutor and was actually a forced "victim."

### Mongolian Banner Delegation Arrives in Shanghai from Beijing for Sightseeing Yesterday; Plans a Ten-Day Stay to Visit Factories and Schools

A delegation of eight members from the Anti-Japanese Mongolian Banner Victory Celebration Homecoming Delegation arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning, accompanied by Zhang Shenwei, acting director of the Mongolian Affairs Office of the Mongolian Banner Committee. The delegation includes Rongxiang (Mongolian Banner Pacification Commissioner), Bawenjun (Standing Committee Member and Secretary-General of the Suiyuan-Mongolian Political Council), Hufengshan (Member of the Suiyuan-Mongolian Political Council and General Manager of the Zhenghuang Banner), Renbingjun (Director of the Education Department of the Suiyuan-Mongolian Political Council), Xiongnuo (Security Commander of the Urad Middle Banner), Kangjimin (Member of the Suiyuan-Mongolian Political Council), Buwenrui (President of the Mongolian Youth Aspiration Society), and Jia Wenhua (Representative of the Yikezhao League). They plan to visit factories and schools and stay for about ten days before returning to Suiyuan via Beijing and Ping. The delegation departed from Guisui on June 25th and arrived in Beijing on June 28th. On July 8th, they met with Chairman Chiang, reporting on the current situation of the Mongolian Banner. During their stay in Beijing for over a month, they visited administrative heads of various agencies to exchange views on border affairs. According to Mr. Rongxiang, a member of the delegation, to reporters yesterday:

Delegation's Mission to Beijing

The main mission of this delegation to Beijing is to request the central government to implement the resolutions related to border regions from the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee. Regarding political matters, the Suiyuan-Mongolian Banner currently has eighteen banners, including four banners in eastern Suiyuan, six banners in the Ulanqab League, seven banners in the Yikezhao League, and one banner in the Tumet Banner (special banner). Each banner has representatives in the delegation. The banners are on par with provinces and counties. The seals of the banner governments are all issued by the central government and directly under the central government's command. However, to date, the administrative powers between the banners and provinces/counties have not been thoroughly demarcated. This delegation hopes that the central government will guarantee the inherent administrative powers of the Mongolian Banners in order to facilitate the advancement of various construction projects. Regarding economic matters, the Mongolian Banner's specialties include cattle, sheep, horses, coal, iron, table salt, caustic soda, etc., many of which have not yet been developed and utilized. Agricultural crops are scarce due to the arid environment. Millet is slightly produced south of the Yin Mountains, while oats, rapeseed, sesame, etc., are slightly produced north of the Yin Mountains. The residents are mostly poor and unable to support themselves. It is hoped that the central government will actively supervise and promote the development of border industries to facilitate development. Regarding education and culture, there is still no university in Suiyuan. There are only five middle schools (one national, three provincial, and one private). The number of elementary schools is also limited. The current population of the Suiyuan-Mongolian Banner is over 2.5 million, and the number of schools is not sufficient. It is hoped that the central government will actively expand to meet the goal of universal education.

Communist Party Conspiracy to Disrupt

Mr. Rong also stated that since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist Party's influence has gradually extended into Inner Mongolia, plotting to disrupt. Four banners in eastern Suiyuan have been captured. Recently, Communist elements have also been found active in the eastern part of the Ulanqab League and the southwestern part of the Yikezhao League, forcing young people to go to Yan'an for training. Our Inner Mongolian compatriots have limited knowledge, speak different languages, and lack political concepts. Suddenly being "indoctrinated" by these people has a significant impact, and the future is concerning. Mr. Rong then said with emotion: "After the country's victory, the Communist Party is making such a ruckus, and our Inner Mongolian compatriots really feel a headache. Before the realization of peace and unification in the country, the situation in Inner Mongolia is even more worthy of attention. Therefore, we hope that the central government can implement the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session on border affairs as soon as possible to boost morale. This time in Beijing, the Mongolian government has expressed its adoption of our suggestions, which is deeply gratifying." When asked by reporters who succeeded Shaba Wang as the leader of the eighteen leagues of the Suiyuan-Mongolian Banner after his death, he replied: The educational administrative organ of the Suiyuan-Mongolian Banner is the Suiyuan-Mongolian Political Council. The chairman of the council was concurrently held by Shaba Wang, the leader of the Yikezhao League. After Shaba Wang's death, all positions were succeeded by Tu, the general manager of the Yikezhao League County Prince Banner. In addition to the eight people who came to Shanghai, Yin Wanlin (Mongolian representative of the Youth League) is currently attending a summer camp in Lushan for training, and Bawenjiergele (representative of the Zhasake Banner) is staying in Beijing for treatment due to acclimatization and is preparing to return to Suiyuan first. After arriving in Shanghai, the delegation stayed at the Greater China Hotel. After visiting Mayor Wu, they began to visit major factories and schools in the city.

### North China Situation Deteriorates; Relief Administration Suspends Transportation of Supplies; Cargo Ships Diverted to Hong Kong; Strengthening Internal Transportation in South China

According to the Relief Administration, in the past week, military conflicts have expanded in various regions, and relief work has become increasingly difficult. In particular, the transportation situation is the most worrying. Due to the deterioration of the situation in North China, supplies are difficult to distribute. The Relief Administration has temporarily suspended the transportation of supplies to North China. Now the Longhai Railway has been cut off again, and the east-west transportation of materials is impossible again. The amount of supplies transported by the Relief Administration from Shanghai to various regions in the past week has decreased sharply by 60% compared to the previous week, which is enough to reflect the seriousness of the current situation and the deterioration of the transportation situation. In the previous week, the Relief Administration transported 14,853 tons of supplies from Shanghai to other provinces. This week (from the 9th to the 16th of this month) it suddenly decreased to 5,910 tons. This week's figure is the smallest weekly figure in the history of the Relief Administration. To adapt to the current situation, the Relief Administration has ordered some cargo ships to be diverted to Hong Kong to strengthen internal transportation in the south. In addition, some cargo ships only pass through Shanghai and go directly to Hankou.

### China Textile Workers Incite Labor Strikes; Court Heard the Case Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] The court heard a suspected labor strike incitement case yesterday morning. Chen Qingyou, Jiang Zhijian, Gu Xiaomei (female), and Jin Keming (at large), workers of the Shanghai Second Textile Factory of China Textile Construction Company, negotiated with the factory on the morning of June 7th because the workers felt they were at a disadvantage when the factory paid wages according to the cost of living index for May and June. The factory immediately agreed to adjust the wages. However, Chen and others took the opportunity to launch a labor strike. At noon, when the workers were leaving the workshop for lunch, they guarded the entrances of each workshop and prevented the workers from re-entering to work. After persuasion by the person in charge of the union, work resumed. However, Chen and others threatened that if the factory deducted their wages for absenteeism in accordance with the factory regulations when paying wages on the 15th, they would prevent other workers from going to work. On the afternoon of June 15th, Chen and others forcibly prevented workers from working. The Social Bureau learned of this and reported it to the police station, which arrested Chen, Jiang, and Gu. Jin Keming escaped and has not been apprehended. The three were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office, which prosecuted them on suspicion of inciting labor strikes. Yesterday, the defendants denied inciting labor strikes in court, claiming that all the workers voluntarily went on strike. The court ordered the case to be adjourned for further hearing.

### Ministry of Education Issues New Measures for Student Public Funding; Public Funding Only Available to Students of National Schools; Impoverished Freshmen at Universities May Apply for Relief Funds According to Regulations

[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing] The Ministry of Education has recently issued new measures for student public funding. Here are the main points: (1) University students who had already received full Category A public funding or supplementary Category B public funding from the Ministry of Education according to the old regulations during the war can continue to receive it until graduation. Students of national middle schools who stayed in the rear and have not yet returned can also enjoy this treatment. However, these two are limited to national schools only. The quota shall not exceed 40% of the total number of students in each school. This does not apply to middle schools that have been transferred to the education departments of various provinces. (2) Newly admitted freshmen to national universities whose families are in areas not yet recovered by the government can apply for relief funds. The Ministry of Education will approve them as soon as possible, but it is stipulated that it shall not exceed 30% of the total number of students in the school. Those who receive this relief fund must prove that they are indeed from impoverished families and have excellent academic performance. The above system was originally established during the war to relieve students in occupied areas and was a form of loan. Now, it is not necessary to repay it.

### Cultural Attaché to be Stationed in Location of Our Embassy

### Ministry of Education Hires Experts to Grade Public and Private Student Exam Papers; Public Funding Acceptance Standards Are Very Strict; Grading Results Will Be Announced in October

[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing] The Ministry of Education's 35th Public and Private Study Abroad Examination was held simultaneously in nine districts including Nanjing, Chongqing, Peiping, Shanghai, Xi'an, Hankou, Guangzhou, Kunming, and Chengdu at the end of July. Currently, the exam papers from each district have been transported to Beijing. The Study Abroad Examination Committee of the Ministry of Education is hiring domestic scholars and experts to grade the exam papers. As for the acceptance standards, it is rumored that the committee has tentatively set the average score for public funding at 50 points and the average score for private funding at 40 points, with an English score of 30 points or more. The public funding standard is very strict, and there will be no abuse of vacancies. However, the above acceptance standards must be finally decided after discussion by each committee. The examination results were originally scheduled to be announced in early September of this year. However, due to the large number of exam papers and the time required for grading, it is feared that the announcement will be delayed until October. The number of applicants and the number of actual attendees for public and private study abroad students in each district across the country are as follows:

### Screening Measures for Fake High School Graduates

Instruction issued by the Ministry of Education

[Nanjing] The Ministry of Education recently issued an instruction to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities in the former occupied areas, instructing the screening measures for fake high school graduates. The original text is as follows: "Those fake high school graduates who are already studying in temporary university preparatory classes are allowed to be exempted from the high school graduate screening because they have already participated in the screening for students above specialized schools. Also, fake high school graduates who have completed their studies in university preparatory classes and have passed the grades can have their transcripts filled out by the class, together with their fake high school graduation certificates, and sent to the department or bureau. After passing the examination, it can be used as the screening examination, and a certificate will be issued by the bureau."

### Another Gain from the National Education Summer Camp; Exhibition of Standard Specimens and Model Teaching Aids; New China Manufacturing Factory Designated to Assist in Holding the Exhibition

[Special Report by this newspaper] The National Education Summer Camp hosted by the Shanghai Education Bureau, which gathers municipal principals, will end in three days. The short two-week course has provided the trainees with a lot of academic benefits. In these last three days, there is also a more meaningful program, which is the specimen and model teaching aid exhibition that the reporter is now going to describe. It is organized by Director Zhu and Principal Qian of Yangzheng, and the products of the New China Scientific Instrument Manufacturing Factory are designated as the exhibits of the conference.

In the historical period when we stepped into the atomic age, it further proves the theory of scientific development. Therefore, elementary education should focus on natural science from the beginning. Natural science first emphasizes object teaching, and the urgent need for specimens, models, and instruments of animals, plants, and minerals to enable teachers to achieve twice the result with half the effort is undoubtedly certain. The National Education Summer Camp, in view of this, although the time is tight, still spares no effort to make the conference affairs of the exhibition a greater success, and also makes the camp training add more generous results.

The reporter made a special visit to Mr. Zhou Shichen, the manager of the New China factory that assisted in organizing the exhibition. He said that the content can be roughly divided into four parts, namely (1) the specimen department, including the morphology of animals, plants, and minerals, (2) the model department, mostly local physiological institutions of the human body, (3) the instrument department, various teaching materials and physical science application experiments, and (4) various aircraft models that the factory is currently trial-producing. Mr. Zhou also told the reporter: "Recently, because the cost has soared, and not only are skilled workers highly paid, but they are also not easy to hire. Therefore, many of the original local manufacturers in this city now have no goods on the market. Therefore, our factory is working day and night, almost unable to cope. Therefore, the exhibits that will be on display this time cannot be complete. Please forgive the attendees for this point."

The venue is in the Fuxing Middle School at the end of North Sichuan Road in this city. It is open to the public from 11:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day. I think that every elementary and middle school natural science teacher, even though it is very hot and the road is far, has to take this trip in order to add some information for his own teaching.

I hope that more of this kind of meaningful gathering will be held!

### How to Implement a Two-Shift System?

— Ma Jingxuan

Recently, the total population of Shanghai is estimated to be about five million people. According to the 10% ratio plan, there should be 500,000 school-age children. The actual number of children enrolled in school is 300,000, accounting for only 60% of the total. There are still 200,000 children who have not been able to attend school. If we want to implement universal education, the current primary schools in Shanghai must add at least 400 schools, 3,500 classes, and more than 5,000 teachers to accommodate these 200,000 newly enrolled children. I remember on August 10th, when Mayor Wu gathered with the local press for a symposium, he talked about education issues. Mayor Wu said, "If we want to add schools, the municipal government's finances are extremely difficult. If we were to implement a two-shift system, it might be easier to achieve."

What is a two-shift system? Mayor Wu said: "Divide the school's students into morning and afternoon shifts, taking turns attending classes." This means that one classroom must accommodate two classes of children. For example, Class A children attend school in the morning, and Class B children attend school in the afternoon. Sometimes, when other classrooms are available, they can also attend school all day. This is called a two-shift system.

The advantages of implementing a two-shift system: (1) One classroom can accommodate two classes of children. (2) The number of children in each class can be evenly distributed, without being too many or too few. (3) One class studies at school, and the other works at home, which can integrate education with life. (4) Fully utilize teaching venues and vacant classrooms, eliminating the drawback of one class occupying one classroom exclusively. (5) Two classes share the same equipment, which can save half of the equipment costs. How to implement a two-shift system? The following is a plan for reference when implementing it. Assume that there is a primary school with grades one to six, with a total of six classrooms, originally enrolling only six classes of children. Now, with the implementation of the two-shift system, twelve classes of children can be enrolled. Each class still attends the original teaching hours, equivalent to the teaching efficiency of the original six classes of children. However, the allocation of classrooms, the arrangement of timetables, etc., must be changed, as explained below: First, Classroom allocation: Arrange the original six classrooms into three regular classrooms (teaching Mandarin, arithmetic, and social studies), one nature study room (teaching nature, general knowledge), one workshop (teaching drawing and crafts), and one singing and dancing room (also used as a hall, teaching music, physical education, and group training). If the school has a garden, sports field, library, hall, etc., these can all be utilized as teaching venues. Second, Teacher allocation: For the entire school of twelve classes, in addition to two staff members, there are twelve grade-level teachers. Each teacher is responsible for teaching hours per week: 870 minutes for senior grades, 960 minutes for middle grades, and 1020 minutes for lower grades. Three specialized teachers, each responsible for teaching hours per week, range from 990 minutes to 1050 minutes. Group training is handled by the principal, teaching two classes together, totaling 720 minutes.

Third, Timetable arrangement: Pay attention to the following points:

1. Time allocation: Each session is 30 minutes, each break is 10 minutes, and a decision is made to change classrooms. There are six sessions every morning, from 8:30 AM to 11:50 AM. There are six sessions in the afternoon, from 1:30 PM to 4:50 PM. There are a total of twelve sessions in the morning and afternoon, with a total of 360 minutes of mathematics. The six classrooms have a total of 12,960 minutes per week.

2. Rotating Sundays: To fully utilize space and time, classes are held as usual on Sundays. However, each class takes turns having a day off from Monday to Saturday. Each teacher and staff member also takes turns having a day off. In this way, 2,160 minutes of teaching time can be added per week, resulting in a total of 15,120 minutes of teaching time.

3. Teaching hours for each subject

(A) According to the Ministry's regulations, the weekly teaching hours for each subject in each grade are as follows:

(B) Changes in weekly hours for each subject in each grade after implementing the two-shift system are as follows: Looking at the two tables above, arithmetic is increased by 90 minutes in the first grade, and the hours are the same for the second grade. Music is reduced by 60 minutes in the third grade, arithmetic is increased by 60 minutes, and crafts are increased by 30 minutes. In the fourth grade, music and physical education are each reduced by 30 minutes, and crafts are increased by 30 minutes. In the fifth and sixth grades, music is reduced by 30 minutes, and physical education is reduced by 60 minutes. In addition, English is added for 180 minutes. In addition to combining classes for the various subjects for the twelve classes, the remaining subjects must be taught in separate classes. The teaching hours shown in the table above are 16,320 minutes, while the actual number is 14,520 minutes. Compared with the Ministry's prescribed teaching hours of 15,780, there is no significant difference.

When arranging the daily timetable, the following should be noted: (1) Group training, music, and physical education for each grade are taught in combined classes and must be scheduled at the same time. (2) Each grade should schedule one session each for reading and storytelling per week. (3) The first grade should schedule one session each for arithmetic games and arithmetic stories. (4) Morning assembly for ten minutes for each grade should be scheduled on the daily timetable as usual. The purpose of implementing the two-shift system is to accommodate each child with fewer classrooms. The method of implementation is that each class attends school for half a day or a full day, taking turns attending classes, and each class still maintains the original teaching hours and curriculum each week. If the number of school-age children exceeds the number of enrolled children by more than one time, and it is not difficult to hire additional teachers, the implementation of the one-shift system is the most effective method.

The teaching methods for the two-shift system are the same as for ordinary teaching methods, and there are no special differences in the guidance aspects. The teachers in charge only need to pay attention to the following points to be able to fulfill their duties happily. 1. Guidance on family life, 2. Handling of exercise books, 3. Full utilization of libraries, factories, farms, sports grounds, and halls, 4. Maintaining order when changing classrooms, 5. Handling of lost items, 6. Preventing and stopping theft.

The two-shift system has only half the number of classrooms. If the allocation is not proper, it will become chaotic. The most important thing is that each class should have a class committee for children to rest and place their homework supplies, and there should be a class teacher to handle class affairs at any time.

Implementing the two-shift system doubles the number of enrolled children and the number of teachers. The teachers' salaries will naturally also double. It is best to pay this expense from the tuition fees, which is more convenient. Mayor Wu said: "If the increase in teachers' salaries is borne by the parents, then the expansion of the two-shift system can be achieved. As for poor students, they can be free of charge." From this point of view, the implementation of the two-shift system can be realized this semester as long as the parents support it and the teachers' salaries are available.

Now is the time for each school to recruit new students. If the number of applicants in each school exceeds the limit by more than one time, it may be advisable to admit all of them in one batch, enroll them in the corresponding grade, and try out the two-shift system. As for whether my implementation plan for the two-shift system is appropriate, please correct me!

### Q&A on Household Registration Laws and Regulations (Continued)

(II) (X) Question: What is the title of a concubine in relation to the household head's wife?

Answer: According to the provisions of Article 1124 of the Civil Code, the concubine is only the agent of the household head, and the household head is still the wife.

(II) (X) (1) Question: After the death of the husband, what should the housewife call the husband's concubine?

Answer: After the death of the husband, the wife becomes the head of the family and still calls the husband's concubine a family member.

(II) (X) (2): After the implementation of the Civil Code, a son was born to a concubine taken by A. Now that A has died, his wife is old and weak and has no other descendants, so she makes the son born to his concubine the head of the family. What should he call his father's wife or his father's other concubines, and the concubine from whom he was born?

Answer: After A's death, if his wife adopts the son born to his concubine as his heir, then according to Article 1072 of the Civil Code, he should be the adopted son of A's wife. Before the adoptive relationship is terminated, there is no mother-son relationship with his biological mother. On the household registration book, A's wife should be regarded as his mother, and the concubine of the cohabiting biological mother and the father's other concubines should be regarded as family members.

(II) (X) (3) Question: A's wife is physically disabled, and both husband and wife are unable to maintain their livelihood. Therefore, A remarries into another family, and his wife is also willing to live together permanently. However, that family has always regarded the woman who remarries as the head of the family, living in peace without any difference. How should their household registration be filled out?

Answer: If A remarries into another family, and his original wife is willing to live together permanently, she can be filled in as "family member."

(II) (X) (4) Question: A child born out of wedlock, with no father to trace, follows the mother's surname and eats at the mother's home. What is the title of the child to the mother's parents?

Answer: A child born out of wedlock, with no father to trace, follows the mother's surname and eats at the mother's home. According to the provisions of Article 1065, paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, he is still the maternal grandparents to his mother's parents.

### Under Close Attention of the Authorities: Major Commodity Prices Gradually Stabilizing; Those Who Arbitrarily Raise Prices Without Relation to Foreign Exchange Will Be Instructed by Responsible Agencies to Restore Original Prices

[This Newspaper News] Since the adjustment of the exchange rate, the financial and commodity markets in this city once experienced slight fluctuations. After the authorities understood the actual situation and patiently explained it, the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce also convened the responsible persons of various trade associations to talk, encouraging them to assist in government orders and stabilize prices. In recent days, special phenomena have gradually disappeared, especially food, which is the standard for prices. Although it has little to do with foreign exchange, it is inevitable that general merchants and civilians will be affected and find excuses. Therefore, the authorities have paid special attention to this, and in addition to the Social Affairs Bureau conducting inspections, a large amount of foreign rice is sold off every day in order to stabilize people's hearts. At the same time, the Central Bank is also doing its best to maintain the financial market. The current black market price has gradually reached a stable stage. Although the black market for yarn and cloth is still profitable, textile mills still sell at the original price every day, giving a good impression to the general public. If a large amount of rationing can be further implemented, so that buyers do not feel disappointed, then the effectiveness of state-owned enterprises can be fully demonstrated. In addition, imported goods related to foreign exchange, such as hardware, western pine, western medicine, and dyes, are inevitable due to the increase in costs due to the lengthening of foreign exchange, but the goods currently sold in the market are not purchased at the new exchange rate. It is worth studying whether the price should be increased according to the market. In fact, this kind of business has also been in a state of having a market but no sales for several days, and although prices are soaring, there are very few buyers.

### Gold Market Sentiment Gradually Stabilizing; US Dollar Rising Significantly

The black market situation gradually calmed down, and buyers retreated knowing it was difficult. The Central Bank's control has not relaxed slightly, and the situation is still under mediation. Therefore, the market opened slightly lower at 2.19 million in the morning, and short selling was still strong. Pressure was reapplied, and the market was shrouded in buying sentiment after the opening. The low price fell to 2.13 million, and the fear of overfloating has been slightly clarified and gradually rebounded. After ten o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 193 bars at a price of 2.16 million, and people's hearts have felt stable. After entering, the market once rose to 2.18 million, hovering around 2.17 million at noon. In the afternoon, it continued to rise above 2.19 million before being stopped. As a result, it fell slightly compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments, silver bullion, and silver dollars were all flat. The dark rate for short-term financing was still flat, and interest rates were generally between 10% and 15%, but it fell below 9% at noon and was not well received.

Foreign currencies remain very stable. The ratio of gold notes to US dollars has tightened again. US dollars opened high at 3,450 yuan in the morning before there was supply. After entering, the downstream of the gold market was inevitably slightly hit, and it retreated to 3,350 yuan midway. However, there was still more strength among buyers, and it rebounded to 3,450 yuan with the rise in gold prices, hovering between 3,390 yuan and 3,420 yuan at noon. There was still some progress in the afternoon, and as a result, it rose by 10 yuan compared to the previous close. The ratio with gold prices tightened again to 640 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong dollar funds were extremely scarce and rose and fell easily. It never broke 700 yuan and as a result was similar to the previous close. Hong Kong exchange rate was 690 yuan to 700 yuan. Indian exchange rate was 870 yuan on sale. Yarn and cloth merchants were willing to cut prices for supply and sale. British exchange rate was 11,600 yuan on supply. US exchange rate was still being made at the pegged price.

### Bond Market Gradually Weakening

Government bonds have gradually lost momentum again. Tong Bing fell to 830 yuan after some sellers liquidated after the market opened at 950 yuan, before stabilizing. Some buyers took the opportunity to buy in at the bottom, and it soon rebounded to 980 yuan. Near noon, the market was sluggish. Tong Wu fell from 860 yuan to 780 yuan, but near the close it recovered to around the opening price. Trading in other bonds was quiet, with little change. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jia and Yi bonds fell slightly by 30 yuan, Bing bonds fell by 50 yuan, Ding bonds fell by 20 yuan, and Tong Wu bonds rose slightly by 10 yuan. Trading in Bing and Wu bonds was relatively active, with a volume of no less than 2 million yuan.

### British Person Assesses the New Exchange Rate

Domestic Products Not Rising, Exports Can Increase

Imported Goods Highly Profitable, Imports Difficult to Reduce

[Reuters London 20th] Bankers of Oriental banks in this place did not express surprise at the depreciation of the Chinese legal currency. The selling price of legal currency to the US dollar in the open market reached 3,700 yuan, which indicates that the government's expenditure is increasing without limit, and the domestic struggle has not yet ended. It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of the new exchange rate. The stability of the monetary base depends on the elimination of the above-mentioned obstacles and the smooth flow of inland transportation. However, before that time comes, the Chinese government authorities can only maintain the foreign exchange for a limited period of time and gradually depreciate the foreign exchange rate of the legal currency. The cost of living in Shanghai is now 4,500 times higher than before the war, while the foreign exchange rate has increased by about 1,000 times. The inflation of inland prices is more moderate. If there are sufficient means of transportation, the price level in Shanghai can be reduced and China's exports can also be increased. If the new foreign exchange rate is not overwhelmed by the rise in prices, the exported goods will benefit greatly due to the simultaneous cancellation of export duties. However, imports will not be greatly reduced, because merchants operating in imported goods are now making very high profits.

### New Exchange Rate Does Not Affect the London China Bond Market
[Reuters, London, 20th Dispatch] A Reuters economics editor states that Chinese bonds on the London Stock Exchange are extremely stable and have not been affected by the devaluation of Chinese legal tender. This devaluation is clearly based on internal Chinese needs and seems to have little bearing on foreign creditors. London's confidence in the Chinese government's maintenance of foreign debt has not diminished. It is widely believed that China will attend to its foreign debt as soon as possible, but the current internal political and economic turmoil must first be cleared up. The devaluation of legal tender alone is not sufficient to achieve this goal.

Liquid Fuel: Foreign Merchants Still Maintain Original Prices
Foreign merchants have not raised prices for liquid fuels. Gasoline remains at 740 yuan per gallon. However, retailers of kerosene and diesel are still quoting highly variable prices. Generally, current retail prices have already increased significantly. However, according to industry insiders, foreign oil companies intend to maintain the original national currency prices and will not change them due to the increase in the exchange rate. Therefore, the prices of kerosene and diesel are expected to fall back to last Saturday's market prices in a day or two.

Oujiang Merchants Propose Restoring the Wenxi Paper Mill: Hoping the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Will Allocate Machinery
The Yongjia County Chamber of Commerce recently convened a members' general meeting. According to representative Huang Hongyuan, it was proposed to establish the Wenxi Yongli Power Plant and Weaving Factory in Wenxi, where Yongjia and Qingtian counties meet. The rapid flow of the Oujiang River's upper reaches is very suitable for this type of industry. Before the War of Resistance, Shi Liangcai, the manager of this newspaper, and the Commercial Press, etc., raised funds to propose establishing a paper mill near Wenxi and planned to order long-net papermaking machinery and various equipment. Additionally, a hydroelectric power plant with 3,000 horsepower was to be established in Xiaoxi. However, the project was suspended due to the outbreak of war. At that time, it was estimated that the annual production of newsprint could supply all national newspapers and cultural institutions, alleviating any concerns about shortages. Currently, the people are impoverished, and financial resources are exhausted. Recruiting merchants to manage the project is beyond our capabilities. It is proposed to request the Executive Yuan to negotiate with the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (NRRA) to allocate a full set of hydroelectric power generation and papermaking machinery to our country and hand it over to commercial organizations for responsible establishment. The proposal was passed by the general meeting, and telegrams were sent to the NRRA and the Zhejiang Provincial Government to request the allocation of machinery. Both the NRRA and the Zhejiang Provincial Government instructed the county to supplement the feasibility study and forwarded it to the Resources Commission for review. The chamber has requested the Resources Commission and the NRRA to quickly send experts to Wenxi to conduct surveys and plan the establishment.

### Public Trial of Wen Yiduo's Murder Case
[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 16th Air Dispatch] Special Correspondent Zhang Shengli

The Wen Yiduo murder case was publicly tried in Kunming on the 15th. According to the confessions during the public trial, it was confirmed that this case was not a "local incident." The rumor of a "local incident" originated on July 19. At that time, Yunnan Chairman Yu Han was away from Yunnan on official business, and Yang Lide, the former adjutant-general of the Kunming Garrison Headquarters, was arrested in connection with a case. Many wall posters appeared in Kunming, promoting that Yang's arrest was an attempt to "frame the local authorities." In late July, newspapers in Chongqing, Guiyang, Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin published news that the Li and Wen cases were related to Yang Lide and Long Chunzeng. Long Yun, the president of the Military Advisory Council, made a special statement in Beijing about this matter, and this rumor began to disappear from the newspapers. On July 27, Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong, Deputy Chief of Staff Leng Xin, Commander Zhang Zhen, Chairman Lu Han, and Commander-in-Chief Huo Kuizhang flew from Beijing to Kunming on the same plane, and the rumor of a "local incident" gradually subsided. On August 6, Yang Lide was released on bail, and the rumors in Kunming subsided. A few days ago, Long Chunzeng, the third son of Long Yun, sent letters from Zhaotong to the Central Daily News and Justice Daily in Kunming, requesting the publication of notices clarifying that the Li and Wen cases had nothing to do with him. This office has replied approving the publication. These side stories illustrate that this case was not a "local incident."

Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong is Fully Handling the Wen Case
After the Li and Wen cases occurred, there were other rumors of "framing the central government" and "killing three birds with one stone." The former said it was done by the Zhongbei faction, and the latter said it was done by the central government. The government, in addition to expressing concern and attaching importance to the case, repeatedly sent senior officials to Kunming to thoroughly investigate, arrest the murderers, and solve the case. In terms of propaganda, it has remained silent to this day. It has neither publicly denied nor endorsed the rumors from various parties, but is waiting for the case to be solved before "revealing the truth to the world." Now that the Wen case has been publicly tried, the confessions have revealed that this case was neither a "frame-up of the central government" by the CCP, nor a "three birds with one stone" plot by the central government. The solving of the case has clarified three types of rumors. The following is a summary of the public trial of the Wen case and the confessions for the reader.

"Military Joint Trial Court" Organized for Public Trial of the Wen Case
After the Wen Yiduo murder case was solved, it was investigated five times by the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters and the Military Law Department of the Army Headquarters. The confessions of the criminals and the evidence were carefully interrogated. Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong, who was fully authorized to handle the Li and Wen cases in Kunming, ordered the Military Law Department of the Army Headquarters, the Yunnan Provincial Security Command, and the 13th Gendarmerie Regiment stationed in Kunming to jointly organize a "Military Joint Trial Court" to publicly try the case at the Kunming District Court on the 15th. The presiding judge was Major General Zhang Xiaojing, Director of the Military Law Department of the Army Headquarters. The judges were Colonel Yang Guifang, Chief of the Military Law Section of the Yunnan Provincial Security Command, and Major Zhang Zhengdong, Adjutant of the 13th Gendarmerie Regiment. The observers invited were Liang Shuming and Zhou Xinmin of the Democratic League, Mei Yiqi, President of Tsinghua University, He Lin, Professor of Peking University, Feng Wenqian, Professor of Nankai University, Zha Liangzhao, President of Kunming Normal College, Bai Shijun, Secretary of Yunnan University, Gan of the Provincial Assembly, Fang Shaokun, Deputy Speaker of the Municipal Assembly, Zhang Benzong, Member of the Kunming County Assembly, Yan Biancheng, Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Commerce, Li Zhu'an, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Lu Shizeng, President of the High Court, Mang Wenhuan, Chief Prosecutor, Li Shi, Presiding Judge of the Kunming District Court, Zha Zongfan, Member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Liu Zhenyu, Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Luo Zhiping, Representative of the Kunming County Party Headquarters, He Wenxuan of the Guizhou-Yunnan Supervisory Envoy's Office, Sun Dongming, Director of the Secretariat of the Provincial Government, Zhao Bing, Secretary of the Municipal Government, Lei Benqu, Representative of the Kunming County Government, Guo Yeru, Director of the Garrison Headquarters, and Shao Yizhi, Director of the Kunming Branch of the Central News Agency, a total of 23 units. The Provincial Government specially appointed Section Chief Li De, Nie Tiren, and Section Chief Liu Guisheng to serve as receptionists, and the Gendarmerie Regiment sent a squad of gendarmerie to provide security. The Army Military Academy also sent representatives.

(5) They are lower-level cadres who rose through military merit. (6) They have participated in several battles, been wounded several times, and received national medals.

Li Wenshan's Confession: The Killing Was Out of Anger
According to Li Wenshan's confession: "On the 15th, when Wen Yiduo was giving a speech, he slammed the table and stomped his feet, scolding the government for being too corrupt and about to collapse. He cursed the soldiers as running dogs and shameless. We soldiers have fought many battles and suffered many injuries. Why should we be insulted? At that time, my blood boiled, and I couldn't wait to shoot him dead with a gun. Company Commander Tang saw me touching my gun and stopped me, telling me not to be foolish!"

He also confessed: "There are tens of thousands of people in Kunming City. Why kill him alone? Because he is a public menace." (At this time, the presiding judge said that these words were irrelevant.)

According to Tang Shiliang's confession: "At that time, he cursed the government as shameless, cursed the soldiers as running dogs of the government, and as reactionaries. We were very angry and determined to kill him!"

Both Criminals Unanimously Confessed That No One Instigated Them Beforehand
The presiding judge asked separately: "Did anyone instigate you beforehand?" "Did you discuss it with anyone?" Both replied: "No." He also asked: "Did you report to your superiors afterward?" Tang Shiliang replied: "We kept it strictly secret from each other." He also asked: "You are soldiers. Why didn't you report to your superiors?" Li Wenshan replied: "We did something bad, so we didn't report it." The presiding judge asked Tang Shiliang: "Can a company commander's monthly income support his livelihood?" He replied: "Yes." He also asked: "Does anyone usually give you money?" He replied: "No."

The presiding judge asked Li Wenshan: "If anyone has said anything to you, tell it. It will be beneficial to you." He confessed: "We did it for our own conscience, not for money." He also asked: "Killing someone requires responsibility?" He confessed: "I am responsible myself." He also asked: "Tell the truth, and it can reduce your responsibility." He confessed: "Shoot me. I am willing to die." (Loudly, patting his chest)

The presiding judge told Li Wenshan and Tang Shiliang at the same time: "Today is the trial court, and it is also your last chance to speak. If someone asked you to do this, tell the truth. It will be very beneficial to you." Tang Shiliang confessed: "He cursed the soldiers. Anyone with blood and energy could have eaten him." Li Wenshan confessed: "No one asked us to do it. It was completely voluntary." The presiding judge asked: "Do you regret it?" Tang and Li confessed in unison: "No regrets." Tang also confessed: "Any young person with blood and energy could do this." Li also confessed: "He deserved to be killed. I will never regret it." (Loudly)

Based on the confessions of these two criminals before and after, general observers believe that several things have been explained: (1) The reason for the killing was out of anger. (2) It was voluntary and not instigated by anyone. (3) They are willing to die and will never regret it.

The Process of the Assassination of Wen Yiduo
According to the confessions of the two criminals, roughly: On the morning of July 15, at around 11:00 AM, Tang Shiliang, Li Wenshan, and Xu Zhankun came out of the company headquarters and first went to Cuihu South Road, then to Huashan West Road, and Qingyun Street. At a little after 12:00 PM, they walked to the entrance of Yunnan University and saw many people walking into Yunnan University, some carrying wreaths. They went in to take a look. A memorial service was being held inside (referring to the Li Gongpu memorial service). A woman (referring to Li Gongpu's wife) finished speaking and then invited Wen Yiduo to give a speech. After they listened to Wen Yiduo's words, Li Wenshan wanted to shoot him with a gun, but Tang Shiliang stopped him. When Wen Yiduo walked out of Yunnan University, there were six or seven people following behind Wen. The three of them also followed behind Wen, wanting to attack him, but there was no opportunity. Wen Yiduo later walked into No. 14 Fu Yongdao (at that time, the Democratic League was holding a press conference at No. 14). The three of them waited in the fried dough stick shop across the street. When Wen came out of No. 14, there were only two people (one was Wen's son, Li Hehe). They followed them. When they reached Xicangpo, they opened fire. Li Wenshan's first shot hit Wen's leg. Wen fell down and shouted. Li Wenshan fired wildly. Wen Lihe was very close to his father. After his father fell, he lay on his father's body and was also hit by random gunfire. Li Wenshan fired six or seven bullets, leaving two or three bullets in case people chased him, so he could defend himself. Tang Shiliang also fired, but he couldn't remember how many shots he fired. Xu Zhankun didn't bring a gun and followed behind them. No one was nearby when they committed the crime. After the crime, Li Wenshan fled towards Qianju Street, and Tang Shiliang and Xu Zhankun fled towards Ximen. After a long time, the three of them returned to the company one after another. They kept the matter secret from each other. On August 3, Tang Shiliang ran to Yiliang alone and stayed at a friend's house named Shi. On August 5, at 11:00 AM, his battalion commander found him in Yiliang and brought him back. He was wearing plain clothes when he fled and only carried a locally made Laqi pistol. Xu Zhankun was the quartermaster sergeant in his company. After he fled, Xu also fled and is now missing.

The presiding judge asked Li Wenshan why he wore plain clothes when he went out. Li confessed: "After the Li Gongpu case occurred, the battalion commander said: 'Kunming has been too chaotic recently. It is inconvenient for us to wear uniforms when we go out on patrol.'" He also asked: "What weapons did you bring?" He confessed: "I brought a Shixiang gun, made in Guangdong, with a wooden handle, a missing muzzle, a broken sight, and a number starting with the number one." (The presiding judge showed the murder weapon in court, and Li Wenshan admitted it was correct.)

Democratic League Representative Liang Shuming Attended the Hearing All Day
Observers must enter the court with an "Observer Certificate." The court opened at 10:03 AM on the 15th and adjourned at 11:34 AM. The hearing resumed at 2:05 PM and ended at 2:44 PM. There were 24 observers in the morning and 17 in the afternoon. Mr. Liang Huanming and Mr. Zhou Xinmin arrived on time in the morning and afternoon. Mr. Liang listened quietly, and Mr. Zhou took notes on the confessions. Neither expressed their opinions on the trial process that day, only exchanged pleasantries with several observing professors in the lounge. In the morning, Mr. Liang wore a long gown and mandarin jacket. In the afternoon, he only wore a silk long gown, waving a black paper fan gently, with no expression on his face.

The criminals Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan were escorted to court by a platoon of soldiers in a large truck before the trial began. After the trial was over, they were escorted back to prison. Tang Shiliang wore a dark blue suit, had Western-style hair, was short, and had a sallow complexion. Li Wenshan was quite tall, but not a "burly man." He wore blue cloth pants, a dark blue Zhongshan suit, and long hair, with the ends of his hair covering his right eye.

Li Wenshan was interrogated first. When Li was escorted to court by the gendarmerie, he was tied with a white legal rope. The gendarmerie untied the legal rope in court, which took about two minutes. At the beginning of the interrogation, Li Wenshan stood at attention for about a quarter of an hour. Later, he reported to the judge: "I can't stand it anymore. Please allow me to relax a little." The presiding judge allowed him to rest briefly. When Tang Shiliang arrived in court, he mistakenly thought the reporters were the judges and bowed to the reporters' seats first. Later, he looked up to the left and saw the judge was above, turned around and bowed, and then stood at ease. Neither criminal was wearing a military uniform, but because they were both active-duty soldiers, they were still tried by military law. According to the confessions of the two criminals, Tang Shiliang's clothes were exactly the same as when he appeared in court when he assassinated Wen Yiduo on the 15th. Li Wenshan wore yellow khaki cloth pants, and his hair was combed relatively neatly.

Before the public trial, the investigating authorities asked Wen's son, Li Hehe, to testify. As a result of two letters of request, Yunnan University sent two letters proving that Wen Lihe was indeed unable to be discharged from the hospital to avoid affecting the wound. Wen's son, who witnessed the incident, is no longer in danger of life, and the case has not been formally sentenced, so these two criminals can be confirmed.

The Criminals Confessed Their Backgrounds
According to Li Wenshan's confession on the 15th, he is from Huangpi, Hubei, 32 years old, and a lieutenant platoon leader in the 3rd Company of the Special Service Battalion of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters. He attended primary school in his childhood and graduated from the Fifth Army Cadre Training Class. He has never held an official position in the past and won the Army, Navy, and Air Force Medal during the war. He has been in the army for more than ten years. In 1938, he participated in the Battle of Taierzhuang and the Battle of Zhengzhou, and his right eye was injured by Japanese poison gas at this time. In 1942, he participated in the Battle of Jisulongling. He presented scars in court to prove it. He has an elderly mother, who is 60 or 70 years old. He has an older brother, who was killed in the Battle of Kunlun Pass. After leaving the Fifth Army, he met Tang Shiliang in Kunming. Through Tang's introduction, he became the platoon leader of the Special Service Company of the Garrison Headquarters at the end of April this year. He and Tang Shiliang were in the same company, and their relationship was very harmonious.

According to Tang Shiliang's confession on the 15th, he is from Hengyang, Hunan, 28 years old, and the captain of the 3rd Company of the Special Service Battalion of the Garrison Headquarters. He graduated from the Gendarmerie School. He has never held an official position in the past. In 1944, he won the Army, Navy, and Air Force Second Class First Class Medal. He originally served in the 20th Gendarmerie Regiment. In 1942, he joined the 71st Army and was wounded in action in Burma. Later, he was wounded in action in western Yunnan. He presented scars on his head and left hand in court to prove it. He has several brothers. His eldest brother was wounded in the Battle of Songhu, his second brother died in the Battle of Kunlun Pass, and his third brother died in Jiangxi.

According to the confessions of these two criminals, general observers believe that the following facts have been explained: (1) They are not from Yunnan. (3) They have never served in Yunnan agencies or troops in the past. (3) Their education level is not high. (4) They have not been in a formal military school. (5) They are lower-level cadres who rose through military merit. (6) They have participated in several battles, been wounded several times, and received national medals.

The Liquidation of Maoye Bank Has Been Pending for a Long Time: Please Instruct the Ministry of Finance on How to Proceed
Editor Sir: Greetings. In 1928, I deposited 5,000 yuan in national currency, the remainder of my hard-earned business, into the "Shanghai China Maoye Bank" (English name Tlie Cltinese American Ba-nk of Commerce, Shanghai Branch), a Sino-American joint venture. At that time, the bank was located diagonally opposite the Huiluo Company on Nanjing Road in Shanghai. I was ignorant of social situations and thought that Sino-American joint ventures were more reliable than ordinary banks. Who would have thought that the bank would suddenly collapse the following year? I almost went crazy when I heard the news, but I still thought there was a way to resolve the aftermath and soon heard about liquidation registration. I had to take my passbook and credentials to register. Since then, it has been in a state of indefinite delay. The bank's liquidation office soon moved to the China Industrial Bank Building on the Museum Road, and I still went to inquire from time to time. According to the staff there: "This matter has been handled by the Ministry of Finance of the Chinese government and must wait for orders," I was helpless. Since the outbreak of the war, the liquidation office has disappeared. I am now over fifty years old and living in extreme poverty, hoping to use this money to live out my remaining years. At that time, the money was worth about ten gold bars. After years of hard work, I have not seen any of the principal or interest for eighteen years. It is like a stone sinking into the sea, with no hope. If this continues, I am afraid I will not be able to wait in my lifetime. The bank was nominally a Sino-American joint venture. Now that victory has been achieved and Sino-American relations are becoming closer, this long-pending case should be resolved as soon as possible to comfort the people. However, I have not heard any statement from the government regarding this liquidation. There are several points that are unclear, namely: (1) From the bank's collapse and liquidation in 1929 to the 8/13 Incident in 1937, why didn't the government authorities complete the liquidation in these eight years? (2) Will the government authorities continue to process it after the victory? (3) Will there be any hope of a solution in the future? Regarding these three points, I respectfully request your newspaper to publish them to appeal for justice on behalf of the kind and suffering people and to ask the government's Ministry of Finance to provide an answer so that I can die in peace. At the same time, I also ask other affected depositors of the bank to initiate the concentration of claims for negotiation. I am extremely grateful. (Dong Xiqin)

Can Ordinary People Be Assassinated at Will?
Editor: Now, the southeast towns of Rugao and Taixian counties, which were occupied by the Soviet army, have been recovered by the National Army one after another. However, the National Army is stationed in the towns and cities on the communication lines and has not yet stationed in remote rural areas. The Communist army has broken up into smaller units and hid in the villages. They lurk during the day and move around at night. The Communists regard the people who return to their hometowns and the small and medium farmers who have never cooperated with them as "reactionary elements." They will not spare "reactionary elements" and will assassinate and arrest them separately. Their methods of assassination vary. Some ambush on the roadside, some shoot people in their homes, and some disguise themselves as National Army soldiers and kill you on the way to the National Army's defense zone. Arrests are both overt and covert. Overt arrests give you the title of "reactionary suspect" and arrest you openly. Covert arrests are secret arrests. Therefore, in the rural areas of Taizhou and Liangxian counties recently, people are often assassinated or suddenly declared missing. Such news happens several times a day. When the people ask the Communist army about this, they say: "These are all stubborn tricks of the National Army's special agents. You must unite quickly!" As a result, there is another wave of fleeing from the Communist areas. The number of refugees newly added in Nantong, Shanghai, and other places in the past half month is indeed not small; but it is not as many as in the towns near Rugao, Hai'an, Qutang, and Jiangyan. I remember that the assassination of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo once attracted the attention and intervention of many people in society. How come no one pays attention to and intervenes in the assassination and arrest of these many ordinary people? Ah! Are the lives of ordinary people not worthy of the attention and intervention of adults and gentlemen! (A Refugee from Northern Jiangsu)

Tang Shiliang Confessed That Hitting Wen Lihe Was a "Mistake"
The presiding judge asked Tang Shiliang: "Did you go out on July 15?" He confessed: "I was on duty that day." He also asked: "How many people went out with you?" He confessed: "Three people, Li Wenshan and I, and the quartermaster sergeant Xu Zhankun." He also asked: "What did you go out to do together?" He confessed: "I took them to the street to take a look." He also asked: "Why did you go to Yunnan University?" He confessed: "Because I saw the bulletin on the street, I knew there was a speech at Yunnan University, so we went to take a look." He also asked: "Do you know Wen Yiduo?" He confessed: "I don't know him. After a woman finished speaking, she said: 'Please invite Mr. Wen Yiduo to speak,' so I knew who Wen Yiduo was." (The presiding judge asked Li Wenshan: "How do you know Wen Yiduo?" Li confessed: "I didn't know him in the past. I only knew it when I heard the woman speak.") He also asked: "Why didn't you want Li Wenshan to hit him when the meeting was held at Yunnan University?" He confessed: "There were many people at that time, and I was afraid of causing trouble." He also asked: "Why did you want to kill his son?" He confessed: "At that time, we didn't know he was his son. We fired wildly and made a mistake." He also asked: "What gun did you bring that day?" He confessed: "Laqi gun, a private locally made gun."

Judge Zhang Zhengdong asked Tang Shiliang: "Why did you run to Yiliang?" He confessed: "I wanted to take the highway home."

Finally, the presiding judge asked Tang Shiliang: "One more thing, you have to tell the truth. Where did Xu Zhankun go?" He confessed: "I don't know." He also asked: "Did he bring a gun when he hit Wen Yiduo?" He confessed: "He didn't bring it. He was far behind us." He also asked: "What are his characteristics?" He confessed: "His face is long, and his body is a little taller than me, but a little shorter than him (referring to Li Wenshan). There is a mole on the corner of his left eye. He wore a US Army jacket and khaki cloth pants when he left. Because the things he left behind have not been touched."

Based on the above confessions, general observers believe that several things have been explained: (1) Tang Shiliang came out for patrol, and Li Wenshan and Xu Zhankun came out to take a look at the street. (2) Tang and Li were both wearing plain clothes and brought private locally made pistols. (3) The three went to Yunnan University to listen to the speech. (4) Only two people opened fire, and Xu Zhankun did not bring a gun. (5) Killing Wen Lihe was a "mistake." (6) No one was nearby when they committed the crime. (7) They fled in two directions after committing the crime. (8) Tang Shiliang had escaped and was brought back. (9) Xu Zhankun's case is lighter, but he is now missing.

At 2:44 PM on the 15th, the trial of the Wen case was completed. After the criminals Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan signed and sealed their confessions, the presiding judge announced: "The defendant will be remanded in custody pending judgment. Court adjourned." It is not known when the judgment will be pronounced as of the time of writing.

The Guangxi Speaker Contest
[Our Newspaper, Guilin, 5th Air Dispatch] Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong

Last summer, the province was liberated, and the provincial government returned to Guilin. All rumors also disappeared. Just when big things were being turned into small things, and small things into nothing, on June 10, the Provincial Assembly was formally established. This assembly, which has been meeting for 45 days and still does not have a speaker or deputy speaker, like a headless angry dragon, vehemently brought up a shocking opium case a week ago. 140 million yuan worth of opium violates many government orders and harms many compatriots. It is too lawless! The gentlemen of the assembly must find out its background and must have the provincial authorities arrest the two corrupt officials and bring them to justice for 10 million yuan each. The government has repeatedly banned opium, but corrupt officials have repeatedly ordered its cultivation. What kind of system is this? Therefore, the resolution to ask the provincial government to strictly arrest Huang and Luo and thoroughly investigate the matter was sent to Chairman Huang. Chairman Huang, who had been kept in the dark for a long time, was shocked and angry and issued a written statement overnight and sent it to various newspapers for publication, expressing that he would never tolerate corruption and would definitely conduct a thorough investigation based on the facts. Chen Liangzuo, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, has been suffering from hematuria these days and is in poor spirits, but he also gave a solemn speech to reporters. However, when reporters asked, "It is rumored that there is someone behind the scenes directing this case. Has the director heard of this?" He replied that he did not know. What about the media? They have been revealing the truth with eye-catching headlines every day. The Central Daily News even used the headline "Strictly Arrest! Prosecute! Investigate Thoroughly!" to urge the government to quickly and thoroughly investigate this case. In addition to being concerned about the issue of the speaker and deputy speaker, the members of the assembly are also concerned about the opium case in Xilong and Xilin. The inside story is complicated and cannot be explained. The whole of Guilin has been blown into a frenzy by this hurricane, and this hurricane has also scared away Huang, who was still in Guilin a few days ago, and forced him to go to Hong Kong to avoid the storm. Silent Guangxi, politically enlightened Guangxi, has rarely experienced such a shocking storm. Now that the storm has finally started, let it blow! Let the jackals, wolves, snakes, and rats all be destroyed in the relentless vortex!

Thunder in the Palm: The Speaker Must Be Re-elected
A gambling scam is popular in the streets and alleys of Guilin: a person holds a red piece of paper and a white piece of paper in his hand and chants: "Look closely, see clearly, one red, one white. Winning the red gets money, buying the white loses money. See if your eyes are fast, see if my hands are fast...." The assembly, which has been noisy for two months and still has no result, has taken it to the next level and is staging an extremely exciting play. Writers such as reporters cannot help but think of the "fast eyes and fast hands" on the street from the red walls and green tiles of the assembly. I am very sorry. It cannot be said to be frivolous, nor can it be said to be solemn. Smart readers will definitely ask: "Who lost money?" I will definitely answer: "The common people are making crooked braids. A county has obediently taken out more than 300,000 of the people's fat and ointment. The hotels in Guilin are very happy, and the restaurants in Guilin are ecstatic!"

Is the issue of the speaker really that interesting? It's really interesting! Because the supreme Qianjin Gate is pushing down, pushing hard, pushing ruthlessly, Chen Xigong, who was supposed to be elected speaker because the Ministry of the Interior explained that the three questionable votes were valid, encountered unprecedented misfortune. Mr. Li Renren, who lost the election, has a mountain behind him, forcing him forward layer by layer, and the "effect is quite good." Suddenly, a "be careful, re-election" sign was released. "Re-election is a must!" The members who agreed to wait for the Ministry of the Interior to resolve the matter are anxiously waiting and have not received a clear instruction from the Ministry of the Interior. Is there really no instruction? Or is it fake? It is not for you to know, nor is it for me not to know. Although Chen Xigong is indeed the speaker according to the explanation of an internal telegram from the Ministry of the Interior, the provincial government completely denies that it has received an explanation from such a telegram from the Ministry of the Interior. At the same time, Li Renren found 49 members through different means to implement "re-election review." As a result, due to insufficient quorum, he achieved the "record of creating eight filibusters with the spirit of building a mountain nine ren high." The assembly members never imagined that they would come to Guilin and be pulled around (the assembly members who were unwilling to make up the "quorum" and implement the re-election rented a large wooden boat and spent the whole day hiding in the Tanjiang River, dazed). The intentions of the "pulled" gentlemen or the "self-pulled" gentlemen suffered a defeat, but they also lived comfortably. Although the rumors of receiving "allowances" cannot defile the gentlemen's "reputation," everything will not reduce the mood of contention. Small and large banquets every three to five days, bird's nest and shark fin nourish the gentlemen's spirits. What is so difficult about staying in Guilin for another month?

Receiving a Telegram Sets Off a Huge Wave
A telegram caused another huge wave. On the 31st, Mr. Chen Xigong received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, asking him to assist in promoting the work of collecting land tax in kind. The cover of the telegram was "Speaker Chen Xigong Receives." Mr. Chen received this telegram and, in order to carry out the tasks entrusted by Chairman Chiang, resolutely disregarded all obstacles on August 1 and telegraphed to take office as speaker. This has troubled the provincial authorities. The provincial government sent a car at 2:00 AM to send a manuscript from Chairman Huang asking Chen not to take office as speaker to various newspapers for publication. At the same time, the members of the Li Renren faction published their advertisement: "Emergency Announcement Denying Chen Xigong's Illegal Telegram Taking Office as Speaker," the advertisement was 40 square inches large (the advertisements of "you refute me and I refute you" in recent days have benefited the newspapers quite a bit, just like the hotel owners hoping that the assembly members will stay for another year or so). Chen Xigong's "request" to Chairman Huang is naturally difficult to accept, and he decided to take office according to internal instructions. However, how easy is it to hold an inauguration ceremony! The provincial authorities have long made it clear to Chen not to take office to avoid "causing unexpected disputes." Who can guarantee that there will be no fists? Who can guarantee that there will be no all-out brawl?

The speaker's sign is still one red and one white, turning around in the hands of some people. It is not clear, and it cannot be seen clearly. Who is the winner? God knows!

Free Talk: Twilight Musings by Shao Fu

It is said that the "Shanghai Miss" election night was poorly managed. Reporters, in the course of their work, were obstructed and harassed by some "feather-duster-wielding" characters. It is hoped that those hosting future gatherings will take note.

Wang Dumei was elected Miss Shanghai with over 60,000 votes, amounting to over 60 million yuan in ticket sales. The sum is not small, but compared to the 200 million yuan target of the relief association, it is insignificant.

Fortunately, there is still a coronation ceremony yet to be held, so there is still room to brainstorm ideas.

Rice has been a scarce commodity these past two days.

The verdict in the grain loan case is about to be announced, which should serve as a warning to those recklessly speculating on prices!

Mooncakes are on the market; the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching.

Some are "raising their heads to gaze," while others are "bowing their heads in thought."

The Great World entertainment center lacks a buyer. Shanghai, a city teeming with hidden dragons and crouching tigers, casts doubt on the strength of the wealthy.

In fact, this is an underestimation of them. It's not that the rich gentlemen lack money, but rather, they are afraid of attracting attention, and secondly, whether the property can be cleared and used freely is still questionable.

Various Wills by Ru Shui

The news of cremation brings wills to mind. Because those who are unwilling to be cremated, or those who particularly advocate cremation, must state so in their wills.

Here, I would like to discuss various historical wills.

A person's hopes and fantasies are reflected in their final will. Some write their wills on the underside of staircases, while others engrave them on tortoise shells. One eccentric old woman wanted her will tattooed on her back. In hospitals, nurses' skirts can also serve as paper to record a will. One nobleman left his widow only a shilling, saying it was for her travel expenses to a place where she could drown herself.

In one place, an odd woman said on her deathbed that her property should go to God. This even alarmed the local government, and a high official was ordered to find God. He reported that after tireless searching, he could not find God.

The earliest wills date back 2,000 years. Aristotle's will was established in 322 BC. He specified his heirs, appointed guardians for his daughter, ordered the liberation of his female slaves, and even detailed the burial procedures.

American revolutionary politician Morris was a generous man. He bequeathed his wife a considerable inheritance, but stipulated that if she remarried, she would receive double the inheritance. Patrick Henry, on the other hand, stated in his will that if his wife remarried, she would receive nothing.

President Washington's will was twenty-five pages long, naming his wife and six others as heirs. He said that with seven people, he was confident that the provisions he had made would be carried out.

Frenchman Rabelais was a famous humorist. His will stated, "I have nothing. I owe a lot. The rest, I give to the poor." American legal scholar Hormell gave most of his property to the American government, making him the first in America to do so.

The writer Robert Louis Stevenson bequeathed his birthday to a female friend because her own birthday fell on Christmas. He said that if she did not use it well, all rights would revert to the President of the United States.

The will of exhibition expert Barnum was the most meticulous, printed into a fifty-three page booklet. It covered the distribution of property and the continued support of famous artists.

The most beautiful will was that of the great biologist Pasteur: "This is my last will and testament. Everything that the law allows a man to leave, I leave to my wife. May my children never abandon the path of responsibility, and may they always maintain the obedience due to their mother."

The privilege of making a will is arguably undisputed. Those who die without a will entrust themselves to angels, because every country has laws to dispose of estates. However, there is one place that explicitly stipulates that "the fallacy of disposing of property should be disseminated casually."

Most people make a will before they die. Libraries everywhere have will templates. If a will is written in the presence of a lawyer, it is even safer and more reliable, benefiting both the deceased and the living. Therefore, a person should not only put their intellectual and spiritual wealth on paper, but also recognize that a will is the most faithful servant, capable of preserving the deceased's wishes for posterity.

Sexual Knowledge Liberation: Youth Issues by Lü Yu

People in our grandparents' generation never talked about "sex." They dared not speak of it, nor did they want to, because from a very early age, they had acquired a terrifying notion of sex and crime. This notion was so deeply ingrained that it deprived them of sound rational judgment.

Such a mentality should undoubtedly be dispelled in our generation. The prohibition of sexual knowledge causes at least the following three harms to young people:

Restricting the curiosity of young people in science - The reason why Chinese culture has not made significant progress over thousands of years, according to the theory of the psychology master Freud, is mostly due to the suppression of sex. Sex is the driving force of all life. Therefore, suppressing curiosity about sex is also suppressing curiosity in other sciences. Like what the Russian physiologist Pavlov said: The questions "What is this?" and "Who is that?" are the source of all children's wisdom.

Serious moral loss - The first acquisition of sexual knowledge by young people is mostly unhealthy. Since they cannot inquire openly, they can only obtain fragmentary information from irresponsible friends and lascivious books. This kind of distorted sexual knowledge often gives them great impulses. It is based on local laws that testators can address the prevalence of sexual diseases, which should be indirectly blamed on the prohibition of sexual knowledge. They may be able to change their emotions through poetry and music, but they are more likely to be destroyers of social morality.

Physiological and psychological effects - As mentioned above, sexually transmitted diseases and pathological sexual behaviors are often a source of distress for modern youth. We know that a healthy man has one or two sexual urges per month, which is a normal physiological phenomenon, but many young people think it is a serious matter. They are influenced by advertisements from city monks, feeling ashamed on the one hand and terrified on the other. Thus, harmless things give them terrible mental blows. They first transform from nervous emotions such as worry, fear, and anxiety into psychological pathologies, which in turn cause physiological pathologies.

The harms caused by the prohibition of sexual knowledge are of course not limited to the three points listed above. But for these reasons, we have good reason to protest against our traditional morality. This traditional morality often lurks silently in our subconscious, hindering the rational development of our minds and bodies.

A Laugh by Xi Xian

"Hey! How much money do you bring home to your wife every payday?"

"None at all."

"How come?"

"She waits for me at the company gate and takes the money home herself!"

"My wife dreamed last night that she married a millionaire."

"You're lucky. My wife thinks about it during the day!"

Employer: "Personal appearance is a powerful factor in business success."

Employee: "Exactly! Business success is a powerful factor in personal appearance."

### Where is Shanghai Going? by Chen Gan'ge

Hong Kong, without Kowloon as its hinterland, might become a dead island. But Shanghai is different. From the ships entering the port at Wusongkou to the end of the Huangpu River, spanning dozens of square miles, there isn't even a hint of "hills." The boundless plains laid the first condition for a metropolis.

However, this vast land has been abandoned. What is now called Shanghai actually only refers to the former International Settlement and the former French Concession. Beyond this small area, Shanghai changes. Not only are there no tall and large buildings, but even bungalows are rare.

In this small area crowded with three million people, all kinds of disputes are created every day. Amidst the noise and clamor, there are a series of housing problems, rice problems, security problems... even traffic problems, keeping the entire municipal authority busy.

These problems are all symptoms hindering urban development, and these symptoms cannot be treated by a mediocre doctor using palliative methods. However, one-way traffic, mandatory rental of vacant houses... happen to be palliative measures. It is not that I deliberately negate the goodwill measures of the authorities. Because tens of thousands of vehicles and groups of citizens still have to squeeze into this small area every day, whether it is one-way traffic or two-way traffic, to work and live, precisely because that is his office, his business place, and he will not stop going to the office after the implementation of one-way traffic. On the contrary, sometimes to go around a few more circles for the obstacle of one-way traffic to reach the destination. Isn't it?

Of course, a wise official will accommodate many reform plans. Here is a small opinion that seems to be available to the authorities for consideration

The thing is, on the side of the city center (Yinxiang Port), isn't it the old site of the city government? There, the glazed tiles still reflect a beautiful light under the sunlight. The road surface is also very smooth, but unfortunately the beautiful house has been deserted for nine years and is still empty. The open land is full of weeds. Why do today's civil servants have to crowd into the clamor to work? If the city government really moves over one day, not only can it reduce the tens of thousands of civil servants from crowding around in this noisy city, invisibly resolving the severity of traffic, but also, the post-war restoration of the prosperity of the city center can also achieve a part of the success.

Shanghai is vast and needs to proliferate, but its development still depends on the efforts of the authorities! It also depends on the assistance of all aspects of the industrial and commercial circles!

Ancient and Modern "Three Nos" by Wen Yi

"See no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil" - this is an ancient saying. But ancient sayings can only be appreciated by archaeologists in this modern 20th century. Nowadays, people generally advocate "See no profit, speak no profit, hear no profit", because in today's society, all living beings rush around from morning till night, all for profit. People die for profit, which can be said to be a worthy death.

American Teachers Also Bitterly Propose a Bill of Rights by Jin Yi

An American, Mr. Skoling, who has taught for more than forty-two years, initially received a reward of one dollar and eighty-three cents a day. Now, as a professor in the Department of Education at the University of Michigan, he is still not much better off. He believes that teachers are always "doing more with less." Uncerpaidnd Overworken He said this is why 600,000 people retired from teaching positions in 1939. At the end of last month, he drafted a "Teachers' Bill of Rights" and intends to send it to all American teachers for signature. The content is as follows:

1.  The number of students in a teacher's class must be limited to ten to twenty students, so that teachers can teach better and one million new teachers can be added.

2.  Complete and sufficient material equipment is required (tangible assistance, books, etc.)

3.  Comfortable and meticulously designed classrooms are required (many are like guardhouses, and only a few are suitable for teaching)

4.  Teachers must have the same personal freedom as respectable citizens in general (teachers occasionally like to play cards, dance, smoke and drink once or twice, but this is not assumed in many cities)

5.  A forty-five hour work week is the limit (an average teacher has to spend seventy hours a week in the classroom, guiding students and parents, grading papers, and leading social activities)

6.  Year-round: (fifty-two weeks) salary In the United States, the average annual salary should be $1,900.

7.  Stable life and ability to concentrate (before deciding on a subject, new teachers should be assigned lighter subjects and have the opportunity to try out various classrooms, and work should be carried out under the guidance of experienced teachers.)

8.  Establish a monitoring system. (Apart from occasional inspections, the work of teachers is usually not paid attention to or discussed, so a monitoring system is needed.)

9.  There must be time equivalent to one lesson per day to plan teaching materials (three hours of planning can save the time of fifty students)

10. Have the right to assist and participate in the administration, planning and policy of the school.

### Trying to Be Clever but Bungling by Zheng Ping

A certain school wanted to earn more tuition fees for the summer school, so at the end of the semester, it raised the standard of grades. Anyone who failed in one of the five main subjects, regardless of the grades in other subjects, would be given the opportunity for a "make-up exam" or "repetition," so only one-fifth of each grade could be promoted on average.

As a result, the principal proposed a lenient method. Whether it was a "make-up exam" or "repetition," as long as you entered the summer school of this school, you could be promoted if you passed the exam. From this, the tuition fee was also considerable.

It happened that a middle school opened nearby, and those without certificates were also accepted. Therefore, about forty people went to take the exam. The students were overjoyed to be admitted, but the principal bungled his own clever plan.

### Forgetfulness by Xi Yuan Ji

One night before going to bed, he suddenly remembered that he had something to do, but he forgot what it was. He thought about it for a while, but still had no memory, so he swore fiercely: if I don't think of it tonight, I will not sleep.

So, he began to fall into deep thought, one hour, two hours... later, but still did not think of it.

The clock had already chimed twelve times, and his brain finally gained liberation: it turned out that he had decided to have important matters to deal with tomorrow morning, and he was going to go to bed earlier tonight.

### Rotating Credit Association by Little Citizen

——In the speculative circle——

The teahouse in the morning is full of "loafer" of all ages, sipping tea and eating dim sum, discussing yesterday's trivial matters, a young man, eloquent: "That yesterday five million societies almost could not be resolved, thanks to the old man's help. A burly man with a pockmarked face stood up, rolled up his sleeves, revealing his flowered arm and the glittering gold bracelet, spitting and saying: "××× Am I not," Pockmarked skin brags, never dismantled apprentice's feet," A person of the year continued: "× What's the reason, yesterday's number is too small, otherwise I'll pat my ass and run, the day before yesterday Jin San got a million," Biting off his collar ×". Another middle-aged man was saying: "Yesterday was really disappointing, I combined three societies again, got more than five million, bought a sports car, and the remaining four corners were given to the little guards".

Near noon, everyone held a booklet in their hands, leaving the teahouse with a lively momentum and a sudden loneliness, leaving behind a table full of teapots and teacups. At two o'clock in the afternoon, the teahouse was crowded with all kinds of men and women, including vegetable vendors, plasterers, carpenters, tailors, etc., in the middle sat a "loafer" wearing a plaid shirt and pants, with a hideous face, spread out a booklet. Everyone looked at the arrogant face sitting in the middle with hopeful hearts, and as a result, two by two walked out of the teahouse, some with sullen faces and dejected, and some with joyful faces, but the absolute majority.

"×That one million is left with 100,000, hum," a fishmonger from a nearby vegetable market cursed resentfully, where did the money go? Supporting a general comfortable life, beautifully dressed "loafer".

Linked Comic Book: San Mao Joins the Army (82) by Zhang Leping

### After Wells' Death by Jiu Zhang

Wells wrote an article of the "Elegy" type last year, and now he is really dead. His predictions have always been "not far from the mark," and this time it seems to be the same.

In this article, he wanted to criticize his own achievements as a future historian. He would not feign modesty and belittle himself; nor would he pretend to be broad-minded and think that the world after death had nothing to do with him. He briefly explained his own struggle, from a biology assistant to a world-renowned writer, who had studied science and history, and had a keen interest in the dissemination of knowledge and the fate of mankind, and still held hope for the future society.

I sometimes wonder, how many people after World War II still have a calm mind and an abundant passion to hold hope for the future world? But I also feel quite comforted that Mr. Wells died after Hitler after all. In the Outline of World History, Wells particularly "downgraded" Napoleon, saying that this ambitious man had no achievements. In terms of his destructive power, it was not as great as the impact of an epidemic on humans. But soon Europe saw a second Napoleon, and this new ambitious man almost sent troops to land in Mr. Wells' hometown. When London was heavily bombed, I wonder what Mr. Wells thought? Fortunately, this second Napoleon soon met with complete failure and committed suicide in a hurry, I am afraid that even the will did not have much time to consider. Wells was able to stick to his claim again. Decades later, people will certainly look down on Hitler's achievements, and may even doubt his destructive capacity. I think Mr. Wells can now die with a smile.

Opposing militarism is one side of his thought, and the other side is of course to build a peaceful and global new culture. Wells can use his novels to please young people, and use his historical works to make middle-aged people contemplate, but he cannot live forever and wait for this ideal to be realized. The responsibility of those who die later, this idiom will have to be said again.

### Double Horse Yarn Black Market Resurgence; Allocation of Raw Cotton Calculated at New Exchange Rate, Causing Sharp Increase; Hoping Central Textiles Will Not Use This as a Pretext to Raise Prices

[Our Newspaper's Report] The price of yarn has been stimulated since the exchange rate fluctuations. The price of "Star One Double Horse" yarn soared to 1.6 million, which was shocking. Subsequently, due to Mayor Wu's warning, the price of open invoices returned to 1.2 million plus. It is heard that some who had already settled at the high price are requesting refunds. Moreover, this time the Central Textiles' price has not risen sharply with the exchange rate, which has stabilized people's minds considerably. However, yesterday the black market price of "Double Horse" yarn reached 1.5 million plus, and the factory price was 1.3 million plus. Insiders revealed that the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration allocated over 20,000 bales of raw cotton to various yarn factories some time ago, but the foreign exchange settlement has not yet been finalized. Recently, factories were suddenly notified that settlement must be based on the new exchange rate, causing renewed upward pressure on prices. According to authoritative sources in the yarn factory industry, the government is suppressing commodity prices and goods already allocated should be settled at the old exchange rate. Furthermore, factories have ample cotton reserves, and the cost of pulling yarn is relatively low. Even with the stimulation of the new exchange rate settlement, the price increase will be limited. Well-informed sources point out that over the past six months, foreign cotton has been in high demand, and the surging yarn prices have prompted the cotton yarn reproduction industry to appeal to the relevant authorities. Mayor Wu's office has also received a written report. If Central Textiles can maintain its policy and not use this as a pretext to raise prices, the yarn factory industry will not take action to stimulate commodity prices. It is also reported that the industry will hold a meeting this Saturday to discuss ways to assist government orders and suppress commodity prices.

Another report states that the yarn market was quite strong yesterday. The Cantonese merchants' buying interest remained high, absorbing a significant amount of 32-count "Blue State Phoenix" fine yarn. Mainland merchants were also purchasing, leading to an increase of 20,000 to 30,000 for 20-count yarn and 50,000 to 60,000 for 42-count doubled yarn. The sentiment was optimistic. Due to the high cost of raw materials, yarn factories were reluctant to sell. At noon, "Fangjian" company posted its price at a fair level, and buyers were extremely enthusiastic, but the supply was insufficient, and each buyer only received a very small allocation.

### Cotton Cloth Transactions Decline; Off-Market Sentiment Strong

Since "Fangjian" started selling at non-increased prices, the cloth market trend has become moderate. "Colorful Ball," "Five Blessings," and other fine cloth delivery notes were sold at a premium of 1,000 yuan over "Fangjian"'s price. Sellers of "Biji" [a type of woolen fabric] delivery notes were more numerous, with a premium of 750 yuan. However, spot transactions have decreased. Subsequently, it was learned that the Central Bank is still trying its best to maintain gold prices, stabilizing market prices and slightly restoring confidence. Fine cloth delivery note prices fell by 500 yuan, and "Biji" fell by 250 yuan. Spot transactions in the market were scarce, and there was not much change in the transaction desks, but off-market sentiment was strong. The situation was even more so in the afternoon.

### Major Investors Seize Opportunity for Squeeze; Chinese Stocks Rebound Yesterday

Chinese stocks suddenly showed a rebound yesterday. Cantonese investors bought into yarn factories, and major investor Yang heavily invested in Mei Ya, turning from short to long positions. The market suddenly became tight. Yong Yarn closed at 630 yuan, and Mei Ya at 3350 yuan, both at high prices. Jingfu and Xinguang each started at 203 yuan, and Qinxing at 153 yuan. After a slight midday rally, the short sellers were cornered, giving major investors an opportunity for a squeeze. The less active stocks, medium-sized stocks rebounded from lows to break-even, and small-sized stocks mostly recovered. Senior stocks showed signs of promise and made slight progress. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yong Yarn slightly rose, Mei Ya rose nearly 10%, Xinguang and Jingfu rose limitedly, and Qinxing also rose by more than half a percent. Most of the less active medium and small-sized stocks rose, and senior stocks also made slight gains.

Foreign stocks showed mixed performance. Major investors, such as Ruofu Da, favored British United, which rose sharply from 9600 yuan in the morning to 1000 yuan before pausing. Although Yisha rose to 9650 yuan, it was difficult to sustain. A few small stocks did not have time to follow suit and continued to decline. As a result, British United rose by half a percent compared to the previous close, steel and paper slightly declined, and the rest were relatively stable.

### Tea Merchants Hope for Subsidies; New Tea Still Not Profitable; Old Tea Definitely Benefited; Labor Costs and Tea Boxes Both Request a 50% Increase

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, Mr. Tang Jishan, Chairman of the Shanghai Tea Export Association, told reporters that the government's adjustment of the exchange rate has indeed helped the export of old tea to a considerable extent. However, it is still quite short for new tea, because the production cost of new tea is really too expensive. It is reported that the current price limit for medium and high-grade old Keemun black tea from the UK is three shillings per pound. The US price limit for our black tea is 57 cents per pound, and for first-grade Pearl Tea, it is 48 cents per pound. Now, the production cost of new tea exceeds this price limit by a factor of two. Therefore, although the exchange rate has increased by 60%, the export price of new tea is still expensive after conversion. He strongly advocates that the government should adopt a subsidy policy for the export of new tea, so as to give practical assistance to tea merchants, strengthen their strength, and regain the original sales channels and international markets. As for the government buying out the tea, Mr. Tang believes that the tea merchants' original foreign customers will disappear as a result of barter trade, so the subsidy method is better. According to Mr. Tang, the most benefited by this exchange rate adjustment are tea merchants who still hold old tea inventory. Exporters who do not have goods on hand still cannot profit. Moreover, US importers have sent telegrams requesting a reduction in tea prices since hearing about the exchange rate adjustment. Furthermore, tea workers have recently requested a 50% increase in wages, and the price of tea boxes is also planned to increase by 50% each.

### President Song Specially Appoints Xu Xueyu to Fly to Taiwan

Regarding the matter of transporting Taiwan Rice to Shanghai

The President of the Executive Yuan is very concerned about the supply of rice and the fluctuation of rice prices in this city. In view of the fact that Taiwan province produces abundant rice, it is now time for new rice to come on the market. Using it to aid Shanghai will definitely regulate supply and demand and suppress rice prices. The President of the Executive Yuan has specially appointed Mr. Xu Xueyu, General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to fly to Taiwan yesterday to negotiate with the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office on the matter of transporting Taiwan rice to Shanghai for assistance. It is believed that after Taiwan rice is continuously transported to Shanghai, the rice price in Shanghai can be further suppressed.

### Mayor Wu Instructs That Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Should Return to Original Prices

Vegetables are also not allowed to increase in price

The prices of miscellaneous grains and oil cakes have fluctuated greatly since the adjustment of the foreign exchange rate on the 19th of this month. Taking soybean oil as an example, the selling price before the 19th of this month was 74,000 yuan per dan. On that day, it rose to 82,000 yuan per dan. On the 20th, the price slightly recovered, and the selling price was 78,000 yuan per dan. On the 21st, the price of soybean oil gradually stabilized. Mayor Wu specially summoned Mr. Zhang Chao, Chairman of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Retailers Association, and Mr. Fu Changyu, Chairman of the Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Business Association, to the municipal government for talks yesterday (the 21st) morning. He told them that the rising prices of miscellaneous grains and oil cakes were completely unreasonable, and the person in charge of the association should immediately convene a meeting of the industry to ensure that the prices return to the level before the exchange rate adjustment. Mr. Fu Changyu, Chairman of the Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Business Association, and others solemnly stated that they would definitely follow the Mayor's instructions and urge the industry to comply. However, they requested that non-oil merchants who are supplied by the China Vegetable Oil Factory should also join the industry association. Mayor Wu approved the association's written request and waited for the government to consider and handle it.

In addition, the prices of vegetables and other items have also been on the rise in the past three days. Mayor Wu also summoned Mr. Zhang Shouren, Chairman of the Vegetable Industry Business Association, and others to the municipal government for talks on the previous two days. He sincerely told them that vegetables are daily necessities for citizens and should not be increased in price arbitrarily. If there are any difficulties, they are allowed to report to the Mayor in person or in writing, and the government will definitely do its best to help solve them.

### Lun Chang's Delivery Notes: Procedures for Return Agreed Upon; 20,000 Pieces to Be Returned First, Remaining to Be Reserved; Outlying Areas to Be Handled Separately by the Company

[Our Newspaper's Report] Before the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8, 1941, the British-owned Lun Chang Dyeing, Bleaching, and Printing Company sold various fabrics to cotton cloth merchants in this city and outlying areas, totaling more than 100,000 pieces. Due to the impact of the war, the goods could not be delivered. After the victory, the people holding the delivery notes in this city requested the Cotton Cloth Business Association to negotiate with Lun Chang to fulfill the delivery. The company claimed that the goods had been seized by the Japanese enemy and had not been resolved. Later, it was discovered that more than 36,000 pieces of cloth were left in the Nanmu warehouse, and the Association repeatedly requested the Su, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau to return them. The Bureau approved the allocation according to the proportion of cloth quantity recorded by Lun Chang on December 8, 1941. However, the holders of the delivery notes were not satisfied with the joint proportional distribution method with Lun Chang. After convening a meeting, representatives were sent to continue to negotiate with Lun Chang. As a result, the factory agreed to allocate 20,000 pieces from the more than 36,000 pieces to the holders of the delivery notes for distribution. The holders of the delivery notes also decided in principle to accept this and organized four committees: evaluation, distribution, accounting, and custody. They also agreed to further negotiate with Lun Chang on the signing of the agreement. The procedures had been reported in the previous newspaper. According to inquiries, the holders of the delivery notes have reached a preliminary agreement with Lun Chang to prepare for the signing of a contract. The content of the agreement is as follows: (1) 20,000 pieces will be allocated to the holders of the delivery notes in this city first, and the rest will be reserved for further discussion; (2) Delivery notes from outlying areas will be handled by Lun Chang independently; (3) After the official signing of the contract, the total number of cloth pieces recorded on the delivery notes and the number of allocated pieces will be evaluated according to market prices and distributed proportionally; (4) The amount of distribution will be jointly verified by the holders, and after certification by the Association, Lun Chang will distribute the cloth pieces separately and endorse the delivery notes before returning them to the holders for storage. This delivery note dispute caused by the war can be considered to have come to an end. We await the signing of the contract.

### Chamber of Commerce Actively Restores the Commodity Display Center

In order to promote domestic goods, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is actively preparing to establish a commodity display center. The original site of the Chamber of Commerce's commodity display center was located at No. 59, South and North Road, Tianhou Temple Bridge. It was built by the Chamber of Commerce in the 10th year of the Republic of China (1921) with funds raised. Over the years, it collected local products, handicrafts, and machine-made domestic goods from all over the country, numbering tens of thousands of varieties. It was open every day for people to view. It was the most complete commodity display center in the country. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the center was located in a restricted area, and all the exhibits and valuable display cabinets and furniture could not be moved out. They were all stolen and sold by the enemy puppets, resulting in huge losses. The building was also occupied by the puppet Chinese Daily. After the victory, the Chamber of Commerce was busy organizing the reorganization and re-election of various industry associations and did not have time to recover it. Now, the ownership of the center has been returned to the Chamber of Commerce by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, and the Youth Daily has been notified to move out. Therefore, the fourth executive committee meeting decided to actively find ways to recover the commodity display center building and appointed Wu Jichun to concurrently handle the restoration of the commodity display center. It has now notified the return of the center's address and is planning to restore the display equipment. It will soon consult with various industries to collect exhibits.
