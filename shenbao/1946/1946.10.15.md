### The Door to Peace Opens Further: The Government Prepares for an Immediate Ceasefire; Chairman Proposes a Three-to-Five Person Meeting First

[United Press, Nanjing, 14th] Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke and Political Consultative Conference (PCC) Secretary-General Shao Lizi stated today that the government is willing to issue a ceasefire order. According to President Sun, they are also reconvening the PCC Comprehensive Group and the Constitutional Draft Review Group, but with certain conditions: the Communist Party must also issue a ceasefire order, and Zhou Enlai must return to Nanjing to participate in a three-person meeting to handle various technical issues, before the government can issue the ceasefire order.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] After President Sun Ke returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 13th, he presented the consensus of opinions gathered with government representatives on national affairs to the Chairman when he was summoned on the afternoon of the 14th. The Chairman agreed, and the consensus was to be conveyed by PCC Secretary-General Lei Zhen via special train to the various parties in Shanghai tonight. Whether there will be a turning point in the situation will depend on the response from Shanghai. A decision is expected within a day or two. Those summoned by the Chairman at his official residence on the afternoon of the 14th were Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Chen Bulei, Chen Lifu, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Dingchang, and Lei Zhen. Sun Ke reported on his meetings with various parties in Shanghai and the opinions they offered, as well as the results of yesterday's discussions. After listening to the report, the Chairman gave instructions and summoned Lei Zhen again at 5:00 PM for further instructions. This newspaper's reporter specifically visited President Sun at his private residence at 8:00 PM in the afternoon, who made the following remarks: "During my visit to Shanghai, I met with people from various parties, and many opinions were provided. However, the National Army's entry into Zhangjiakou on the 11th of this month and the announcement of the National Assembly convocation order the following day led some people to believe that the government had closed the door to peace and that further negotiations were impossible. Upon my return to Nanjing, I explained this to the government and awaited their opinion. The view in Shanghai is not entirely correct. Although the National Assembly convocation order has been issued, there are still over twenty days before the meeting, and if negotiations are possible, it is not too late. The most urgent matters for negotiation are: 1. Cessation of military conflict; 2. Government reorganization; 3. Participation of all parties in the National Assembly; 4. The issue of constitutional draft amendments. I will explain each separately as follows: First, the government is not only willing to negotiate a cessation of military conflict but also desires it as soon as possible. However, a ceasefire is a matter for both sides. In the past, both sides had agreements and issued ceasefire orders, but they could not be maintained, and military conflict remained unavoidable. Therefore, it is now necessary to find a thorough ceasefire solution. Both sides must negotiate and reach an agreement that both sides adhere to in order to achieve lasting peace. Therefore, in order to discuss the ceasefire issue, a three-person military conference must be convened immediately to implement the ceasefire as soon as possible.

Hoping Zhou Enlai Returns to Beijing and Immediately Participates in Negotiations

We also hope that Zhou Enlai will come to Beijing immediately to attend and participate in the negotiations. Second, regarding the reorganization of the government, Ambassador Stuart proposed convening an informal five-person group to specifically discuss the issue of government reorganization. When the suggestion was made, Zhou Enlai expressed his agreement, but it eventually stalled. Now it should be realized. After an agreement is reached, the PCC Comprehensive Group can be convened. In this way, the matter of participating in the National Assembly and submitting a list of names can be resolved sequentially. Third, the purpose of convening the National Assembly is to enact a constitution. The PCC Constitutional Draft Review Committee has been meeting and studying at any time since early February. The entire constitutional draft has been discussed. However, before the return to the capital, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had stated that even if the constitutional draft went through the review process, it should still be reserved in its entirety. The government also expressed agreement. Therefore, although the study is complete, it cannot be established without mutual agreement. Therefore, the Constitutional Draft Review Committee should be convened immediately to continue its unfinished task and submit it to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process before submitting it to the National Assembly for enactment." Sun continued that the most important military matters are ceasefire, reorganization, and unified command, which must be negotiated by a three-person military group. In the political field, a five-person group should discuss government reorganization. Once an agreement is reached, the government can implement the reorganization. If an agreement can be reached on everything before the National Assembly convenes, the National Assembly can be held under the new government after reorganization. Finally, Sun emphasized that the door to peace is not only not closed, but is even more open. He hopes that the Communist Party, the Democratic League, and various other parties will return to Beijing as soon as possible to conduct the meetings of the various groups. What I presented to the government upon my return to Beijing were the points mentioned above. The various parties must proceed according to these steps in order to achieve a solution to all the problems. I believe that the future is very promising. The reporter then took his leave. It is understood that these opinions have been approved by the Chairman.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] With peace talks stalled, the two ambassadors, Stuart and Ma, have been less active. On the afternoon of the 14th, at 2:30 PM, British Ambassador Stevenson visited Ambassador Stuart for nearly an hour. Ambassador Stuart then visited Soviet Ambassador Petrov. An hour later, he visited Foreign Minister Wang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and revisited Special Envoy Ma, returning at 7:00 PM. Ambassador Stuart is scheduled to visit Hangzhou on the 18th and return to Beijing on the 21st, reportedly accompanied by Berg.

### Lei Zhen's Mission to Shanghai: To Visit Representatives of Various Parties

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] PCC Secretary-General Lei Zhen traveled to Shanghai by car tonight. It is understood that Lei will visit representatives of various parties in Shanghai to exchange views on the current situation.

[This Newspaper Report] After the recovery of Zhangjiakou, the CCP in Shanghai has remained silent. However, many believe that the door to peace has not been closed. After Youth Party leader Li Huang returned to Shanghai from Beijing, he convened a meeting of the leaders of the Third Force remaining in Shanghai at the Youth Party headquarters on Haig Road late the night before last. Huang Yanpei was ill, Qian Xinbo did not go out at night due to foot problems, and Guo Moruo was too far away in Hongkou to attend, so only Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Yang Yongjun, and Li Huang of the Youth Party, and Luo Longji, Zhang Junli, Shen Junru, Liang Shuming, and Zhang Bojun of the Democratic League attended. Li Huang gave a report during the meeting. Yesterday morning, the government's PCC representatives also held talks in Beijing and reported the results of the talks to the Chairman. PCC Secretary-General Lei Zhen rushed to Shanghai yesterday afternoon and visited Zuo Shunsheng to discuss matters at 10:00 PM. Observers generally believe that Lei has notified the Third Force in Shanghai of the resolutions of the government's PCC representatives.

According to a certain PCC representative of the Third Force who has participated in previous talks: If the government is unwilling to include the Third Force and convenes the National Assembly as scheduled, or if the CCP withdraws from negotiations and launches a guerrilla war, it would not be a proper way to solve the problem, even for the sake of both sides. On the contrary, if it can be done appropriately and the PCC group is convened first, the Third Force has no reason to refuse to participate. The PCC Act proposal was jointly signed by thirty-eight representatives of various parties, and they should all abide by it. There is no other way to follow.

[Central News Agency, This City] After taking the oath of office, Party Headquarters Director Fang, along with Secretary-General Xie Renzhao and Committee Member Chen Hua, visited the leaders of various parties in Shanghai for the first time yesterday afternoon. They met with Zhou Enlai and urged him to go to Beijing as soon as possible to discuss peace plans. At the same time, they visited Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Junli, Zeng Qi, Shen Junru, and Zhang Bojun, hoping to promote peace and unity and jointly participate in the National Assembly.

### CCP Delegation Denies Imminent Departure from Nanjing

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Liang Shuming visited Lei Zhen on the morning of the 14th to protest against newspaper reports about the Communist Party registering unemployed employees of the Democratic League. He visited Mo Dehui in the afternoon for a long conversation. There was talk of Mo going to Shanghai. The CCP delegation had no activities on the 14th. The spokesperson only made the following two points of clarification: First, they deny that the CCP office is withdrawing from Nanjing. Second, they deny that the CCP has declared a proactive, comprehensive breakdown.

### Hong Lanyou Visits Yu Dawei to Discuss Air Transport of National Assembly Representatives; Reporters to be Included in the Invited Group

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, has been extremely busy preparing for the National Assembly. He held meetings all day on the 13th. Hong told reporters on the evening of the 14th that the work of the Assembly's news group will be handled by the Central Propaganda Department. The News Group will be responsible for allowing reporters to attend and listen. The original plan for 120 reporter seats has been expanded to avoid disappointment. Hong also said that reporters would be included in the invited group for this Assembly. Although they will not receive the same treatment as the representatives, they can enjoy equal convenience, making their status at the Assembly comparable to that of reporters attending some international conferences. A special lounge for reporters is set up next to the Assembly hall. Each major newspaper will have more than one seat. The Assembly hall will be completely decorated by the end of the month, at which time reporters will be invited to visit and report. The Preparatory Committee will end its work the month before, and the Assembly Secretariat will handle the opening of the Assembly. Regarding transportation for representatives from various locations to Beijing, Hong discussed it with Minister Yu Jiaju on the morning of the 14th, and there should be no problem. In addition to China and Central Airlines, the Air Transport Brigade can also assist. The locations and times for representatives from various places to gather will be announced soon. There are approximately three gathering points in each province, with Xuzhou, Zhenjiang, and Shanghai for Jiangsu. Notifications have been sent to the representatives today to prepare to gather. Regarding the list of National Assembly members, Hong said that a portion can be officially announced by the National Government on the 15th. The lists of the various parties are still being urged.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] After the convocation order for the National Assembly was issued as scheduled, the attitudes of the various parties have not been fully clarified, and the future of the peace talks is still unclear. When the reporter inquired with a certain authoritative source, it was said that the government is absolutely determined to convene the National Assembly as scheduled and still hopes that the various parties will participate as scheduled. Negotiations on this matter have been underway recently, and there may be considerable results. If they cannot gather as scheduled, it is fortunate that the Assembly period is very long, and they can participate at any time. It was also said that all parties are still working hard on the peace talks. The government is enduring for the sake of the country, and it is expected that there will be concessions in the political field. If the Communist Party prioritizes the country, it will not tend towards extremism.

### Calm on the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] As the great battle in Chahar comes to an end, the northern section of the Pinghan Railway is showing a calm before the storm. The National Army's forces are gradually increasing, while the Communist Army is holding its ground. Both sides seem to be preparing. Last night, a section of the railway south of Zhuozhou was damaged. Trains southward to Zhuozhou and northward from Shijiazhuang are running to Dingzhou on the 14th, but the Xinle Railway Bridge requires pedestrian connection.

### Communist Army in Suide, Northern Shaanxi, Attacks the Border of Yulin; Communist Army Raiding Old City of Gui Sui Suppressed

[This Newspaper, Tianjin, 14th] Wu Daifeng, commander of the Communist Army's Suide Garrison in northern Shaanxi, recently led more than 20,000 troops to invade the border of Yulin, advancing towards Zhenchuanbao and Wuzhen, Hengshan, which are 130 li from Yulin. The National Army intercepted and resisted, and fighting has been ongoing since the 13th. Many believe that the Communist Army intends to capture Yulin. The Yulin military authorities are properly planning defenses.

[Central News Agency, Guisui, 13th] A small group of the Communist Army raided the southwest corner of the old city of Guisui at 9:00 PM on the 13th and were immediately suppressed.

[This Newspaper, Taizhou, 14th] The recovery of Xinghua County is only a matter of time. The county government, which has been exiled here, has been working with unusual intensity recently to prepare to enter.

### National Army Units on Both Banks of the Grand Canal Have Converged at Sishui Town

[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 13th] On the 12th, National Army units from both the north and south ends along the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu converged at Sishui Town (north of Jieshou) between Gaoyou and Xianying. On the 13th, several refugees from Lianshui came north from Yangzhou by land and arrived in Huaiyin. It is estimated here that once this route is open, the refugees gathered in Nanjing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and other places will return to their homes in large numbers in a short period of time. Therefore, relief work urgently requires the full cooperation of all parties. The Huaiyin Special Commissioner's Office announced that the total number of displaced people from the six counties of Huaiyin, Huaian, Lianshui, Funing, Suqian, and Siyang has reached 1,040,000.

### Armistice Along the Jiaoji Railway Line

Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu Retreats Back into Shandong Province

[This Newspaper, Jinan, 13th] The Jiaoji Railway line has entered a temporary armistice. Although the Communist Army in eastern Shandong has withdrawn from the transportation lines, 20,000 to 30,000 troops remain in the area 8 to 12 kilometers south and north of Gaomi, with the intention of launching further military operations at any time. Traffic along the Jiaoji Railway line is now completely under the control of the National Army. Cars can travel directly between Jinan and Qingdao by the middle of next month, but full train service will have to wait until around the New Year. In the areas recovered by the National Army in southwestern Shandong, local order has been largely stabilized. The Yang Yong unit of the Communist Army's Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, totaling 30,000 to 40,000 troops, has withdrawn from southwestern Shandong and gathered in the Fanxian, Shouzhang, and Yanggu areas of northwestern Shandong, preparing to resist the National Army heading north. The New Fourth Army, which went to northern Jiangsu to fight, is also gradually retreating back to Shandong. Its First Division recently passed through Linyi and headed north, reaching the Yishui area, apparently for replenishment and reorganization. Its future intentions are still difficult to determine.

### Commander Sun Lianzhong Returns to Beiping from the Front Lines

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Sun Lianzhong, commander of the Eleventh War Zone, has been traveling back and forth between the front lines and Beiping for days, extremely fatigued. He returned from the front lines last night, his feet muddy, and reported to Chief of Staff Chen immediately without resting. According to someone familiar with the Chahar campaign, the Communist Army's greatest failure was in its lack of strategic understanding, focusing only on the front and neglecting the emptiness behind, which led to Fu Zuoyi's troops advancing rapidly and descending from the north in one fell swoop. On the Zhangjiakou-Huailai front, although the Communist Army's frontal resistance was strong, the National Army's left and right wings encircled and bypassed Huailai, entering the Xiahuayuan in one fell swoop, forming a large encirclement. More than 30,000 Communist troops were annihilated within this encirclement, with more than half being溃灭, which was another major miscalculation by the Communist Army. The Communist Army originally planned to send a division to cut off the Pinghan Railway and threaten Tianjin and Beiping to achieve a diversionary effect, but the result was only minor disturbances on the Pinghan Railway, and they did not dare to spy on Tianjin and Beiping. This plan also failed.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng remained in Beiping on the 14th and went out to inspect at one point. He was originally scheduled to leave Beiping and return to Nanjing on the 15th, but he may delay it by one day because he is rushing to complete the official business under his direction.

[This Newspaper, Guisui, 14th] Commander Fu Zuoyi flew to Zhangjiakou by special plane at 2:00 PM on the 14th for inspection.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Sources stated that the Fu Zuoyi and Sun Lianzhong units of the National Army in eastern Chahar converged east of Xuanhua last night, but according to the Twelfth War Zone, there are still strongholds between Xuanhua and Xiahuayuan that have not been recovered, so the two armies may have converged on the evening of the 14th. In other news, the National Army that recovered Huailai and Xiahuayuan has sent a division south in pursuit and will soon recover Zhuolu. The Du Yuming unit that recovered Duolun has rushed to Zhangjiakou and converged with the Fu Zuoyi unit. It is also reported that the Fu unit advancing west from Zhangjiakou is approaching Chaigoubu and will soon converge with another unit advancing east from the western section of the Ping Sui Railway.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] After the National Army on the Ping Sui Line completely recovered Huailai on the 13th, the Communist Army in the Huailai-Yanqing area fled into the mountains north of Huailai and west of Yanqing, while the main force fled southwest of Huailai into the 　Shanbao area. The National Army has advanced west past Tumubao and Sangyuan.

[This Newspaper, Guisui, 13th] The Communist Army near Zhangjiakou has collapsed towards Weixian through Kongjiazhuang and Zuo Weicheng. The city's electricity, water, and the important buildings of Qinghe Bridge have been completely destroyed. The station only has one freight car. The two airfields about 15 li from the city were also destroyed. After the engineers rushed to repair them, planes landed on the 13th. The Communist Army Security Brigade that surrendered in Shangdu automatically organized a anti-traitor group and destroyed the administrative organization of the Communist Party's seven districts. Lu Ping, the Communist County Chief of Wuyun, recently led 200 Communist troops to brutally kill people who responded to the National Army in Liangcheng Changhanying.

A large number of National Army troops have been rushing north from southern Shanxi to reinforce Datong and relieve the siege.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 14th] The Communist Army is attacking Datong again from the north and northwest of the city. Although the Communist side claims that Datong is isolated again, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense said that the Communist Army's new offensive against Datong is not a serious threat, because the strength of the Communist Army in that section of northern Shanxi does not exceed 5,000 men.

### Frequent Communist Army Movements in Northern Shanxi

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] According to sources, amidst the National Army's advance on Zhangjiakou, the Communist Army in northern Shanxi is moving frequently. The He Long unit, which collapsed from Jining and Fengzhen to Zuoyun and Youyu, has been reorganized and moved to the area south of Huairen, numbering approximately 6,000 to 7,000. The Communist Army has also transferred more than 3,000 troops from the vicinity of Zhouzhuang north of Shanyin. Approximately 6,000 Communist troops have also gathered in the area near Hunyuan, all of whom are actively building fortifications and conscripting grain and labor, attempting to defend the corridor from northern Shaanxi to the Taihang Mountains.

### Minister Bai Reports on Military Reorganization, Declaring He Does Not Wish to Eliminate the Communist Army, Hoping They Will Not Seize Territory and Obstruct Peace

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The Central Memorial Week was held at 9:00 AM on the 14th. Chairman Chiang himself led the ceremony. Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi attended and reported on military affairs. Bai first discussed the reorganization of the army after the victory of the War of Resistance. He stated that the purpose of military reorganization is to establish a modern army, navy, and air force to defend the country. The reorganization work south of the Longhai Railway has been underway, and the troops north of the Longhai Railway should also be reorganized. Unfortunately, the Communist Army did not abide by repeated ceasefire agreements, raised troops and created chaos, and even attacked Nantong, almost threatening Nanjing and Shanghai. The government had the Battle of Northern Jiangsu to protect the local area and the people. Bai then reported on the military situation on the Longhai, Jiaoji, Tongpu, and Tianjin-Beiping lines. He continued that the soldiers across the country, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang and the command of Chief of Staff Chen, were forced to use troops, but the ultimate goal is still peaceful reunification and the implementation of the nationalization of the army, not allowing any one person or party to have its own army. Therefore, militarily speaking, we do not want to eliminate the Communist Army, but only hope that the Communist Army will be reorganized into the national army, will not seize territory, and will not hinder the work of restoring transportation, so as to achieve peaceful reunification as soon as possible and establish a new country of the Three Principles of the People.

### Zheng Jiemin to Return to Beijing

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Zheng Jiemin, the government member of the Military Mediation Headquarters, will return to Beijing to report on his work within a day or two. Ji Lun began working at the headquarters on the 14th. The personnel on the Communist side appear quite deserted.

### The United States Should Help Chairman Chiang Establish a Coalition Government

Commentary in the New York Times

[Central News Agency, New York, 13th] The New York Times wrote in its commentary today that the Communist Party's loss of Zhangjiakou was the most serious failure since the end of the war. The United States should fully assist Chairman Chiang in establishing a feasible coalition government. Marshall will not return home, and the United States will not withdraw its small number of troops stationed in China. We can and must hope to obtain some kind of Chinese-style compromise to save "face." The greatest difficulty is mixing two opposing ideals in a democratic government. Although the political ideals of the two sides are very different, Chairman Chiang is above the two parties. He has made some concessions and sincerely wants to establish a feasible coalition government.

### Cü Zheng's Resignation Intent Firm

Vice President Qin Zhen Also Submits Resignation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Judiciary Yuan President Cü Zheng's recent submission of his resignation to the Executive Committee and the National Government Chairman Jiang, indicates a rather resolute intention to retire. His resignation had already been drafted a month ago. Recently, with the term of office of the National Government Committee expiring on National Day, he formally submitted it to the highest authorities. He himself expressed to those around him that he believed it would certainly be approved. It is heard that if Cü retires, his possible successors will be Zhang Ji, Wang Huijü, or Zou Lu. However, it is generally believed that before the National Congress is convened, his resignation will likely not be accepted by the highest authorities, as Chairman Jiang and Cü have a very close friendship. On the eve of National Day, he personally visited him at the Central Hospital in a light car with a small entourage, and they spoke at length for about fifteen minutes. Furthermore, the 17th of this month (the 23rd day of the ninth lunar month) is Cü's seventy-first birthday. Cü will soon return to his ancestral home in Guangji for a visit.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Judiciary Yuan Vice President Qin Zhen, since being transferred from the Vice President of the Legislative Yuan to his current position, was elected as a member of the National Government Committee in the thirty-second year of the Republic. He concurrently served as the Vice President of the Yuan. Recently, due to the expiration of his term as a committee member and being plagued by old age and illness, he decided to retire on his own initiative. He has submitted requests to the Central Committee and the National Government Chairman Jiang, to resign from his position as a member of the National Government Committee, as well as from his substantive and concurrent positions as Vice President of the Court. It is said that he has also requested to resign from his concurrent position as Chairman of the Central Government Employees Disciplinary Committee.

### US-UK-Soviet Potsdam Agreement Secret Parts Should Be Published - Request of the US Policy Association

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The US Policy Association, on the 13th, issued a letter through its treasurer, Kerber, requesting President Truman to publicly announce the rumored "secret Potsdam Agreement concerning China." The association stated that the existence of this agreement "has been confirmed to this association by the State Department." However, the State Department officially denies this point. Mr. Kerber published the correspondence between the association and the State Department to prove the secret agreement concerning China made by Stalin, Truman, and Attlee at the third Potsdam Conference in 1945. According to the letter, the US Policy Association, in a letter to Secretary of State Acheson, accused the secret Potsdam Agreement of containing the following provisions: (1) Outer Mongolia's separation from China, which violates the terms of the Yalta Secret Agreement. (2) The division of Korea. (3) Granting the Soviet Union extra reparations from Northeast China. (4) Forcing the Chinese government to accept the Chinese Communist Party organization into a coalition government without dissolving or merging the CCP's original army. (5) If the United States cannot compel China to implement items 1, 3, and 4, then the Soviet Union will take action and be solely responsible. The China Desk of the State Department denied the above-mentioned specific provisions, stating that they "have no factual basis," but did not explicitly deny the existence of a certain secret agreement. According to the letter revealed by Kerber, he wrote to the State Department twice, on September 13th and 26th, stating that based on the State Department's reply, he believed it sufficient to prove that there was indeed a secret agreement concerning China at the Potsdam Conference. He asked the State Department whether this interpretation was incorrect, but the State Department has not replied. However, today, a responsible official of the State Department related to this matter told reporters that "no agreement concerning China was concluded" at the Potsdam Conference. At the same time, the State Department does not intend to notify the association of this view again.

Lady Cripps said to the welcoming staff at the airport: "I am very honored and pleased to be visiting your country's capital. This time, I was also able to pay my respects to Chairman Jiang and his wife, which I will always remember. I have never felt like a stranger in your country, because about seven years ago, when my husband, Mr. Cripps, met with Chairman Jiang in Chongqing, the Chinese people treated him with such friendship and care, as if I were there myself. Now I am about to begin visiting various parts of your country, and the convenience you have given me has given me the courage to observe all aspects of the lives of your people, and I hope to improve them. Britain will deeply appreciate this expression of your friendship. I very much hope that upon returning to Nanjing, I can report to you everything I have seen. Furthermore, I believe that being able to enter the interior of China is the greatest experience that anyone could hope for."

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Lady Cripps and her party arrived safely at Jiulongpo Airport at 2:30 p.m. today. Heads of various Chongqing agencies and leaders from all walks of life were at the scene to welcome them. They then entered the city and went to the Lizhi Society reception center to rest.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Lady Cripps hosted the press at 9 p.m. at the Chairman's wartime capital residence, reporting on the significance and work of the Aid China Society. She said: Chongqing and London both suffered equally brutal bombings during the war and were able to stand firm until victory. In addition to admiration, I cannot help but recall the necessity and value of Sino-British friendship. I am very grateful for the warm welcome I have received from all parties during this visit to China. Later, the reporters asked questions, and Lady Cripps and the General Secretary of the Association, Mrs. Miller, replied, saying: The future direction of the British Aid China Association's work will depend on the entire economic environment of the British Empire. The funds they donate do not come from wealthy merchants, but from ordinary British citizens who are sympathetic to China, accumulating small amounts into large ones. However, they will continue to maintain the donation of one penny per week from 780,000 people and other fundraising. This donation is purely raised for the people, regardless of party affiliation and without political overtones. Therefore, she will go to the Communist area on the 27th or 28th at the invitation of Zhou Enlai to inspect various military hospitals that receive this donation.

### Fuxin Coal Mine in Rehe Province - Reserves are the Largest in the Far East - The Government Allocates 70 Billion for Development

[United Press, Tianjin, 14th] Local newspapers report that during the occupation of Rehe Province, the Japanese spent a large sum of money and considerable time and effort to increase coal production at the Fuxin Coal Mine in Rehe Province.

### Our Tungsten Production - Efforts are Being Made to Increase It

[Central News Agency, This City] Our country has the most tungsten production and the best quality. A person in charge of the Foreign Trade Office of the Resources Committee recently told a reporter: Our country's tungsten production is gradually increasing. In the year since the victory, production has not increased compared to before the war due to political instability and unstable prices. Because tungsten is one of the important non-ferrous metals in heavy industry, the government has always controlled it from before the war to the present. Merchants are not allowed to transport it freely, and its sales are managed by the Foreign Trade Office. It is one of our country's important exports in the international trade market. Therefore, the mines in the tungsten producing areas are all state-owned. Tungsten ore can be refined and then exported, but because the cost is high, only tungsten ore is exported. It is transported to countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. In addition, the production and sales of zinc are also state-owned, and free trade is not allowed. Our country's smelting technology for antimony is quite good, and it can be smelted to 99.9%. Ordinary countries only smelt antimony to 99.75%. Therefore, from a technical point of view, our country is not inferior to foreign countries. Only after the overall national economy stabilizes, will the production and sales of this rare metal be of considerable benefit to the country's income.

### Northeast Cement Industry

Of the Original Fourteen Factories Including Jilin, Less Than Half Now Remain

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 14th] In the past, the cement industry in the Northeast, operated by the Japanese, included fourteen factories: Dalian, Jilin, Liaoyang, Fushun, Benxi Lake, Harbin, Quanzhou, Anshan, Jinxi, Miyahara, Miaoling, Andong, Mudanjiang, and Xiaotun. The highest annual output reached 2.16 million tons, exceeding the total output of all cement plants within the customs. Currently, the Jilin, Quanzhou, and Miyahara factories have been completely destroyed. The Harbin, Dalian, and Mudanjiang factories are still in the hands of the Communists. The Anshan factory has been destroyed by more than 60%. The Jinxi, Liaoyang, and Fushun factories have machines that are mostly outdated. The damage to other factories is relatively minor. It is estimated that after resumption of work, the output will be less than half of what it was in the past, but within the country, it will still occupy a significant position.

### Zhang Xiaomei to Go Abroad Tomorrow to Inspect the Economy

First Flies to Japan, Then to the United States

[This City News] Dr. Zhang Xiaomei, a specialist member of the Supreme National Defense Council, has recently been dispatched by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to inspect overseas economies. He is scheduled to take a US transport plane tomorrow (16th) to Tokyo first, where he will stay for ten weeks to observe Japan's post-war recovery. He will then transfer to New York and Washington, with an estimated itinerary of about six months in the United States. He will also take the opportunity to visit Europe.

According to Mr. Zhang's conversation with reporters, the economic construction of our country must grasp two points: (1) Average national income, (2) Balance of international payments. The method of averaging national income, whether movable or immovable property, should adopt a system of one name per person, one name per household. In addition, scientific methods should be implemented for household registration, and thorough surveys and statistics should be conducted. As for balancing international payments, the current countermeasures are (1) Encouraging exports, (2) Promoting thrift, (3) Reducing consumption. However, whether in terms of quality or cost, domestic goods and foreign goods ultimately cannot compete. The remaining solutions are to quickly seek currency stability and lower bank interest rates. Other essential measures include attracting the import of industrial machinery and promoting local products. In other words, there can never be too many means of production, and there is no shame in a lack of consumer goods. Furthermore, our domestic goods merchants should pay attention to the Southeast Asian market in addition to domestic sales and seize positions before Japanese industry recovers.

Editorial

### Expectations for the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters

Fang Zhi, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, and the newly appointed committee members, held a swearing-in ceremony yesterday at the Shanghai Stadium. At the same time, all circles in Shanghai held an expanded Commemoration Week for the Premier. Starting with Wu Jingheng, the central oath administrator, each person gave a speech. Director Fang also clearly declared that he would complete the revolution in a political party style and realize the party's principles with a revolutionary spirit, which is enough to make the party members in this city recognize the path they should strive for in the future. No fewer than five or six hundred people attended the ceremony yesterday, and the newspaper received a new impression that the style of the Kuomintang would undergo a change.

Originally, Kuomintang members are a group of people who firmly believe in and fight for the Three Principles of the People. If they take "vanguard for the people" as their mission, they should stand in front of the people and guide them; if they believe that "life is for service," they should not seek fame or profit, but work hard and serve the people. Regardless of which concept is held, party members must be close to the people, and the party headquarters must be a home for party members. Those in charge of party affairs must not regard only a certain number of staff within the fire door of the party headquarters as their cadres, but should regard all party members as cadres for all their work; moreover, since the party stands in front of the people and serves the people, the party's work should be the work that the people urgently need. In other words, what the party wants to do is what the people want to do, and the people should also be the cadres of all the party's work.

If the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters can establish a new style in the future, encourage the party members in the city, and even inspire the people in the city, without being narrow or biased, and take what the people like as what they like and what the people hate as what they hate as the standard, and move forward bravely, then we dare to believe that all the party members in the city and even all the people in the city will be happy to use them, and the party's talents will be inexhaustible. What we expect from the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters is nothing greater than this.

### The Completion of the New French Constitution

The French Constituent Assembly passed the draft of the French Constitution on the 29th of last month, and it was submitted to a referendum for a vote the day before yesterday. According to the results of the vote counts in various provinces of the headquarters, as of the time of this author's writing, 9,143,310 people voted in favor of the new draft constitution, and 8,084,067 people voted against it. It is no longer a question that the new draft constitution of France will be passed by a referendum. The result of this referendum can not only bring an end to the temporary political system in France after the war, but also determine the form of French politics, and even affect the evolution of the entire European political situation, so people all over the world are paying close attention to this French referendum.

Since France gained its liberation, it has maintained a temporary political system. Although French politicians have made great efforts to create the newest and most democratic constitution, it was ultimately overthrown in a referendum on May 5th of this year. As a result, the French head of state is still called the interim president. However, in recent months, France has faced many problems that urgently need to be resolved, both in domestic and foreign affairs; therefore, the general public is eager for the temporary political system to end as soon as possible and to embark on the normal track of constitutional government, so that these problems can be easily resolved. Therefore, the leaders of the three major political parties in France (namely the Catholic Progressive Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party) have done their utmost to compromise in the Constituent Assembly, and finally drafted another new draft constitution and submitted it to a referendum to show the support of public opinion; at the same time, the leaders of the three major political parties also instructed the members and masses of their respective parties to unanimously support this new draft constitution. Logically, it should not be a problem for this new draft constitution to be passed by a referendum; however, on the eve of the referendum, the anti-Japanese war hero General de Gaulle gave speeches in various places, attacking this new draft constitution and appealing to the citizens to vote against it, which can certainly sway the opinions of some citizens, especially members of the Catholic Progressive Party. Therefore, people are not too optimistic about whether the fate of this new draft constitution will be accepted by the general public.

Because of his merits in leading the anti-Japanese war, General de Gaulle has an unshakable position in the minds of the general French people. According to the results of testing French public opinion, those who support de Gaulle as leader account for 35%, which is unmatched by any political party leader. However, in today's France, which has suffered from the German ravages and destruction during the war, its vitality has been damaged and has not yet recovered, so since liberation, the urgency of famine, the lack of materials, the obstruction of transportation, the soaring prices, and the social unrest have all been very serious problems; in addition, the international situation has not improved, the creation of world peace is not easy, the confrontation between the Anglo-American group and the Slavic group, and where France will go are even more difficult to solve. Although de Gaulle has military strategy and leadership every day, it is questionable whether he has the means of a politician and diplomat. These current referendum situations are fully exposed. The first is the large number of citizens who abstained, nearly 30%. The lack of enthusiasm of French citizens in the referendum is enough to show the French people's suffering from politics, and they feel deeply at a loss in the gap between the struggles between the left and right factions. Second, there is little difference between those who approve and those who disapprove. From this, we can also know that de Gaulle's position among the people cannot be underestimated. If General de Gaulle continues to engage in political struggles in the future, then the political tide in France will be just beginning, making us have to take some reservations about the future of French politics.

The clauses of the new French constitution have not yet been published, and its contents are not yet very clear; however, this new constitution is the result of a compromise between the three major political parties in France. The differences of opinion from all parties have been reduced to a minimum in the constitution, so it is by no means accidental that it can still be passed by a majority of citizens despite de Gaulle's opposition. Among political parties, it is truly worth our reference today to be able to resolve all political disputes through peaceful negotiation, finally reach an agreement, complete a new constitution, and then pass it by referendum, so that French politics can move from a temporary political system to the normal track of constitutional government.

### A Brief Discussion on Price Controls

There are two purposes of price controls: one is to stabilize prices, and the other is to rationally allocate resources. To achieve the first purpose, first, all materials must be controlled; second, production mechanisms must be fully and continuously utilized.

To achieve the second purpose, first, the targets of consumption must be identified; second, distribution mechanisms must be sound; third, there must be sufficient authority.

If the above premises are not mistaken, then it is virtually impossible to achieve true control without escaping the following situations and intentions:

(1) Fair prices in name, making money in reality; constantly racing against the black market.

(2) The object of distribution is the materials currently in hand, not the appropriate needs of the other party.

(3) There are too few materials to meet the demand.

(4) Materials cannot be unified, and there is a free market in addition to rationing.

(5) Only manages distribution, not production, resulting in a disconnect between production and sales, and problems with sources, or production prices and distribution prices cannot be matched.

(6) Rationed goods cannot be controlled and flow into the black market one after another.

(7) The object of consumption has not been clarified, resulting in improper distribution, or distribution for the wrong purpose.

(8) Unsound personnel, lack of unified authority, and the control itself causes problems.

(9) The economy has no boundaries, but the control pressure is limited to one corner.

(10) There is fundamentally no determination or preparation for control, but it is only to deceive people in the face of the current situation.

(11) Or using the name of control to implement some kind of monopoly attempt.

Now the control agencies are increasing day by day. In terms of their nature, some are handled by the central government, some are handled by local governments, and some are handled by semi-official and semi-commercial entities. But whether the above-mentioned defects can be avoided as much as possible is naturally clearer to the authorities and does not require us to worry too much. However, once it is held, we very much hope to strive for perfection and achieve the expected purpose. Otherwise, the more you try to sort it out, the more confused it becomes, only deepening the difficulties of those involved, undermining the credibility of the government, and the general public may not be able to get practical benefits, which is really not worth the loss. There have been too many past failures with methods such as fair prices, price limits, and rationing. Facts have proven that simply talking official language does not have much effect on economic measures. Therefore, don't talk about control, but if you want to talk about control, you can't have a simple-minded mentality, and you can't ignore economic factors.

### Eliminating Pirates Promotes Fisheries: Zhejiang Province Strengthens Maritime Police Force; Requests Allocation of Vessels, Loan of Ten Billion

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 14th] Pi Zuoyi, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, and Li Xing, Section Chief of the First Section, returned to Hangzhou yesterday after going to Shanghai to discuss fisheries, water conservancy, transportation, and other matters in Zhejiang Province. According to Mr. Pi, speaking to our reporter, the main task of this trip was to purchase fishing boats, discuss the Qiantang River Ferry, the Xixing Wharf, and negotiate with the Executive Yuan for construction funds and flour. In addition to purchasing five L.C.M. landing craft from the Materials Supply and Sales Office at a price of US$5,000 each, the China Aquatic Products Company is willing to lend two vessels free of charge, but they need slight repairs. Zhejiang Reclamation Company and Zhejiang Haiyu Fisheries Company can each lease one vessel, totaling nine vessels. In addition to the two landing craft that will be allocated to the Qiantang River Ferry, the remaining seven vessels will be listed as fishing protection vessels. Four vessels will be sent to Ningbo, and three vessels will be allocated to the coastal areas of Wenzhou and Taizhou. The above-mentioned vessels are all under 100 tons. Although they are not as ideal as 160 tons, equipped with light and heavy machine guns, together with the original two vessels in Dinghai, and allocated to the maritime police of the four detachments, they will be enough to make the pirates who have plagued the coast of Zhejiang for a long time have nowhere to hide. The coast of Zhejiang is the largest fishing ground in our country, and the fishing season is in November and December. In order to promote the development of the fishing industry and protect the safety of fishermen, the above-mentioned fishing protection vessels can go to sea at the end of October, so that pirates can be contained. The Zhejiang Provincial Government is also in contact with the Executive Yuan, requesting the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate materials for 5,000 wooden sailboats and 500 engines, so that they can be used by fishermen during the fishing season at the end of the year. In order to take care of the welfare of fishermen, the Provincial Government is negotiating with the Farmers Bank of China for a fishing loan of ten billion yuan in order to turn around funds and repair fishing gear. As for the Qiantang River Ferry and the Xixing Wharf, raising funds will not be a problem. Mr. Mao Yisheng has been invited to Hangzhou for inspection, so that he can design and construct them. In terms of water conservancy and transportation, some permanent projects will be reported to the central government in Nanjing for instructions to determine the overall plan.

### It is rumored that Jingfang firmly stated that the suppression will be completed by the end of this month

[Our Suzhou dispatch, 14th] Taihu Suppression Area Commander Fu Jingfang, in view of the fact that the suppression work has already started and the appeasement work is also proceeding smoothly, but bandit traces are still found in Wuxian County from time to time, disturbing the area, according to reliable reports, they are all committed by the bandit troops claiming to be the "New Fourth Army," which should be sanctioned in order to complete the suppression. He specially invited Su County Magistrate Lu Jianhua and Military Section Chief Guo Pingyan to Mudu at 9:00 a.m. on the 13th to discuss countermeasures. It was decided to first improve the Baojia system, so that the bandit troops have nowhere to hide, and then wipe them out in one fell swoop. The reporter met with Mr. Fu at about 2:00 p.m. and asked about the recruitment situation. He said that the Liao Bingnan Department has excellent discipline after being incorporated, and the supplies and equipment are very complete. As for the other two departments, Xie Decheng and Hu Zhiying, Commissioner Jin Jiarang is in the process of contacting them, and they can generally surrender. Yang Yanbin once went to Wangting to recruit scattered bandits in the area, but the effect was minimal. The headquarters believes that the suppression work must be completed by the end of October, so if the bandit troops continue to be stubborn, they will launch a large-scale search and suppression.

[Our Suzhou News] At about 12:00 a.m. on the day before yesterday, two bandit ships carrying more than 20 bandits, holding one machine gun and more than a dozen rifles, suddenly appeared in Hengjing Xu Zhuang Township of this county, intending to land and loot. They were discovered by the local self-defense team, who fired first. Seeing that the shore was prepared, the bandit ships sailed towards Huanglu Township. At that time, the Huanglu Township self-defense team also heard the sound of gunfire and had already prepared. When the bandit ship approached the area, the self-defense team ordered it to approach the shore. Seeing that the shore was also prepared, knowing that there was no way to spy, the bandit ship quickly raised its sails and fled towards West Taihu.

[Our Qingpu News] Since the bandit group of Li Defu fled back to the county on the morning of the 7th of this month after being encircled and suppressed by various counties, its momentum has become even more rampant. It has now been broken up into three groups, with light machine guns, Thompson submachine guns, and other new weapons, disturbing various districts and appearing in broad daylight without any scruples. Considering the importance of politics during the bandit suppression period, the local authorities specially formed a special propaganda team composed of party, government, military, police, and interim council members, divided into two groups in the east and west townships, led by the interim council and the county party department respectively, and set off immediately to publicize government orders, in order to achieve the effect of "three points military, seven points political." The working time for the first departure is stipulated as three weeks.

[Our Dangtu News] The suppression work here has completed the initial stage, and the bandits in the Meili District can be expected to be eliminated. More than 100 people have been captured and surrendered, and are being dealt with separately. A part of the suppression troops has returned to their original defense, and the rest are concentrated and waiting for orders. County Magistrate Pan and others will go to Dongtang City to inspect and direct the suppression.

### Xiangshan, Sanmen, Ninghai: Abundant Harvest, Cheap Rice

[Our Yuyao News] Xiangshan, Sanmen, and Ninghai counties have had bumper harvests this year. The early rice and autumn harvest are both bountiful. The single-season rice, glutinous rice, and double-season late rice in Xiangshan are particularly outstanding, with yields doubling in previous years. Recently, the price of rice in these areas is only about 30,000 yuan per stone. Because the index of other prices is increasing day by day, the cheap grain hurts farmers, and farmers are calling out in succession.

### Xiaofeng Bamboo Restores Sales

[Our Xiaofeng News] Xiaofeng County produces more than 100,000 pieces of bamboo per year, which are sold to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and other provinces. It is a major income for the people of Xiaofeng, and their livelihood depends on it for half a year. During the Anti-Japanese War, due to traffic blockages, it was not easy to transport and sell. Recently, the ships have been restored and the routes are smooth. The bamboo merchants of the county presented it to the Second District Special Commissioner's Office and approved the establishment of the Xiaofeng County Forestry and Agricultural Cooperative in Meixi Town, specializing in the promotion and sales of bamboo, which has already opened.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 14th] The 202nd Division of the Youth Army recently received an order from the Ministry of National Defense that, in order to facilitate the collection and training of refugee youths in northern Jiangsu, the division headquarters and directly subordinate troops moved from Hangzhou to Suzhou.

Mr. Fang met with this newspaper's special correspondent stationed in Suzhou alone on the evening of the 13th and made a statement, elaborating on the mission of the division in great detail, saying: The mission of this division is to garrison in Suzhou under orders, and the tasks are as follows: (1) Collect and train refugee youths from counties and cities along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, which must be completed by the end of this year. (2) Starting from January next year, be responsible for handling the centralized training of educated youths from Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Taiwan provinces. At this moment, high school or university students among the draft-age men must participate in centralized training according to the provisions of the new conscription law. However, in order to adapt to China's current social education situation and the disparity in cultural standards, the government has specially stipulated that educated youths will be centrally trained by the Youth Division, and ordinary draft-age men will be centrally trained by the Division/Regiment Management Area or ordinary division to avoid the difficulty of uneven procedures in education and training. Mr. Fang continued to say: The two brigades and four regiments under the division will be stationed in important strongholds along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. The deployment will be completed within days. Division Commander Lieutenant General Luo Zewen is currently in Beijing asking the Ministry of National Defense for instructions and will come to Suzhou soon. In addition to the heads of the departments of the division headquarters, there are also Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Zhongqu, staff officer of the Training Department of the Reserve Forces of the Ministry of National Defense, and a technician from the Engineering Department to guide the collection and training and survey the barracks. As for the conscription location for the centralized training of educated youths next year, it will be decided after the Ministry of National Defense designates it.

### Changshu and Qingpu Rush to Repair Highways

[Our Changshu News] The county government followed the instructions of Provincial Chairman Wang's inspection in Changshu and rushed to build the bridges and culverts of the coastal highways from this city to Fushan and Twelve Fort Port to meet military needs, expanded and laid telephone lines in various townships to facilitate transportation, and requisitioned workers to dredge the main river. A total of more than 80 million yuan is required, which has been submitted to the province for approval, so that construction can start as soon as possible.

[Our Qingpu News] During the bandit suppression period, the rush repair of highway transportation is a top priority. The Suhu Highway passes through a section of this county. The county government was ordered to requisition workers and materials and set a deadline for repair. Currently, thousands of civilian workers from nearby townships are being mobilized to rush to repair the road surface and bridges of the section overnight in order to complete it by the deadline.

### Rogue Prank: Grand Theater Scare

[Our Suzhou News] The Grand Theater in Beiju, this county, once received a threatening letter some days ago. The matter was reported to the police and other relevant agencies for protection. At about 5:00 p.m. on the 12th, just as the theater was showing the second movie and was about to end, an object emitting light suddenly exploded in the auditorium with a loud noise. The audience panicked and fled, and the order was disrupted. The theater telegraphed various military and police agencies to dispatch a large number of personnel to the scene to suppress the situation. At the same time, the emergency exits were opened to evacuate the audience, and fortunately there were no injuries. After searching, a cigarette butt was found under the tenth row of seats downstairs. There were two burnt match sticks inside the cigarette butt, and there were residual traces of magnesium powder for photography on the outside. It was discovered that the loud noise and white light were caused by this. Therefore, the explosion was loud and there was light, but there was no destructive power, which was obviously a rogue prank. The city defense headquarters and the military police team believe that this action is enough to endanger public safety and must not be tolerated simply because no damage occurred. It was decided to strictly investigate and arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice.

### The Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu is Exhausted and Continues to Send Spies to Disturb Southern Jiangsu

[Report from our Suzhou correspondent] Recently, the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu, due to repeated military defeats and exhausted resources, in an attempt to reverse the declining trend, dispatched Ye Jingbo, a senior counselor of the Communist Suwan Border Region government, along with more than 200 of his special agents, disguised as refugees and other various personas, to cross the Yangtze River from places such as Jiangdu, sneaking into the vicinity of the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line, with the intention of waiting for an opportunity to sabotage the railway and disrupt public order.

### Jiaxing Collects Land Tax in Kind, Request to Convert to Rice Denied

[Report from our Jiaxing correspondent] The collection of land tax in kind in this county is about to begin. However, local public opinion organizations and farmers' associations believe that Jiaxing farmers do not store grain, so they telegraphed the Provincial Land and Grain Department, requesting to pay land tax in rice.

Whether Xinzhuang Belongs to Songjiang or Shanghai

We live in Xinzhuang, West Shanghai. Before the provincial and municipal boundary demarcation is resolved, the issue of this year's land tax is of great concern to the residents near our town. The facts are written below: More than a month ago, the Songjiang County Government posted notices everywhere, stating that they wanted to collect land tax, borrow grain, and collect autonomous donations and taxes. The joint office of the 15th and 16th Baos of the 26th District of Shanghai City reported this to the Municipal Government for review. Now, the Bao office announced that it had received instructions from the Municipal Government stating that it had telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government, ordering the Songjiang County Government to withdraw the Xinzhuang office and the police station, and to stop collecting taxes and borrowing grain. However, the Songjiang County Xinzhuang office is currently urging the local landlords to pay. I think that the people are in this position, which party should they obey in order to not violate the law? I would like to ask your newspaper's "Reader's Opinions" column to disclose this, or to bother the provincial and municipal authorities to seek a clear explanation, so as to prevent the people from being confused and not knowing what to do. I would be very grateful. (Zhang Wunong)

Quickly Promulgate Housing Lease Regulations

Since the "Wartime Housing Lease Regulations" were legally abolished six months after the end of the war, the malignant housing shortage caused by the war has become increasingly serious due to the lack of reasonable emergency laws to manage it! The courts invoke the leasing regulations of the Civil Code as a benchmark for resolving current housing shortage disputes, and the judgments made are quite inappropriate in terms of the circumstances and facts faced by tenants under fixed-term contracts. The end of the war does not mean that all the malignant consequences caused by the war have been eliminated. Looking at the fact that the wartime leasing regulations were abolished six months after the war, it can be seen that the legislators at that time estimated that the housing shortage problem could be eliminated six months after the end of the war. Unexpectedly, the external troubles have been eliminated, but the internal worries have not been resolved. More than a year has passed, and the situation has deteriorated. Population concentration and serious housing shortage in major cities has led to constant disputes. Appropriate housing lease management regulations should be formulated to provide a benchmark for court judgments. However, the authorities have no time for this, causing most landlords to be able to legally terminate leases on the pretext of pursuing their desire to be paid in gold bars, which is deeply regrettable!

Looking at other consequences caused by the war, such as inflation, high prices are used to regulate it, education has declined, and efforts are gradually being made to rectify it, and traffic is inconvenient, and orders are given to improve it. Only the serious housing shortage has not seen any effort to alleviate it. Instead, the only leasing regulations targeting this problem have been abolished, and the current Civil Code leasing regulations are used instead, which is like having someone whose height and width have changed dramatically wearing a robe made nine years ago. It is neither elegant nor applicable, is it not a joke!

Furthermore, after the court accepts the landlord's lawsuit to terminate the lease relationship, if it is a fixed-term contract, it will immediately order the tenant to move out within a limited time. Most leases in Shanghai now have a term, and if the term expires, a lawsuit is filed (in fact, most have already expired), and the tenant is ordered to move out after the lawsuit. Regardless of whether the human feelings and facts are reasonable, just the fact that the tenants are being evicted and sleeping on the streets will gradually increase and obstruct traffic. This may be inconvenient for both security and administration. Law is based on customs, human feelings, moral habits, and environmental facts, and it is formed by intersecting and combining them. How can it be independent from the above factors? The judgment of right and wrong is naturally difficult to be reasonable! Therefore, the current Civil Code leasing regulations will not only fail to formulate a solution to the housing shortage but may also cause other unnecessary disputes and consequences.

The Bloody Tears of Christians in Northern Jiangsu

The Christians in Northern Jiangsu are in deep waters, without clothes or food, like beggars, suffering from war disasters, and living a hard life. The relief for national refugees has not reached the Christians in Northern Jiangsu at all. They have no permanent property and no ability to resume business. I hope that fellow believers will be enthusiastic and help each other. (Hong Sheng)

### Many Abstentions in the Referendum, France Passes New Constitution, Promulgating the Three Principles of Government of the People, by the People, for the People

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th] The draft of the new French Constitution was voted on by referendum yesterday. The final vote counts are as follows: (1) In mainland France and the North African territories of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, 9,143,310 votes were in favor, and 8,084,067 votes were against, with 1,059,243 more votes in favor than against. (2) In mainland France (excluding Corsica), 9,002,467 votes were in favor, and 7,790,676 votes were against, with 7,776,893 abstentions. During the initial constitutional draft vote in May of this year, the total number of votes in favor for the country and its territories was 9,109,771, and the number of votes against was 10,272,586.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th] A referendum was held in various parts of Vietnam yesterday to vote on the new French Constitution. According to preliminary reports, more people are against it than for it. In Cochinchina, 90% of voters opposed it, with 552 votes in favor and 2,934 votes against. The same was true in Hanoi, where out of a total of 5,265 voters, only 2,701 voted, with 509 votes in favor and 2,192 votes against.

[United Press, Paris, 13th] The new French Constitution was voted on by the people today. This constitutional draft seeks to establish a government based on the three principles of government of the people, by the people, and for the people, as established by US President Lincoln, and its meaning has been incorporated into the constitution. The dispute between former President De Gaulle and other opposition parties lies only in the details, and the final judgment rests with the people of the whole country, which is the basic principle of democratic politics. According to the outline of the new constitutional draft, the organizations of the various government departments are as follows:

(1) "Executive Branch": There will be a President and a Prime Minister. (2) "Legislative Branch": A parliament will be established, composed of the National Assembly and the Council of the Republic. (3) "Judicial Branch": A Supreme Court and a High Court will be established. (4) "Advisory Council": An Economic Committee and a French Federal Council will be established for consultation.

De Gaulle firmly believes that one of the two houses, namely the National Assembly, retains too much power over the executive and judicial departments. Whether his statement is correct is debatable, but the allocation of these powers is determined by the French Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement, which represent 15 million voters in France, which is enough to guarantee that the constitution they have drafted will be accepted by the people. However, De Gaulle's reputation is also enough to compete fiercely with them, so the outcome is difficult to predict.

The preamble to the new constitution states that everyone has inalienable rights, regardless of race, religion, or belief. According to the constitution, everyone has the right to join a trade union and strike. Workers can not only participate in the determination of their working conditions but also participate in the management of enterprises. All wealth and the operation of all industries that have the nature of national public undertakings or monopolistic undertakings must actually be owned by all the people. The preamble guarantees that France will not engage in wars of conquest and agrees, with the consent of various countries in the area, to limit its sovereignty to the extent necessary to maintain and defend peace. The 617 members of the National Assembly are elected by direct election. The Council of the Republic has 250 to 320 representatives, some elected by the National Assembly and some elected by the Electoral College. Only the National Assembly has complete legislative power. The Council of the Republic can draft bills and submit them to the National Assembly for final decision.

De Gaulle's Moral Victory

[United Press, Paris, 13th] The new French constitutional draft was put to a popular vote today. According to reports from various polling stations here, the number of voters in the morning was very small. Although the weather was clear, by noon, the number of people who went to the polls at some polling stations was only half of the number of voters during the May referendum on the constitutional draft. However, according to various strong indications, 20% of the voters nationwide will abstain from voting. Because Laos and other provinces in Vietnam are located in remote areas with difficult transportation, copies of the new French constitutional draft were dropped by parachute in various districts on the outskirts. According to supporters of De Gaulle, there are many abstentions in this vote, and there must also be many votes against it, which is General De Gaulle's moral victory. De Gaulle believes that the new constitution has failed to establish a workable political system and tends to become an anarchic and dictatorial system, and he has advised the people to reject it. However, the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement all support this constitutional draft, and although De Gaulle strongly opposes it, the leaders of the various parties are urging the people to accept it.

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 14th Dispatch: Today, Molotov delivered a very strong speech at the Peace Conference, accusing Britain, the U.S., and France of violating the agreements previously established by the four powers, and using the method of majority vote to impose their will on other countries.

### Summary of Five-Nation Treaties: Europe's Map Sees Only Minor Changes; Prevent Aggression, Establish Democratic Principles

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] Considering the treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, as proposed by the Paris Peace Conference, the map of Europe will see only minor changes. The four major powers' foreign ministers will draft the final treaties based on these five draft treaties and hand them over to the five former enemy countries for signing. The principles of the five treaties are largely the same, and the main issues addressed are nothing more than preventing future aggression, Europe's economic recovery, and establishing democratic principles and human rights. It is hoped that after the five former enemy countries satisfactorily resolve the various issues of the treaties, they can join the United Nations organization as members. Allied forces will withdraw from each of the former enemy countries within ninety days of the treaties coming into effect. Only the Soviet Union may maintain troops within Hungary and Romania to maintain its communication lines with Austria. The territorial changes this time are very small, with Italy suffering the most losses. The Balkan borders will only see minor adjustments, and will largely revert to their old borders of 1939. Trieste will establish a free zone, formulate a democratic constitution, and have an official stationed by the United Nations Security Council. Regarding

Disarmament

each of the five former enemy countries may only retain a small military force to maintain domestic security and border and air defense. The remaining armaments will be handed over to the Allied forces. Military training, except for authorized individuals, is generally prohibited. Other security measures include the establishment of demilitarized zones in specific areas such as the Greek-Bulgarian border, prohibiting the construction of permanent fortresses capable of firing upon Allied territories. The prohibition of certain weapons includes atomic weapons, self-propelled bombs, long-range artillery, automatic mines, one-man torpedoes, bombers, and (except for the Soviet Union) motor torpedo boats.

Regarding Politics

each treaty has provisions forcing the government to guarantee the democratic rights of the people. Except for Italy, each country clearly stipulates that there must be no fascist or anti-United Nations organizations. Except for Bulgaria, this clause specifically mentions the Soviet Union. War criminals and Allied traitors must be handed over, and the Allied countries will repatriate the prisoners of war of each former enemy country as far as possible.

Economic Clauses

that have been agreed upon include: (1) Granting most-favored-nation treatment to each United Nations country within ten months. Italy must grant most-favored-nation treatment to the United Nations within a period of three years. (2) Respecting the internal sovereignty of each former enemy country, except where the country's economic legislation has state-run monopolies. (3) Restoring the property rights of the Allied countries in the defeated countries and providing compensation for damages. This compensation is paid in local currency to facilitate their economic recovery.

### Large-Scale U.S. Military Exercise in Japan; Various Army, Navy, and Air Force Units Participate; Completion of All Programs to Take Five Days

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] The U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force began their largest exercise since the occupation of Japan today, at a landing site selected before Japan's surrender. High-speed bomber squadrons will conduct bombing exercises against targets on the beach at treetop level, lasting five days. The Navy will conduct a simulated attack in Tokyo Bay. B-61 "Black Widow" night fighters and A-26 attack bombers will create dense smoke screens on the beach. P-51 "Mustang" bombers will destroy enemy bunkers with thousands of pounds of bombs. Paratroopers will also participate in the exercise. Only combat troops will land on the first day of the exercise, and heavy equipment will remain on the ships. Some equipment will land tomorrow, and all equipment will land on the 17th, thus completing the exercise.

### New Japanese Constitution to Be Promulgated on November 3rd

[Reuters, New York, 13th] The New York American, affiliated with Hearst, reported that the United States secretly sold 500 pounds of black uranium oxide, the most precious metal in the world and raw material for making atomic bombs, to the Soviet Union in 1943. At that time, no more than a hundred people knew about the Manhattan Project (which was responsible for making the atomic bomb), and although those involved in the atomic bomb's manufacture protested this sale at the time, the U.S. government still approved it. The Soviet Purchasing Commission handled the purchase for the Soviet Union, claiming that it was for medical research and non-military scientific experiments.

### Philippine President Roxas Refuses to Accept Franco's Medal

[United Press, Manila, 13th] According to a report from Madrid, the Spanish Franco government intended to award medals to Philippine President Roxas and Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino.

This Spanish medal is the same as the one awarded to Argentine President Perón.

### Main Base of British Pacific Fleet to Be Established in Australia; Rumor of Seeking a Summer Naval Station in China Is Untrue

[Reuters, London, 13th] The Sunday Times reported that its Beijing correspondent telegraphed that naval issues in the Far East were gradually becoming the focus of speculation. Britain does not intend to maintain a large naval base in Hong Kong or Singapore. The main base of the British Pacific Fleet will be established in Australia. Rumors that Britain wants to obtain a summer naval station in China, and that China has asked Britain to send naval instructors to train the Chinese Navy, are all untrue.

[Reuters, London, 13th] The War Office announced the appointment of Major General Erskin, acting Chief of Staff of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the British Army of the Rhine, as Commander of the British Army in Hong Kong. The Major General served as head of the British Military Mission in Belgium from 1944 to 1945.

### Japan's Political Parties and Parliament (Part Two)

When the war situation progressed smoothly, they attempted to take advantage of the spoils of war, and they are still

active behind the scenes

in politics, believing that the current international situation is favorable to them, hoping that relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union will deteriorate, exaggerating the conflict between the Chinese Nationalists and Communists, and creating an anti-China atmosphere in the House of Peers. When Interior Minister Omura Seiichi answered Yamada Ryozaburo's question regarding the crackdown on Koreans and "compatriots" in the House of Peers on September 9th, he even referred to the Chinese as "people of a third country," rather than people of an Allied country. Only after the local delegation sent a letter correcting this did he declare it to be a misunderstanding. Ikeda Hayato, Director of the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, also wanted to treat Taiwanese as people of a third country and

not list Taiwanese as Chinese citizens

when answering Matsutani Junnosuke's question regarding the collection of property taxes in the House of Peers on the 9th of this month. According to the regulations of the Allied authorities, citizens of Allied countries have no tax obligations in Japan, but Ikeda of the Tax Bureau actually stated in Parliament that the government was currently discussing the collection of property taxes from Taiwanese. All of these facts illustrate that conservative forces are using these politicians as tools

to attempt a resurgence

. In order to strengthen their camp, a grand union is the inevitable outcome, so recently the calls for a unified front of conservative forces have been deafening. According to various newspapers, Yoshida recently personally discussed the merger of the two parties with Shidehara, the president of the Progressive Party, believing that there should only be two political parties, radical and conservative, to promote

the realization of democracy in Japan

, and he expressed this view to a United Press reporter. At the same time, Kajii Karo (an important figure in Kodama Yoshio's organization, a former enemy intelligence agency in Shanghai) of the Liberal Party and Kawai Kosae of the Progressive Party held secret talks on the merger issue. It is said that Yoshida will be the leader of the new party after the merger, and Shidehara and Saito Takao will serve as top advisors. Although the opinions within the two parties are not yet fully unified, the merger is only a matter of formality, and they have already

formed a united front

in practice. In the local elections to be held in mid-October, the Liberal and Progressive parties have even decided to cooperate with each other to expand the power of the conservative faction. The Liberal Party is also willing to provide practical assistance to the Progressive Party's local election candidates. This illustrates that the two parties have actually

implemented a grand union

. The Socialist Party was formed in November of last year by social movement pioneers such as Iso Abe, Toyohiko Kagawa, and Takano Iwasaburo, the top leaders of pre-war labor and peasant associations, and is the largest opposition party in Parliament. Their highest ideal is to achieve socialism through Parliament, advocating for social democracy within the framework of maintaining the Emperor system. This view is very clearly expressed in the

draft constitutional amendment

submitted by the Socialist Party to Parliament. After this Second National Congress, the Socialist Party's focus on parliamentarianism became even more pronounced. The party's policy was originally to use the General Federation of Labor as its activity center, leading mass movements to expand the party's power; however, because the party is the largest opposition party in Parliament, this part of its power had to be devoted to parliamentary activities, and recently the

leadership of the labor movement center

has fallen into the hands of the Communist Party, and the Socialist Party has been in a passive position in many cases. Therefore, it has adopted a bystander attitude towards the recent seamen's strike, the national railway workers' strike, and the news and broadcasting industry strike. The composition of the Socialist Party is also very complex. Among the Socialist Party members elected in the general parliamentary election, more than 20 were chairmen of various companies, and at the same time there were People's Front factions advocating cooperation with the Communist Party, and anti-communist elements who declared cooperation with the Liberal Party. As a result of the election at this National Congress,

the right-wing forces won

, with Suehiro Nishio, whose activity base is the General Federation of Labor, being elected as Secretary-General, and Tetsu Katayama being promoted to Chairman of the Central Executive Committee. At this congress, Tatsuki Morito, a neutral faction member, explained the reason why the Socialist Party declared its refusal to participate in the Communist-led National Salvation Front, which aroused dissatisfaction among left-wing members, and

a fierce quarrel

broke out between the left and right factions in the field. Ozawa Hisaaki, a representative from Aomori Prefecture, questioned the right wing, saying that if they wanted to form a democratic front, they must cooperate with the Communist Party. At this congress, the Socialist Party took a generally negative stance on the current labor movement. Mizutani Chosaburo, the chairman of the congress, answered the question of Otsuka Eigoro, a right-wing representative, saying that it was doubtful whether the current labor union leaders understood the spirit of labor unions, that it was time to reflect on this, and that it was very simple to submit a

motion of no confidence in the Yoshida cabinet

to Parliament; but that overthrowing the Yoshida cabinet was not a simple matter. At this congress, the Communist Party sent Nosaka Sanzo as a representative to lobby for cooperation with the Socialist Party to form a People's Front, but to no avail. At the same time, the Socialist Party headquarters ordered its local branches to stop cooperating with the Communist Party, which shows that the Socialist Party is gradually becoming a government party. Yoshida also revealed the idea of a merger of the Liberal, Progressive, and Socialist parties, and there is also an intention within the Socialist Party to form a coalition cabinet with Yoshida. At this

National Congress

the party's cadres were constantly criticized from all sides, and there was great dissatisfaction with the failure to realize the democratic front, and there was doubt as to whether the party's cadres still had the sincerity to realize the socialism that the party had proclaimed. Some members, such as Kato Kanjuro, Kimori Saburo, Arayan Hanmon, and Takatsu Tadashi, are said to be splitting off. At the same time, economic groups representing conservative economic forces, echoing this political offensive, have successively announced their establishment, such as the Kanto Management Association, the Keizai Doyukai, and the New Industrialists League, all of which have been formally established. Although Kosa Yuzo, Furuetsu Kiyoshi, Tatsuyama Aiichiro, Matsumoto Taro, and Shimada Katsunosuke have retreated from the surface of the economic world due to the purge order, they still have a lingering connection. How the mainstream of these conservative forces will develop is something that we need to pay attention to and monitor.

### Councillor Accusations of Treason; High Court Says No Complaint Received; Xiao Kuai Le Troupe Should Not Insult Lu Keming in Radio Broadcast; Speaker Pan Issues Important Statement Yesterday

For days, the Xiao Kuai Le Troupe has been broadcasting insults against Senator Lu Keming on the Shengli and Yuandong radio stations. Speaker Pan spoke to reporters about this yesterday, stating that there was indeed a proposal in the Senate to suggest that the government should review radio programs, but it was not proposed by Senator Lu, and it had nothing to do with the Xiao Kuai Le Troupe. Furthermore, senators are legally not responsible to the outside world for speeches made in the assembly, and the troupe cannot casually rely on rumors reported in the newspapers to launch attacks. If Senator Lu believes that the troupe's actions are a public insult and damage his reputation, he can file a complaint according to law. As for radio broadcasts, there are original regulatory agencies, and those who issue licenses for program content should be responsible for paying attention to the review. If there are violations of the law, they can be banned according to law. Broadcasting troupes belong to entertainers, and they must also have their professional organizations, and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs is the supervisory authority. If there are inappropriate actions, the supervisory authorities will not sit idly by, he said.

Regarding the recent issue of some municipal senators being accused of treason, Pan Gongzhan expressed his opinion in his capacity as speaker, stating that accusations of treason are based on actions rather than positions. The qualifications of the current municipal senators have all been reviewed and approved by the Public Officials Candidate Qualification Review Committee. If it is deemed inappropriate, the committee should be responsible, which has nothing to do with the Municipal Senate. At the same time, the administrative and judicial authorities should have a unified point of view and interpretation regarding the accusation of treason. The issue only involves the personal problem of surrendering to the enemy, so attacking the Municipal Senate is inappropriate. The Chief Prosecutor of the High Court responsibly stated that as of now, the court has not received any complaints from the public accusing municipal senators of treason.

### Municipal Senate's Finance and Self-Government Committees Hold Second Meetings Respectively; Factory Confiscated by Enemy and Puppet Regimes Petitions for Return to Original Owner; Request Banks to Offer Low-Interest Loans to Suppress Daily Commodity Prices

[Our Newspaper Report] The Finance Committee, the second group of the Municipal Senate, held its second subcommittee meeting at the Bank of Communications yesterday afternoon to discuss eight proposals: (1) Regarding the cotton cloth and factories forcibly purchased during the enemy and puppet regime periods, request the municipal government to forward a letter to the central government, ordering the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas to return the remaining cotton cloth to the original owners, and allow the original owners to redeem the factories sold under duress at the original selling price, according to the price index, to relieve the people's hardships. It was resolved to pass it according to the original method, that is, the committee will detail the reasons and request the municipal government to forward a letter to the central government, ordering the Bureau to return the remaining cotton cloth to the original owners in proportion to the purchase vouchers, and allowing the original owners to redeem the factories sold under duress by calculating the amount obtained at the original selling price according to the current price index and preparing the funds. (2) Request the Shanghai Municipal Bank to offer low-interest loans to suppress daily commodity prices and ensure the safety of the lives of the majority of the people. It was resolved to pass it in principle, requesting the municipal government to notify the Shanghai Municipal Bank to consider handling it, and requesting the Bankers Association to handle it together.

### Sell Enemy and Puppet Property to Compensate for People's Losses

(3) Suggest that the government should use the proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet property confiscated in Shanghai to compensate the people of this city who suffered losses in the January 28th and August 13th incidents in advance. It was resolved to request the government to promptly compensate for the losses that the people of this city have already registered as a priority. (4) Regarding the request of the Shanghai Soap and Candle Industry Association to request exemption from the commodity tax on soap, it was resolved to notify the person in charge of the association to attend and explain at the next meeting of the group before further discussion.

### Ham and Cured Meat Request Tax Exemption

(5) The Shanghai Ham Commercial and Cured Meat Commercial Associations requested the abolition of the ham and cured meat tax. As the case has already been resolved by the general assembly to be exempted, the committee decided to request the municipal government to act accordingly. (6) The Shanghai Film and Theater Industry Association submitted a case for the excessively high entertainment tax rate, providing additional reasons for requesting a reduction in the tax rate. The committee believed that the original application was not without reason, but the group had no right to change the decision of the general assembly, and requested that it be submitted to the next general assembly for discussion.

### Allocate Funds to Acquire the Racecourse

(7) Request the municipal government to forward a letter to the central government, allocating a portion of the funds obtained from the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau's bidding and sale of enemy and puppet materials as funds for the acquisition of the racecourse. (8) Request the municipal government to allocate public funds to each district so that each district can follow the laws to implement production. It was resolved to reserve both cases for discussion at the next meeting.

In addition, there was a temporary motion, which was passed, stating that in the future, applicants should attend and report on all application cases.

### Various District Offices Request Allocation of Housing

[Our Newspaper Report] The Self-Government Committee, the first group of the Municipal Senate, held its second subcommittee meeting at the Municipal Senate in Fuming Village yesterday afternoon, proposing to request the municipal government to allocate office housing for self-government agencies to facilitate the implementation of self-government. Five articles were passed. Secretary-General Xiang Changquan also reported on the housing conditions of various district offices.

### Regarding the Issue of Denunciation; Alternate Councilors Hold Differing Views; Dissatisfaction Expressed with a Few Individuals Falsely Using the Name; Mutual Attacks Erupted at the Press Conference

[Our Newspaper] The recent rumors in the city about the denunciation of two traitorous councilors have attracted much attention from various sectors. To clarify its position and views on this matter, the Shanghai Alternate Councilors Association specially hosted a press conference at the New Life Club at 2:00 PM yesterday. Five people attended, including Wei Yunong, Yang Zhiqian, Yin Yong, Xie Dahuang, and Wang Zhiben, who are standing directors of the association, as well as alternate councilors Cao Yaxia, Wu Renxun, Huang Xiaowen, and more than 30 reporters from various newspapers in the city. Wei Yunong served as chairman and explained that the association was established in September, electing 15 directors and 5 standing directors. The board of directors established two groups: General Affairs and Research. The General Affairs Group established three sections: Documentation, Accounting, and General Services. The Research Group established three sections: Investigation, Design, and Editing. In addition, ten research committees were established for Civil Affairs, Finance, Police Affairs, Economy, Transportation, Education, Welfare, Health, Land, and Regulations. The central task is to promote emotional connection among alternate councilors, jointly research municipal facilities, exchange opinions, and provide suggestions to the authorities for improvement, in order to achieve the goal of seeking welfare for the people. Therefore, its nature is absolutely cooperative with the elected councilors, and it is definitely not confrontational.

Four Points of Opinion Reported

Subsequently, Cao Yaxia reported the association's four points of opinion: (1) According to Article 3 of the "Measures for Restricting the Candidacy and Appointment of Personnel Who Served in Puppet Organizations or Their Subordinate Agencies and Institutions" promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, "Those who have served in puppet organizations or their subordinate agencies and institutions and have not been convicted under the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors shall not be candidates for public office within two years." Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will conduct self-inspection and make legal adjustments. (2) Personnel serving in public education institutions shall not be elected as councilors, and principals of municipal primary and secondary schools shall also not be councilors. (3) It is solemnly declared that the members of this association absolutely do not want to replace councilors by engaging in anti-traitor work. If any councilors are involved in collaboration with the enemy, they will be subject to legal sanctions. This association is only representing public opinion to promote this work.

Denunciation Triggers Verbal Sparring

Regarding the denunciation of traitorous councilors, Yang Zhiqian also explained that not only has the association not taken such action, but it also has no such motive. If anyone uses the association's name to denounce, we are absolutely opposed to it.

Standing Director Wang Zhiben expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the use of the association's name to denounce traitorous councilors, and stood up to declare: There are 181 alternate councilors, and the opinions of one or two people cannot represent the entire body. Denouncing traitors is something every citizen can do. It is reported that a committee for eliminating traitors has been established, and it is said that Wei Yunong is the person in charge. On this point, I express doubt.

Wei Yunong immediately stated that the title "person in charge" was not self-proclaimed, but was reported in the newspaper. There is nothing to show off about in this matter, and someone "couldn't stand it" and said this. The opinions of the two sides clashed. Wang Zhiben believed that there was no so-called "couldn't stand it" at all. Since it is not a matter of showing off, why come forward in the name of a few people to claim to represent the public's opinion? I am also a standing director, and I still know nothing about everything. Denouncing traitors is obviously a few people acting alone. According to Wang, the association's address was originally at 270 Weihaiwei Road, but later other directors suddenly moved the address without my knowledge, which is really mysterious.

Later, Yang Zhiqian stated that the opinions of the standing directors are actually the same as Wang's, the purpose is to deny that the association has taken such action. It is hoped that all sectors will not misunderstand. The reception ended here, and the point that horse racing has gambling behavior and should be refused to be opened was not even explained.

Oath Supervisor Wu Jingheng, Committee Chairman Fang, and the Entire Committee Members and Guests Take a Group Photo (Taken by Our Newspaper)

### New Chairman and Committee Members of the Municipal Party Department Held Swearing-In Ceremony Yesterday; Central Committee Member Wu Jingheng Supervised the Solemn Ceremony

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Celebration Week and the swearing-in ceremony of the newly appointed Chairman of the Municipal Party Department, Fang Zhi, and Committee Member and Secretary-General Xie Renzhao, Director of the Secretariat Xu Guanya, Director of the Organization and Training Department Chen Baotai, Director of the Propaganda Department Tao Baichuan, Committee Members Wu Kaixian, Shen Chunhui, Qian Jianqiu, Xie Dahuang, Zhou Feicheng, Chen Baohua, etc., were held in conjunction at the Municipal Gymnasium on Shaanxi Road yesterday morning. The layout of the venue was quite solemn. The Central Film Photography Studio also sent staff to the scene to take newsreel footage. At 9:00 AM, the oath supervisor, Central Committee Member Wu Jingheng, Mayor Wu Guozhi, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, and guests from all walks of life, Du Yuesheng, Cheng Cangbo, Xu Jiyu, Xi Yushu, Li Ximou, Hu Xiyuan, etc., totaling more than 500 people, arrived at the meeting one after another. The ceremony began at 9:30 AM, and after performing the rituals as required, Chairman Fang led the oath.

Wu Jingheng's Speech: Promote Democracy

After the oath, Oath Supervisor Wu Jingheng delivered a speech, stating: "Shanghai has now become the center of Eastern politics. Everyone attaches great importance to all criticisms of New York, the center of Western politics. Shanghai in the future is also worthy of attention. We must not regard Shanghai as a 'ten-mile foreign concession' city again. Speaking of politics, the most fashionable term is 'democracy'. Our Kuomintang was established to fight for democracy, and we have never abandoned democracy. Now some people want to urge us to be democratic, thinking that we are not enthusiastic about democracy. This is a big mistake. Therefore, we hope that in Shanghai, the center of politics, starting from the Party Department, we can promote the spirit of democracy. During the War of Resistance, Chairman Fang presided over Party affairs in Chongqing, the center of politics, and achieved great results. This time he came to Shanghai, he is familiar with the job and will definitely make even greater achievements. All committee members are also important figures in the Party, and they will definitely be able to work with Chairman Fang to complete this great mission."

Mayor Wu's Speech: Three Hopes

Guests then delivered speeches: Mayor Wu first delivered a speech, stating: "Today, I am attending the swearing-in ceremony of Chairman Fang and all committee members. I would like to specially put forward three hopes for each of our party members: (1) We must have the spirit of sacrificing our lives for righteousness and enduring hardship and sacrifice. (2) We must have the enthusiasm to do what is right and serve others. (3) We must have the sentiment of rather others betraying me than I betray others. With these three conditions, I think there is not a single compatriot in the country who does not love our Party. In the future, under the leadership of Chairman Fang and all committee members, the Party affairs of Shanghai will definitely be able to promote the spirit of the Kuomintang and complete the task of our Party."

Speaker Pan's Words: A New Style

Speaker Pan then delivered a speech, saying, "It is hoped that the Party in Shanghai will have a new style in the future. Not only Kuomintang members should strive for the Three Principles of the People, but also mobilize the citizens of the entire city to be willing to strive for the Three Principles of the People. The Shanghai Municipal Party Department should regard all citizens of the city as loyal comrades of the Three Principles of the People, in order to build a country of the Three Principles of the People, and a Shanghai of the Three Principles of the People." Subsequently, Councilor Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, hoping that "the Party and government are integrated" and that the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, will realize the Three Principles of the People and achieve the ideal of universal harmony.

Fang Zhi's Reply: Implement the Revolution

Subsequently, Chairman Fang, on behalf of the oath takers, delivered a reply, stating, "I would like to put forward a few hopes for the future: (1) Comply with central laws and central resolutions, be practical and realistic, work hard, and never perfunctorily, follow old customs, exaggerate, or deceive. (2) The Party and government are integrated, and the government and the Party should maintain close contact with each other. We should cooperate with public opinion organs to jointly assist Mayor Wu in promoting government orders and building a greater Shanghai. Currently, the most important things are to suppress prices, support industry and commerce, and provide relief to the unemployed. (3) The era of 'government is not about talking too much' has passed. Under democratic politics, political parties should try their best to express their own policies and decisions, and the citizens of the whole city should also actively build and criticize. Words are not about quantity, but about telling the truth. (4) Consolidate unity, ensure peace, especially the National Assembly, which will be convened soon according to the central law. The constitution related to the long-term stability and security of the country for a hundred years will be formulated. It is hoped that all parties and social leaders will unite and work together to seek national affairs." Finally, the Party members' code of conduct was read aloud, slogans were shouted, and the music was played at 10:30 AM to complete the ceremony.

[Another News] In order to express welcome to the newly appointed Chairman of the Municipal Party Department, Fang, various agencies in the city will hold a banquet at the Lido Hotel at 3:00 PM this afternoon, and there will be entertainment.

### National Products Exhibition Hall Grand Opening Today; Covers an Area of Ten Mu and Has 200 Rooms

[Our Newspaper] The largest national products exhibition hall in the city since the victory will open at 10:00 AM today after a month of preparation.

### The Meaning of the Words "Subordinate Organizations" in the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors; The Chamber of Commerce Sends a Telegram Requesting Explanation Tomorrow

The City Chamber of Commerce urgently needs to issue an order to clarify the meaning of the words "subordinate organizations" in Article 10 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, in order to correct misunderstandings and reassure people. Yesterday, it sent separate telegrams to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Organization, and the Shanghai Municipal Government to appeal. The original telegram is excerpted as follows: "Your association, in May of this year, requested a supplementary explanation of the meaning of the words 'subordinate organizations' in Article 15 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, that those who do not hold positions in special organizations established by puppet organizations shall not be regarded as 'subordinate organizations' and shall not be subject to the restriction that they cannot be candidates for public office within a certain period of time. In lieu of a telegram, it was submitted to the Ministry of Organization and the Ministry of Social Affairs for review. Later, Luo Qinghua, the elected director of your association, went to the capital on official business and visited the central authorities in detail, handing over the telegram in person and stating that during the period of occupation, there were Baojia organizations everywhere, with ten households forming a Jia. Anyone in the neighborhoods with a little wealth was designated as Jia head, Bao head, or Lianbao head. At that time, residents could not escape the tiger's den. Those who went to the interior could only take on a false name and suffer unexpected disasters. Because the organization was widespread, the scope involved by the enemy was even wider. If it is handled in accordance with Article 15 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, and their civil rights are suspended within a certain number of years, then one out of ten households will be affected. Those who can handle public affairs for the local area will be almost wiped out in one fell swoop. Within a certain period of time, there will be no one to drive and use. The relationship is really too great. It is proposed to lift the restrictions and start anew with the people. Those who held Baojia positions during the period of occupation and did not engage in behaviors that pleased the enemy and harmed the people, and who are still elected when promoting local autonomy, should be handled in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 10 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases, and be exempted from the restrictions of Article 15 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. It is submitted for review and handling. Later, on August 9, your association received Telegram No. 7054 from the Ministry of Organization, stating: 'Regarding the case previously submitted requesting a supplementary explanation of the doubts in Article 15 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, it has been referred to the Ministry of Political Affairs for review, and it has been replied that the request of the Chamber of Commerce is obviously different from the interpretation of the Executive Yuan. For the sake of prudence, it has been recorded and submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Judicial Yuan for unified interpretation, which can be implemented nationwide, so as to form a final decision and dispel doubts.' etc. Special telegram notification etc. So far, the unified interpretation of the Executive Yuan and the Judicial Yuan has not been officially issued, and the 'Measures for Restricting the Candidacy and Appointment of Personnel Who Served in Puppet Organizations or Their Subordinate Agencies and Institutions' promulgated by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan on August 9, 1935, stipulate that these measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation, and their scope of application should be limited to personnel who served in 'puppet organizations or their subordinate agencies'. The meaning of the legal text is very clear and cannot be confused. It is already unnecessary to explain. However, some people still distort the legal text and want to confuse the words 'subordinate' with the people's organizations within the 'enemy-puppet controlled area', with the intention of fabricating charges and hoping to achieve personal gains. Newspaper reports are indiscriminate and confusing, which is enough to confuse the audience and disturb people's minds. According to Article 2, Paragraph 10 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases: 'Personnel of cultural, financial, industrial, freelance, autonomous, or social organizations within the enemy-puppet controlled area who rely on enemy-puppet forces to infringe upon others, upon accusation or report', the provisions of this article are applicable. It is found that trade associations and chambers of commerce are the financial or industrial organizations referred to in this article, and Baojia organizations at all levels are the autonomous organizations referred to in this article. Their incumbents must have the crimes mentioned in the latter part of this article and be accused or reported before they can be strictly investigated. The organizations within the 'controlled area' are very different in severity from the 'subordinate' agencies or organizations mentioned in other articles of the same regulations. The restriction measures promulgated by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan on August 9 also clearly stipulate 'subordinate' organizations, so trade associations and Baojia personnel within the enemy-puppet controlled area should not be subject to the restrictions of these measures. Please promptly give a clear order to explain, in order to correct misunderstandings and reassure people."

### A Blood Debt Owed by the Enemy in Eight Years; Investigation, Registration, and Statistics of Crimes; From November of Last Year to April of This Year; The Total Number Has Reached More Than 30,000 Cases

[Special Article from Our Newspaper] This is a blood debt! It is owed by the enemy during the eight years of invasion, and has not yet been paid off. It is unknown how this blood debt will be settled in the future?

Please take a look at the statistics of the investigation and registration of enemy crimes by the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate from November of last year to April of this year:

November of the 34th Year 1,297 cases

December 11,919 cases

January of the 33rd Year 10,160 cases

February 6,609 cases

March 422 cases

April 231 cases

Total 30,638 cases

The word "enemy" here includes enemy military police, enemy troops, and enemy expatriates. Among the 30,638 crimes, only 488 cases, less than 1.6% of the total, have victims who can point out the name of the perpetrator and the unit to which they belonged. The classification of the crimes is as follows:

Murder and Massacre 71 cases

Torture of Civilians 98 cases

Rape 3 cases

Detention of People and Inhumane Treatment 58 cases

During Military Occupation There Were Acts of Seizing Sovereignty 2 cases

Robbery 15 cases

Confiscation of Property 120 cases

Extortion of Illegal and Excessive Donations and Levies 2 cases

Wanton Destruction of Property 119 cases

Total 488 cases

Let us close our eyes and think about how many tragic stories are contained in the number 30,638? And in these many lives, many piles of blood and tears, there are also many inexhaustible and inspiring, commendable and tearful historical materials! Could it be that we, as great citizens, will lightly erase this page of blood debts?

When the Ministry of Judicial Administration ordered the Local Procuratorate to conduct this investigation and registration of enemy crimes after the victory, those kind compatriots who came from the countryside, bringing their old and young, tearfully recounted how their homes and relatives were cruelly burned and killed by the enemy, and tears kept flowing from their eyes. Now it is time to pay off the debt. They have only one wish: to punish those murderers. Although many illiterate and kind villagers mostly cannot name the perpetrators and their units, they are very sincere in their spirit of not being afraid of trouble and coming from afar to register when they hear that there is a place to appeal. They believe that murderers will eventually receive their due reward.

Speaking of this, we should review how the work of trying Japanese war criminals has progressed in the past year. How many have been punished nationwide so far? Compare it with the number of enemy crime investigations and registrations! What fraction does it account for?

"30,638", this number stained with blood and tears! However, we must recognize that this is only a part of the enemy's crimes near Shanghai? Those who sacrificed silently and were unknown, those who did not register, the enemy's crimes across the country that are millions of times greater than the corner near Shanghai - millions of times "30,638", how will they be avenged? This question, the compatriots who died under the enemy's crimes, are waiting for us, the living, to give an answer!

Inexhaustible stories stained with blood and tears, this is a blood debt! It is owed by the enemy during the eight years of invasion, and has not yet been paid off. It is unknown how this blood debt will be settled in the future!

### Panda Flies from Chengdu to Shanghai Today; Recovering from a Minor Illness; Arriving Late; After a Short Rest, Will Cross the Sea to the United States; US Military Officer Acts as a Flower Protector

[Our Newspaper] Another panda Miss has already taken off from Chengdu yesterday, spent the night in Chongqing, and will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon.

Miss was born in Western Sichuan, and her name has not yet been determined. The mission of her trip is to cross the ocean and go to the New York Zoo to fill the position of the previous Miss who died there three years ago.

Panda Miss recently suffered from a minor illness, so she missed a flight, which made the people taking care of her busy. Fortunately, Miss recovered soon, and the staff on the China Airlines flight arranged everything comfortably for her on this trip to Shanghai.

She will soon cross the Pacific Ocean by presidential ship. It was originally scheduled for a United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) staff member to accompany her, but he valued work more than "beauty" and could not spare the time. Now, a US military officer has voluntarily volunteered to be a "flower protector" and be her companion along the way.

The first panda Miss to go abroad was taken to the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago by an American explorer in 1938, which made people all over the world crazy about her. Since then, six more Misses have gone abroad one after another, two to the United States and four to the United Kingdom. The one going abroad now is the eighth Miss.

### Puppet Municipal Government Advisor Miyashita Manjiro Arrested; Procured Military Rice and Collected Materials for the Japanese Army; Disguised and Lurked in Hongkou after the Victory, Planning to Escape

Miyashita Manjiro, a senior economic advisor to the puppet municipal government, was arrested a few days ago at his residence at No. 163 Ruikangli, Hongkou, by a certain military agency. Miyashita Manjiro is from Hokkaido, Japan, and is 57 years old. He came to Shanghai to do business before the war, opening the Rongtai Foreign Firm. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out and the Japanese army occupied Shanghai, because he was familiar with the highest authorities of the enemy navy and army, he contracted military rice and specialized in enemy military uniforms. He also opened the Datong Transportation Company to transport goods for customers. Later, he became a senior economic advisor to the puppet municipal government. The policy of controlling cotton cloth and cotton yarn promulgated by the puppet government in the 32nd year was the plot of this criminal. The puppet municipal government's iron and copper donation movement was also a masterpiece of this criminal. Taking advantage of his position, he indiscriminately recruited disciples. Many shameless merchants coveted his power or heavy profits and joined his ranks. Each person paid a "seeing gift" of 2 million yuan. As a result, the criminal made a fortune and bought many properties in Shanghai. After the victory, he lurked in Hongkou, disguised as a small businessman, trying to avoid attention, but was eventually discovered and arrested by a certain military agency.

### Embezzlement of Sealed Materials Uncovered on Fuxing Island: Armed Escort Guard Company Commander Arrested and Confesses; Large Amounts of Stolen Goods Recovered from Hardware Stores on Beijing Road and Elsewhere

[Report from This Newspaper] The Fuxing Island warehouse in Yangshupu, Shanghai, experienced continuous thefts of sealed hardware materials in the middle of last month. The relevant authorities sent personnel to investigate, but no clues were found. After the victory, the island was guarded by the navy with strict security. Petty theft was practically impossible, indicating internal involvement. Therefore, the 常局(local authorities) approached the matter from the side. On the 28th of last month, they discovered that Xietai Chang Hardware Store at No. 8 Defeng Lane, Beijing Road, was selling this hardware material. They arrested the store owner, Chen Zhenchang (33 years old, from Shaoxing). After interrogation, Chen confessed that the 550 dozen hinges (seven boxes in total) were introduced by Ge Jie (from Anhui, living at No. 848 Hualong Road) and purchased from Xi Naichun (at No. 73 Gujia Lane, Beijing Road) for 2.25 million yuan. Based on this confession, the authorities went to the addresses and arrested Xi and Ge. According to Xi's confession, three or four days ago, Ge Jie and another man, Zhang Xinmin (from Henan, living at No. 3 Dean Lane, Fangbang Road, Nanshi), introduced him to Sha Zhenhua, the company commander of the 8th Company of the Fuxing Island Naval Guard Battalion. Sha claimed to have a large number of private hardware goods, cheap and of good quality. If Xi wanted to buy them, Sha would be responsible for delivery. Tempted by the prospect of high profits, Xi agreed. The next day, Sha sent two armed navy soldiers to escort 21 boxes of hardware hinges to his residence in two horse-drawn carts, asking for 8 million yuan. However, after Xi inspected the boxes, he discovered that they did not all contain hinges. Therefore, he only accepted eight boxes of hinges at the time, paying 3.49 million yuan. He later sold 550 dozen to Xietai Chang for 2.25 million yuan. As a result, he not only failed to profit but lost over 1 million yuan. At this point, the truth of the case became clear. The authorities arrested the main culprit of the inside job, Sha Zhenhua, at the Fuxing Island Naval Guard Company headquarters. After interrogation, Sha admitted to the theft. The remaining hardware materials returned by Xi, including eight boxes of copper locks and five boxes of zippers, were stored at Yin Linsheng's residence (from Xuzhou) at No. 178 Dazhong Lane, Zhongzheng Middle Road. The authorities have already retrieved these items. The zippers had been repackaged into two sacks. In addition, it was discovered that the perpetrator had previously stolen and sold a 10-horsepower motor and water pump before this incident, which Ge Jie resold to a man named "A Qi" for 700,000 yuan. The investigation is ongoing. The main culprit, Sha Zhenhua, is an active-duty naval officer and has been handed over to the Naval Military Law Office for punishment according to the law. The remaining suspects have been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution.

### Rickshaw Representatives Petition in Nanjing Last Night: Requesting Revocation or Postponement of Elimination

If that is not possible, they request that the elimination be carried out within the period of 1950 to 1953, in accordance with the decision of the Municipal Council. Finally, they hope that the rickshaw licenses to be eliminated can be changed to tricycle licenses.

Regarding the elimination of rickshaws in this city, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau convened more than ten directors of the Rickshaw Guild, including Chen Zhiyao, to the bureau for discussions at 4:00 PM yesterday. Director Wu first informed them that the elimination of rickshaws is inevitable. The authorities have not ignored the livelihood of rickshaw pullers after the elimination. Mayor Wu and Director Wu have thoroughly discussed the implementation and follow-up issues to ensure that they are practical.

The preliminary measures for eliminating rickshaws have been decided: (1) The lottery method has been abolished and replaced with an equal allocation method. (2) Rickshaws owned by a single person who pulls his own rickshaw will be eliminated last. Underage rickshaw pullers will be eliminated first. Whether rickshaw owners with fewer than ten rickshaws will also be subject to allocation for elimination has not yet been decided. Representatives of the rickshaw owners then presented their opinions, and the meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM.

### US Military Tribunal Continues Trial of Nazi War Criminals: Japanese Military Intelligence Chief Testifies

[Report from This Newspaper] Twenty-seven important personnel from the German spy agency Oehard, which continued to engage in espionage work for Japan after Germany surrendered, were on trial again yesterday by the US Military Tribunal. The person who testified was Major Hidakao, the former Chief of Intelligence of the Japanese Army stationed in China. He cited an example of the cooperation between the Oehard Bureau and the Japanese military authorities, stating that during the Okinawa campaign, the Japanese army relied on reports from the Guangzhou branch of the Oehard Bureau to find the location and deployment of the US Navy and Marine Corps. The report was signed by the head of the Guangzhou branch, Hi Ying, and bore the branch's code. At this point, the defendant's defense presented a document signed by the witness, stating that it could not be determined who wrote the report because the witness was in Nanjing at the time, and the report came from Guangzhou and was forwarded by the Intelligence Department of the 23rd Japanese Army in South China.

Therefore, the defense argued that the witness's words were contradictory and unreliable. However, the prosecutor, Major Dewey, pointed out that the document provided by the defense was not signed in the presence of US military personnel, so it could not be established.

After a long and heated debate, the witness continued to testify. According to the witness, the main task of the personnel of each section of the Oehard Bureau was to intercept the radio communications of the US Navy and Marine Corps and translate their codes. After the Battle of Okinawa, the activities of the Japanese army in North China also relied on the intelligence of the Oehard Bureau.

### Daxiang Ship Owner Appeals for Return: Management Bureau Promises to Intervene

[Report from This Newspaper] Xu Zhongxin founded the Daxiang Shipping Company before the war, with a total of six ships.

After the Management Bureau requested instructions from the Executive Yuan, it was decided that the original owner should redeem it at a price of more than 100 million yuan. Xu Zhongxin has paid all the money, and the Management Bureau instructed the China Merchants Bureau to return the ship to Xu. However, the China Merchants Bureau stated that the Shipping Association believed that the ship was still in dispute and delayed its return. Xu Zhongxin recently appealed to the Management Bureau, and Liu Gongyun promised to intervene with the China Merchants Bureau. However, Xu Xueyu, the General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, is currently not in Shanghai. The Management Bureau's opinion is that there are no property rights issues with the ship and that the China Merchants Bureau should return it.

### Ostensible Underground Work Used to Raise Funds; Selling Forged US Dollar Savings Bonds; Chen Gaoyong and Six Others File a Private Prosecution

[Report from Our Newspaper] This city's cultural, educational, and journalistic circles of Chen Gaoyong, Chu Yukun, Dai Jimin, Huang Dalin, Ji Xizong, You Zhi, and Wang Naixu, having been deceived by mistakenly purchasing forged US dollar savings bonds, have filed a complaint with the local court against Jin Dingguo and Chen Jue. It is alleged that last autumn, Jin and Chen, under the guise of raising funds for underground comrades, sold seventeen savings bonds of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China savings offices, and the Yunnan Branch of the Central Trust Bureau, each bond being in denominations of US$500, US$1,000, and US$1,500, totaling US$17,000, to various people.

### Xin Fu Chinese Medicine Store Initiates Expanded Lung Treatment and Free Medicine Campaign

Registration Provisionally Set to Begin on the First of Next Month for 200 People

[Exclusive Report from This Column] Since this column published the verified prescription for lung disease sent by Zhang Xixian, Chief of the Fengxiang County Police Bureau in Shaanxi Province, on May 19, it has attracted close attention from all quarters. Dozens of letters inquiring about it arrive daily. Compiling the reports from patients who have taken the medicine, they all say that this prescription is indeed effective for first and second-stage pulmonary tuberculosis. Once tuberculosis is contracted, vitality is immediately lost, and if not properly treated and nurtured, recovery is rare. The harm to humanity is truly not insignificant! Our people have long been called the "Sick Man of East Asia," and the spread of tuberculosis is particularly widespread. It directly causes losses in spirit and finances, and indirectly worries the nation and the people. Mr. Ren Xia, of the Xin Fu Chinese Medicine Store at No. 14, Lane 522, Hankou Road in this city, recognizing this, independently launched a campaign on July 24 to donate medicine and prescriptions, and entrusted this column to handle the registration. All lung disease patients could apply. To date, more than 1,500 patients have applied and received medicine, with an average of ten doses per person. The cost of each dose is estimated at 2,000 yuan, so the total cost has exceeded 30 million yuan. Now, in order to expand the distribution and benefit the poor and sick, Mr. Ren recently suggested at a board meeting of the Chinese Medicine Trade Association that this matter be handled collectively by the Shan Qing Society of the Medicine Trade Association. The medicine would be raised from colleagues throughout the city. The entire board passed the motion, and Mr. Ni Xizhang, the chairman of the association, also expressed his strong support. Subsequently, the two directors of the association, She Shengyuan and Fang Bingzhang, were elected to be responsible for handling the matter. Registration will begin on November 1. All truly poor lung disease patients, after being certified by the Jia and Bao chiefs, can come to the hall to fill out an application. Once the application is approved, they can begin receiving medicine. According to those with experience, lung disease patients need to take about 50 to 60 doses continuously to be effective. Those who stop after taking only ten doses will have no effect at all. This time, each person will receive about 50 or more doses, with the aim of curing the disease. This is truly good news for the poor and sick. (Yan)

### Leather Industry in Difficult Circumstances; Unable to Bear New Taxes; Production Shrinking; Business Insufficient to Cover Expenses; Wages and Interest Too High; Competition Difficult

[Report from Our Newspaper] At a time when industry and commerce are in recession and production is shrinking, the leather manufacturing industry in this city is also facing a desperate situation and will be unable to bear any new taxes. Yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, the directors and supervisors of the industry association hosted the press at the Banking Club to lament the current situation of the industry. According to Zhang Shanzhang, chairman of the association, the leather manufacturing industry is currently facing a crisis and cannot bear the 15% commodity tax. Zhang then listed the four most serious difficulties currently facing the industry: (1) Heavy Taxes: (A) Business Tax: Regardless of wholesale or retail, a 15% tax is levied. From the raw material merchant (raw hide merchant) who sells to the manufacturer, who resells to the wholesaler, who resells to the retailer, or the leather product merchant, each merchant pays the tax once, resulting in overlapping taxation. (B) Stamp Tax: The stamp tax rate amended and promulgated in April of this year is 3 yuan per thousand yuan, which is equivalent to an additional 3% business tax, and the overlapping taxation overlaps with the business tax. (2) High Wages: Comparing wages before the war with the present, they have increased about 10,000 times, while the old price of finished leather is only 4,000 times higher than before the war. Currently, wages account for 13% of the total cost. (3) High-Interest Loans: Government production loans have strict restrictions on collateral and various procedures, making them difficult to obtain, while market interest rates are as high as 20% per month. Even at 15% per month, the manufacture of sole leather takes three months, and the interest cost accounts for 24% of the total cost. The manufacture of upper leather also takes one and a half months, and the interest cost accounts for 17% of the total cost. (4) Dumping of Foreign Goods: Due to the above three reasons, the cost of domestic leather is too high, while foreign goods have perfect mechanical equipment and particularly low costs. Moreover, because the exchange rate is only 1,000 times that of before the war, they can be dumped in large quantities in China. Currently, the cost of domestic sole leather is about 6,000 yuan per catty. However, the market price of first-class sole leather is only about 3,000 yuan. Sole leather from South America costs only a little over 2,000 yuan per pound. The cost of domestic bovine upper leather is more than 3,000 yuan per square foot (100 square inches). The market price is only about 2,000 yuan. Australian patterned leather of ordinary quality costs a little over 2,000 yuan per square foot (144 square inches). The quality is excellent, and the sizes are large. Therefore, even though domestic goods are so devalued, there is still a lack of sales.

For this reason, in the past three or four months, many colleagues have found that the proceeds from sales are insufficient to pay wages and business expenses. As a result, work is intermittent, and production has been greatly reduced. According to a survey last month, the monthly output of large and medium-sized leather factories has decreased from 100,000 pounds to 20,000 pounds. Dahua Factory has decreased from 60,000 pounds to 10,000 pounds. Zhongnan Factory has decreased from 60,000 pounds to 6,000 pounds. China Factory has decreased from 60,000 pounds to 14,000 pounds. Xieyuanchang has decreased from 15,000 pounds to 4,000 pounds. Handmade leather workshops are weak, and 20% of them are currently in a state of suspension. If this continues, the total collapse of the industry is just around the corner. Now, with the imposition of a commodity tax at a rate of 15%, which is ten times higher than the business tax, it will accelerate its demise, and thousands of workers will face unemployment. The factory owners will also be forced to change industries. The only result will be that raw hides will be exported, processed and manufactured by foreigners, and then imported as finished leather or manufactured goods. The loss of rights and interests is truly regrettable.

Finally, Du Gang, the executive director of the association, and Xi Yingkui, the supervisor, inquired separately, stating briefly that the people should have the obligation to pay taxes when the government levies new taxes. However, the premise should still be to consider whether the industry can afford it. Otherwise, the small loss will lead to a big loss, which will run contrary to the original intention of the state to develop industry. Therefore, they propose to postpone the imposition of the commodity tax until the crisis in the industry has passed, and then re-determine the tax rate and collect it lightly. It is said that the industry will send representatives to Beijing in the next few days to explain the difficult situation to the Central Government and request a postponement of the imposition of the commodity tax.

### Shanghai Stock Market Steady; Few US Dollar Transactions

The situation in Shanghai yesterday was stable. The Central Bank continued to increase controls. The opening price in the morning was 1.305 million. There was still some sales to customers, and the buying interest had not diminished. It once rose to 2.22 million before encountering pressure. After stabilizing, it turned sideways. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 150 lots at a price of 2.2075 million. Afterward, it gradually turned from stable to weak, retreating to the 2.2 million level. The Central Bank slightly adjusted the market. The various parties were unable to support it and closed out their positions. By noon, it had fallen to 2.18 million. At noon, it hovered around the 2.19 million mark. The afternoon was very stable, struggling around the 2.2 million level. As a result, it was slightly down 12,000 yuan from last Saturday. Gold ornaments and silver ingots were both flat. Silver dollars were again sluggish in North sales, falling back a lot. Dark market trading was flat. Interest rates ranged from 15% to 18% per month.

The foreign exchange situation has gradually eased. The US dollar remained quiet. The British pound was at 14,700 yuan to 14,900 yuan, the Indian rupee was around 1,130 yuan, and the Hong Kong dollar was around 920 yuan, with some transactions. The retail price of the US dollar was still 3,500 yuan, but it was difficult to close deals. The dark market price was about 4,200 yuan to 4,400 yuan, with not much trading. The results were similar to last Saturday. The Hong Kong dollar fell from 930 yuan to 920 yuan for sale due to the rebound in Hong Kong telegraphic transfers and forward contracts. As a result, it was down slightly 1,000 yuan from last Saturday.

### Bond Market Dull

Bond trading volume was no more than 3 million yuan. There was still no round lot trading between buyers and sellers. Most were scattered sales. A large account from Seventh Avenue made some modest purchases. The situation was still stable. The Unified Bond opened in the morning at 2,100 yuan. The high price was no more than between 2,150 yuan and 2,180 yuan. There was some slight struggle. Midway, it fell back below 2,050 yuan before stabilizing slightly. As a result, it was up slightly 30 yuan from the previous close. A and B bonds were also up 20 yuan. D and E bonds were flat.

### Ninghong New Goods Samples

The first batch of this year's new Ningzhou black tea has arrived from Zhongxin Chang Tea Store, with more than 500 cases. Although samples are being displayed on the market, trading has not yet begun due to the surprisingly high prices demanded by sellers. Other varieties of aged tea with better quality are still favored by exporters. High-end black tea is especially closely watched by English companies. However, the process is not enthusiastic because of the scarcity of goods and lack of supply. As for this year's new special tribute tea and new Zhenmei tea, it is said that the Baitou firms are eager to try. They are currently planning to start negotiations with the suppliers. For domestic sales of red and green tea, Qimen floral tea and local tea factories welcome all comers. There were some inquiries about aged Wucao tea from stores on this street, but there were very few agreements.

### All Parties Watch and Wait; Sluggish Trading in Chinese Stocks

Chinese stocks were even more depressed. The counters of various hot stocks were also quite quiet. Over-the-counter scalping has gradually gained ground, and trading on the exchange has plummeted. The opening price in the morning initially showed a slight increase, but trading was very thin. Soon, it turned from stable to weak. The rise and fall in the middle were minimal, and it went all the way down. The floor traders took the opportunity to short. There were no twists and turns in the middle, only slight purchases from the Northern Gang, which could not resist the selling pressure. Near noon, short covering saw a brief rebound, but the buying interest was temporary. With the pressure of off-market supply never ceasing, it succumbed again at the close. Compared with last Saturday, Xinya Cement fell by one-tenth, Qinxing fell by eight-tenths of one-tenth, and Nei Yi, Wuhe, Zhongsi, Lilian, Tongyi, Xinwei, Zhongfang, Xinguang, and Jingfu each fell by about one-half of one-tenth. Yongsasha, Meiya, Datong Match, and Huafeng fell by two or three percent. Company Rongfeng and Jinglun fell slightly. The total turnover was about 7 million shares. In the off-market, various stocks continued to fall due to a lack of buyers.

Foreign stocks were unable to rise. Apart from Yeguang, which was flat, small stocks were even more lackluster. Compared with last Saturday, Yisha and Yinglian Steel each fell by a little less than one-half of one-tenth. Yeguang was flat, while Navigation alone fell by more than one-tenth. The rest each fell by one-half.

### China Trust Allocates Rayon; Can Be Implemented Within This Week; Registration Procedures Must Be Completed Within Three Days

The Central Trust Bureau previously shipped more than 4,000 cases of rayon from Japan and decided to distribute them fairly to various silk factories in the city for application. It is now known that the first allocation can be implemented within this week. The industry association is now handling the registration of each factory's purchase of rayon, which must be completed within three days. The association members are responsible for warning the registered manufacturers to fill in the amount according to actual needs and not to report falsely. If it is found that the actual usage does not match, not only will the right to allocate rayon be cancelled, but also the previous allocations will be recovered. It is said that the rayon allocated by the China Trust Bureau will be lower than that allocated by the China Textile Corporation. The previous allocation price of No. 120 Sky Bridge was 2.8 million yuan per case, while the China Trust Bureau will be about 2.56 million yuan.

### Sky Bridge Rises Another 50,000

The market price of rayon has not yet stabilized. Yesterday, No. 120 Sky Bridge with luster consistently sold for 4.25 million yuan, with a decrease of 300,000 yuan in the middle. As a result, the weekend price rose by another 50,000 yuan. Various grades of miscellaneous brands with luster and semi-luster each rose by 50,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan. The factory and merchant market was calm, and trading was sluggish. There was also an abnormal shortage of spot goods. Yesterday, the transaction price for D-grade was 3.71 million yuan, but it was old silk, and the quality and color were not superior. The price of ordinary five-dan old orders was 3.55 million yuan, which was also second-rate. Dried silk was not seen trading. The silk goods market was lonely yesterday, with stagnant sales. Therefore, the prices of all goods did not increase or decrease.

### Silk Weaving Industry Plans to Establish a Public Treasury for Easy Mortgaging

Responsible persons of the Shanghai Silk Weaving Industry Association said that the industry has been on the verge of danger in the past few months. The main reasons are the difficulty in obtaining raw materials and the heavy pressure of high-interest loans. At present, regarding raw materials, because the Japanese rayon has been shipped to 4,800 cases, and another 6,000 cases will continue to arrive, the China Trust Bureau will distribute them eight times a month according to the actual needs of each member manufacturer. Therefore, the raw material problem can be slightly solved. As for the pressure of high-interest loans, the association is currently discussing with the industry bank to organize an industry public treasury, so that each member manufacturer can mortgage raw materials and finished products to revitalize the use of funds. Methods are currently being drafted. Once the organization is successful, the future of the industry can be bright.

### Construction Fir Arrives

Yesterday, the timber market was flat and weak for fir. It is said that about one million feet of goods arrived from Fujian. The price of foreign pine was stable, but plywood was still in demand. The price of Taichang Poplar Plywood Factory was 15,000 yuan per piece.

### Over-the-Counter Scalping Revives; A Serious Problem Facing the Stock Exchange

The stock exchange market has not been prosperous, and brokers feel bored. Market funds have apparently failed to be introduced into the investment market, which was completely unexpected.

We know that the prosperity of the black market depends on the fact that there are many who use telephone conversations. The stock exchange once allowed legitimate brokers and salespersons to install five telephone lines for conversations. Brokers and brokers are absolutely not allowed to have telephone conversations, but this check has not been cashed.

There are also too few listed stocks. The American-style listing fees and annual fees make domestic manufacturers flinch. Among the first batch of 20 listed stocks, the five hot stocks are not available on the exchange. Investors are not very interested in the remaining dozen or so unpopular stocks. Conversely, too many good stocks are excluded from the exchange, which also makes investors hesitant to invest in stocks.

Over-the-counter scalping trading has gradually revived. How to lead floating funds from gambling-style scalping giants to the investment market for activity? How to prevent the spread of over-the-counter trading? This is really a serious problem facing us. (An Old-Timer)

### Flour is Controlled, But Wheat is Not; Manufacturers Say Raw Materials are Insufficient

The flour market has become chaotic since the foreign exchange adjustment. Although the authorities control flour prices, they have not yet controlled wheat prices, resulting in rampant black market flour. Recently, the authorities have resolved to control flour prices and ordered the five major flour mills to increase sales. Yesterday, the responsible person of the Maoxin Flour Mill in this city said that the five major flour mills can at most sell 10,000 bags of flour per day. This is not because production is insufficient, but because the source of wheat is not smooth. Therefore, the flour mills urgently hope that wheat prices will be controlled and that the source will be unblocked to increase flour production.

### Flat Price Flour Distribution Method

According to the current joint flat price flour distribution office of the five factories, since the distribution of flour began on the 25th of last month, about 120,000 bags have been distributed by last Saturday. Each bag weighs 44 catties, and the distribution price is 13,900 yuan. The distribution targets are all flour merchants. The office distributes 9,000 bags per day, except on Sundays or holidays. The application method is based on the flour numbers approved for the first time, totaling 70 companies, and the amount is approved according to past sales. According to the responsible person of the Flour Industry Association in the Fourth District, there are currently about 17 or 18 flour factories operating in this city, and they can produce 100,000 bags per day with existing equipment.

### Rice Prices Firm; Miscellaneous Grains Turn Weak

The rice market still has abundant river accumulation. Customers and goods registered more than 15,000 stones. The store side seized the opportunity to pick it up. The market shape was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon. As a result, japonica rice was slightly weak, and indica rice was neither honored nor humiliated. The price of inland areas stood firm, temporarily forming a stalemate. However, white yuan goods were scarce, and retail was lively, continuing to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Various roads of soybeans poured in, but they still could not get rid of their weak state. They were difficult to prosper. Broad beans were stagnant and fell by 1,000 yuan. The source of mung beans in the Jinpu southern section was also numerous, still lacking spirit and little trading, slightly less than 1,000 yuan in the middle and lower grades. Red sorghum stood firm. The shipment of sesame from Hankou was very high, and it continued to be downstream, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The supply of raw peanuts exceeded demand, and the market was flat and weak. New adzuki beans decreased by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. However, wheat bran remained firm, and soybean cakes were unchanged. The prices of various oils decreased by 300 to 500 yuan.

### Flat Price Unchanged; Existing Yarn Reported According to Order; Rising Trend Not Even Slightly Abated; Cotton Cloth Stagnant and Reduced by 2,000 to 3,000 Yuan

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the yarn market initially softened because the association's bulletin earnestly warned industry insiders to report existing inventory truthfully according to the mayor's discussion. It is known that in the mayor's face-to-face discussion, the Cotton Yarn Industry Association ordered that cotton yarn registration be completed within a limited time. The deadline is very short, starting from now until tomorrow (16th). All cotton yarn quantities currently held by members of the Cotton Yarn Industry Association must complete registration procedures before 5:00 PM tomorrow, and reported by the association for verification. However, due to active sales to customers and the arrival of buyers, the Weaving Factory Gang purchased vigorously. In addition, the Changxi market walked on its own, gradually rising after the opening. 20-count yarn rose by 40,000 to 50,000, and 32-count fine yarn was especially short and in demand, rising by as much as 135,000, the same as 42-count double-strand thread. The foundation was very firm, and it did not weaken slightly due to the yarn registration.

The Yarn Joint Sales Association opened yarn as usual yesterday afternoon, with private factories allocating 651 pieces and the Fangjian Company allocating 617.5 pieces. The allocation price was based on 20-count yarn as the standard, still 1.55 million yuan per piece. The total group allocation of yarn in the second phase was 30,000 pieces. Among them, private factories accounted for 18,000 pieces, and there are currently 1,879 pieces remaining. Fangjian Company accounted for 12,000 pieces, and there are currently 1,451 pieces remaining. The various counts of cotton yarn opened by Fangjian Company yesterday were: 10-count Lima cone yarn allocated to the underwear and canvas industry; 20-count Fengnian allocated to the dyeing and towel industry; 32-count Lima allocated to the knitting, handkerchief, and camel fleece industry; 42-count Blue Phoenix allocated to the dyeing factory; and 60-count Rainbow Ball allocated to the underwear industry.

The cloth market was quite depressed, with no improvement, and prices were also weak. The reason was that customer gangs were quiet in purchasing, and the sales on this street were stagnant. It was because the season was late autumn, but the weather was still warm, so the overall sales were not smooth, and therefore gradually turned cold. Yesterday, the market price of Longtou fine cloth was 86,000 yuan, Blue V was 84,000 yuan, 20-count unlicensed fine cloth was 74,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen serge was 93,000 yuan, and Blue Chicken was 78,500 yuan. Among them, except for serge, the prices were reduced by about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Therefore, yesterday's market price was also down 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan compared to the opening price of Fangjian last Saturday.

### Fangjian's New Initiative: Establishing a Company in the Northeast; Retail Department Opens Today

The China Fangjian Company has now decided to establish a Northeast branch to manage textile production in the area. The company recently resolved at a board meeting that in order to develop yarn and cloth production in the Northeast and to understand the actual situation there, Deputy General Manager Wu Wei has been sent to the Northeast for observation. Mr. Wu left Shanghai by plane yesterday, transferred in Ping, and headed to the Northeast. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai in two weeks. In order to make it easier for citizens in this city to purchase various fabrics, the company has set up a retail department to sell various fabrics. It has now been prepared and will officially open today. According to the business director of the company, this retail department is the same as other stores in terms of business nature, and the prices are slightly cheaper than ordinary cloth stores.

### Taiwan Sugar: Over 6,000 Tons Arrive, 18th Batch Already Distributed - Approximately 24,000 Bags

The Taiwan Sugar Corporation recently had 6,200 tons of sugar delivered by the Tai-An Company's Tai-An ship. The ship arrived in port yesterday, and unloading has already begun. Furthermore, the 18th batch of Taiwan sugar has been distributed since last week, totaling 23,900 bags. The types include raw sugar, medium sugar, coarse sugar, first-grade white sugar, and thick first-grade white sugar, totaling five varieties. The allocated price for raw sugar is 110,000 yuan, medium sugar is 130,000 yuan, coarse sugar is 170,000 yuan, refined first-grade white sugar is 180,000 yuan, and solid first-grade white sugar is 150,000 yuan. A portion of this cargo has not yet left the warehouse, and the situation should be clear in the next day or two. It is understood that the 19th batch of Taiwan sugar is scheduled to begin distribution and sale this Thursday.

Yesterday, the sugar market saw minimal activity due to destocking. Transactions were scarce, and the guild marginally lowered prices. Spot market prices for 20th-grade medium white sugar were 188,000 yuan, and raw red sugar was 120,000 yuan. Only Shantou merchants offered green goods at 117,000 yuan. While cotton red sugar was quoted at 120,000 yuan, no transactions occurred. Xinghua white sugar sold for 128,000 to 129,000 yuan, with a total of a few hundred deals completed.

### Capital of 30 Billion Yuan: Aw Boon-Haw and Others Actively Preparing for the Fujian Economic Construction Company

Overseas Chinese are initiating the establishment of the Fujian Economic Construction Joint Stock Company. On September 8th, the preparatory committee convened at the Victoria Club in Singapore. Committee members Aw Boon-Haw and Lim Keng Lian, among others, attended or sent representatives. Aw Boon-Haw and Lim Keng Lian served as co-chairmen of the committee, with Aw Boon-Haw also serving as the director of preparations. Lim Keng Lian, He Bao-ren, Huang Chong-ji, and Huang Jing-cheng were elected as representatives for fundraising in various ports. The total capital amounts to 30 billion yuan in national currency, with 10 billion yuan to be raised in Malaya, 10 billion yuan in the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Siam, Vietnam, and Burma, and 10 billion yuan in Fujian, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. The capital will be paid in two installments: half by the end of November this year and the other half by the end of January of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947]. Those who pay in full at once will be accommodated.

### White Coal Price Exceeds Million-Yuan Mark: Supply Disrupted, Market Inventory Dwindling

The coal market sees white coal lump, Yangquan, and Jiaozuo varieties experiencing dwindling inventories due to a lack of new shipments. Vendors are tightly holding onto prices, with asking prices reaching as high as 1.05 million yuan, with some minor transactions occurring between 1 million and 1.02 million yuan. Although New Hongji's current allocation is small, the presence of Kaibao and Mark white coal varieties has resulted in prices lower than those of Yangquan, with transaction prices rising slightly by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to the previous market.

### The Suffering of the Import Industry: Approximately Six Grievances

Since the victory [end of WWII], everyone knows that the most profitable business is the import industry. However, according to importers, there are many difficulties: (1) The United Kingdom and the United States have very strict controls on imports and exports. Exported goods must be approved by those countries, and export permits are sometimes even revoked while goods are being loaded onto ships. (2) Export manufacturers have no fixed delivery times. (3) According to the provisional measures for foreign exchange management, after applying for foreign exchange, settlement must be completed within three months. If settlement cannot be completed by the deadline, the Central Bank will purchase the exchange at the market price on that day, meaning that even before a transaction is successful, exchange rate and handling fee losses must be incurred. (4) For the sake of cost and reducing trouble, most merchants tend to purchase the same goods, leading to a surplus of certain items. (5) Damage during transit and theft at the docks. (6) High-interest loans: When placing orders, applying for foreign exchange typically requires a deposit of 30% to 50%. However, there is no guarantee of delivery dates. At a compound interest rate of 1.67% per month, the interest will equal the principal in just five months of non-arrival. If the time is extended, the profit margin will be even smaller.

### Autumn Silk Harvest Only 10,000 Dan

According to a silk industry magnate, this year's autumn silk harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is the worst in a decade. A total of 320,000 sheets of autumn silkworm eggs were sold to silkworm farmers in Jiangsu Province, and 180,000 sheets in Zhejiang Province, totaling 400,000 sheets. With an estimated yield of 6.5 jin of dry cocoons per sheet, the total amount of dry cocoons should have been 25,000 dan. However, since the autumn silk harvest began, silk factories from various regions have been opening for business and purchasing in the production areas. As of the 13th, Jiangsu Province has collected approximately 23,000 dan of fresh cocoons, which can only be converted into 8,000 dan of dry cocoons based on a conversion rate of 290 jin of fresh cocoons to one dan of dry cocoons. The autumn cocoon production in Zhejiang Province has been even more drastically reduced, with the province only collecting approximately 4,500 dan of fresh cocoons, which can only be converted into approximately 1,600 dan of dry cocoons using the same conversion rate. The total amount of dry cocoons collected is only around 10,000 dan. The price of fresh cocoons is lower in Jiangsu, at 160,000 yuan per dan, while it is higher in Zhejiang, at 180,000 yuan per dan.

### Tong'an Dried Longan Prices Rise

Recently, due to a shortage of ships, Tong'an dried longan has not been transported, and sporadic sales here have led to gradually increasing prices. However, destocking has not been particularly smooth. According to telegrams from the production area yesterday, prices have increased by another 20,000 yuan.

### National Physical Education Implementation Plan: Ministry of Education Intensifies Supervision and Promotion in Provinces and Cities

[This newspaper, Nanjing] Since the Ministry of Education's Organizational Regulations for the National Physical Education Committee were approved and promulgated by the National Government last summer, the Ministry has been restructuring its physical education administration, expanding its organization, appointing representatives from relevant departments, and inviting individuals with research contributions in physical education. Ministry members have also been assigned to form the National Physical Education Committee and undertake various physical education initiatives. The organization of the National Physical Education Committee, its actual staff, and its tasks are briefly described as follows:

Organization

The National Physical Education Committee consists of 21 members. In addition to one representative each from the Ministries of Interior, Military Administration, Conscription, Social Affairs, Military Training, and the Department of Health, as well as the Director of the Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education and one advisor, totaling eight individuals, the Ministry of Education has appointed 13 individuals with research or significant contributions to physical education, namely Hao Gengsheng, Yuan Dunli, Dong Shouyi, Wu Yunrui, Fang Wanbang, Ma Yuehan, Wu Bangwei, Kuang Zi, Xu Minhui, Jin Zhaojun, Zhang Jiwu, Cheng Dengke, and Jiang Lianggui, who are all physical education experts. Among the committee members, there are three standing committee members: Yuan Dunli, Hao Gengsheng, and Dong Shouyi. Recently, Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education designated Hao Gengsheng as the convener of the committee meetings, entrusting him with full responsibility. The term of office for committee members is one year and is renewable. The full committee is scheduled to meet once a year, with the possibility of convening special meetings when necessary. The Minister of Education presides over the meetings, and if the Minister is unable to attend, one of the standing committee members will be mutually selected to preside. Committee members, except for full-time members, are unpaid.

Work

Of the 21 committee members, some are representatives from various departments and are contacted only when meetings or relevant liaisons are required. The 13 physical education experts appointed for their research contributions in physical education either serve as principals of physical education schools or professors of physical education at universities and cannot work at the Ministry. Therefore, according to regulations, five of them must be full-time. Hao Gengsheng, Yuan Dunli (although he serves as the president of Beijing Normal College, his position is dedicated to research and communication of physical education knowledge both domestically and internationally), Dong Shouyi, Fang Wanbang, and Wu Bangwei are permanently stationed and fully responsible. The committee also has a secretary who manages daily affairs under the direction of the standing committee. There are also school physical education groups, social physical education groups, and research and implementation groups. Each group has a director who manages the affairs of that group under the direction of the standing committee. In addition, there are several staff members and assistant staff members who carry out the tasks of each group under the direction of their supervisors.

Tasks

The tasks of the National Physical Education Committee are:

Eight: (1) Planning and implementation of national physical education plans; (2) Guidance and assessment of national physical education; (3) Review of national physical education funding; (4) Inspection and statistics of national physical fitness; (5) Training and certification of physical education teachers; (6) Research on physical education academic subjects; (7) Management of sports competitions; (8) Other national physical education matters. It is reported that under the leadership of Minister Zhu, the committee is vigorously promoting its work. The Ministry of Education has recently intensified its supervision of the National Physical Education Committees of education departments in all provinces and cities across the country to actively promote national physical education implementation plans. It is also reported that Yuan Dunli will travel abroad to recruit foreign physical education experts to assist in the promotion of national physical education in China.

### Municipal Education Bureau Promotes National Education, Implements Compulsory Enrollment, and Establishes Performance Evaluation and Reward/Punishment Methods

In order to implement the central government's policy of popularizing national education as soon as possible, the Municipal Education Bureau is implementing the First Five-Year Plan for National Education, so that all school-age children and out-of-school citizens in the city can receive compulsory education for a certain period of time. In addition to following the National Education Implementation Guidelines promulgated by the Ministry of Education and referring to the actual situation in the city, it has formulated various plans and is actively promoting them. The measures for compulsory enrollment and delayed/exempt enrollment, performance evaluation, and reward/punishment are detailed as follows:

### Bloodstains on Sumatra: Inside the Second Riot in Indonesia

— Special Dispatch from Bagan Apiapi, Sumatra, September 20th, by Mao Ming

Since the resolution of the conflict with Indonesia on March 12th of this year, which was caused by the humiliation of the national flag, the murder of the overseas Chinese leader, and the burning of houses, the authorities of the Bagan Apiapi Overseas Chinese General Association have clearly recognized that in these extraordinary times, the prosperity and safety of the area can only be achieved by promoting harmony and unity between the Chinese and Indonesian people. Therefore, they have made every effort to engage in national diplomacy, hoping to avoid disaster during this difficult period and preserve the lives and property of the overseas Chinese in the port. They have spared no effort to assist with government measures, celebrating or participating in celebrations of Indonesian commemorative days. They have also held lavish banquets for the arrival of officials from the Bukit Batu and Qianba Ru areas. Recently, in response to the government's proposal, they organized an international club with the participation of Chinese, Malay, and Indonesian people. The club was formally established on September 3rd.

The Occurrence and Development of the Incident

However, some Indonesian extremists, especially military personnel, were dissatisfied with the peaceful resolution of the March 12th incident (which was mediated and signed by the Bukit Batu Governor). Extremists in the Asahan and Tanjungbalai areas have always viewed the overseas Chinese as meat on the chopping block and were even more dissatisfied with the Bagan government's (supposed) weakness toward the overseas Chinese. Moreover, in these areas, the troops were disorganized, vying for power and profit. They felt the need to find new territory to satisfy their selfish desires. Therefore, about two months ago, the so-called Tanjungbalai naval forces (long-haired) occupied the town of Liba Ham, under local jurisdiction, without notifying the local government. They forcibly requisitioned military rations from the local overseas Chinese, detaining and beating them, leaving no abuse uncommitted. At that time, the General Association immediately contacted the local government and telegraphed Bukit Batu requesting that the foreign troops be ordered to leave the area. Although the government agreed to comply, it had no effect. Several weeks ago, the troops advanced to the town of Gui Wu, only two hours by water from the port. The goods of overseas Chinese merchants were taken. A Malayan cargo ship was detained in nearby waters, and two Hainanese overseas Chinese were killed. The troops then intercepted ships at sea, robbing commercial vessels and properties. The General Association reported the situation to the local government and requested that they be suppressed, but although the government agreed, nothing was done. Finally, the local magistrate and police chief repeatedly assured the General Association that if the troops continued to disobey orders, the government would take necessary measures. They also stated that unless authorized in advance by the government, the troops were not allowed to land at the port. They would use force if necessary. With the government's assurances, the overseas Chinese were less fearful, and residents were able to live and work in peace.

Later, a national army colonel from Bukit Tinggi, the police chief of Bukit Batu, the Bukit Batu Governor, the military police chief, and dozens of armed troops came to the port together. They said their mission was to resolve the problems of Liba Ham and Gui Wu. The overseas Chinese felt gratified that the government was paying attention to dealing with the undisciplined troops. After arriving at the port, the officials also summoned overseas Chinese leaders to talk, urging the Chinese and Indonesians to cooperate and be friendly. The overseas Chinese leaders all agreed. On the morning of September 18th, the officials borrowed a motorboat from the Chinese, saying they would personally go to the town of Gui Wu to resolve the rebellious Tanjungbalai navy. However, they only took a small number of troops with them. About an hour after the boat left, it returned, accompanied by another motorboat towing several sampans. The boats were full of troops. The overseas Chinese were quite surprised. When they saw the troops land on the dock, numbering about two hundred, armed and ready, most of whom were Tanjungbalai troops, the overseas Chinese fled along the way. Shops closed their doors, and order broke down. At this time, the General Association personnel came out to persuade the overseas Chinese to calm down and not misunderstand. As soon as the troops left the customs office, they split into one group that went to the government offices with the officials, and another group that fired their guns as a signal and rushed to the city center. The leader carried a machine gun and shot at anyone he encountered. A Chaozhou person could not avoid it and fell to the ground. The overseas Chinese, seeing that the situation had reached a critical point, took up arms and returned fire. The sound of gunfire erupted, and a fierce street battle began. The Indonesian machine gunner and several vanguards were shot and retreated to the customs warehouse. The overseas Chinese surrounded the entrance to the customs office. On the other hand, the Indonesian troops in the barracks immediately surrounded the Chinese residential area and occupied the Chinese rubber factory (a four-story building) as a fortress, controlling several streets. With enemies on both sides, the overseas Chinese were in a precarious situation. They decided to eliminate the Tanjungbalai bandits in the customs warehouse first. After several charges, they finally drove the bandits back at 1 p.m. At night, both sides were on high alert, but there was no contact. However, the overseas Chinese were extremely worried because a large number of women and children in the residential area were under enemy control, and news was cut off. They could not sleep all night. On the morning of the 19th, gunfire resumed, but both sides adopted a defensive posture. A small group of overseas Chinese families risked escaping from the line of fire at dawn and fled into the city, reporting the atrocities of the Indonesian troops. They said that several women and children had been killed, and most had been detained. All the residences had been looted. This news increased the overseas Chinese's worry.

### Three Hours of Desperate Fighting: Indonesians Retreat and Raise White Flag

The General Association, fearing that the situation was getting out of control, selected an Indonesian to convey the General Association's intentions, requesting the police station and officials to find a way to mediate the dispute and begin peace negotiations. Two hours later, they received a reply from the government agreeing to peace talks, requesting that all members of the General Association carry a white flag to the magistrate's office for negotiations, with the government guaranteeing the safety of the members to and from. The General Association requested that the government send representatives to negotiate in the city, and the General Association would protect the safety of the government representatives. However, the government did not respond, and the Indonesian troops intensified their attack. They relied on superior weapons, controlled most of the intersections, and shot at anyone they encountered, cutting off traffic in many parts of the city. The situation was extremely dire. The overseas Chinese felt that death was imminent.

As the saying goes, "A cornered beast will still fight." Even more so with humans. When backing water as a battle position, one will have no mercy for the category if cannot win. Therefore, those with more strategic sense rose up to encourage a counterattack, and many responded. The initial goal was to retake the rubber factory. They advanced in several directions, bravely charging forward regardless of the gunfire. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Indonesians were unable to hold out and retreated. The rubber factory was recaptured, and they took the opportunity to recapture the Zhonghua Public School and the Minde Bookstore (both in the residential area). At this time, the overseas Chinese families trapped in the area escaped to the city. Morale was extremely high, and they took advantage of the momentum to besiege the barracks and quickly captured it. Then they occupied the post and telegraph office (with ambush inside). Finally, they surrounded the police station (the police station had the most weapons. Since it could not maintain order, it should have remained neutral, but the police station supplied the Indonesian troops with a large number of weapons and continued to shoot at the residences and residents). At this time, the number of mobilized people reached one or two thousand. The sound of gongs and flutes was endless, and the momentum of the charge was overwhelming. They finally surrounded the police station. The police were frightened and fled. Finally, the police chief surrendered with a white flag. This counterattack was a concerted effort by the overseas Chinese, with the force of a thunderbolt. In just three hours, the Indonesian reactionary forces in the city were cleared, and five or six hundred overseas Chinese women and children who had been detained were able to celebrate their survival. The remaining Indonesian forces fled into the forests outside the city.

According to reports, the Indonesian troops originally planned to massacre the overseas Chinese prisoners in the concentration camp in an emergency. However, the Indonesian in charge of the concentration camp took the keys and fled. Although the Indonesian troops used a knife to cut the lock open, the overseas Chinese had already arrived, which was truly a dangerous situation. It was also reported that some of the detained women and children were beaten and raped by Indonesian troops.

Looking at this incident, the speed of the Indonesian troops' actions clearly indicates a planned conspiracy. The government repeatedly promotes friendship and cooperation, yet now it uses the excuse of resolving the rebel army in Gui Wu to concentrate military forces from various places to attack us. Troops are not used to defend against foreign enemies but to harass the people. How can this not arouse public anger?

The purpose of the Indonesian troops' provocation this time was: 1. To avenge the failure of the reckless actions on March 12th. 2. Because Indonesia's economic power is weak, they want to suppress the city by force and then extort money from the overseas Chinese at will.

The Indonesian troops were well-trained and had sufficient weapons. They gathered elite troops from various places, as well as police and thugs, numbering thousands, and had a pre-planned plan. Yet, they were defeated in a short period of two days by the overseas Chinese, who had no training, lacked weapons, and were unprepared. This is because the overseas Chinese fought for self-defense and survival, and they were righteous. The Indonesians used violence to invade others, which is against reason. Therefore, as soon as they made contact, they collapsed. However, the casualties among the overseas Chinese also reached more than a hundred.

### Guard Against Another Indonesian Counterattack: Overseas Chinese Actively Deploy and Call for Rescue

After the incident on the morning of the 18th, the Indonesians telegraphed various places to request reinforcements. That night, the overseas Chinese also sent representatives to Consul General Wu and compatriots in Malaya to ask for assistance. By the night of the 19th, the overall situation in the port had stabilized, but they feared that Indonesian reinforcements from other places would continue to arrive, and if they could not resist, more than 20,000 overseas Chinese would be massacred. Therefore, on the night of the 20th, they sent four more representatives to Malaya to call for rescue, and seven injured people (with bullets still lodged) were transported to Malaya for treatment.

On the 21st, the entire city actively deployed defenses, using cars to transport rubber sheets and piling them up at various intersections as substitutes for sandbags to facilitate defense. In the afternoon, armed troops escorted about a hundred Indonesian women and children back to the suburbs. According to investigations, two motorboats carrying Indonesian reinforcements were anchored in the port of Yaluo, about seven kilometers from the port. The port is accessible from both land and sea.

On the morning of the 22nd, it was learned that the Indonesian reinforcements numbering more than a hundred had landed at the port of Yaluo. Fearing that reinforcements would continue to concentrate and surround the city with local defeated soldiers, they decided to strike first and catch them unprepared. They sent troops by land and sea. At 11:00 a.m., two motorboats returned from Malaya, reporting that Consul General Wu had contacted the British and Dutch authorities to request support. He also visited Lord Killion, a special envoy of the British, asking him to mediate the Dutch-Indonesian dispute in Batavia and protest to Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir. The motorboats also transported some supplies, which slightly eased the anxiety of the overseas Chinese. In the afternoon, the attacking troops returned safely. They said the enemy troops were hiding deep in the forest, with no trace, and they could not fight. The two motorboats anchored in the port belonged to overseas Chinese in Malaya and had been seized by the Indonesian authorities in Pekanbaru to transport troops. The troops had two machine guns and dozens of rifles. The attacking troops immediately released the two seized motorboats back to their port. According to the motorboat personnel, the Jinhaili motorboat carrying the overseas Chinese representatives and seven injured people was detained by the Indonesians off the coast of Qianba Ru and taken to Bukit Batu. The lives of the personnel are unknown, and the overseas Chinese are very anxious.

At 9:30 a.m. on the 23rd, two Allied aircraft circled over the city to survey the ground situation for about ten minutes. The morale of the overseas Chinese was boosted, as if they had received reinforcements. According to reports from overseas Chinese returning from Malaya, this was the result of the consul's contact with the governor. In the afternoon, it was reported that 300 overseas Chinese in Gui Wu had been detained and eight had been killed, but the exact details were unknown. The defense force held a meeting in the afternoon to discuss strengthening the armed organization and electing commanders and deputy commanders, and dividing the troops into naval and land defense teams.

Because enemy ships continued to transport reinforcements and detain ships, the armed Hailong vessel patrolled the sea on the morning of the 24th. Aircraft came to reconnoiter again in the morning. Many roadside vendors have resumed business today. According to news from overseas Chinese in Qianba Ru, the Indonesian troops there have retreated and the overseas Chinese are safe.

On the morning of the 25th, aircraft came to reconnoiter again. Overseas Chinese at the dock signaled for help with flags. Crowds were prohibited from watching on the road, and order was fairly good. In the afternoon, fishermen at sea reported that a Chinese crew member of an Asahan motorboat had told them that Asahan had sealed up fourteen motorboats in preparation for transporting reinforcements here, urging Bagan overseas Chinese to pay attention. According to a refugee from the village, more than 30 overseas Chinese in the village of Bentongga have been massacred. As a result, people were panic-stricken and could not live in peace. In the evening, radio stations in London and Chongqing reported the Bagan incident, saying that the government would send representatives to investigate the truth. Also, the motorboat that carried three seriously injured people to Malaya this morning was detained by the Indonesians at sea again. After the Hailong vessel pursued it, the motorboat was released, but five overseas Chinese were arrested and taken away.

On the morning of the 26th, aircraft continued to reconnoiter as usual. The overseas Chinese wrote English words on white cloth and placed them on the dock, stating "Surrounded, please rescue quickly." In the evening, Chongqing Radio said: "According to a dispatch from Batavia, the conflict between the Chinese and Indonesians in Bagan has gradually eased. Consul General Jiang expressed that a joint Chinese-Indonesian investigation team has departed since the 25th. According to a high-ranking Indonesian official who went to Batavia from Sumatra, the incident was caused by agitators who claimed to be the Indonesian Navy but were actually Dutch spies after arriving in Bagan." "Welcome the arrival of the investigation team." This resolved the Indonesian extremists' riot. The brave resistance of the overseas Chinese was purely for self-defense. If they had not defeated the bandits, they would have been massacred. What they hope for is to live and work in peace, so they hope that the investigation team can complete its mission as soon as possible.

### Glimpses of Zhengzhou

— Special Dispatch from Zhengzhou, 2nd Day of the Month, by Reporter Wang Shoumei

The car arrived in Zhengzhou, and it was almost dark. I followed a teahouse attendant who was touting for business at the station to a hotel. I looked at a few, and they were all dilapidated and terribly dirty. There were no satisfactory rooms. But the prices were not low. It cost three thousand yuan a day, including tea and a 10% tax. A traveler would have to spend four or five thousand yuan a day. Not to mention eating. A meal costs two or three thousand yuan. The cost of living in Zhengzhou is indeed twice as high as in Kaifeng.

Zhengzhou is crossed by the Longhai and Pinghan railways, forming a key transportation hub in the Central Plains. Every day, it welcomes travelers from different places, and every day, it sends out many travelers, allowing them to reach their destinations. Zhengzhou is reviving from desolation and moving towards prosperity day by day.

Devastated and Unable to Recover

Zhengzhou is a city that has been devastated and destroyed by the enemy. It has not yet recovered. The superficial bustle cannot hide the inner desolation. There is not a single decent and clean street here. The constant stream of cars, jeeps, and trucks stir up a lot of dust, making it uncomfortable to breathe.

Datong Road and Dehua Street are the first places to prosper here. The goods in the shops are all shipped from Hankou or Shanghai. Not many. In the evening, the streets are full of pedestrians, but the dazzling gasoline lamps in the shops do not attract them. It turns out that many of the people gathered here are stranded due to the war and the disruption of transportation.

This is a city of mixed elements and very chaotic order. There have been two robberies recently, but they were quickly solved by Commander Liu Jiakang, who is responsible for security. Director Gu Jian of the Pacification Headquarters has ordered Commander Liu to rectify military discipline. Under strict implementation, the results are quite significant. Today, the troops stationed in various cities have given people a very bad impression due to their poor attitude and discipline.

Different Atmosphere Compared to Kaifeng

Zhengzhou and Kaifeng are two cities only 140 li apart, but the atmosphere in the two cities is completely different. One is too quiet, and the other is too dynamic. If Kaifeng is compared to Beiping, then Zhengzhou is a bit like Tangshan. Both the too quiet and too dynamic cities give people an uncomfortable feeling of suffocation. Zhengzhou does not have a decent newspaper that can be considered a newspaper, and the readers are taken away by the Kaifeng and Hankou newspapers of the day. Who wouldn't say this is a joke? The bookstores here, like those in Kaifeng, are full of soft and obscene reading materials, and spiritual food is lacking. If you are not too vulgar, you will feel deeply lonely. In the old theaters, places where Henan opera and storytelling are performed are packed with people. There are no decent cinemas, and they are all showing films from the enemy-puppet era. Although the drama troupe led by Xu Sheng and the drama troupe of the Political Department of the Pacification Headquarters are constantly performing, they cannot break the silence here. Naturally, their spirit of hard work is worthy of admiration. In order to strengthen activities and strive for new progress, the Zhengzhou branch of the Chinese Drama Association was established under the leadership of Chen Zhong, the deputy captain of the drama propaganda team, to promote the improvement of old dramas. It is hoped that this group of pioneers will continue to work tirelessly in the traditional spirit of drama workers.

Remarkable Achievements in Epidemic Prevention and Disaster Relief

Zhengzhou, a city with three or four thousand prostitutes, has a large number of customers in the Xiaoyao Lane where the prostitutes gather. The chaotic situation is conceivable. The fraud case that occurred the other day happened in a brothel. In response to these phenomena, Commander Liu, in conjunction with the commissioner and county magistrate, is carrying out a census, Baojia organization, self-defense team training, and general training for all levels, strengthening security work, and systematically bringing this disordered city onto the right track. Even the old graveyard in the northwest corner, a gathering place for vendors, rogues, local bullies, and stray soldiers, has been transformed into a national market, with streets laid out to ensure that "people must be registered in households, and households must be registered in Jia" to reduce the lurking and activities of bandits and thieves.

Zhengzhou is a dirty city, and an epidemic is currently prevalent. The health committee organized by the authorities is carrying out epidemic prevention, clearing garbage, tidying up sewers, and building public toilets. The working team of the Relief Administration is also spraying DDT and forcing residents to be vaccinated at intersections to reduce the threat of disease to the city's residents.

Disaster relief efforts are being promoted here, and the results are better than in Kaifeng. They show their work achievements, unlike Kaifeng, which uses "quiet streets" to please people. The term "quiet streets" has been forgotten in other places since the Northern Expedition!

The last time I came back from Shanghai, I passed through this city in a hurry, but this time I had the opportunity to stay for two days and fully observed the city, and I felt very happy. Zhengzhou is "chaotic" and "poor," but it is improving everywhere and full of vitality. This is exactly what makes us happy.

Tunnel between Fenggang and Taitung, Taiwan Province (Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun)

### A Journey in Tainan

— A dispatch from Tainan on the 9th, by our special correspondent, Jiang Muyun

In mid-September, I, the reporter, departed from the provincial capital, Taipei, for a journey to the central and southern parts of the island, lasting half a month, and returned north late at night at the beginning of this month. The original plan also included trips to Penghu and Taitung, but the existing transportation had already become difficult, and the typhoon on September 25th further blocked the sea and mountain routes. More than a dozen doctors and nurses dispatched by the Health Bureau to Penghu County to provide emergency assistance for cholera were stranded in Kaohsiung hotels for more than two weeks. Even the Taiwan Transportation Vessel (台交丸) of less than a hundred tons could not operate on a regular schedule. Moreover, the highway from Pingtung to Hedong was already considered a daunting journey by travelers in normal times. Even if one could reach Taitung, the coastal highway after Hualien Port had not yet been repaired in the Hualien County section since the last earthquake. These two places were obviously isolated from the rest of the province, directly impacting my plan to circumnavigate the island, forcing me to return to Taipei prematurely.

Grain Collection Exceeds Expectations

Without visiting the central and southern parts of Taiwan, one would not know its size, let alone its wealth. Historically, the central and southern regions were cultural centers and political hubs. They possess a vast plain, yielding two harvests of grain each year. Favorable weather conditions and man-made irrigation systems ensure abundant agricultural production. More than three million farmers live and die here. In the past, Japanese public and private landholdings accounted for 60 percent. Taiwan Takushoku Co., Ltd. was the most exploitative of the big landlords. Farmers had to pay half of their harvest for the rulers' allocation of fertilizer and seeds, and they also had to sell their food grains cheaply, offering their blood and sweat to the rulers. After the retrocession (光復), this tenancy system has obviously undergone major reforms. Some Japanese-owned land has been transferred to farmers for cultivation, and some government-owned land has been leased to farmers at low rents. This is reflected in the unprecedented grain collection, which has achieved 80 to 90 percent success, sufficient to illustrate the depth of farmers' sense of obligation to pay taxes. However, farmers are most concerned about how the government will use the collected rice and loan funds, because this will be the blueprint for next year and an excellent test of political measures. However, the government is not without its questionable aspects. The assessment of barren mountains and forests, and unproductive "敷地" (real estate), has increased more than eighty times since 1937, making it impossible for taxpayers to bear, and the failure to consider this beforehand has ultimately led people to lodge "protests" (raising protests is just a catchphrase among the people of this province), fostering a new atmosphere.

A New Trend of Opposing Reality

During my two weeks in the major cities of southern Taiwan, I also came into contact with local gentry, youth, farmers, and workers from all walks of life, as well as county and city councilors representing public opinion. They all had a bellyful of grievances to vent and countless questions that needed answering. They often used the enthusiasm and passion of the previous year, full of hope, to challenge reality. In general, cursing reality and hating the status quo were the main themes of their conversations and discussions. To put it bluntly, in their disappointment, they have created a new atmosphere of opposing the government.

The result of this new atmosphere is discord and alienation between the people and the government, the military and the people, and the people and the people. Short-sighted provincials blame it on the mainlanders (外省人). In the south, they call mainlanders "阿山吓," a sarcastic term. In Kaohsiung Port, the distance between the two is even greater. Some minor incidents often trigger major disturbances, and some problems that shouldn't be problems become big problems. We cannot say that the provincials are making a mountain out of a molehill, because they have been separated from the motherland for too long, and their temperament is narrow, impatient, and bears the characteristics of a tropical industrial region. But in this way, local officials and satirical workers are often greatly disheartened.

People ask, why does public opinion provoke the feelings between the government and the people? And the people blame the government for not facing reality, adopting public opinion, and maintaining a great distance from the people.

### Gentry Who Monopolize Public Opinion

In Taiwan, the councilors who represent public opinion are mostly medical professionals. In the past, the Japanese allowed Taiwanese to obtain medical doctorates but restricted general opportunities for secondary and higher education. After the retrocession, they were elected by the people as local county and city councilors, and some even served concurrently as township chiefs. I attended the meeting of 76 township chiefs convened by the Tainan County government in Xinying. Most of them were county councilors, and some were doctors, with education levels above middle school. They still retain their previous ideas about township chiefs, respecting themselves and being respected by others. This situation is the same in Kaohsiung County, where 29 of the 56 councilors also serve as township chiefs. Before the government decided to implement the popular election of township/district chiefs after the 16th of this month, it issued two orders: first, current councilors may not concurrently serve as township chiefs; second, members of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association (皇民奉公會) may not hold public office. The former have mostly resigned from their township chief positions and now serve solely as councilors. The latter has made councilors feel uneasy. In fact, some of those who distinguished themselves during the Japanese era are now quite prominent, especially the councilors in each locality. For example, in Chiayi City's 21 councilors, it is said that only two did not belong to the former Imperial Rule Assistance Association. Provincials said with indignation that the government-appointed gentry monopolized public opinion, but apart from this group of gentry, how many councilors can be selected? This is the problem. The government, for this reason, has had to adopt a tolerant attitude and establish a method of reporting, which is the government's dilemma.

Factory Closures and Unemployment Become a Problem

What makes provincials dissatisfied with reality is the high prices and rampant corruption. Regarding prices, they compare them to those of the previous year. In fact, it is difficult for an island to avoid external waves. Regarding corruption, the government encourages people to provide concrete facts and deal with them strictly according to the law, but they cannot do so, only roar and complain. I asked several supervisors in charge of a certain unit, all of whom were provincials. He said very frankly that narrow-minded and disunited provincial compatriots are really not easy to deal with. At the time of retrocession, they thought that the positions held by the Japanese should rightly belong to the provincials. In fact, this was not the case. Taiwan province cannot detach itself from the mainland and unify everything on its own. As a result, they were disappointed. Currently, the only thing they consider serious is the unemployment problem, which is indeed a fact. I visited three sugar factories in the south, one of which was the Pingtung branch of Taiwan Sugar Corporation, which has a production capacity of 3,000 tons of white sugar. It is currently shut down. Taiwan Sugar Corporation plans to restore some factories this year, but the area of sugarcane fields has obviously shrunk to two-fifths. Especially in the rice-sugarcane interchangeable area around Taichung, people are very doubtful and unwilling to plant sugarcane, even though the company has repeatedly advertised that fertilizer is available and provides loans of 3,000 to 6,000 yuan per hectare (15 mu) for sugarcane seedlings and 3,000 to 4,000 yuan for cultivation, but they still hesitate. Sugarcane, which could not be sold retail before, is now available everywhere in the market, and workers look at the sugarcane fields and sigh. Along with sugarcane, factories such as paper and alcohol factories are also shut down. The butanol factory in Chiayi City had more than 3,000 employees at its peak, with total assets of over 20 million yuan, producing gasoline, ammonia, wine, insecticides, etc. Currently, it requires NT$30 million in repairs to resume work. Now there are more than 200 workers, and the capitalists, due to soaring raw material prices, cannot immediately repair and start work, and must lay off another half, leaving 100 people to serve as guards. When I visited, these employees were discussing privately, panicking about the unemployment problem. Other agricultural product processing factories, and even Fengtian (豐田), are the same. The high prices of raw materials and labor force the factories to stop production. If they don't produce, it's already a loss. Once they produce, they suffer a loss. This is a crisis.

### Boundless Autumn Scenery in the North

— A dispatch from Beiping on September 28th, by Yuxin

The "intermittent" autumn rains in the Beiping-Tianjin area have not cleared for several days. After an investigation, Beiping can be summed up in one sentence: "Walls have collapsed, houses have fallen, roofs are overgrown with grass, and the ground is muddy." Especially in the dilapidated and poorly maintained houses in the embassy district outside Xuanwumen, most of the roofs are "wide open" after the rain, or they are leaning east and west. Those that have not been smashed by the rain have a pile of green grass growing below the ridge. As a gentle breeze passes, new small grasses nod frequently to the passing pedestrians in front of the eaves, as if they are congratulating themselves. In addition, in the crooked alleys, after a small rain that greets the sun, you can see mud everywhere and it is difficult to find a foothold. Pedestrians on the road have the suffering of "I can't go, brother."

Recently, there have also been cases of collapsed houses at the Tianjin wharf, one after another.

The cleanup team people, after being urged a thousand times, finally appeared. The food grains in the warehouses that have been taken over for a long time in both places—these moldy substances have become the淤血 (stagnant blood) after victory. The sky is clearing! The issuance of a "suspension order" is tantamount to adding a thunderbolt from the blue to the retained personnel!

Some key intersections have added a layer of color and a new look to Beiping. Try touring Qianmen and Xidan, and you will know: the signs "烙," "烤," "涮" are hung high on the faces of the restaurants to attract old wives. Really, autumn insects are on the market. The area around Xuanwumen Shizi Street is a cricket "market." Buyers who love crickets flock here, picking those with high-pitched, strong, and powerful wings, which are called top-quality, priced at 5,000 yuan. Buyers spend money like dirt, and sellers are still reluctant to sell. Second-class crickets (crickets are also called 蟋蟀) are also worth hundreds or two hundred yuan.

The excavation of crickets accounts for the top spot in the world of autumn insects. This animal likes to lie dormant in soil that is not dry or wet. It is said that there are many people engaged in capturing them around Taoranting outside Xuanwumen in Beiping, especially children. A group of two or three people carry a set of furniture: an iron cover fence, a clay pot, a small cloth bag, and a hollow paper tube. The children are naive and funny, and some simply lie on the mounds to dig them out. They love to catch 二意儿 (crickets with two antennae), 三意儿, and 老米嘴. After a while, they use the paper tube to guide them into the pot for confinement. If they fight and call loudly in the pot, it will definitely cause great joy. The autumn clouds above these children's heads flutter and dance. The reed pond outside the Taoranting wall, like an ocean, is endless, decorating the boundless autumn scenery! At the same time, looking to both sides: the crops have all ripened, the peanuts are connected by four leaves, and purple flowers bloom on the eggplants, serving as a collar decoration for the young women of Qingqiu. How elegant and beautiful! The nearby tilted and uneven farmhouses, accompanied by these fields near and far, are worthy of being a pastoral city.

### The Errors of American Marriage

— Duanmu Ping

One-fifth of American marriages end in divorce, and women aged 20 to 30 account for one-third of them. Why? American marriage is based on a ridiculous concept—illusory love—and emphasizes sensuality. Do those boys often regard their ideal wives as young mothers or operating partners, or do they think that sensuality is paramount? What will happen to the children born to the latter?

He may say that the children should be managed by women, and he himself is crazy about fulfilling his fatherly duties, but he is ashamed of the children. This kind of sexual love and romantic love blocks the brilliance of fatherly love.

The fundamental error of marriage is obvious. In America, no one teaches "fatherhood." But it is the basis of male existence. This instinct must come from experience, experience, and contact with a real father as a child. But after the children are born, most of those American fathers disappear. During the day, he is in the office, and at night he is either out or attending banquets, or he is too tired. The children are therefore very unfamiliar with him. The father's enthusiasm, understanding, example, and instinctive concern do not exist.

To act as a father or mother, our society has invented many things that lead children to victory—radio, storybooks, movies, kindergartens, or summer camps. Those school affairs are also handled by women, so 90 percent of American boys' lives are led and educated by women, and fathers despise their own responsibilities.

How many men have spent their energy, time, and money to concentrate on fatherhood? How many people have paid attention to the situation in schools? How many people have cleverly solved those early crimes? That is the duty given to men at home. Losing it can cause wives to worry and lead to many tendencies toward divorce.

But men should only bear half the responsibility for this kind of marriage. Girls are more inclined to illusory love. They pursue the kind of love that is found in books or movies, so when she has this feeling, she rushes to get married, thinking that there will be a perfect result. In this case, those heroes usually have no money. This kind of love ignores a few points: First, money cannot help a man's character, but on the contrary, it often spoils him. Second, marriage is not the conclusion of everything, nor can it guarantee perfection. Marriage is really just the beginning.

Most American brides in the fire believe that marriage is an endless courtship, treating marriage as the result of engagement. As long as they are materially comfortable, they can talk about the possibility of having children later. This is what they call love. After marriage, the method of courtship is cancelled. The family cannot be used as a future speculation. It is a place where the two sexes accompany each other. Marriage is inevitably for the basic solution of sex.

Infidelity is the biggest cause of divorce, and marriages based on adultery will be divorced sooner or later, because they have mistaken the purpose of being together for life.

Another point is that many American boys and girls hold the belief of "only one." If girls only date one boy, it is impossible to meet someone with a compatible personality. This "only one" belief can also be said to be an obstacle to marriage, because if a person dreams of an object before getting married, then he will apply the dream to life. In this case, many people think that marriage is wrong and endure it. In reality, their thoughts are wrong, and some even become nagging or indulgent because of disappointment; but most of them still pursue their "only one" after divorce.

In short, men are not fully grown unless they have the fundamental idea of being a father. Women are not mature if they want to maintain the state of a bride or if they are mothers but do not fulfill their duties as wives. A wife is a partner of a real father.

The family is the foundation of the national society, so we must establish a formal family. If people find children annoying and try to avoid them, people who grow up like this will find marriage annoying. Life is not just about pursuing happiness. If we want to be happy, we must seek happiness instead of joy. A happy person is often tolerant of others and strict with himself.

If we plan to start marriage well, we must change those people's views and prices of marriage. Young men should not think: who is the most beautiful one; young women should not think: who can always treat me like a bride forever.

The proper life question is: is she the best mother I have chosen for my children? Is he the best father? Or think like this: would I like to be her or his child? (Translated from Reader's Digest)

### UNRRA Holds Relief and Charity Stations in Nanjing!

This is a station where children drink milk.

### Women's Outlets

— Li Ying

When every girl reaches a certain age and her studies at school have reached a certain stage, she naturally considers her future: getting married? Or seeking employment? Getting married is certainly not a matter of overnight, especially in modern times, it requires a long period of consideration. So she takes a job, partly as a transition to marriage and partly to be economically independent.

They have been irrigated with new culture in schools, and they have the inherent pride of young people, thinking that they are great, full of talk about equality between men and women, serving society, and being a woman of the times; however, as soon as they leave school, how long does it take for them to change their original intentions. Of course, the feudal poison of thousands of years still remains in modern society, but most girls, when they first enter society, cannot resist the temptation of external materials, and with a single mistake, they fall into ruin, and many are corrupted by excessive admiration for vanity.

Many professional women have strong wills and continue to work hard at their posts, day after day, year after year. Seeing the younger sisters getting married one by one, while she is still busy and running around all day long, suddenly, a wave of sadness strikes her. It is not sadness for the loneliness of being single, nor is it the trouble of her job, but the embarrassment of old age. When she can no longer work, how will an old maid live? Of course, she needs a home, and home is getting married. Rather than waiting until the year of "getting married," it is better to take advantage of youth. As a result, they got married!

I object to "women returning to the kitchen" and "getting married is the best career for women," because the former is a means of exhausting soldiers and oppressing women, and the latter is exactly an excuse for the brainy and fat-bellied to humiliate women. However, women must understand how to manage housework, which is their natural responsibility. In the United States and Japan, there are "bride schools," which shows the importance of women to the family. Getting married is not a humble job that relies on men. On the contrary, it is a most sacred job: being a virtuous wife, helping her husband seek career development, and being a good mother, teaching and raising children, please evolve humanity. Moreover, if women are all single and independent, will the world not become extinct and destroyed?

A small number of girls have good family environments, smart qualifications, and more progressive aspirations. They may as well go to middle school, university, or even gilding for further study, and seek genuine independence and serve society in the future. However, they must absolutely abandon selfish enjoyment. If you give up halfway, get married, and have children, the trivial matters of the family and the entanglement of the children will keep you from having a moment of rest, unless you are inhuman.

Finally, let me end my clumsy writing by borrowing the opinion of Mrs. Roosevelt, the former president of the United States: "It should be determined according to the circumstances of the environment, without judgment, and without a fixed path to seek."

Cooking

### Crab Meat Balls

— Yihe

The season is autumn again, and "Mr. Wuyang" (crab) is loved by everyone. Here, I would like to introduce a method of eating crab. Housewives may wish to try it.

[Ingredients] Four crabs—preferably female; three eggs, one catty of potatoes, a little salt, ginger, scallions, monosodium glutamate, and animal oil.

[Preparation] First, boil the crabs until cooked. Separate the roe and meat, break them into pieces. Then, boil the potatoes until cooked, peel them, mash them, add salt, monosodium glutamate, ginger, scallions, etc., and mix them evenly so that they are not too thin. Also, mix the egg yolks and whites separately. Add the egg whites to the crab meat, and the egg yolks to the crab roe and meat. Then, mix each into the mashed potatoes to make two piles. Take half of the yellow mashed potatoes and half of the white mashed potatoes to make balls, preferably with a few shrimp kernels on top. Fry the balls in a frying pan, take them out and let them cool slightly, then you can eat them. The taste is incomparably delicious. However, the taste will be lost if eaten cold, so it is advisable to serve it on the table as soon as it comes out of the pot.

### Is Playing Mahjong a Democratic Entertainment in China?

— Fang Qi

The most favorite pastime for ordinary housewives in Shanghai is playing mahjong.

I have secretly investigated the daily lives of dozens of housewives, and the result is that most of them like to play mahjong, but the degree of liking is different. This result surprised me quite a bit. Why do they like to play mahjong? The biggest reason is that they can make a living and don't have to worry about the seven daily necessities, nor do they have to go out to run for a living. Their husbands earn the money, so they don't have to worry about it themselves. Someone takes care of everything at home: the babysitter cooks and washes clothes, and the nanny takes care of the children. They are almost all idle and have nothing to do. They don't want to sit idle, and they don't have a proper hobby, so they think of playing mahjong to pass the time! And playing mahjong is not limited to uneducated housewives, it seems to be a common epidemic.

Playing mahjong is also like an addiction. Once you get used to it, you have to play it every day. So;

First, it wastes life and money. Mahjong always has wins and losses, and money is always lost. And playing eight rounds or sixteen rounds, or even until late at night, sleeping during the day and playing mahjong at night, is really very exhausting.

Second, couples may often quarrel or fight because of mahjong, which can cause cracks in their relationship.

Third, sometimes friends may argue because of a card. Even if they don't argue, everyone is unhappy in their hearts.

These are still minor matters. The biggest harm is the impact on children;

(1) It cultivates abnormal psychology in children. Most housewives who love to play mahjong base their happiness or unhappiness for the day on whether they win or lose money that day. So they are capricious. If they lose money, they will often beat and scold their children for minor or no reason. This cultivates an abnormal psychology in children of being afraid of their mothers and not daring to speak or move, which prevents them from fully developing themselves and hinders their future.

(2) Children need their parents to pay attention to them at all times. As long as they are not careful for a moment, they will do anything, and once they do it, they will often do it. If a mother likes to play mahjong, she will rarely take care of her children, so children often develop many bad habits, and the family doesn't even know.

(3) Children are most likely to imitate. If parents have a gambling habit, children will play mahjong very young because they are influenced by what they see and hear.

(4) In order to keep the game quiet, parents do not hesitate to provide money to children to make them go away to buy food and play, which results in cultivating children's habit of spending money extravagantly.

Therefore, I hope that ordinary housewives, even if not for themselves, should change their ways and no longer be addicted to mahjong for the sake of their children, the masters of the next generation of the country.

### The Crying of Children

— Dehua

Raising children is the most troublesome thing, because their vocal organs are not yet fully developed. So when they are uncomfortable or unhappy, they cannot express it in words. Most of them express their unhappiness with the expressions of their muscles and faces, and often cry loudly. However, it is not easy for mothers to know the reason for their crying, and it is very difficult to deal with. Now, children's psychologists have used their experiments and experiences to study the relationship between children's crying and their discomfort, which can be roughly divided into two stages. Fortunately, mothers should pay more attention:

(1) The crying of children under six months of age:

1. Crying loudly and forcefully—indicates discomfort and needs to be massaged.

2. Crying sadly without tears—this is a sign of hunger.

3. Crying intermittently with the legs contracted forcefully—this is probably a stomachache.

4. Yawning while crying—indicates tiredness and wanting to sleep.

5. Crying loudly and forcefully with the head moving left and right—indicates a headache or earache.

(2) The crying of one-year-old children:

1. Crying with a red face and tears—indicates pain in the head and face.

2. Crying with the eyes open and tears, but not loudly—this indicates that the way they are being held is not good.

3. Crying with the eyes half-open, tears, and babbling—this indicates that they are lying uncomfortably, or the bedding is uneven.

4. Crying with the eyes half-open and few tears, with a long tone—this indicates hunger or thirst.

5. Crying suddenly with a frown, shivering all over, and crying loudly—indicates being frightened.

6. Crying loudly with the legs contracted tightly—indicates a stomachache.

7. Crying intermittently with the eyes open, no tears, and the head turning left and right—indicates impatience.

Spring and Autumn

### On Diaries

— Xi Xi

Diaries are the most direct and reliable documents, but sometimes one is driven by the subconscious to write things without realizing it. If one blindly believes in what is written in one's own hand, one cannot avoid being misled. Not only diaries, but also autobiographies, memoirs, and the like are prone to this problem. In modern times, the diaries of the famous Li Yueman and Weng Wengong were both printed from their handwriting. Seeing the precision and order with which they conducted their studies and affairs, and the richness of the recorded content, one cannot help but sigh in admiration. However, a very surprising loophole can be found in these two diaries.

The last few volumes of Yueman's diary were never handed over by Fan Zengxiang, so the photocopy only goes up to volume fifty-one. From his own Chou year to the year of his death—the winter of Jiawu—there were still some essays and discussions. His death in the winter of Jiawu is mentioned in the biography written by Ping Buqing. When asked, older people also remember it that way, while Weng Wengong's diary suddenly records a line on a certain day in the year of Yiwei, saying that he visited Li Chunju, a famous scholar. At this time, Li should have already passed away. If it is said to be a writing error, then the tone does indeed refer to seeing Li. If it is said that there is an error in the year and month, then the diary is written day by day, how could it be wrong? Moreover, Li was Weng's Gengchen student and was highly regarded at the time. Weng should not have mentioned nothing about Li's passing. This is a doubtful case that cannot be clarified. It is a pity that the last few volumes of Li's diary cannot be published for comparison.

Li Yueman's learning and writing became even more refined in his later years, completely without any fiery temper. He did not keep drafts of some of his poems and lyrics, nor did he write them in his diary. I once saw a small painting, a misty rain pavilion boating scene painted by Tao Fangqi. This was a handwritten record of a trip to Jiaxing in the fourth month of Guiwei year when Tao and Fan Zengxiang visited Xu Jingcheng together. In the Jue year, Fan went to Beijing, and Yueman wrote a passage at the end:

"For ten years, I have slept by Yuan Lake for six evenings, and the beautiful scenery is not easily copied in my life. Five times the sails have leaned against the night fire, and the chess pavilion has become desolate again. The Zhongxing is gradually restoring thousands of families, and the long-term guest emptily misses a single oar. It is rare that an old friend carries a copy of the painting, and I see an ice pot in the soft red dust.

Brocade robes and green feathers resemble flying immortals, and the two beauties ride the lower boat together. The city walls and mountain light divide the green fields, and the shadows of the seagull waves connect the distant sky. The inscription on the collar proves the West Lake moon, and the flying birds soar high above the Shangjun smoke. How can Kuaiji be borrowed to order, to plant flowers and grow old together by the side of the five clouds. Old Brother Yunmen asked me to inscribe on the misty rain chess boating picture. I have been to this lake six times from Jiwei year to Xinwei year, only in Yichou year did I not because I was nursing a child, the rest were all at night and I never boarded the pavilion. In Jiwei, it was late spring, the misty trees were faintly visible, and the pavilions were like paintings; after Yichou, only broken bricks and tiles remained in the wilderness. Now, when I unfold this scroll, it is still a beautiful rainbow, a mirror oar, and floating duckweed. My homesickness and worldly eyes increase my desire to return home, and Yunmen is about to govern Dingyang, and I also have a trip to Tianjin. We bid farewell at the fork in the road, and I hastily composed two poems. When will we ask about the egrets and revisit the old journey? Jia Shen, Spring Festival, Yueman, the old man."

Tao was observing mourning leave after serving as a Hunan provincial education commissioner, and Xu was also at home after his mission abroad. Fan was returning to Beijing that year to take up a new position, so he was able to meet with Yueman. At this time, there was the Vietnam issue, but the poem only speaks of singing about the wind and moon, and it cannot reflect the significance of the times. Tao soon died of illness, and Yueman mourned him the most. Xu was killed in the Gengzi Incident, which he did not live to see. The poem is not included in his collected works, nor is it found in his diary, but it is still a good poem.

This anecdote came to mind when discussing diaries.

### The Napoleon of Literature Balzac

— Ma Chaoying

Honoré de Balzac was a French novelist, a transitional writer between Romanticism and Realism. His writing method was realistic and scientific. When he came into contact with a person, a place, a thing, or a scene, his eyes, his ears, and all his senses immediately became active, observing and analyzing. At the same time, he had a very rich imagination, which allowed every character and scene he wanted to write about to appear vividly before his eyes. As long as it could be the subject matter for his novels, no matter how vulgar or ugly, he dared to adopt it boldly. Therefore, he was a bold and adventurous writer of the nineteenth century.

Balzac was born on May 20, 1799, in Tours, France. His father was a lawyer. Balzac was the eldest son in his family, with one younger brother and two younger sisters.

In his early years, Balzac studied at a church school in Vendôme. He was a mediocre student in class, but at the age of thirteen, he became interested in literary masterpieces and immersed himself in reading all day long. He read books without restraint, which affected his health. So he rested at home for a long time.

In 1813, Balzac's family moved to Paris, and he also came to Paris to complete the legal education that his father had assigned to him. After leaving school, he continued to practice under a lawyer for a year and a half, and then worked as an assistant to a registrar for another year and a half. But Balzac soon expressed opposition to his profession, and he was determined to become a writer. At that time, a big mess arose in his family because of this idea, but these difficulties were finally overcome by Balzac's persistence. His family allowed him to try for two years.

At this time, Balzac's family had already left Paris, and only he still lived in a dilapidated house in Paris. His family only gave him a small allowance each year, so little that it was barely enough to maintain his life. But he was not discouraged by this. On the contrary, he dealt with his poverty with an optimistic and humorous attitude. In his small room, he worked hard to write a tragedy about Cromwell, but it was not successful. But he was still not disappointed in himself. He believed that as long as he continued to work hard, he would succeed one day.

In 1825, in order to make money, Balzac and a few friends organized a bookstore and a printing house, but these businesses soon failed. From this time on, Balzac fell into a difficult situation, and he had to write articles to earn money.

Balzac's persistence in writing was astonishing. He usually went to bed around six o'clock in the evening, got up at twelve or one o'clock in the middle of the night, and wrote for seventeen or eighteen hours, sometimes even exceptionally for twenty-five hours without rest. To support this long-lasting excitement, he always drank a lot of strong coffee; this habit became the main cause of his death.

From 1829, Balzac began to occupy an important position in the French literary world at that time. By 1835, his reputation was already very high. The period after 1840 was the time of his greatest fame.

On March 14, 1850, Balzac finished his life and died in Paris. At that time, he had only been married to Madame Hanska, whom he had been pursuing for fifteen years, for a few months!

Balzac's works, in his own ordered complete works, are more than ninety volumes. He gave it a general title called "The Human Comedy" La Comedie Humaine, which includes six groups of "Scenes of Life" Soenesde la vie and two groups of "Studies" Etude. The scope of his writing is very wide, and the descriptions are meticulous and detailed. From his works, we can see the entire French society during the "Restoration of the Monarchy" and the "July Monarchy." The profiteers, usurers, speculators, agents of large banks, diplomats, ministers, merchants, farmers, monks, officials, criminals, police, etc. of that era are all vividly portrayed. His faithful depiction of the contemporary French society was truly a deviation from the romantic school of the time. Balzac often called himself the "Napoleon of Literature" during his lifetime. Indeed, his writing ambition was no less than Napoleon's courage in facing the enemy.

### Seed

— Zhang Baihuai

Once, in a dream, I discovered a seed on a barren wasteland. I didn't know what kind of seed it was, but the dryness and barrenness of this wasteland seemed to suddenly make me realize a question I had pondered for a long time.

This is my own question.

The seed of my hope is indeed falling on barren wasteland. To tell the truth, I am a young man who has not received a good education. Although I am not stupid, I never waste time, and my small works are also praised by people; however, if I were to say that I am a seed, then I am thinking, now is spring, even if it sprouts and sticks out above the soil, joyfully accepting the nourishment of rain and dew and sunshine, but after a few days, the water absorbed from the strata will not feel enough, and the outstretched leaves will also turn yellow. If it goes on like this, even though spring is still soaring in the sky, my branches and leaves will have already withered. I almost believe that this metaphor will become a prophecy.

In order to struggle, I have to pay attention to the health of my seed. A healthy seed grows into a strong tree, and only a strong tree can withstand storms on barren and dry soil, and finally bear its beautiful fruit.

Health is undoubtedly the foundation of future happiness.

How can I be healthy?

I am contradictory, my actions and thoughts are often inconsistent; I am fragile, my emotions and reason are often unbalanced; I am dreamy, reality and ideals often make me suffer; I am such as I am, that is, of course, only the abstract me, but it can also be seen how unhealthy and on what a shallow foundation I am.

I first went to inquire about the meaning of health.

"The meaning of health is the completeness of human nature," this is one person's answer: "The complete expression of a person's spirit, virtue, and thought."

"Then it can be said that there are too few healthy people," I said.

"Most of the people in this world have no character, almost all people are without character, evil, immoral. This is not my original saying, a great Russian artist who fought tragically all his life said so. That's not enough, people still affirm themselves, happy, as if they were complete people! That's the most hateful thing!"

I still cannot understand the image of a healthy person.

"Its best explanation is a person's appearance, its best symbol is a person's wisdom," this is another person explaining: "A healthy person has a healthy smile, which is different from the evil and licentious smile you see; a healthy person has a healthy cry, he will not wail in sorrow and lose the power of revenge. A healthy person, when we look at him from afar, is dignified and great; when we are close to him, he is gentle and kind. What angers him is when you go against your conscience, what pleases him is when you fulfill one of your hopes. A healthy person is impartial, does not make unnecessary worries and hesitations; he also dreams, but never indulges in dreams, he also suffers, but suffering cannot overwhelm him. A healthy person, his wisdom is like light, the flashing of light can illuminate the darkness; like a flower, the flower blooms in the dense garden of life, emitting a rich fragrance, so that all people can be close to its fragrance."

I think it is difficult to become a healthy person.

"Then," I asked, "what is the foundation of health?"

"The foundation of health is laid by oneself," this is the answer: "Take advantage of every opportunity, don't relax yourself even one step."

"That's really too hard to do."

"That's not hard to do," this is what he said: "Good and bad are changing. Gide said: "If man has not always been like this, how can it be said that man will always be like this? Man is changing! Believe him."

I didn't ask any more questions, and I also remembered what he said about "new food." I found that book in infinite joy.

"Not only does the world change," A. Gide said, "but so does man. Where will it appear from? That new person? Not from the outside, comrade, try to find him in yourself, and, like extracting pure metal without slag from a gold mine, draw him out of yourself, that long-awaited person, obtain him from yourself. Dare to become what you will be. Don't easily let go of yourself, every creature has all kinds of admirable possibilities. Believe in your own strength - your own youth, know to constantly say to yourself: "It's all in me!"

It's all in my health! A seed on a barren wasteland has already grown on barren soil, and I believe I can also withstand storms, blossom and bear fruit, and let people taste very beautiful and very sweet fruits of happiness. (One of the broken and incomplete manuscripts)

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 63

— Ye Jingfeng

Because the car was unreliable, we had to wait for the train again, but it was limited to one hour. If the train didn't leave again, we planned to hire a car again, going as far as we could, and then walk, anyway, it was only forty-some miles. Less than half an hour later, we suddenly heard a sudden commotion outside the dining hall. Looking through the window, it turned out that tickets were already being sold, and there were more people. Later, I learned that the station, although it had a sign, was just for advertising purposes. It would only sell tickets and start the train when there were enough people. Moreover, if the train couldn't pass and encountered a conflict, it might stop for half a day, or it might return the tickets.

When we got on the train, in the military, we were very careful to look for that woman, but we didn't see her踪影. We also expected that there must be other people of this kind on the train, and things of this kind. I had already told my younger brother Hu in advance that there was no need to escape. Since the Northeast fell, there have been many small detectives and informers of this kind along the way. This is a common practice for the Japanese; therefore, every pedestrian must encounter a lot of trouble. Sometimes they come soft, sometimes they come hard, and they must find out your whereabouts, what you do, and who you are before they are relieved.

Sure enough, before long, a middle-aged man sitting opposite us, in his teens, dressed as a merchant, suddenly yawned, stretched his legs, and kicked my younger brother Hu. My younger brother Hu glared at him and was about to explode. I saw that the fellow quickly bent down and stroked my younger brother Hu a few times, apologizing repeatedly. He took this opportunity to talk to my younger brother Hu, asking this and that. My younger brother Hu knew that this was another trick like the country woman's, and he didn't need to pretend. He just used his natural childish and mischievous energy, scolding and insulting him with anger. The fellow, after receiving this scolding, although he was smiling reluctantly, was really a little red in the face with anger. Looking at the way he looked, it seemed that he still wanted to seize the opportunity to retaliate.

At this time, I suddenly felt a burst of uneasiness, and I was also a little regretful. What was the reason? Because, after a cold observation, only my actions and those of my younger brother Hu in this section of the car made people feel out of place. First, looking at the tea boy on the train, when he served tea and water, he was so kind to everyone, as if they were all acquaintances, but he had a dead look in his eyes towards us. Second, everyone on the train, regardless of men, women, old or young, were talking to each other, chatting about everyday life, but we didn't talk to anyone; this showed that we were a different kind of people, appearing isolated. Also, this Pingtong line is just a short branch line, and people who come and go often, I think, are probably these people, and their faces are all familiar; we, in the eyes of those people, are probably a little strange. To call us, on this road, the running dogs and special agents of the Japanese or traitors, of course, they will pay special attention to people like us. What do I regret? Originally, before setting off, the team leader Mu Lai had advised us to change our clothes and stay with the country people along the way. As a cover, or use the department's car to send us there. But we didn't want to trouble the department, and we were young and energetic, and we didn't take these gangs of traitors seriously. More importantly, although we are said to be young, we are "upright soldiers" appointed by the state, why should we be so sneaky and disguised? But I didn't know that this move was a bit too arrogant. Why? People who are doing special work should try to avoid all unexpected troubles as much as possible; because our work has a goal, and if we cause trouble because of arrogance, there is nothing else, but if we cause an accident because of this, wouldn't it be a dereliction of duty and a mistake?

Free Talk

### Squeezing Oil

— Shaofu

A few days ago, I wrote an article "White Collar Criminals," which was based on the news that the security authorities in Fuzhou punished those who watched free shows and rode free cars. I said that the method was very humorous, although it was joking and abusive, but the intention was quite profound. The next day, I received a letter from an armed comrade, who had the following opinions on this issue:

"...(Omitted above) The problem of riding free cars in Shanghai did not start today. It has been popular long before the war and during the enemy puppet period. The whole knot lies with the country and the competent authorities, not because a person is willing to disregard shame and squeeze oil to ride free cars, suffering discrimination and secret laughter. It is really because the treatment of national soldiers and general junior civil servants is too low. To give an example, a civil servant cannot reimburse travel expenses for official business unless there are special circumstances, and the twists and turns are especially numerous, with too many cumbersome procedures such as proving, responsible supervisor approval, and responsible personnel. Therefore, there are general military officers above the rank of lieutenant, who all squeeze oil to ride free cars. Junior soldiers and civil servants have no money to ride in cars, so they can only follow suit and squeeze oil. (Omitted in the middle) In summary, watching free shows and cracking down on theater owners has resulted in repeated detentions and punishments of the perpetrators to warn others, but the number of people watching free shows has not decreased from the past. Although there is a free invitation to national troops at noon every Saturday, the date and time are not appropriate. The theater, for the sake of business, does not give them spare time to entertain themselves, resulting in the inability to completely eliminate watching free shows. Only those who watch free shows and squeeze oil should be punished, but those who ride free cars for official business and for their livelihood should be forgiven with a loud voice." I am willing to publish this publicly here, and I would like to ask everyone to study it.

### Jewish Terrorist Organizations

— Wenzhen

When the flames of democracy and independence are burning in every corner of Asia, the descendants of Israel, who have been wandering for nearly two thousand years, must also feel the pain of drifting and prepare for a national revival movement! That's right, this movement is unfolding vigorously after World War II. Every day, on the foreign news pages, there are reports about their national revival movement, such as immigration to Palestine, conflicts between the Jewish and Arab peoples, and disagreements between the British and American governments due to different views on this movement.

There are two major factions leading the Jewish national revival movement. One faction is the radical faction, which is the terrorist organization mentioned here, and the other is the moderate faction, to which the so-called Zionism belongs. (Zion is the name of a mountain in Jerusalem). Zionism is not within the scope of this article, and will be recorded in another article later. What can be predicted is that the latter advocates using legal, democratic, political and diplomatic means to achieve the goal of national revival. As for the radical faction, they want to directly expel the British from the country by force and organize a free and independent Jewish homeland.

On November 6, 1944, Sir Lord Moyne, the British Minister of State in the Middle East, was assassinated in the forest of his villa in Cairo by two young Jews. One of the murderers was twenty-seven years old, and the other was only twenty years old. As a result, they were sentenced to be hanged. Before that, after a trial, the two murderers indignantly accused the British of improper measures in Palestine, for which the British warned reporters not to report the details of the trial. But later the news finally leaked out, and the murderers finally achieved their expected goal—shifting the world's attention to Palestine!

These two murderers belonged to the Stern Gang in the Jewish terrorist organization. There are two branches of Jewish terrorist organizations, and the Stern Gang is the smaller but most radical branch.

When the Stern Gang was formed is not very clear now. What is known is that it was founded by a Polish Jew named Stern. The members of the group are all called "Free Israeli Fighters" and specialize in individual assassinations. Its masterpieces include the murder of Inspector General Wilkim, Senior Commissioner Sir Michael, and the aforementioned Dr. Moyne.

Stern was a resolute, fanatical poet who was killed in 1942 in the area of ​​the Arabian Peninsula, Dan Amuw. He was less than thirty-five years old when he died. His assassination team consisted of fifty assassins and one hundred and fifty assistants (such as intelligence officers, propagandists, etc.). After Stern's death, his deputy, nicknamed "Fanatical Red Eyes," Yellin, took over.

As for the other branch of the terrorist organization, it is the National Military Organization, usually referred to as NMO, which are the first three letters of the group's name. MNO is led by a skinny law student Picken. He is good at guerrilla warfare, strikes, and creating terror. This organization's weapon is bombs. They often collectively attack the British government's administrative agencies, police, tax collectors, and even the British army in Palestine. The scale and strength of the MON are stronger than those of the Stern Gang. Most of the members are Jewish special agents from the past Polish army. From 1941 to 1942, the team withdrew from the Soviet Union to Central Asia, and many of its members joined the NMO. They provided intelligence, used Polish military cards to transport food and ammunition, and used camps to hide murderers. On July 22 of this year, the world-shaking bombing case at the King David Hotel, where the headquarters of the British army in Palestine was located, was the achievement of the NMO.

The Jewish terrorist organization ends here. As for whether their national revival movement infringes on the sovereignty of the Arab nation, that is a topic for politicians and diplomats. Standing in the position of ordinary people, I only feel that the spirit of Jewish youth, who show their generosity and dedication to justice and follow in each other's footsteps for the sake of national revival, is truly worthy of our admiration. Seeing how difficult it is for the Jewish nation to revive their country, and then looking back at our country, which we have worked so hard to win the War of Resistance against Japan and preserve, but is now desperately engaged in civil war, it is really heartbreaking for ordinary people.

### Horse Racing in Gansu

— You Nan

The Shanghai horse racing issue remains unresolved, and the decision ultimately rests with the municipal government. We will temporarily set that aside and discuss "horse racing" in Gansu.

Every year during the Lunar New Year, on the sixth day of the first month, the Tibetan people of Gansu traditionally hold a horse racing festival. However, their horse racing ceremony and purpose are very different from the horse racing held in the Shanghai concessions during that period.

At that time, the climate was still very cold, and the people were idle. On the appointed day, the Tibetan people dressed in festive attire, and their saddles were decorated with gold, silver, and jewels. Red silk ribbons were tied to the horses' tails, and the manes on their necks and backs were combed into small braids, bound with uniform green silk. The Tibetan people rode their horses, full of joy and pride, and gathered in a designated public square.

At the same time, monks, lamas, men and women, and ordinary people arrived on foot and horseback, creating a crowded and lively scene. After the officials in charge of the horse race arrived, they publicly announced the "Living Buddha's" decree, stating: "Those who participate in the horse race will not be held responsible for any deaths or tramplings. The Buddha's Dharma is boundless, and this is final. If there are any accidental injuries or deaths, it is considered a swift ascent to heaven, and there should be no resentment."

During the horse racing event, five horses were first divided into a group, and each two groups competed once. Then, the top horses from each group were gathered for a final race. The winner was congratulated by the Tibetan people, who hailed him as the "Hero on Horseback" of the year, considering it a great honor. I remember that during the competition in the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the champion was a Tibetan man from Gansu named "Hua Deng Duo Lang," who was only twenty years old.

Horse racing in Gansu is simply a form of athletic competition with a pure purpose, seemingly beyond reproach. Compared to horse racing in major cities around the world, which is aimed at gambling and profit, it is indeed much more noble.

### Odds and Ends

— w. w.

The unmarried want to marry, the married want to be single, and the divorced want to remarry. Once married, people forget their parents; once they have children, they abandon their parents. Filial sons are still filial sons, but when their sons grow up, they imitate their behavior.

This is called the cycle of life.

The Canadian Ambassador is concerned about our country, saying that he is worried about the export of raw materials in exchange for manufactured goods. If China were still the "center of the world" as in the past, then his heartfelt words would truly reflect his concern for the world before himself.

Looking back at our compatriots, it is painful to realize that they cannot live without foreign goods!

The three daughters of Mr. × went abroad. Not only have they adopted foreign styles, but even their names have been replaced with foreign ones. We, the poor, can only sigh in admiration!

### How Roosevelt Dealt with Stalin (2)

— Written by Frances Perkins, Translated by Ge Chunliang

"I felt very disappointed. If it were just a matter of official paperwork, why would I travel such a long distance to fulfill the Russian's request? They themselves were unwilling to come to America or anywhere in Europe. Therefore, I had to go to them to make friends with Stalin. I felt very disappointed because I couldn't figure out how to proceed. All we've accomplished are things that diplomats could have done.

"I thought about it all night and decided to do something desperate to survive. I couldn't stay in Tehran forever. I had to break through this cold surface so that I could communicate with him privately by phone or letter afterward. During the meetings, I rarely met with Churchill alone because I had a feeling that the Russians would think it was wrong if Churchill and I were talking about things we knew but they didn't.

"In the morning, when we went to the conference hall, I caught up with Winston (Churchill's name). I only said one sentence to him: 'Winston, I hope you won't be angry about what I'm going to do.'

"Winston flicked the ash off his cigar and grunted. I must say that his behavior afterward was indeed very good.

"Entering the conference hall, I immediately began to act. I talked to Stalin privately. Although everything I said had already been said, my attitude was more cordial and intimate, so that the other Russians joined in to listen, but they never smiled.

"Then, I covered my mouth with one hand and pretended to whisper something, which was immediately translated. I said, 'Churchill is in a bad mood this morning because he woke up and found himself sleeping under the bed.'

"A faint smile appeared in Stalin's eyes. Then, I decided that I was on the right track. Sitting at the conference table, I began to tease Churchill, mocking his English manner, mocking 'John Bull' (the nickname for the English), mocking his cigar, and mocking his habits, gradually eliciting a response from Stalin. Winston turned red and roared. The more he did so, the more Stalin smiled. Finally, Stalin couldn't help but laugh deeply and happily. For the first time in three days, I began to see a glimmer of hope. I continued to tease him until he laughed along with me. At this point, I began to call him 'Uncle Joe.' The day before, he had treated me like a stranger, but on the day he laughed, he walked over and shook my hand tightly.

"From that moment on, our relationship began to become closer. Stalin himself occasionally joined in a joke or two. The ice on the surface was broken, and we talked like ordinary men, like brothers.

"Do you know?" the President continued. "He was deeply moved by the sword that Churchill brought from the British government as a gift. The ornate sword was placed on a red velvet cushion, and Churchill gave one of his most brilliant short speeches. Churchill himself was filled with emotion, explaining how the British people admired Russia's courageous fighting and Stalin's great leadership! (To be continued)

### Remembering Stilwell

— Sheng Jie

The news of the death of General Stilwell, the famous general who fought in the India-Burma theater, in the United States, brought tears to my eyes!

The general was originally from the United States, but he served in China for twenty years of his life. He was fluent in Chinese, understood Japanese, and was quite familiar with Chinese customs and practices. Therefore, his understanding of China was particularly profound. In 1942, he came to China again from the United States and successively served as Chief of Staff of the China Theater, Commander of the U.S. Forces in the China-India-Burma Theater, and Deputy Commander of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia. During the India-Burma campaign, he opened up a new supply line to China, connecting the Yunnan-Burma Road. This was the most profound impression he left on the Chinese people. To commemorate General Stilwell's great achievements, this road was also named the "Stilwell Road."

The most interesting story left in the India-Burma theater is a few words from a Chinese soldier about General Stilwell, which became the talk of the town among the Allied officers and soldiers in India and Burma after dinner.

Before his death, General Stilwell was already an old general in his sixties, but he did not show the signs of weakness typical of older people. He was like a young and vigorous young officer. In the India-Burma theater, he often wore a Chinese military cap, carried a submachine gun, and inspected the front lines in the midst of gunfire.

Speaking Chinese

Once, General Stilwell was inspecting the front line when a Chinese soldier saw him and was very worried about the life of this sixty-year-old old soldier. The soldiers said, "This old fellow is really tired of living and deliberately came here to die!"

Who knew that General Stilwell immediately replied in Mandarin: "I am not an old fellow, I am your Chief Commander Stilwell." The soldiers looked at each other in dismay.

Unrelenting Efforts

He was an American commanding a Chinese expeditionary force on British territory, but he must not interfere in Sino-British politics, nor allow Sino-British political relations to hinder his plans. To overcome these many political difficulties, he spared no effort to fly over the 18,000-foot-high Himalayas, mediating between the Allied authorities.

He finally achieved the three goals of the North Burma campaign: (1) opening up a new supply line to China to connect the Yunnan-Burma Road; (2) destroying the main force of the Japanese invaders; and (3) proving that properly trained, armed, and led Chinese armies are no different from the best armies in the world.

Today, Chinese soldiers and Allied comrades have begun to view him in a different light. He is the old man of every soldier in the Allied forces, the head of the army. When he passes by a field hospital for wounded soldiers, he always goes to see the Chinese wounded soldiers and comforts those soldiers in Chinese.

On the other hand, he often sits with Chinese and American soldiers, eating their pickled vegetables, drinking their coffee, and chatting with them casually. General Stilwell's shadow appears everywhere on the jungle paths. When he meets Chinese soldiers with toothy smiles, he always chats with them. This is the key factor in his ability to gain the trust of Chinese soldiers.

Stilwell, a typical democratic American general, will forever live in the glorious history of China's War of Resistance!
