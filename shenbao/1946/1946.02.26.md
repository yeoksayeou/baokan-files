### The Supreme National Defense Council Passes the Open Foreign Exchange Market Proposal; Abolishes Current Official Foreign Exchange Rate; Allocates US$500 Million as Legal Tender Reserve

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] At the meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council on the morning of the 25th, Premier T.V. Soong proposed an open foreign exchange market plan on an ad hoc basis. This plan involves abolishing the current official foreign exchange rate and stipulates that the Central Bank should assess market conditions and, based on supply and demand, provide or purchase foreign exchange as needed for regulation and to prevent excessive fluctuations. The proposal was passed. The full text of the open foreign exchange market proposal, temporary measures for import and export trade, and temporary measures for the Central Bank for managing foreign exchange are recorded below:

Open Foreign Exchange Market Proposal

Investigation into the current situation shows that the absence of a public market for open foreign exchange is causing stagnation in foreign trade, leading to a wait-and-see attitude among industrial and commercial enterprises, which is a major obstacle to economic recovery. Furthermore, the lack of published implementing measures has led to speculation and increased activity on the black market, which is affecting gold prices, impacting finance, and stimulating commodity prices. Therefore, the foreign exchange market should be brought into order quickly to promote economic development and people's livelihood. Regarding the approach to restoring foreign trade and opening foreign exchange transactions, after detailed consideration, the following main measures are proposed: (1) Divide imported goods into three categories: (A) Industrial and livelihood necessities, which can be purchased and imported by the people without government permission. (B) Goods that can be imported after applying for a permit, such as tobacco, kerosene, automobiles, wool fabrics, and silk fabrics. (C) Certain luxury goods that are not allowed to be imported. (2) Establish a Provisional Committee for Import Planning to investigate and compile statistics on the import of various goods, review and adjust foreign purchases, and regulate matters related to the items in the preceding paragraph. (3) The Central Bank shall designate certain banks to buy and sell foreign exchange, but those requesting to purchase foreign exchange must prove that it is specifically for importing goods under categories (A) and (B) of the first paragraph. Those wishing to sell foreign exchange must also negotiate with the designated banks. (4) The current official foreign exchange rate should be abolished. The Central Bank should assess market conditions and, based on supply and demand, provide or purchase foreign exchange as needed for regulation and to prevent excessive fluctuations. The sale of foreign currency, banknotes, and gold will also be handled according to the same principles. (5) The government will allocate US$500 million as a legal tender reserve and instruct the Central Bank to allocate a considerable amount from its existing foreign exchange reserves as a fund for market stabilization at any time, and should strengthen the existing institutions and assign key personnel to be responsible for command and use.

### Central Memorial Week; President Chiang's Address; Students' Parades Stem from Patriotic Enthusiasm; Hoping for Trust in the Government Regarding the Northeast Issue

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] The Central Memorial Week was held at 9 AM on the 25th in the National Government Auditorium. After President Chiang led the ceremonies, he delivered a speech that lasted 40 minutes, after which the ceremonies concluded.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] The main points of President Chiang's address to the participants at the National Government Memorial Week at 9 AM on the 25th were as follows: (1) During his two-week absence from Chongqing, he went to Nanjing and Shanghai for inspection and presided over a military reorganization conference in Nanjing. The generals present at the five-day conference unanimously and sincerely supported the Central Government's reorganization plan to reduce the army infantry from 250 divisions to 90 divisions, and concrete measures have been discussed and will be implemented. The generals understand the greater good and place national interests above all else, which is commendable. (2) One of the most important things he saw in Shanghai was the instability of finance and the economy, which led to high prices. After careful examination of the reasons, it was due to much speculation in the market about foreign exchange management and the failure to restore foreign import and export trade. A concrete solution has now been formulated and will be submitted to the National Defense Council for approval today, after which it can be implemented. (3) After arriving in Chongqing yesterday, he learned about the student parades in the provisional capital in the past two days, and understood that they were concerned about the issue of receiving the Northeast. While the actions of young students in the parades stem from patriotic enthusiasm, such important national affairs should be approached with reason, and there must be no radical emotions, and one must not go beyond the proper scope, otherwise it will damage the overall honor of our nation and increase the difficulties of the country. Therefore, he hopes that the people of the whole country will pay attention to the following three points: First, he hopes that the people of the whole country will trust the government, which will surely have a reasonable solution to the Northeast problem, and should not lightly listen to unfounded rumors from the outside world, and should not have激昂 excessive words and actions. The national government for twenty years, the process and all measures to protect national sovereignty, and seek administrative integrity should be recognized by the people of the whole country. As for the principles of cooperation discussed with the Soviet Union, the government has given to the Northeast Headquarters (1) must abide by our country's laws, (2) respect the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, (3) do not conflict with our country's general international agreements. This is the government's policy on the Northeast issue, and it is specifically stated to the people of the whole country, hoping that you will have no doubts. Second, everyone must know that the friendship between China and the Soviet Union is necessary not only for China but also for the Soviet Union. It is also necessary for world peace after the war, so the friendship between China and the Soviet Union must be maintained and continued to be enhanced, and all of us in China must not be shaken in this belief or neglect its efforts because of temporary or single events. Third, the various laws restricting the freedom of the people during the war have now been abolished, and the speech and actions of the general public must be self-loving and self-respecting, and must be examined at all times, and must not exceed the proper scope of the law. I deeply hope that the people of the whole country will use their freedom with the spirit of responsible and disciplined, which is a necessary prerequisite for us to implement the people's livelihood.

This historically significant scene concluded around 5:00 PM. The original text of the three speeches is recorded below:

Zhang Zhizhong's Speech

Government Representative Zhang Zhizhong said: "Today, the Military Mediation Group, composed of the government representative, the Communist representative, and Advisor Marshall, signed the basic plan for military reorganization and incorporating the Communist forces into the National Army. This is of great significance, as everyone knows. The government and the Communist Party have been in opposition for eighteen years. During this period, countless talents have been sacrificed, much of the nation's vitality has been consumed, and much construction has been delayed due to the Communist problem and the civil war problem. Today's signing of this plan can be said to have ended the eighteen years of disputes and opposition. We must abandon the use of weapons as tools of war and enter a new era of peace. The peaceful, unified, democratic, and united nation that our people have been hoping for will be realized, and it has been guaranteed in this document. The success of the Political Consultative Conference lies in achieving the goal of political democratization, and this document will lay the foundation for the nationalization of the military. In the future, our country should follow the grand policy of peaceful construction to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. I represent the government in signing this plan and guarantee its implementation one hundred percent, so as to achieve the goal of gradual military nationalization. The fact that this meeting has such a good result should be attributed to our great friend, General Marshall. I extend my sincere gratitude and profound respect."

Zhou Enlai's Speech

Communist Representative Zhou Enlai said, "Minister Zhang, General Marshall, and friends, today is a day of great success, because today we signed the basic plan for military reorganization and incorporation. On January 10th, at General Marshall's residence, we signed the agreement to cease military conflict. On January 31st, the Political Consultative Conference of the National Government passed five resolutions. This time, at 'Yaolu', we signed this plan again. These illustrate that we are taking steps towards the goals of political democratization, military nationalization, and equal and legal status for all parties. I, representing the Chinese Communist Party, assure you that we will ensure that the basic plan for military reorganization that we have signed this time is implemented one hundred percent. This basic plan that we have signed stipulates the various terms for reorganizing the army and incorporating the Communist army into the National Army. This covers the entire country, so as Minister Zhang said, it is a guarantee of peace for China. We believe that the implementation of this plan will change the situation of armed conflict that has lasted for eighteen years. It will enable China to achieve peace, democracy, unity, and unification, and it will enable China to enter a modern, industrialized nation. I also think that this success should be attributed to the assistance and efforts of China's friends and General Marshall. I also thank Minister Zhang, with whom I have cooperated many times over the past twenty years. Minister Zhang's efforts on this plan have made a great contribution."

Marshall's Speech

Special Envoy Marshall said, in translation: "This agreement represents the hope of China. I can only hope that its pages will not be stained by a few uncompromising elements who, for selfish purposes, may thwart the Chinese people who eagerly seek the right to live in peace and prosperity."

### Hangzhou Grain Prices Soar, All Rice Shops Destroyed

[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 25th] Hangzhou rice prices rose from 25,000 at 9:00 AM on the 24th to 38,000 at 10:00 AM. Rice shops hoarded rice and refused to sell it, with black market prices reaching 51,000 per shi, which aroused public anger. The destruction of rice shops started in the lower city and gradually spread to more than 130 shops throughout the city, none of which were spared. Utensils and rice were scattered all over the streets, and the losses were enormous and impossible to calculate. Police officers in Chou'anfang fired shots into the air, injuring two civilians and a former official. Upon hearing the news, the authorities quickly devised countermeasures, first dispatching military police to persuade the public not to act rashly. In the afternoon, provincial and municipal authorities held an emergency meeting and decided on the following prices: 17,000 for white japonica, 21,000 for white superior, 22,000 for Hunan superior, 23,000 for Luo superior, and 90% of the price for brown rice, with a limit of one dou per person. Other measures were difficult to implement. On the 25th, more than 200 rice shops in the city must open for business. Mayor Zhou stated that those who resist orders will be severely punished. The price of subsidized rice was set at 15,000, with the municipal government handling 100 shi per day.

### Complex Situation of Conflict in the Northeast, Zhou Enlai Ordered to Present New Proposal

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 25th, urgent telegram] Chongqing News: Fierce fighting has broken out in the Northeast.

[United Press, Chongqing, 25th] It is widely rumored here today that a division of the Soviet Red Army from Poland has arrived in the Northeast, but this news has not yet been confirmed.

[This newspaper, Peiping, 23rd] After the New Sixth Army arrived in the Northeast, Du Yuming's isolated army received powerful assistance and gradually expanded its defense area. North of Xinmin, it entered Fakucheng County on the 18th. In the Liaohe Plain, it crossed Taian and entered Liaozhong. The Communist army in the above areas has suffered considerable setbacks. The CCP in Yan'an has been eager to resolve military conflicts and various disputes in the Northeast peacefully. Xinhua News Agency here revealed that after Zhou Enlai returned to Yan'an on the 19th, the CCP gave Zhou a new instruction, ordering him to submit a proposal to the government to stop the conflict in the Northeast. After Zhou asked Yu, he submitted it to the government. The recent situation in the Northeast is complex and serious, and it is feared that no results have been negotiated. In Rehe, the commander of the 13th Army, Yu, held a meeting with Xiao Ke, commander of the Communist Jireliao Military Region, in Pingquan, but the gap between the two sides' opinions was too great and no results were achieved. It is also reported that Du Yuming came to Peiping for medical treatment on the 18th, and Zheng Dongguo will fly to Jinzhou to temporarily take command of the New Sixth Army, the 13th Army, and the 52nd Army.

### Problem of Emperor Hirohito's Abdication, Opinions Divided into Two Factions

Imperial Household Ministry to be Reorganized and Downsized

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] A certain important person in the Imperial Household today told a United Press reporter that factions for and against Emperor Hirohito's abdication are forming behind the scenes among the imperial family and senior courtiers. Hirohito himself has expressed his intention to abdicate at an appropriate time, motivated by accepting responsibility for the war, not to avoid being arrested as a war criminal while in office. The faction in favor of abdication believes that Hirohito should bear moral and spiritual responsibility for the war, but because many files have been destroyed and memoirs of those who participated in the secret developments before the war are confusing, it is difficult for people of high position to determine Hirohito's direct relationship to the origins of the war. The opposition faction argues that those responsible for the war were cabinet members and not the emperor, so Hirohito should remain in office. If Hirohito's abdication becomes a reality, it will be followed by the succession of Prince Hirohito, who is only twelve years old, assisted by a regent to govern the country.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th Special Telegram] The Japanese Imperial Household Ministry will be reorganized into the Imperial Household Agency, the Minister of the Imperial Household Ministry will be changed to the Director, and the original staff of 2,000 will be reduced to 400. The imperial family has decided to sell one million Japanese acres of all its forest land.

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] According to Fujita, the secretary general of the "National Food Emergency Campaign Association," if the current food crisis continues, 20 million Japanese people will die from malnutrition and starvation by the end of July of this year. He said that the situation in April, May, June, and July will be the worst. If sufficient food is not imported from abroad, food riots will inevitably occur, and starving people may attack Allied warehouses. At the same time, it is very possible that rioters will attack Japanese farmers. He said that the food shortage in Japan is so severe that some Japanese people are eating rats and silkworm pupae. Most Japanese people are waiting for winter and spring to come so that they can eat some kind of green grass.

### Japanese Residents Remaining in the Northeast

Currently Number 1.6 Million, Excluding the Kwantung Army

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th Special Telegram] According to a Japanese person who recently returned to Japan and was formerly a director of the Changchun Japanese Residents Association, the total number of Japanese residents remaining in various parts of the Northeast is 1,661,000. This number does not include the Kwantung Army that has already been disarmed.

### Soviet Union to Implement New Five-Year Plan

[United Press, Moscow, 24th] Marshal Stalin recently announced that the Soviet Union will implement a new Five-Year Plan. This is the fourth time since the Soviet Union began its first Five-Year Plan in 1928.

### British Empire is Being Hit by a Storm, New York Times Says the US Would Participate If Attacked

Other countries are concerned about the empire's dual pressures, especially the United States. At the same time, the United States has great sympathy for the desire of all people for independence. The United States will likely sympathize with activists operating in the name of independence in areas under imperial administration, it is said.

[United Press, London, 24th] It was announced today that the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference will be held in London at the end of March. The conference will discuss two issues: imperial defense and federal relations. Regarding the latter, two points need to be discussed: First, the establishment of a supreme national defense organization in the United Kingdom Parliament, which is expected to be realized soon. Second, the future trend of preferential trade systems within the empire and with foreign countries, and the attitudes of the three federations towards peace treaties.

### French Government Ousts Gaullist Generals

[Reuters, Paris, 25th] It was officially announced yesterday that 20 French generals and many other senior military officers have retired. Although the official statement is that they retired due to the new army law to reduce the officer corps, it is generally believed that this is a step to remove Gaullist elements, as the left-wing has repeatedly expressed suspicion that General de Gaulle may use the army to seize power again.

### Christian Party Wins Big in Belgian Senatorial Election

Restoration of the King Now Possible

[United Press, Belgian Capital, 25th] In yesterday's provincial senatorial election, the Christian Social Party won 344 of the 696 seats (227 seats in 1939), becoming the strongest party in Belgium. The Socialist Party won 231 seats, the Communist Party 58 seats, and the Liberal Party 53 seats. It will be possible to form a coalition government. According to reliable sources, King Leopold of Belgium, who is exiled abroad, plans to publish a white paper. It was originally scheduled to go on sale today, but has now been postponed. The Christian Social Party supports the restoration of the Belgian king, which is a major issue in this election.

Radar equipment currently used by the army can be used for long-distance wireless telegraph and wireless telephone work. Signals can be sent from New York, reflected off the moon, and received by Paris. This new method will make telecommunications between the two continents more reliable, it is said.

### Optimistic Situation Reduced in Dutch-Indonesian Negotiations

[United Press, Batavia, 24th] The optimistic situation at the beginning of the Dutch-East Indies negotiations is now waning. According to sources in the East Indies, the reason is that the Dutch made a careless statement when Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir left for Yogyakarta last Monday to hold a meeting with party leaders. The border areas are also extremely dissatisfied with the Dutch proposals, believing that these proposals are old hat from the Dutch side and that there is no acceptance of the demands made by the Republic of East Indies.

[Reuters, Batavia, 25th] British Ambassador Sir Kerr held a party last night. Indonesian "Prime Minister" Sjahrir and Dutch-Indian Deputy Governor Van Mook were among the guests. There were a total of 50 guests, including General Selwyn, Chief of Staff of Admiral Mountbatten, General Spurling, Commander of the Allied Forces in the Dutch East Indies, and General Spoor, Commander of the Dutch Army.

### French Crowds Demand Severance of Relations with Spain

[United Press, Paris, 24th] Mass rallies were held in Paris and Bordeaux to protest the execution of ten Spanish Republicans in Madrid. The protesters had participated in the resistance movement against the enemy in France. Thousands of French people have sent a motion to Foreign Minister Bidault, supporting the severance of relations between France and Franco's Spain.

[United Press, Paris, 24th] The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions, representing 70 million workers in 52 countries, passed a resolution yesterday, notifying all affiliated unions to demand that their governments sever diplomatic relations with the Franco government and protest the criminal sentence of ten Spanish Republicans by the Madrid court.

### Cairo Mourns for Three Days, Radio Station Broadcasts Quran

[Reuters, Cairo, 25th] Cairo students are scheduled to "mourn for three days" starting today to commemorate "Evacuation Day", but they intend to obey the instructions of Prime Minister Sidky to maintain normalcy in everything. At the suggestion of the students, the Egyptian National Broadcasting Station began its program today by reciting sections of the Quran. Although the situation in the urban area is quite peaceful, the authorities have again banned British troops from entering the city as a precaution. Chalk notices have been written on both sides of the military police patrol vehicles on the streets. Egyptian military police are guarding British agencies in the urban area.

### New Labor Unrest Brewing in Three Major US Industrial Areas

Transportation workers belonging to the New York Industrial Organizations Congress are demanding increased wages, and will launch a strike at any time after midnight on Tuesday if it is not granted. The mayor has completed emergency measures to cope with it. The labor unrest at General Motors in Detroit has not yet been resolved. Workers deny that there are any optimistic signs in the negotiations. Milk deliverers in the city have been on strike for five days, and bakers and freight handlers have also gone on strike, causing great inconvenience to housewives. Workers at the Flatley Company in Cleveland are also threatening to go on strike due to job cuts.

### Gandhi's Appeal Takes Effect: Mumbai Returns to Normal; Indian Sailors Return to Their Posts; Shops and Factories Resume Operations

[United News Agency, Mumbai, 24th] After three days of bloody riots, order has been restored in Mumbai today. Of the city's sixty-six cotton mills, fifteen have already resumed work. Gandhi appealed to the Indian people to stop this kind of mindless violence, saying, "Even one person shouting any slogan is tantamount to nailing the coffin shut on Indian independence." This appeal seems to have had a beneficial effect.

[Agence France-Presse, Allahabad, 25th] Nehru, leader of the Indian National Congress, left here today for Mumbai. It is hoped that Nehru will help eliminate the current unrest in the area after arriving in Mumbai.

[Reuters, Mumbai, 25th] Officials announced today that Mumbai has almost returned to normal after nearly a week of strikes. An army communiqué stated that Indian navy personnel have now returned to their posts without incident. Dockworkers have also returned to work. Only the Royal Air Force personnel are still on strike, but they insist they are unrelated to the Indian Navy incident. During the turmoil in Mumbai, nine banks, over thirty shops, twenty-two government-operated food and clothing stores, and ten post offices and police outposts were looted. Two more warships sailed into Mumbai today. The All-Students Union called for a strike, but no incidents were reported.

[Reuters, Mumbai, 25th] Local Indian nationalist newspapers report that since the disturbances, a total of 270 people have died and over 1,700 have been injured, with 500 discharged from hospitals after treatment.

### Local Correspondences

Songjiang

Our County Sets a Deadline to Eradicate Narcotics

Eradicating narcotics is one of the most important central tasks of our county this year. It is reported that the County Police Bureau recently received instructions from the County Government, along with a plan to eradicate narcotics and a self-rehabilitation pledge form for narcotics users. The bureau has been ordered to handle this in two phases: general inspection and general denunciation. After receiving the order, Director Rong immediately issued orders to all branch offices and resident stations yesterday (the 24th) to comply, aiming to order the eradication of narcotics use by all narcotics users in the county by the end of June, in order to completely eliminate narcotics.

Confiscated Houses of Collaborators Used as School Buildings: Our County Government recently received a request from the Ba Zhen Central National School to borrow the house of Ye Jiujie, the former director of the Rice Association of Enemy and Pseudo Organizations, which had been sealed off, as a school building. They stated that school was about to start and requested that personnel be dispatched to unseal the house as soon as possible. After receiving the request, County Magistrate Huang approved the unsealing to benefit the school, as using the property of collaborators as school buildings was feasible.

Kunshan

Telecommunications Employees Go on a "Go-Slow" Strike

Employees of the local telecommunications bureau have been demanding improved treatment from the bureau, calculated based on the rate of price index increases, due to rising prices and difficult living conditions. Receiving no satisfactory response, they began a "go-slow" strike on the 24th, only sending military and government telegrams and refusing to send any commercial telegrams.

Banks Offer Small Loans: The local county bank, in view of rising prices and the difficulty for the poor and sick to obtain even basic food, has launched small loans for the poor to provide relief. Those applying for loans at the bank have been extremely crowded in recent days.

Changshu

Full-Scale Cowpox Vaccination Campaign Launched

Our county has decided to launch a full-scale cowpox vaccination campaign in both urban and rural areas. One hundred doses of vaccine have been allocated to Yu from the Shanjiu Suning Branch. In addition to collective vaccination in various agencies and schools, the urban area has decided to vaccinate at the Social Service Center, and the rural area at the Rice Industry Association.

Wuxi

Lack of Coal Prevents Resumption of Work

Many factories in the area were damaged during the occupation period. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, those with minor damage have resumed work, while those with more serious damage are still under repair and cannot be restored for the time being. The biggest reason for this is the shortage of electricity. Silk and yarn mills and flour mills are only operating every other day. Other factories, such as paper mills and foundries, have not yet resumed work due to the lack of electricity. Although requests have been made to the power plant to restore electricity, the coal shortage cannot be resolved. In the blink of an eye, new silkworm cocoons will be on the market, and silk mills will resume work. Rice seedlings also need irrigation, which requires even more electricity. Therefore, if the coal shortage cannot be resolved, agricultural and industrial production cannot be increased, and the future is worrying.

Huzhou

Large Number of Traitors Arrested in Shanghai

Chen Peisan, the leader of the pseudo-Wuxing Detective Team; Yang Heshang, a detective of the enemy's Huzhou Garrison; Wang Zonghan, an enemy military police translator in Huzhou; Wang Meisheng and Tang Zhengfang, enemy interpreters; Yao Zhanyuan, an enemy Agent No. 5; and Huang Menghua, an economic traitor – all seven people were arrested in Shanghai. Except for Wang Zonghan, who has been transferred to the Zhejiang High Court for trial, the other six traitors have been submitted to the Wuxing authorities for legal action.

### New Paris Fashions: Imitating Madame Chiang Kai-shek's Clothing

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] Major French fashion houses are now striving to create women's clothing styles, hoping to make Paris once again the center of women's fashion in the world. Most are referring to the straight-draping style of the Chinese cheongsam, reaching the ankles, with buttoned collars, and especially the clothing of Madame Chiang Kai-shek, as shown in recent photographs, as a model for imitation. Among them, Madame Wanbaleili, a leader in the fashion industry, has created the most cheongsams, derived from the style worn by Madame Chiang during her travels in the United States last year. In addition, Chinese clothing colors such as yellow, blue, purple, and light red are also favored by fashion designers.

### Itagaki Formally Surrenders: "Fight to the Death" Ultimately Falls Short

[Reuters, Singapore, 25th] The Dutch News Agency reported today that Lieutenant General Itagaki, the Japanese commander in Singapore who threatened to "fight to the death" after the unconditional surrender of the Japanese Emperor last August, has formally surrendered to Major General Messervy, commander of the British forces in Malaya. Itagaki was the commander of the Japanese Seventh Area Army, which occupied Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, the Nicobar Islands, and parts of Siam and Borneo.

### Atomic Bomb Test Procedures Finalized: Only an Automated Recording Robot Will Observe at Bikini

[United Press, Washington, 24th] It is understood that the procedures for the atomic bomb test on Bikini Atoll are as follows: The first bomb will explode several hundred feet above the target ships. The second bomb will explode at sea level, creating a tidal wave up to one hundred feet high, expected to cause maximum damage. The third bomb will explode several thousand feet underwater, and the pressure will cause the ship's hull to collapse. This special bomb is still in the planning stage and cannot be used immediately at the beginning, fearing that it will completely destroy the ships used as test targets. This deep-water test is expected to cause violent boiling on the surface and will be carried out in deep water far from inhabited coastlines, merchant shipping routes, and fishing areas.

[United Press, Bikini Atoll, 24th] The atomic bomb experiment will be held in the waters near this island in May. At that time, only an automated recording robot will be on the island as an observer. Naval construction units will soon begin building concrete towers on this island, with walls lined with lead, to house cameras and scientific instruments. The island's natives will have to abandon their homes and move to the nearby Rongerik Island within a few days, but they apparently do not resent this. The island has only coconut trees, a few breadfruit trees, and taro plants. There are several small huts made of pandanus, including a "government house" and a church. It is truly remarkable that the islanders can maintain their strong bodies in such a simple living environment. The natives are all friendly and polite, and all but the children are fully clothed, thanks to the teachings of the missionaries. The natives have quickly learned the value of American currency, and all prices are calculated in US dollars. Once the islanders have been relocated, the engineering team will begin various preparations for the atomic bomb experiment on this island, which is two and a half miles long and one and a half miles wide.

[United Press, San Francisco, 24th] The US Navy Department announced today that three fully loaded "New Guinea pigs" ships to be tested with atomic bombs in the Marshall Islands in May have left here for the "Bikini Atoll" test site.

[United Press, London, 24th] The Daily Express reported today that regarding the situation of atomic research, the United States Army has stopped informing British scientists of the research results for four months, as the British side has made no recent contributions in exchange. The atomic research institute that Britain already has has almost come to a standstill. The construction of the institute in Didcot Valley, Berkshire, has also been stopped due to a lack of personnel. Britain had originally allocated six million US dollars for experimental expenses, but now it is unable to proceed because it has not been able to obtain both protactinium and uranium 235 from the United States.

### A Jiangnan City Full of Northern Flavor: A Cross-Section of Life in Xuzhou

— Special Correspondent Jiang Jun

Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 21st (airmail dispatch)

This is a modern northern city.

Several roads running through the city are lined with huge billboards. The wide roads in the middle are dotted with long, round flower beds. Every traveler who arrives in Xuzhou for the first time will nod in greeting: Xuzhou is a modern city. Yes, Xuzhou is moving towards the road of a modern city. There are fashionable girls with hairspray fragrance, streamlined cars, cinemas, dance halls, and the latest urban equipment. However, the surface cannot represent the substance. The true face of Xuzhou, like most Chinese towns, is still lingering in the era decades ago.

Ah Q in Xuzhou

Learning Fashion

Despite the wooden sign saying "No Ox-carts in the Street", the old ox-carts, as if indifferent, still swagger through the market. The creaking sound of wheelbarrows continues day and night, endlessly. A truly local girl is a simple "Edao Mao" (referring to a simple quilted cotton padded jacket and trousers worn by women in the countryside), a cheongsam that is the same thickness from top to bottom, revealing a large section of bulky cotton padded trousers, with no curves to speak of.

Cinemas are a place for a minority to spend their leisure time. The entertainment methods of ordinary people are either to listen to Qingchang (a type of folk singing) in a shuyu (brothel) or to appreciate Henan Bangzi opera. The water heater equipment in the official residence of the Pacification Commissioner is only one in the entire city, and there are no branches. Ninety-five percent of the people still live in the oriental-style buildings inherited from our ancestors. As for dance halls, it is a big joke to Shanghai people: Do not imagine the waxed floor. The dance floor here is just an ordinary cement floor. After a few rounds of dancing, gray sand swirls with the dance, and the crude and vulgar military music has become all the accompaniment. Among the three dance partners, the girls from the circus are often the other two. Not a few are from brothels. The semi-urban and semi-rural female students, not wanting to be outdone, sit in groups of three or five to "learn". The audience exceeds the seated guests, crowding inside and outside the door, staring with both eyes, competing to see this "foreign trick". The colorful dancers: flying generals, "Chiuba" soldiers, country bumpkins – magnificent, breathtaking. This is just like "Ah Q" learning fashion, not thoroughly.

Thirty Miles East of the City

Strictly Guarded

The news of victory has been six months ago, but so far, Xuzhou is still the Xuzhou of the past. Nothing has been restored, and it still carries the remaining mood of wartime. The area thirty miles east of Xuzhou is the "liberated area" controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. Bunkers and fortifications are heavily guarded. In order to defend local security, the Xuzhou city area is under curfew after 11 pm. Late at night, all is silent. In the silence, one can feel loneliness, and in the loneliness, it seems as if one can breathe in the terrifying smell of gunpowder.

During the day, soldiers of different units walk back and forth in the streets and alleys. In the square, in the early morning, soldiers are diligently engaged in combat training. In the foreign-style house of the Tongshan Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, Communist Party soldiers with badges of the "New Fourth Army" and "Eighth Route Army" live harmoniously with the comrades of the Central Military Police. All of this constantly sweeps dark clouds across people's hearts that cannot be removed at present.

Customs and Sentiments

Northern Flavor

The customs and sentiments of Xuzhou are all with a northern flavor: dry, windy, and dusty. Therefore, the automobile class in Xuzhou is particularly majestic. Where the wheels pass, dust rises, and pedestrians are as if falling into a heavy fog.

The character of the people of Xuzhou is simple and straightforward. The reporter has been asked several times such questions: "To what extent have the government and the Communist Party negotiated? Fight or make peace, why is it always so vague?" The question, although it inevitably contains a little naivety, clearly shows that they are concerned about state affairs and are hoping for the arrival of true peaceful days!

Due to the general public's concern about the development of the political situation, the sales of newspapers in Xuzhou are not bad, especially the Shanghai Shen Bao and Ta Kung Pao, which are very popular with readers.

Common Sense of Depression

No News

There are two local publications, Zhong Bao and Xu Bao. The content and printing quality are both inferior. The Xu Bao was founded in 1929 and has a longer history. The president is an elderly old man of seventy-three years old, in very good spirits, who claims to be an amateur in running a newspaper. There are more than a dozen local and foreign reporters active in Xuzhou. They all have a common sense of depression: Xuzhou is a place with no news. Although freedom of reporting on military mediation is clearly stipulated in the Political Consultative Conference, the relevant authorities in Xuzhou believe that their duties are important and keep their mouths shut. The reporters simply cannot "get started".

Prices are rising step by step, and military conflicts and mediation are becoming more and more mysterious. Nowadays, the general price index in Xuzhou is even higher than that of Jinghu (Nanjing and Shanghai). People live in an "unbearable" circle.

Ladies Sleeping on the Floor

When the reporter first arrived, Xuzhou was experiencing a widespread housing shortage. According to the person in charge of adjusting houses, the current population of Xuzhou is close to 300,000, which is almost twice as high as before the war, which is one of the reasons for the housing shortage. However, the main problem is not the number of houses, but the uneven distribution. The confiscated properties of enemies and pseudo-officials are still shelved and have not been dealt with. Most of the giant buildings and mansions have an armed comrade standing guard outside the door, but no one is inside. This kind of contradictory phenomenon is currently being rectified by the authorities. At present, most of the top hotels in Xuzhou are requisitioned in whole or in part by military organs. Military and government officials and their families often reside there, so if travelers are not through the "official" route, they can not expect to be served. In Xuzhou, it is not uncommon for well-dressed ladies to temporarily sleep on the floor in hotels.

Xuzhou wine is drunk and does not hurt the brain. However, according to those familiar with the local situation, women are more charming than wine. Xuzhou has a famous "soul-melting den" called "Jin Guli." Jin Guli is like Guangxi's Tezhali (a red light district), with neat and elegant buildings and a smaller scale but a unique charm. There are more than twenty houses here, each with dozens of courtesans, whose lives are not bad. In summary, the normal state of Xuzhou is waiting to be established quickly.

### Recent Situation in Kunming

Another misfortune that emerged after the Kunming recession is unemployment, which has become an important issue in the lives of Kunming residents for the first time in many years. In fact, during the War of Resistance, there was a great shortage of labor, especially in skilled technical workers. After the Japanese surrendered, this situation has reversed 180 degrees, and a large number of workers have no work to do. At the end of November last year, a spokesman for the provincial government said that the number of unemployed people at that time was about 50,000. However, according to well-informed and qualified sources, it is feared that the number is even higher than this. During the household registration survey in the first month of this year, Kunming City had a total of 300,000 residents. If this number is correct, then at least one in six people is unemployed.

People often talk about the government lending money to factories to help them through this transition period. Although local industrialists have submitted urgent petitions to the government, they have not yet received practical relief to date. Not only that, it should also be said that the government has decided to create "trust"-style state-owned industries (such as organizations like the China Textile Company). This news has caused considerable unrest and panic among local industrialists. (Translated from the February issue of Millard's Review.)

### Observations on Salt Administration Reform (Continued)

— Xu Erxin

The salt fields produce salt, which is managed, allocated, and sold by state-owned salt companies. In reality, the merchants are responsible for selling the salt to the consumers. To sell salt, the merchants must first apply to the responsible salt affairs administration office for a license. Once approved, they must provide a substantial guarantee and pay a deposit before starting business. During operation, merchants must keep detailed records of all transactions in ledgers for inspection. They must also have complete storage facilities for salt to allow officials to inspect their warehouses at any time, thereby preventing the sale of smuggled salt. The quantity of salt purchased, sold, and stored must be recorded daily on forms. Merchants must sell salt at the regulated price and are not allowed to increase prices arbitrarily, short-weight customers, or mix the salt with mud or sand. They must also display salt samples prominently in their shops. Street vendors who carry salt to sell in villages must also be registered and licensed, and they must provide a substantial guarantee before starting business. All wholesale and retail salt transactions must be recorded separately for inspection. The routes and locations for sales must be clearly defined, and vendors are not allowed to sell outside of designated areas to prevent abuse. Any merchant may freely apply for a sales license without restriction, and people are free to buy from them.

Rectification of Anti-Smuggling

Salt taxes in our country are relatively high, leading to the prevalence of smuggled salt and slow sales of government salt, making anti-smuggling necessary to protect tax revenue. Throughout history, laws have been strict and regulations numerous. Even with patrol officers and soldiers spread everywhere, the more stringent the anti-smuggling efforts, the more prevalent smuggled salt becomes, because the high profits incentivize people to take risks. Not only are anti-smuggling units often ineffective and unable to fulfill their responsibilities, some may even collude in smuggling, and others may even smuggle salt themselves. As a result, they fail to effectively manage anti-smuggling and tax protection, achieving little success. In recent years, the financial authorities have focused on rectification, significantly reducing smuggled salt and yielding substantial benefits. In the future, anti-smuggling affairs should have unified authority and be handled uniformly, establishing sound institutions and exerting effective force. Emphasis should be placed on inspecting salt fields, as no smuggled salt can arise if no salt leaves the fields illegally. Within each salt field area, a sufficient number of troops should be stationed based on the area's size to conduct patrols. Furthermore, teams should be stationed at key transportation routes to conduct inspections and implement encirclement and interception measures. Near seaports, where smuggled salt is most likely to emerge, patrol boats or shallow-water gunboats must be deployed for frequent patrols to prevent leakage. At key land and water crossings between production and sales areas, patrol checkpoints must be established to conduct inspections and interceptions. In addition, troops should be deployed along specified transportation routes to set up anti-smuggling lines to prevent smuggled salt from entering sales areas and to prevent government officials from smuggling goods. It seems more effective to entrust the inspection affairs in sales areas to local governments, specifically assigning the responsibility of inspecting smuggled goods to local police units. All confiscated goods from successful seizures should be sold, and after deducting the tax revenue, the remainder should be used to reward the personnel involved and those who contributed. In addition, bonuses should be given to show encouragement. Furthermore, salt producers in the production areas should be organized into mutual guarantee groups to monitor each other and implement joint liability. If anyone secretly opens new salt fields, illegally increases sun-drying boards, secretly transports salt, hides excess salt, smuggles salt, or colludes with smugglers, neighboring households should truthfully report them. If violations are not reported and are discovered, joint liability should be enforced. This type of production area inspection, with its focus on prevention, is truly a fundamental solution to anti-smuggling.

This state monopoly system, in which the state-owned salt company is responsible for the monopoly business, is different from a free market system, but it is not a complete monopoly. Instead, it is a system of planned control with limited freedom. Salt producers are free to produce salt, and merchants are free to sell it in sales areas. At the same time, salt fields with high production costs and scattered locations that are difficult to manage are abolished and closed. Those who secretly produce salt are severely punished. Merchants must register and obtain licenses and operate within designated areas and routes, subject to the management of the relevant salt affairs administration. On one hand, planned control is implemented over salt production, procurement, transportation, storage, and sales, balancing planned economy and free economy, and taking into account both state-owned and private enterprises. That is, planned economy is used to develop state-owned enterprises, with the goal of achieving nationalization of capital and benefits for the masses. It is deeply believed that this does not violate the principles of economic construction that our country should adopt after the war. However, the salt law stipulates a system of tax collection at the salt fields and free trade for the people, which is not fully consistent. But until the salt production is strictly managed and the salt tax rate is reduced, there will be many abuses in a free trade system after the tax collection. In this state monopoly system, the salt company pays the tax at the specified rate when it goes to the salt fields for allocation and transportation, which is equivalent to collecting taxes at the salt fields. The salt company is responsible for allocation and sales, while merchants are responsible for free sales in various regions. Consumers are also free to purchase salt without time limits. This is a system of limited free trade. Once the salt production is rectified, management is strict and complete, the objective conditions for free trade are met, and smuggled salt can be prevented, it will not be too late to implement the system of tax collection at the salt fields and free trade according to the salt law.

### News Outside the News

New Flying Boat Ascent Technique

Professor Biggard, an instructor of marine and atmospheric studies at the University of Minnesota, is planning another exploratory flight. Biggard, now sixty-one years old, rose to fame in the early 1940s for his balloon ascents. Biggard now intends to ascend in a flying boat suspended by one hundred balloons. He hopes to reach an altitude of twenty miles (105,600 feet) to discover the secrets of cosmic rays. It is believed that this ascent will usher in a new era of atomic research. The balloons used for the ascent will be made of a gelatinous material, each capable of expanding to 100,000 cubic feet in the upper atmosphere. Mrs. Biggard plans to serve as the balloon's pilot.

Atomic Fission Machine

Instruments for studying atoms are constantly emerging. Recently, American scientists invented a new type of atomic fission machine. This machine can split uranium-235 for use in manufacturing atomic bombs. Ionized uranium-235 can be introduced into a vacuum tube. The uranium-235 is separated in the tube by an electric arc, combining each atom with an electric current. Magnets can rotate the atoms in the tube, with the speed of rotation varying according to the atomic weight and current. Another "restorer" is used to collect atoms with different rotation speeds for use.

New Type of Helicopter

The Siorsky Aircraft Division of the United Aircraft Association has built a new type of helicopter. The emergence of this aircraft has truly set a new international record. Aircraft experts at Bridgeport, Connecticut, are stepping up research to enable helicopters to be used for commercial shipping and short-distance flights.

The new type of helicopter has a rotor at the tail and top, and three landing wheels. The fuselage is made of plastic. Its speed is 114.6 miles per hour. (The previous world record was 76.15 miles per hour). With a load of 1,000 pounds, the speed is 110 miles per hour, and with 1,650 pounds, it is 105 miles per hour. The highest ascent record is 21,000 feet, about 10,000 feet higher than the previous world record.

### Editorial: The Northeast Problem is an International Problem

In recent days, the Northeast problem has gradually become the most watched issue by people around the world. The Northeast problem, in its essence and in its form, has already become an international problem.

After the students in the capital marched and petitioned over the Northeast problem, similar actions have sprung up in various places. Yesterday, students across Shanghai boycotted classes to promote the cause, and today they are rumored to have an even larger march to express their patriotic fervor and protection of rights. This is not only happening among students, nor is it limited to Shanghai alone. The Northeast is China's lifeline. The integrity of the Northeast is the integrity of China. Recovering the Northeast has been the unanimous desire of the Chinese people for the past fifteen years since the September 18th Incident. Now, more than half a year has passed since the victory of the War of Resistance, and the obstacles to receiving the Northeast are so great that anyone cannot help but feel the gravity of foreign insults and the disturbances of internal treachery. When people are in dire straits, they return to their roots. When people are sick and in pain, they cry out for their parents, which is a natural thing. Therefore, it is a common occurrence in any country for patriotic citizens to demonstrate and demand that the government engage in solemn negotiations and not continue to appease and concede. Unexpectedly, the Soviet radio broadcast actually referred to this as an anti-Soviet activity by "reactionary elements." The government has already lodged a protest with China. We really do not know what the Soviet allied people would think if they were in our shoes.

Lest we exaggerate, China is always the most peace-loving country. The fact that China has been subjected to aggression for years is a fact. Today, the fact that China wants to strive for liberation from aggression and oppression is also a fact. The Chinese people will never forget the various forms of assistance provided by the Soviet Union in the early stages of the War of Resistance. This is also a fact. Just look at how China, even as a victorious nation and one of the four great powers, is willing to sign the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Friendship, hoping to maintain peace in the Far East for at least thirty years. It is willing to recognize the independence of Outer Mongolia, recognize the joint operation of the Northeast Railway, and recognize the lease of Lushun and Dalian, as if China were a defeated country. China does not care about it either. China's sincerity in being friendly to the Soviet Union should be seen by everyone in the world. Even if we do not talk about the secret agreement of Yalta, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Friendship, as it was agreed upon by both parties, should be jointly observed by both parties. The Sino-Soviet Treaty is the most important covenant in China's international affairs this year, because it contributes the most to world peace. If this treaty can be broken and not observed, then what righteousness can be talked about in the international community, and what treaties can be mentioned? And would not the organization of the United Nations and the establishment of the Security Council be unnecessary? Therefore, to put it bluntly, China's Northeast problem is not only a Chinese problem today, nor is it just a Sino-Soviet problem, but an international problem involving the entire world. International problems can only be resolved internationally. Therefore, when we discuss the Northeast problem, we must first see this point clearly and firmly oppose attempting to resolve the Northeast problem by abusing domestic political negotiation methods among political parties. Otherwise, it will inevitably lead to a situation of increasing chaos and leave endless troubles for the country.

The occurrence, evolution, and development of the Northeast problem to its current stage are not just issues related to China and the Soviet Union. It has always been an international problem. From the standpoint of the Chinese people, we certainly do not want to see such an international problem in our own territory, but this problem first appeared as an international problem. Originally, China's full-scale war of resistance against Japan after the Lugouqiao Incident was aimed at ensuring the integrity of our territory and sovereignty. If Japan is defeated and China recovers the Northeast, there will be no Northeast problem, and there will be no problem with the international implications that currently exist in the Northeast. The reason why the situation in the Northeast has developed to its current point is not due to our autonomy, but to the revival of so-called "power politics" in international relations. Overthrowing "power politics" was originally the goal of the war against the Axis powers. Unexpectedly, during the war against the Axis powers, "power politics" secretly raised its head again—this is manifested in the secret agreement of Yalta, as it is manifested in the Charter of the United Nations.

It is because of the Yalta Agreement that the situation in the Northeast has developed as it is today. China is not a participant in the Yalta Agreement, and in theory, is not bound by the Yalta Agreement. However, the agreement established in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, which is the cornerstone of the new Sino-Soviet relationship, is tacitly built upon the thread of Yalta. In the Yalta Agreement, President Roosevelt took on the obligation of making China accept the Yalta Agreement. It was under the urging of our ally, the United States, that China concluded the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship with our other ally, the Soviet Union, making the greatest concessions with the mood of a brave man breaking his arm in order to maintain world peace. We trusted our allies, expecting that after making the greatest concessions, we would be able to achieve our desire to rebuild the Northeast. The countries that participated in the Yalta Agreement should bear full responsibility for the development of the situation in the Northeast to its current stage! The reason why the Yalta Conference had this secret agreement was obviously because the Soviet Union used its participation in the war as a demand to force the United Kingdom and the United States to do so. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Soviet Union is the original instigator of the current situation in the Northeast, and that the disaster originated in Yalta. The United States and the United Kingdom, which participated in the Yalta Conference, should not shirk their responsibility in clarifying the current situation in the Northeast in terms of morality!

The current situation in Cambodia is not only that China has failed to carry out the reception work. The main conclusions, in summary, are as follows: (1) The issue of so-called "spoils of war." If the term "spoils of war" is interpreted broadly, it will include everything; (2) The question of so-called "corridors" and "new Xinjiang soil" is clearly contrary to the meaning of China's territorial and sovereign integrity; (3) Creating and developing a situation within the Soviet-occupied area that conflicts with the interests of the Chinese National Government, hoping to turn it into a "fait accompli," from a problem that is itself an international problem into a problem that looks like a domestic problem on the surface. As for what is called "economic cooperation," it especially reminds us of the demands made by Hirota back then. This has a different feeling in the hearts of the Chinese people. What is particularly worrying about the developing situation in the Northeast is the centrifugal and divisive movement. Needless to say about the "East Mongolian People's Republic," there is also the so-called "People's Armed Forces" developing in the Northeast, echoing the Chinese Communist Party's army and hindering the advance of our national army. All of this is contrary to the original intention of the allied countries that fought against the Axis powers, and especially contrary to the purpose of China's bitter eight-year war and firm rejection of the Japanese invaders. If the United Nations does not want to repeat the mistakes of the old League of Nations, in order to ensure the security of the world, it should resolutely assume the responsibility for a fair solution to the Northeast problem today. US Secretary of State Byrnes's previous statement that the Northeast reception issue will be referred to the Far Eastern Advisory Commission for a solution may have the same view as ours, and the United States' awareness of its mistakes at the Yalta Conference can also be known to some extent.

This newspaper's previous discussion of the Northeast situation stated: "The 'Agreement on the Northeast Region' was signed by the Chinese National Government and the Soviet Government. Before the power of the National Government reaches the Northeast, the Soviet Union has a treaty obligation to transfer the entire Northeast to the National Government. Therefore, the Soviet Union should not allow any situation that conflicts with the interests of the National Government to arise and develop within the defense zone." Why would there be so-called "People's Armed Forces" in the Northeast? Why did the Soviet authorities not stop it? Why does the propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party emphasize this point in particular, hoping to turn it into a domestic problem? Undoubtedly, the Chinese Communist Party has become a puppet of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union is cultivating its puppet forces in the Northeast. This newspaper also stated in the same editorial: "When former US Vice President Wallace came to China a few years ago, he said that the length of the border between China and the Soviet Union is comparable only to the border between the United States and Canada, and he hoped that the border between China and the Soviet Union could be as good as the border between the United States and Canada in promoting understanding and cooperation between the two countries. We also sincerely hope that this long border can be as good as the border between the United States and Canada." This newspaper has always valued the friendship with our ally, the Soviet Union. This can be seen from this, but because we value it, we must point out the key points of the currently developing situation in particular and hope that the Soviet Union will improve its attitude.

The delay in resolving the Northeast problem will cause consequences that we do not want to imagine. The restatement of the Open Door Policy generally shows the attitude of our allies, but the current Northeast problem is not a problem that can be solved by restating the Open Door Policy. This originated in Yalta. This is a problem that requires international cooperation to solve! Now is the time for action. We must not all be shortsighted and only seek temporary peace, but instead learn from some of the British former Foreign Secretary Simon's tricks and perfunctorily deal with the matter, so that the fire in the stars will eventually spread. We must remind our American allies not to forget those countless sons and daughters who died on the barren islands of the Pacific, on the plains of China, and in Europe and Africa for their country!

In short, the Northeast problem is a national problem. If the international community cannot resolve the Northeast problem fairly, then the Northeast problem will inevitably harm international peace!

The progress of the "Atomic Age"

Don't let "Wild Horses" hinder it!

### Shanghai Students' Rights Protection Movement to Commemorate Eight Martyrs Today

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Students' Rights Protection Movement will hold a memorial service for the eight martyrs, including Zhang Xinfu, at Aurora University at 10 a.m. today. Social organizations in the city will send representatives to participate. The presidium of the conference will be composed of representatives from eleven schools, including Jiaotong University, Daxia University, Tongde University, and Guanghua University. After the conference, the team will start marching. In addition to requesting the municipal government to forward two letters to Chairman Chiang and requesting the external office in Shanghai to forward them to Soviet Marshal Shlemin, the conference will also telegraph students across the country and distribute a book to fellow citizens of the city. It is also learned that the students in the city believe that students should concentrate on their studies during the founding period, so they do not intend to waste their studies and will resume classes soon. Also, the Shanghai Women's Association issued a declaration yesterday to maintain the sovereignty of the Northeast. The Shanghai Branch of the National Diplomacy Association also issued a declaration, stating that the Northeast issue is related to global stability and peace, and hoping that people around the world will pay attention to this new issue. Also, the Chinese Poor Students Association and the Student Self-Government Association of New Construction Middle School also issued a declaration of the Rights Protection Movement yesterday. Also, the students of the National Temporary University, 2,200 in total, and the students of the National Jiaotong University, 458 in total, gathered at the gate of the municipal government at 1:00 p.m. yesterday to petition the municipal government for the Northeast issue. When Mayor Qian was out on official business, he sent a representative to receive them and comforted the petitioning students. At 2:10 p.m., Director Gu and all the students retired in formation. The team then formed small groups and went to various places for propaganda. The students of Lin University traveled north along Zhongshan Road, crossed the Waibaidu Bridge and went straight to the Soviet Consulate, standing around and chanting slogans, and pasting slogans on the doors and windows of the consulate. A piece of patriotic sincerity was revealed. At 3:10 p.m., they left the Soviet Consulate and went to the Times Daily Newspaper in Xiejiao Lane to make a demonstration of the same nature. The student organization was strict and the order was very good.

Continuing report: The Student Representative Council of Jiaotong University's Patriotic Movement issued an emergency statement last night, stating that the printed declaration of the Shanghai Students' Rights Protection Movement Conference on the 25th had discrepancies with the previously agreed wording. This is inconsistent with our position. Furthermore, the report stated that the book "The Shanghai Students' Rights Protection Movement Informs Fellow Citizens of the Whole Country" was drafted by students of Jiaotong University, which is also not true. Therefore, it is announced that it will withdraw from the Shanghai Students' Rights Protection Movement Conference and reiterate our pure national patriotic position. If there is criticism from any position, all students of the National Jiaotong University will criticize it with a national patriotic and just position.

Northeast Sojourners in Shanghai Issue a Declaration to Express Their Views

The Northeast Sojourners Association in Shanghai recently issued a declaration and a letter to the elders of the Northeast. The declaration stated: Since the September 18th Incident, the people of the Northeast have suffered hardships and pains during this period. The miserable situation of their displacement cannot be imagined by ordinary people. However, what is the situation in our hometown today? We have no political party and are willing to inform the country and abroad of four points from the standpoint of a Chinese citizen: (1) We are willing to return to our hometown to build a new Northeast. Any domestic and foreign forces that attempt to divide our sovereignty or forcibly establish a special political institution without the consent of the people of the Northeast, and directly and indirectly obstruct our return to our hometown, will be resolutely opposed. (2) Firmly advocate that the Soviet army immediately withdraw from our country's territory. (3) Immediately stop the factional struggle and thoroughly implement economic and political democracy. (4) The number of loyal and capable people in the Northeast is no less than that in other provinces. The government should immediately seek more talent from the Northeast, in the wild and unknown, to participate in the rescue and construction of the new Northeast.

University Professors Association Calls for the Protection of Sovereignty

The Shanghai University Professors Association believes that the situation in the Northeast is becoming increasingly serious. Yesterday, it telegraphed Chairman Chiang and sent a telegram to educators across the country, calling for the protection of the sovereignty of the Northeast.

### Commodity Prices Fell Universally Yesterday; Authorities' Emergency Measures Effective; Rice Purchase Loans Temporarily Set at 2 Billion Yuan

Since the authorities took effective measures to suppress commodity prices, cotton yarn, cloth, and black market gold all showed a general downward trend yesterday morning. The opening price of rice was as high as 26,000, but it did not rise until the close of the market, already falling by an average of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared to the end of last week. The real reason for this is the implementation of rice merchant loans by the food administration authorities and the sudden drop of 200 to 300 yuan per bag of various brands of flour yesterday.

Draft Rice Purchase Loan Plan

[This newspaper's report] According to Special Commissioner Yang's statement to reporters, the number of rice shops in this city has increased to more than 1,600, and the number of rice firms has also increased to more than 300. General grain merchants, due to limited capital, are increasingly hoarding goods as rice prices rise, to prevent being unable to replenish them at the original price after selling. Now the Food Administration Office plans to remedy this through loans, so that they can still supply rice when grain prices soar, while still having sufficient funds to replenish purchases from production areas. When asked about the government's collection of military grain, it was stated that all procedures for collecting military grain were completed before February. Currently, any grain collection is to collect already determined military grain. It is estimated that the total amount of military grain accounts for less than 1-2% of the output of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which will not affect the supply of grain sources.

(Further news) The Food Administration Bureau continued to convene rice merchants in this city yesterday morning to discuss methods for purchasing rice through loans, dispersing only at noon. It is said that the draft has been prepared and will be announced as soon as it is approved. It is also confirmed that this loan will only be available to members of the city's bean and rice trade association who hold membership certificates. The total loan amount is temporarily set at 2 billion yuan in national currency, and can be increased again if needed. Interest will be calculated daily based on the national bank's loan interest rate. Security can be provided by written guarantees from the silver and money industry, shops, and grain merchants. The loan amount will be based on the current rice price converted into national currency, ranging from a minimum of 500 piculs to a maximum of 2,000 piculs. The rice should be stored in warehouses, according to designated institutions, and the goods should be sold to this city. It is also heard that once this method is passed, the food administration authorities plan to discuss with the city's administrative agencies to form a review committee to supplement everything. With such effective implementation, it will not be difficult for rice prices to fall day by day.

### Insurance Association Re-election

Luo Beichen Appointed Chairman

The Shanghai Insurance Association has been reorganized, and the re-election meeting was held yesterday afternoon at the Jin Cheng Building.

### Robbery Case in Dongjiadu; Several Robbers Arrested

[This newspaper's report] A robbery occurred at the Liu Xiangji Brick and Tile Company at the Fengji Wharf in Dongjiadu, Nanshi, at around 10 PM the night before. Police and robbers exchanged gunfire, and the details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that when the robbers fled, the Dongjiadu Police Station had already been notified, and a large number of personnel rushed to the scene. At the same time, Yao Lu, deputy director of the Penglai Branch, section chief Yao Zhilong, and section members Li Shutang, Wang Dianxiang, Tong Bairong, Zhang Shusheng, Yang Lian Geng, and others also rushed to the scene by car. In a confrontation on Lujiabang Road, they captured an injured robber, Pan Xian. Then, near No. 179 Xuejia浜, they captured Tang Guoliang, confiscating a Mauser pistol and two handguns. They were all taken to the station. At around 3 AM, Wang Silong, who had been injured and fled back, was captured at No. 54 Hongqiao Road, and three suspected men and women were arrested on a boat at the bottom of Tangjiawan Street, Xujiahui Catholic Church.

### Telecommunications Labor Dispute Negotiated Again; Both Sides' Opinions Gradually Converge; Employees Agree to Two Methods

The long unresolved Shanghai Ministry of Communications Telecommunications Bureau and International Radio strike, has been repeatedly discussed by Director Tao of the Postal and Telecommunications Department, Deputy Director Qian of the Telecommunications Bureau, and Director Yu, Deputy Director Lu, and Chief Engineer Lu of Shanghai. A meeting of all department heads was convened at 2 PM yesterday. It was agreed to follow the Ministry of Communications' approved methods for increasing treatment:

Ministry of Communications Approved Five Methods

(1) Starting from February, the salary multiplier and basic living standard will be handled in accordance with the Municipal Government's standards. (2) The above basic living standard will be issued according to regulations: 100% for officers, 80% for assistants, and 60% for workers. (3) If the price of rice exceeds 9,000 yuan per picul, a rice subsidy will be issued separately, based on the difference between the average market price of medium-grade rice and 9,000 yuan, and also according to regulations: one picul for officers, eight dou for assistants, and six dou for workers. (4) A one-time special subsidy of 50,000 yuan will be issued. (5) Previous loans will not be deducted. After hearing the news, all employees convened a meeting throughout the afternoon to express their views, and all agreed to items 4 and 5. The adjustment of treatment and living standards is too far apart. The standard of the third requirement that has been held is in accordance with the former, and in order to understand the authorities' difficulties, they are willing to make the biggest concession, reducing the total amount allocated per person to five or fewer. The Bureau-Taiwan side expressed regret that they could not change due to the limitations of telecommunications finance and the Ministry of Communications' orders. It is also heard that employees of various bureaus in other areas have already accepted the resumption of work.

Sawmill Workers' General Strike

The tinplate industry workers in this city requested the capital side, the Timber Industry Association, to adjust wages half a month ago, divided into four levels: 60,000, 80,000, 100,000, and 120,000 yuan. As there has been no response so far, they submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation yesterday morning. Starting in the afternoon, a general strike has occurred.

The Western restaurant and cafe workers in this city have been on strike for three days as of yesterday. In addition, Jeep Cafe joined yesterday. It is reported that the mediation yesterday still did not yield concrete results. It is set to be mediated again at the Social Affairs Bureau today.

Xinhua Bank Strike Resolved

After the treatment of the four banks and one bureau, Xinhua, Zhejiang, Xingye, etc., in this city were adjusted, they also successively requested increases and once went on strike. Xinhua employees requested an additional special allowance of 100,000 yuan for February and an adjustment of treatment starting next month, taking the national bank as an example. After several negotiations between labor and capital, a special allowance of 80,000 yuan was issued, so the Xinhua labor dispute has temporarily subsided.

### Car Owners Can Rest Assured; Unlimited Gasoline Supply

[United Press Local Report] American gasoline businesses in this city announced: All gas stations have now resumed unlimited gasoline supply, and the temporary restrictions on weekends have been terminated. A few days ago, there were rumors among Chinese people that there was a shortage of oil in this city. According to gas company officials, these rumors are completely unfounded, but they led to a rush to get oil at various gas stations on weekends, making it necessary to take temporary restrictions. Another rumor that gasoline was about to rise in price was also a factor in promoting the oil rush.

### Dance Hall Manager Accused of Treason

False Town Head and Treacherous Merchant Tried on the Same Day

[This newspaper's report] Three treason cases were heard by the High Court yesterday morning, and the details are recorded as follows:

(1) The Lao Dahua Dance Hall at the intersection of Lin Sen Road and Ma Dang Road was opened by Iraqi national Li Wei. After Italy declared war, the dance hall was regarded as enemy property by the Japanese army and closed. Later, Yuan Shixiang from Dinghai took over as manager, and Chen Huichang from Yong took over as cafe manager, continuing to operate. Now, after the victory of the War of Resistance, Li Wei regained his freedom and asked Yuan and Chen to return the dance hall, but Yuan occupied it and refused to return it. Li then filed a lawsuit with the local court to recover the property; on the one hand, he accused Yuan and Chen of treason with the High Court. After the High Prosecutor's Office concluded its investigation, it filed a public prosecution. After Judge Cao Jun summoned and investigated yesterday, he ordered them to be detained for a later trial.

(2) Ding Bochu, the false town head of Cao Hang Town, collected quilts and other items from the villagers on behalf of the false city security team during his tenure, and then privately embezzled a portion of them. Now, the county government has learned about the previous situation, arrested Ding, and transferred him to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation. After the investigation was concluded, a public prosecution was filed in accordance with the law. The defendant denied embezzlement in court yesterday. Because the witness did not arrive, the court ordered a hearing to be scheduled after the witness was summoned.

(3) Fu Guangyao, the owner of Longchang Copper and Tin Shop on Zhejiang Road, purchased copper coins and nickel coins during the War of Resistance, reselling them to the enemy for profit. Now, after the High Prosecutor's Office concluded its investigation, it was considered to have violated the Regulations for Punishing Traitors, and a public prosecution was filed. However, the defendant argued in court yesterday that what was sold was scrap copper, not whole copper coins. As for the purchase and sale of nickel coins, it was likely done by an apprentice in the shop. The court ordered a retrial at a later date, as the defendant had confessed to the prosecutor's office. The defendant was taken back into custody.

### Bishop Yu Bin Arrives in Shanghai

Inspects Catholic Conditions in Nanjing and Shanghai

[This newspaper's report] Bishop Yu Bin arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. Bishop Yu's trip is to inspect the Catholic conditions in Nanjing and Shanghai. According to Bishop Yu, there are currently 4 million Catholics in China. There are three Catholic universities: Aurora University, Fu Jen Catholic University, and Tianjin Institute of Industry and Commerce. Currently, there is only one Catholic newspaper, Yi Shi Bao, which is currently published in Chongqing, Xi'an, Beijing, and Tianjin. In the future, it is planned to add four editions in Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou or Hong Kong. Yu also said that the highest person in charge of the Catholic Church in China used to be the Pope's representative, but is now succeeded by Cardinal Tian Gengxin. There are a total of seventy cardinals in the Vatican. If the Pope dies, these seventy people have the right to elect and be elected to succeed him. Other popes only have the right to elect, but not the right to be elected. Yu plans to stay here for a week.

### Municipal Cooperative Bank Established Soon

The cooperative cause in this city is being actively developed in coordination with various reconstruction works, and the establishment of cooperative financial institutions is even more urgent. It is reported that the Cooperation Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Central Farmers Bank, and more than 20 cooperative societies jointly initiated the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperative Bank, and convened the first preparatory meeting at No. 65 Daming Road on the 23rd of this month. Many important cases were passed. It is heard that the bank's share capital is 100 million yuan, which can be raised and opened in a short period of time.

### Accidental Firing Kills One

[This newspaper's report] Chen Shiqing, a 17-year-old from Pudong, runs a grocery business and is a member of the Defense Corps. At 12:00 PM yesterday, a soldier from a certain unit of the Loyal National Salvation Army stationed in the township was cleaning his gun when it accidentally discharged.

### Fire on North Jiangxi Road

[This newspaper's report] A fire broke out at No. 431 North Jiangxi Road at 9 PM last night, burning the roof of the third floor and affecting the overhanging building on the third floor of the neighboring house.

### Registration of Enemy Crimes Urgently Awaiting Conclusion; Work is Busy

The Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office has been handling enemy crime cases for more than three months. The Central Ministry of Justice is urging the conclusion of the cases, so the work has been extremely busy in recent days. The office also recognizes that some officials in various agencies in the city are local residents and have been harmed by the enemy. However, due to their duties, they do not have time to register. A special method has been established to allow each agency to provide a list of names and send a letter of notification. The office will assign a special person to reply by letter and arrange for them to register in advance on a nearby date, in order to complete the work as soon as possible. It is heard that this method has already been negotiated with the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau. Wang Daoping and other victims of the bureau have been notified by letter to go to register in batches on the morning and afternoon of the 22nd of this month, so as not to delay and avoid affecting public duties.

### Zhejiang-Jiangxi Postal Area Resumes Acceptance of Parcels

The reason was a street conflict between ticket sellers and Tongxing Factory workers

At 7:30 PM the day before yesterday, a Route 16 trolleybus of the British Tramway Company was traveling on Gordon Road when workers from Tongdian Yarn Factory boarded the bus, causing a conflict and mutual beatings with the ticket seller. Police officers from the Putuo Road Branch sent the injured to the Civilian Hospital for treatment and investigated the incident. However, tramway employees expressed indignation because the yarn factory workers had privately detained Li Zheng and Wu Zhenyong in the factory. As the matter had not been resolved by 11 PM that night, the tramway employees requested the authorities to guarantee the safety of the employees and maintain traffic, leading to a temporary halt of the trams yesterday morning. At around 9:00 AM, tramway employees sent representatives such as Zhu Yongye to the police station to negotiate and demand protection of employee safety. The police station persuaded both parties, and the matter was settled. At around 11:00 AM, the trams resumed operation.

Over 300 members attended, and Xi Yushu, Luo Qinghua, Wang Genzhong, Ju Haoran, and Yu Chuanding were elected as the presidium.

He expressed appreciation for the enthusiastic participation of those in free professions and those who cherished freedom, hoping everyone would work together to unite a force for freedom, break the heavy shackles, contribute to national affairs, and fully realize the association's mission of promoting freedom and democracy.

Election of Directors and Supervisors

Xi Yushu, Ju Haoran, Zhang Shizhao, Wang Genzhong, Xu Yongzuo, He Yuanming, Zhao Chuanding, Zhou Chunfang, Jiang Weiqiao, Wang Qizhang, Fan Shouyuan, Xu Jihua, Ding Zhongying, Jin Tongyin, Xu Jingzhi, Wang Xianqing, Xu Xiaochu, Yan Zhe, Zhou Feicheng, E Sen, Gao Erbai, Yu Chuanding, Luo Qinghua, Liu Piji, Qu Yue, Chen Xunyü, Cai Renbao, Zheng Ziliang, Wang Yansong, Zhang Wenkui, Kong Dachong, Nian Fangyuan, and Zhu Wende, totaling 33 individuals, were elected as directors.

Declaration Issued

Member Qu Yue, Yin Tiyang and others proposed a temporary motion: in light of the recent Northeast crisis shaking the entire nation, the primary task of the association is to realize national freedom. Therefore, a strict and firm stance should be expressed regarding the integrity of Northeast territory and sovereignty. They presented a telegram to the chairman. After being read, it was unanimously approved with applause. The declaration and telegram to the government are recorded below. The purpose is to realize freedom and establish a free and equal country. We do not allow for one-sided freedom in the world, nor do we want to see any events that violate freedom. If freedom can be easily manipulated, how can we face the heroic martyrs who sacrificed their lives to defend the nation?

Although the current international and domestic situation is fraught with shadows, and excessive optimism before national construction is not allowed, we must not casually (telegram original text as follows): Humankind's noble ideal is to strive for freedom. We neither wish to be invaded by others, nor do we wish to invade others. We should respect freedom, make good use of freedom, to enhance the welfare of the nation and society, and promote world peace, so that human society becomes a paradise of freedom.

After this eight-year long war of resistance, having paid an extremely heavy price and abandoned the fruits of victory, we should seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for national construction, unite those with free-thinking ideals, and improve the current phenomena that violate freedom. Whether those who want to maintain the status quo or those who want to break the status quo, should awaken themselves and take the interests of the nation and the people as the premise, stand on the grand basis of peace, unity and solidarity, and build a prosperous, strong, healthy, democratic and free nation.

The Free Association has been officially established. In the future, the main task of the Association is to gather comrades who uphold freedom, to realize national freedom, political freedom, economic freedom, and freedom of thought. Through free discussion, peaceful and legal means, we will engage in academic research, current affairs reviews, and social service, uniting into a free and democratic force, establishing standards of public right and wrong, moving forward together on the path of freedom and democracy, so that everyone obtains joyful freedom. This is truly in accordance with the laws of nature, responsive to human sentiment, suited to the world trend, and meeting the needs of the people. We believe that our continuous efforts will achieve satisfactory results.

Telegram to the Government

A telegram to the government was also passed, stating: "To Chairman Jiang of the National Government: Considering the bitter struggle of the whole nation for eight years, and the Chairman's leadership of the masses with tireless diligence, seeking the freedom of the nation and establishing the country on independence, today light shines again, and the rivers and mountains are rebuilt. Therefore, the integrity of Northeast territory and sovereignty must be maintained. Regarding negotiations with the Soviet Union, no further concessions beyond the Sino-Soviet Treaty should be made, to complete the late Father of the Nation's legacy of freedom and equality, and establish a century-long foundation for national construction. Otherwise, fourteen years of tears and eight years of blood will be washed away, and the fruits of victory will be reduced to nothing. How can we face the martyrs above and our descendants below? This association is organized by people who love freedom, to fight for freedom and support democracy. Today, we are established. We send this telegram to appeal, respectfully requesting your wise consideration, and extending our highest respect to the Chairman. The Free Association kowtows."

Commercial News

### Gold, Banknotes, and Securities Simultaneously Decline: Gold Falls to 1.6 Million

Yesterday, gold suffered a drastic fall due to the crackdown on gold prices in Beijing and Tianjin. The rumor that a certain party was collecting gold gradually subsided. The morning opening price dropped to 1.72 million. It was also rumored that the authorities had ordered silversmiths to exchange their holdings at a rate of 140,000, causing it to drop to 1.6 million. The US dollar, due to large settlements from commercial ship imports, turned from weak to strong, which helped the market. Those who absorbed at low prices became more enthusiastic, and it gradually improved. At noon, a sudden rebound occurred, hovering around 1.75 million, a slight setback compared to last Saturday. In the afternoon, it showed slight weakness, asking prices were slightly lower, and trading became idle. Adornment gold still had no listed price. Fine silver was 2,000 yuan. The supply of silver dollars suddenly increased, once falling to the 900 yuan mark. Finally, 1,000 yuan was needed for supply, with a black market discount of 18 to 23 cents.

Foreign Currency: US dollars were extremely weak in the market, with eager settlement of low-priced imports, turning from flat to stable. The morning started with sales at 2,530 yuan, once dropping to 2,420 yuan. Thereafter, it was maintained by someone and gradually improved, once approaching the 2,600 yuan mark at noon before slightly receding. The result was similar to last Saturday. Hong Kong dollars declined and then entered a consolidation phase. The result was that old notes fell by ten yuan and new notes fell by fifteen yuan compared to last Saturday. This is because old notes have a legal value and can be transferred for cotton settlement.

Public bonds and Chinese and foreign stocks, because the guild has been established and has requested the bureau to set up an open market, the industry is waiting for legitimate development and lacks activity. There were no formal transactions, only a few transfers. Category C bonds fell to around 1,700 yuan, and others were also slightly affected.

Although operators of Chinese stocks have requested open trading, a notice from the Securities Exchange in the morning strictly prohibited off-site transactions during the exchange's closure. Public morale became more unsustainable. Wing On Textile opened at 2,400 yuan, American Asiatic at 2,000, and King Fook at 140 yuan. At noon, asking prices were even lower than yesterday, and private transactions were extremely limited.

Foreign stock trading became increasingly deserted. Stockholders were unwilling to sell at low prices, and stock seekers had difficulty finding suitable parties. As a result, prices were similar to yesterday, but the overall trend seemed to be more selling than buying, and the market was stable but soft.

### Rice and Flour Slightly Decline, Oil Prices Drop by 5,000 to 6,000 Yuan

Yesterday in the rice market, the supply from downstream rivers increased, and shopkeepers became less eager to stock up. Supply exceeded demand. White japonica rice sharply dropped by 2,000 yuan, and early thin paddy rice sharply dropped by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Du rice also slightly declined by more than 3,000 yuan. White yuan and foreign indica rice dropped by more than 2,000 yuan. The oil market continued to have supply from Qingdao, dropping another 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Flour continued to decline, slightly dropping by 500 to 600 yuan. Soybeans dropped again by around 2,000 yuan. Soybean cakes followed, slightly dropping by 300 yuan. Bran also slightly declined by 500 to 600 yuan. Only raw peanuts remained relatively strong. Due to softened morale, all grains declined in unison.

### New Keemun Tea Enters the Market: 215,000 per Package

The Keemun black tea produced in Anhui province is excellent in "color," "aroma," and "taste." During the enemy occupation, transportation was difficult. Although people in the industry tried to transfer and ship it to Shanghai, most of it was old stock that had been stored for many years, and the quality had deteriorated. After the restoration, transportation routes gradually returned to normal, so new Keemun tea could also be seen. Recently, nearly a hundred pieces have been sold by Zhenhe Tea Company, priced at 215,000 yuan per package, no different from before. However, due to variations in quality, there is a clear trend of tacit support. For other varieties, with new goods yet to arrive and old goods nearly exhausted, everyone is optimistic.

### Silk Trade Quiet

Yesterday, the silk market was uniformly weak. In the artificial silk market, the spot price for first and second grade goods from the Great Bridge brand was 2.25 million yuan for sales in the morning and 2.2 million yuan for purchases. In the afternoon, it was once 280,000 to 300,000 yuan, but it receded again, making the original price in the morning. Bank bills were not active. Raw silk was also weak. The transaction price for the top grade of five groups was 2.55 million yuan, about 50,000 yuan less than the previous day. Habutai remained stable. Silk fabrics declined along with raw materials, and transactions were quiet. American Asiatic quilt covers were 75,000 yuan lower than last weekend. Da Cheng crepe was slightly weaker by one hundred yuan. The selling prices of Hong Kang black and white crepe and Lin Ji wax feather gauze did not fluctuate much.

### Woolen Fabrics Sell Briskly to Merchants

Recently, the sales of woolen fabrics and wool textiles to merchants have been quite brisk. Merchants from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, North China, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Nanjing, Wuhu, and Hangzhou all want to buy goods. However, they are all limited to high-end fine wool goods, and both men's and women's colors are transacted. Eight or nine out of ten choose domestic factory products, especially the brands of Zhanghua, Yinfeng, and Xiexin.

### Yarn and Cotton Cloth Turn Weak; Spinning and Weaving Sales Also Slightly Lower

Yesterday, the yarn market was fairly stable, and its process was similar to the weak-at-first-and-strong-at-last trend of last Saturday. In the morning, morale was very weak, and 16-count Guangming yarn once dropped to 930,000 yuan. Subsequently, as competitors bought in succession, the price rose again, closing at 1.02 million yuan at 12 o'clock, the high price of the day. All other counts of yarn, both coarse and fine, first fell and then rebounded. The result was not much different from last weekend, and the trend can be described as stable with a slight upturn. Yesterday was the regular yarn selling period for the Spinning and Weaving Company, and the price was tens of thousands lower than the previous period. 42-count double-strand Xiantao yarn was already available for sale. It is expected that the demand for double-strand yarn this week may be slightly suppressed as a result.

Yesterday, spot cotton transactions became more brisk. The Spinning and Weaving Company continued to purchase heavily, purchasing 500 to 600 pieces of US cotton 42-count raw material middling, 200 pieces of Dazhong collection cotton, and 200 pieces of Sanyu town cotton. All of them were factory delivery prices. Cotton dealers traded 100 to 200 loads of Zhoupu seed cotton. In addition, private yarn mills are still waiting and seeing, and have not taken action. The price increased by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.

Cotton cloth trading was sparse. Merchants sold when prices were high, and medium-grade cotton cloth fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The desire to raise the price of colored cloth was weak. The cost of dyed goods, with fuel prices rising steadily, accounted for most of the factory prices quoted previously. Coal is inconvenient to transport, and dyeing and weaving factories cannot reduce costs.

### Timber Stable but Soft

Yesterday's timber market was stable but soft. Market prices varied, and most sellers, seeing that financial commodity prices had fallen, were quite disheartened and sold secretly. However, some still refused to sell and continued to be optimistic.

### Fuel Market in Great Chaos

Coal Prices Rise Endlessly, Fuelwood and Charcoal Are Similarly Driven Higher

Coal: Since the beginning of this month, the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee ordered that merchants must obtain approval from the committee to purchase and transport coal from other ports, and may not handle it privately, the amount of coal arriving in Shanghai has sharply decreased. Everything depends on maintaining a small amount of stock. Therefore, the owner's asking price is endless, and the offer price is difficult to approach, and there are few formal transactions.

Fuelwood and Charcoal: Due to the sharp rise in coal prices, sales gradually expanded, and some fuelwood and charcoal operators took the opportunity to raise prices, and the market quickly advanced. Huangyan steel charcoal was transacted at a high price of 10,500 yuan per load. Hexi Jiang charcoal was 9,500 yuan, and Louzi Hangzhou charcoal was 8,500 yuan. Chestnut fuelwood was even scarcer. Miscellaneous fuelwood was 2,900 yuan, and pine fuelwood was 2,600 yuan. There were a few boats of split tree fuelwood, priced at 120 yuan, 150 yuan, and 180 yuan per tree, with each tree weighing four to five or six pounds.

### Suppression of Speculative Trading

Securities Exchange Issues Notice

The center of the speculative market in this city, the Securities Building, was repeatedly suppressed by the Financial Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance stationed in Shanghai, together with the police department, and the telephones of various companies were dismantled. This speculative market has virtually stopped. Now the Chinese Securities Exchange has received an instruction from the commissioner's office, reiterating the ban and instructing the various speculative companies to take suppression measures separately. The exchange's chairman Du [name redacted] has issued a notice, which is briefly excerpted as follows:

"Case received from the Shanghai Financial Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance stationed in Beijing and Shanghai, Shanghai Finance Special No. 4534, which states: 'Article 7 of the Regulations on the Handling of Exchanges in the Beijing-Shanghai Area stipulates that "During the liquidation period, exchanges may not engage in any further trading activities (omitted below)". Subsequently, it was reported that within the Chinese Securities Exchange Building in this city, various brokers and securities companies were still buying and selling, manipulating speculation, etc. on gold, foreign exchange, and securities on behalf of customers. Personnel were immediately dispatched to suppress and inspect the account books. The results of the inspection are listed in the following sections: (1) Confirmed that they are still buying and selling gold securities on behalf of customers. A total of 81 companies submitted account books for inspection. (2) Confirmed that they are still buying and selling on behalf of customers, but refused inspection or concealed account books, 31 companies. (3) No responsible personnel in the room, unable to inquire, 5 companies. (4) 8 companies that have ceased operations or have not yet opened. (5) 11 other companies. Currently, although these companies have temporarily disappeared, it is feared that they will become playful over time and will inevitably become active again. In order to thoroughly suppress speculative manipulation, in addition to requesting the Shanghai Municipal Government to remove all telephone lines from the securities companies in the Securities Building, and the police station to send personnel to patrol and strictly prohibit, before the exchange is allowed to resume business, each firm and each broker (including other firms) must be strictly prohibited from engaging in any speculative trading activities. (1) Those who refuse inspection or conceal account books, (2) Personnel have fled and cannot be inquired, (3) Each firm that does sell or buy for clients, should be ordered to cease operations, and to summon those firms’ leaders who refused to inspection or concealed account books and leaders who have fled, severely reprimand them, and also tell them to clarify the reason, for later verification. It is imperative to follow these orders separately and report." Therefore, in addition to complying with the orders separately, this is to notify the public, and all lessees of this building must strictly abide by them, and must not violate them, and this is a special notice."

### Recent Conditions of Various Schools in the Capital After the Winter Vacation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch] Schools in the capital that did not have a winter vacation, such as the Preparatory Classes of National Lin Da University, preparatory courses, and National Temporary Middle Schools Numbers 1, 2, and 3, have continued classes until now. Furthermore, the Nanjing Youth Training Institute, which houses 400 war-displaced youths, also did not have a winter vacation; they are studying major high school and junior high school courses and undergoing training. It is heard that this youth training institute will soon be converted into a middle school advancement program to foster talent on a grand scale. Municipal elementary and secondary schools and private schools, which held entrance exams or enrolled transfer students during the winter vacation, all began classes on the 22nd. Middle schools were scheduled to begin classes on the 27th, and elementary schools a day earlier. In the last semester, after the victory of the war of resistance, there were personnel changes in various schools, and students' textbooks were not entirely uniform. This term, all schools have uniformly adopted the textbooks approved by the Ministry of Education and jointly printed by Seven Publishers. Regarding municipal schools, some middle schools used the winter vacation exam results as a screening test. For example, at Municipal Middle School No. 1, over one hundred students were expelled or demoted. At the Municipal Women's Vocational High School, the number of students held back or expelled was also significant. Henceforth, as educational standards improve, students should study especially hard. Moreover, there are only just over sixty elementary schools in the entire city. The original number of school-age children was already high, and with the return to the capital and the repatriation of residents, the number is gradually increasing. It is heard that the municipal elementary schools have as many as eighty students per class, and still cannot accommodate everyone. Many parents sigh with regret that they cannot find places for their children to study, and it is necessary to find ways to expand the schools. (Foolish)

### Education Bureau Orders Each Municipal School to Quickly Promote People's Education

As for the expenses for jointly running people's schools, starting this month, a temporary subsidy of 5,500 national currency will be provided for each class.

### Brief Reports

Xu Songming, the president of National Tongji University, took a plane to Shanghai on the 14th of this month regarding the school relocation. He is currently discussing the issue of school buildings with relevant parties and actively promoting the move. It is hoped that results will be obtained soon. The time for the entire school to relocate to Shanghai is estimated to be in the summer of this year. The previous rumor that Xu Songming would go to the Northeast did not materialize.

Ms. Wang Xiaoying, the founder and president of China Women's Middle School in this city, arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong a month ago and is actively promoting the reopening of the school. It is scheduled to reopen classes at the original site on Lin Yin Road, South Shanghai, on the 25th of this month.

### This Week's Football Schedule Announced, Mayor's Cup Enters the Quarterfinals, Qingbai Meets Longjie, Donghua Meets Soviet Union

This week's football schedule was announced in the association's tenth notice. In addition to the four league games in the B and C groups, the A group is suspended, and the Mayor's Cup quarterfinals begin.

### Shan Team's Main Player Absent, Suffers at the Hands of Giants

Green Forest Barely Beats Renyu by One Point

Yesterday, the atmosphere inside the basketball hall was feverish, with no fewer than three thousand spectators, making it a grand occasion. All matches proceeded smoothly.

In the first match, the Green team of female soldiers, with its elite force and determination to win, faced the V team, which had previously resisted the Green team forcefully. The Green team repeatedly scored in difficult situations. In the first half, the Green team led 11-5. In the second half, the Green team gradually developed its advantage and won 30-12 at the end of the match.

Next was the match between Green Forest and Renyu in the second division of Group A. Each team gave its all, as the outcome was related to the future of the championship. After the start of the match, the score fluctuated, with the difference constantly within one point. In the first half, Green Forest maintained a 18-17 lead. In the second half, Green Forest came out strong and took a 30-23 lead in an instant. Renyu called a timeout. The score narrowed again, 37-35, the atmosphere was tense beyond compare. Finally, with Chen Weiyuan's free throw, time expired, and Green Forest narrowly defeated Renyu 37-36. From then on, Green Forest, Renyu, Red Team, and Desheng all had a record of one loss, creating a complicated situation.

In the final match, the Oil team faced the Giants in the first division of Group A. Unfortunately, the former's main player, Ma Canxi, had left Shanghai, and the entire team lost its soul. However, in the first half, they tried to rally. Chen Qingjiang and Lin Weicong's small passes made the Giants feel helpless. Therefore, in the first half, the Shan team was still able to take a one-point lead, 21-19. After switching sides, the Giants frequently substituted fresh troops, and the Shan team was already showing signs of fatigue. Therefore, they allowed the Giants to do as they pleased. Carson's excellent shooting was also frightening. As a result, the Giants scored 39 points, and the Shan team scored 29 points. The Shan team suffered at the hands of the Giants.

Science

### Ten Major Scientific Events of 1945

— Mu Wu

The American Scientific Society recently selected the ten most important new inventions or advances in the scientific community in 1945, as follows:

(1) The atomic bomb – broadly speaking, the successful release and practical application of atomic nuclear energy.

(2) The discovery and verification of transuranic elements, i.e., elements with atomic numbers 93, 94, 95, and 96.

(3) The application of the new drug "Streptomycin."

(4) "Variable Time Fuse," or VT fuse, the "inexpensive computer" for artillery shells and bombs, which can automatically detonate near the target. (Manufactured by the U.S. Army and Navy Departments)

(5) "Loran," a nautical aid invented based on timed radio signals.

(6) The success of psychological warfare, which accelerated Japan's surrender.

(7) The British invention of arsenic antidote Bal, with great efficacy.

(8) Rodenticides 1080 and "Antu"

(9) The successful Soviet transplantation of warm-blooded animal hearts.

(10) The establishment of the National Science Foundation (United States).

There is a notable omission above, namely radar. The secret of radar was released by the U.S. military authorities in mid-August last year, and it can certainly be said to be a major invention of 1945. It is inappropriate not to include it in the table above. The special emphasis on other things, such as psychological warfare, also raises suspicions. We hope that this table can be rearranged more fairly.

### I Still Want to Write, Write...

—

I myself don't understand how I started writing; and the most energetic stage of writing was the year I left school, confined myself to home, and had nothing to do.

At that time, my home was in the bustling commercial center of the city – the Nanjing Road area. Moreover, my father was in business, and the area around my residence was noisy all day long: bustling and clamoring, making it impossible to "hold a pen" and "form a chapter" on the manuscript paper – it was really terrible!

Heaven knows! My "writing" was fundamentally "clueless," yet I learned the style of old writers: every night, I always wrote, wrote, wrote, until dawn, when the sound of emptying the chamber pot echoed through the alleyways... I was still sitting awkwardly under the dim light, writing, writing...

For several months in a row, I slept late and rose late, spending the day as night and the night as day, and I had become pale and thin, not looking like a human being anymore.

"Hey, you really don't have to! I don't see any benefit in you writing until late at night every day. I've never seen you make much money from writing; I think you shouldn't write anymore, it'll ruin your health!...Alas! Are you doing this for fame or for profit?" One night, my mother woke up and gave me this "advice."

This time, I was really stunned and couldn't say a word in response; but, from then on, a big question mark hovered in my mind, which was: what's the use of writing?

If I said I was learning to write for "fame," my "articles" were often discarded in the "wastepaper basket" by the editors of the supplements, with no opportunity to be published, so how could I talk about "fame"? If I said it was for "profit," that was even more pitiful, because even if an "article" was published in the newspaper, the resulting manuscript fee, when calculated at the end of the month, was only two or three dollars. However, the cost of postage, envelopes, manuscript paper, cigarettes, electricity, tea...etc., that I spent on writing was definitely not something that these few manuscript fees could offset. But I still refused to listen to my mother's words, and continued to write, write, write, without being able to say exactly why, what was it for after all?

Soon, the question of "what's the use of writing" was finally answered. That was: several years ago, unable to bear the oppression of the puppet regime, I ran to the inland, eager to breathe the air of freedom, and it was precisely the time when the slogans of "writing going to the countryside" and "writing enlisting in the army" were resounding.

Yes, in the countryside, I saw many "street poems" encouraging the people to bravely kill the enemy, and "popular literature and art" depicting the soldiers on the front lines fighting bloody battles. I also saw in the troops the performances of many plays educating the soldiers, and the popularization of in-depth and easy-to-understand heroic stories of the War of Resistance. And the common people and soldiers, spiritually infected by these articles, were willing to sacrifice themselves for the nation and the country... to die for righteousness, and there were examples of this everywhere.

The function of writing, although seemingly unable to surpass cannons and machine guns, has exerted enormous firepower at least in the sense of educating and encouraging the people! So it is called a throwing spear and a dagger, isn't that what it means?

Originally, writing is not a tool for "gaining fame," nor is it like a commodity to be sold in the market. Its ultimate purpose is to guide this group of miserable human beings into the ideal realm of truth, goodness, and beauty.

The reason why I can live happily today is indeed because I have been infected by the works of those writers who "eat straw" and "squeeze out milk," works filled with enthusiasm for humanity, and understand how to do good and love others. So even if my articles are often accompanied by the editor's "wastepaper basket," I have already understood the meaning of writing, and I still want to write, write... (Que Chou)

### Three "Threes" in Nanchang

— Jiang Zhaoran

Three famines: first, a rice famine, with those starved to death already "having bodies lying everywhere"; second, a house famine, which led to the slogan "a piece of tile is a piece of gold"; third, newspaper offices are experiencing a paper famine, and the people running the newspapers say: "Is Luoyang paper expensive? Is Nanchang paper expensive?" Hearing this really makes people laugh and cry.

Too many: first, too many pickpockets, one must be vigilant against flying hands at any time and place; second, too many teahouses, because the number of those who "think of drinking when hungry" is countless; third, too many devout men and women, they say: "It's going to be terrible if we don't worship Buddha anymore!"

Three wonders: some people often treat Japanese prisoners to lavish meals, but say to the beggars who come to ask for leftover scraps: "Get out, you motherfucker!" This is the first wonder; theaters often have disputes and stage real tragedies, and movie theaters are dilapidated and about to collapse, but the audience is still packed "looking askance" and "listening intently." This is the second wonder; some people spend 15,000 yuan in legal tender for a haircut, while others post notices looking for their children, but write: "My home is as empty as a suspended chime stone, if you find the child and bring him back, I can only thank you from the bottom of my heart!" This is the third wonder.

Three famines, too many, three wonders, adding up to three "threes." The ancients had "three immortalities," but I hope that Nanchang's three "threes" are just "昙花一现" [a flash in the pan], and not "immortal"!

Education

### Reviving Hygiene Education

— Li Renzhong

From the War of Resistance to the present victory, the original hygiene courses in ordinary elementary schools and higher elementary schools have been abandoned, as if they are not very important.

Our country has long been known as the "Sick Man of East Asia." In the eight years of the War of Resistance, soldiers and civilians have sacrificed, soldiers have died of starvation and disease, and epidemics have spread. The health of the people is far worse than before the war. To save this great disaster, we must rely on direct and indirect relief from medicine and hygiene. However, hygiene education in elementary schools should be vigorously promoted to instill considerable hygienic knowledge and enable students to have a preliminary understanding of disease prevention!

Recently, our school in Shanghai purchased elementary school textbooks. We inquired at various bookstores, but there were no hygiene textbooks. We hope that the authorities will vigorously promote and urge private schools in each city to uniformly adopt hygiene textbooks to increase the health of the Chinese people. This is also the way to strengthen the country and the race. We hope that in this way, one day we can wash away the shame of being the "Sick Man of East Asia."

### My Own Words

— Fei Ying

If clothing, food, housing, and transportation are not resolved in order, the storms in the heart will not cease!

If I could die and be reborn, I would rather die immediately!

Spiritual emptiness is the most terrible disease!

Those who cannot create are already dead!

The happiest thing in life is having new creations; the happiest time is the memory of struggling to success in hardship!

The most painful person in the world is a blind man whose eyes are covered!

Dreams are the flowers of ideals, and may also be pictures of sin!

When I am lost, I feel that the "sky is vast and the sea is wide"!

Luck is also a kind of failure!

### Who are the Poor?

— Yang Mou

Seeing the winding lines of people scrambling to buy low-priced sugar and kerosene... I can't help but feel a little alarmed. The war has long since passed, but its footprints, its shadows, still control us, plunging people who are used to comfortable lives into the panic of scarcity of materials and soaring prices.

Reading newspaper reports of the work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, I know that it has been going on for a long time. As the name suggests, it should of course be of great help to the poor.

So I thought of something else: outside the office window is the Industrial and Commercial Registration Office of the Social Affairs Bureau, which has been making a great profit these days. Upon inquiry, it turns out that they are all pancake vendors, because they have received this registration certificate and can purchase flour from UNRRA. In a single turnover, the profit is substantial, so no wonder they flock to it like ducks to water. However, the pancake is still the same size, the same quality, and the selling price is even more expensive.

Those who should be relieved, those who have the right and the qualifications to enjoy bargain prices, are holding their stomachs and gritting their teeth, teaching, working as minor civil servants, or working as small clerks in shops. But they have to pay high prices to buy expensive pancakes, to buy "bargain products" that have been resold from the hands of idle and crowded people.

Who are the poor? Who are the real poor? If the target is wrong, the whole thing is wrong.

### Social Services: UNRRA Should Ration and Sell Flour Equally According to Household Size

So That Ordinary People Can Generally Buy and Get Real Benefits

Dear Editor: According to the newspaper, UNRRA is selling flour at low prices without restriction. This will naturally be enough to stabilize the current soaring food prices! But in order to be more reasonable and more universal, I think it should be rationed equally according to household size to be reasonable. In the past, the distribution system of goods under the puppet regime gave some impetus to each price fluctuation. The system of the puppet regime is certainly not good. But the rationing method is indeed not bad, and it may be worth imitating. Now that the household registration has been investigated, if it can be rationed equally according to household size, not only will ordinary people be able to buy generally and get real benefits, but the stimulation to prices will naturally be greater! Moreover, it can also provide some help to the work of investigating household registration. I wonder what the authorities think? Please publish this for the sake of good fortune. Yours sincerely, Longchuan Fisherman Another reader wrote a letter requesting improvement of the bargain sale method, saying: Dear Editor: You are a good gentleman serving us citizens, and we are really grateful. But because we citizens are suffering too much, we have no choice but to trouble you. I am a person who works in a state agency. My salary is not enough to buy two shi of rice. In this time of rising living costs, how can I support my family of three? Yesterday, I saw in your newspaper that UNRRA's important and urgent measures were to sell flour without restriction. This is such a heartwarming good news. It said that anyone can buy, but each unit is a total of twenty bags. Is this something we can apply for? We are a small family and only need one or two bags a month, we don't need so many. Furthermore, with a unit of twenty bags, our monthly income is less than 50,000 yuan, how can we have so much money to buy it? Therefore, I earnestly request the UNRRA authorities to consider the convenience of us citizens, improve the distribution method, so that every commoner's family can buy low-priced flour and all daily necessities. This is such a fair and convenient thing. Reader Jian Bai
