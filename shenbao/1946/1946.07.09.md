### Five-Person Talks in De Facto Stagnation, Overall Domestic Situation Increasingly Depressed; China Lodges Protest Against Convening of National Assembly; Zhou Enlai Meets with Marshall Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The Five-Person Talks adjourned again today, and the political atmosphere in the capital was as dull as yesterday. According to a certain authoritative observer who told this reporter, the results of the Five-Person Talks failed to promote the resolution of pending issues, which was regretted by all parties. Therefore, there may be changes in the format of the talks. Based on various signs observed yesterday and today, a new format of talks is being brewed.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Regarding the results of the Five-Person Talks on the evening of the 6th, in addition to Shao Lizi reporting to Chairman Chiang on the government side, the CCP side reported to Yan'an, but no response has been received. Before new instructions are received from both sides, the talks will naturally be difficult to continue. Tonight, the CCP side stated that due to the lack of results from the Five-Person Talks, the Three-Person Conference may reopen, but the time and location of the reopening are still undetermined.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] At 4:00 PM today, Zhou Enlai visited Marshall. The content of the conversation included approximately two points: firstly, the study of the format of the negotiations, because based on the past lack of results from direct three-party talks, it was believed that there was a need to change the format of the negotiations. At the same time, he reported on the progress of the second round of talks and the focus of the disputes between the two sides. Secondly, discussions on mediating the conflict in the Central Plains. The CCP side stated, "If the ceasefire does not occur, Li Xiannian may seek other paths to 'fight for survival'," the implication being quite noteworthy.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Luo Longji, Minister of Propaganda of the Democratic League, visited Zhou Enlai this afternoon and then visited Marshall.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] After the Central Plains Communist Army Li Xiannian's unit withdrew westward from Xuanhuadian, the CCP delegation actually submitted a memorandum of protest to the Military Three-Person Group and handed it over to Marshall.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Regarding the government's scheduled convening of the National Assembly, the CCP delegation lodged a strong protest to the government representatives and Chairman Chiang on the 7th, including the statement: "Our side solemnly declares to your side that regarding the National Assembly issues, before an agreement is reached, our side will not be bound by any unilateral decisions made by your side. Our side also insists on the rapid opening of the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group to discuss the National Assembly and related issues. If your side continues to refuse and disputes arise as a result, the responsibility should be borne by your side."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The "July 7th" declaration issued by the CCP side yesterday has been translated into English by the government side and forwarded to Marshall by Yu Dawei, and the Chinese manuscript has been sent to General He Yingqin to serve as the basis for discussions. It is reported that Marshall's residence held an internal meeting this morning to possibly study the CCP's declaration.

### Du Yuming-Lin Biao Changchun Talks to be Local Negotiations; Everything Still Depends on Nanjing Consultation

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 8th] The situation in the Northeast seems to be showing a glimmer of hope due to the scheduled meeting between Du Yuming and Lin Biao, and some people may have even greater hopes. However, according to opinions from various sources, everything still depends on consultations in Nanjing. At the same time, the Communist army is actively deploying during the ceasefire period and has now completed its expected work in various places. In addition, the international situation makes it difficult to be optimistic, and the atmosphere of tension may become more pronounced.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 8th] The meeting between Du Yuming and Lin Biao on Friday was promoted by the sincerity of Dai Boer. Although news reporters attach great importance to this dramatic news, powerful figures here have no concrete expectations for what kind of results the Du-Lin meeting will achieve. One influential figure told the reporter, "What five-star marshals cannot solve, one-star officers cannot solve either." The person in charge denied that the Changchun talks would discuss the takeover of Harbin, saying that big problems cannot be solved without solving the small ones. It is reported that Dai Boer once talked about the origin of his efforts to promote the Du-Lin meeting, saying, "Commanders of both sides often cannot implement the orders of their subordinates. Now let them talk to each other." If this is true, it is also a local meeting for direct negotiations in Nanjing.

### Ridiculous Rumor

Claim that National Army Planes Flew to Yan'an is Absolutely Impossible

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 8th] The World Daily reported on the 7th that nine National Army planes flew to Yan'an on the 5th. After the reporter inquired with various parties, Wang Shuming, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, stated that after contacting Nanjing, it was proven that this news was completely unfounded because Yan'an has no nighttime landing equipment. He also stated that this news was insulting to the Air Force and would be protested. The CCP side of the Military Mediation Department showed its Xinhua News Agency Yan'an telegram, which stated that Captain Liu Shanben, the pilot of the 35th Squadron of the 8th Brigade of the Central Aviation Brigade, and ten others, flew a B-24 aircraft numbered 530 from Chengdu on the 26th of last month and arrived at the Yan'an airfield at 3:00 PM, but the names of the ten people other than Liu Shanben were not announced. It was also said that on the 20th, all circles in Yan'an held a meeting to welcome them, and Mao Zedong and Zhu De both attended.

### President Song Talks Freely About Financial and Economic Matters at a Press Conference with Chinese and Foreign Reporters

Remedial Measures for Export Trade Under Consideration; Government Emphasizes Both State-Owned and Private Enterprises

[Our Report] Since the reorganization of the government, issues ranging from sugar consolidation, grain loans, import and export, state-owned enterprises, to foreign merchants navigating inland rivers, participating in peace conferences, war reparations, and civil servant treatment were extensively discussed at the press conference held by President Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan yesterday morning for one hour and fifteen minutes. The speakers were calm, enthusiastic, and passionate, and the atmosphere of the meeting was harmonious, setting a new record for press conferences. This large-scale press conference held by Mr. Song for domestic reporters was his second in Shanghai since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. In addition to Mr. Song, those present included Mayor Wu Guozhen, Minister Peng Xuepei, and more than 40 reporters from various newspapers. The key points of Mr. Song's answers to various questions are briefly recorded below:

(1) Reorganization of the Government: The central government did not intend not to reorganize the government before the National Assembly. If necessary, the government can be reorganized at any time.

(2) Grain Loans: A. The government's grain loans were purely based on the people's demands, and the original intention was very good. B. If there are any malpractices by grain officials, they will be dealt with severely. C. If any current officials participate in the Yangtze River Fuzhong and other companies, even one penny, they should be dealt with severely.

(3) Taiwan Sugar Company: The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry have been ordered to thoroughly investigate. If there is any impropriety, it will be immediately revoked and publicly announced. (Please refer to the Economic Section for this matter.)

(4) Participating in Peace Conferences: Our country is recognized as one of the five major powers, which is recognized by various countries themselves, not requested by us. If we cannot participate as an invited country, our people will deeply regret it.

(5) War Damage Compensation: Japanese public opinion also admits that China should account for 70% of all Japanese reparations, and other countries should account for 30% in total because China suffered the most damage. In the future, we will definitely be able to obtain the largest amount of compensation at the peace conference with Japan.

(6) Export Trade: Low-interest loans will be issued by the Central Bank, and other remedial measures are also under consideration.

(7) Legal Tender Black Market: The government is discussing countermeasures with the American advisor of the Ministry of Finance.

(8) State-Owned Enterprises: The government has no intention of competing with the people for profit. Therefore, the term of establishment for each state-owned company is two years. This is a transitional measure, but the government has no obligation to allow a few people to obtain exorbitant profits. Currently, the China Textile Company has made considerable contributions to finance.

(9) Prices and Currency: If domestic peace and unity can be truly achieved, currency issuance can be stopped in a very short period of time. Regarding this issue, the Minister of Finance was invited to Shanghai the other day to jointly study with the President of the Central Bank. As for loans from the United States, they are still under negotiation and have not yet reached the stage of announcement.

(10) Shipping: State-owned and private enterprises are treated equally. The Minsheng Company's ships in Canada are guaranteed by the government, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also has a day of being privately owned. Opening the four ports of the Yangtze River is an expedient measure to remedy the lack of ships. I have made the greatest efforts to strive for sovereignty and will never do anything to sell it out.

(11) Grain Requisition: Grain requisition is an important measure to control food and stabilize grain prices. The Ministry of Food can answer questions about the details.

(12) Civil Servant Treatment: Responsible officials from Chairman Chiang downwards are almost always seeking countermeasures and planning to gradually restore the pre-war living standards, but the conclusion depends on the domestic and foreign situation.

(13) Investigation and Reception: I extremely welcome the investigation teams organized by the three agencies of the Control Yuan to conduct separate investigations. The work of receiving enemy and puppet industries is very difficult and was initially very chaotic. Liu Gongwu in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui area is exceptionally honest and conscientious. I did not know Qi Yueqi in the Beiping-Tianjin area and Lin Ziyin in the Guangdong area before, but I cannot guarantee whether their subordinates are honest. If there are any mistakes, I will definitely not be lenient.

After Mr. Song resigned amidst applause, Minister Peng of the Ministry of Propaganda continued to answer reporters' questions. Mr. Peng first said that the details of the government's negotiations with the Communist Party could not be fully disclosed for fear of affecting the progress of the negotiations between the two sides and making special envoy Marshall feel difficult. In short, what the government values most at present is troop reorganization and determining troop garrison locations. If these two points are not determined, then everything will be empty talk. In addition, there are the following points: (1) The sovereignty of the Northeast must be truly restored. (2) Transportation between Guan Nei (inside the Great Wall) and the Northeast must be smooth and unobstructed. Therefore, the security and order along the Beining Road, including the eastern part of Rehe, must be effectively guaranteed. (3) The railways and coal mines in Shandong must be quickly restored and their security ensured. The areas occupied by the Communist Army in violation of orders after June 7 must be immediately evacuated. (4) The return of refugees from northern Jiangsu is imperative.

### The Communist "July 7th" Declaration is Incomprehensible; Convening the National Assembly is to Implement Constitutional Government; Minister Peng Issues a Statement to Foreign Reporters

At 4:00 PM, Mr. Song, Mr. Peng, and Mayor Wu also received foreign reporters and answered various questions separately.

President Song said:

(1) Regarding anti-American propaganda, the general public in China is very grateful to the United States for all the assistance it has given to China. However, the Communist Party has a lot of aversion to the current policy of the United States. The government cannot interfere with the actions of the Communist Party.

Regarding the food issue, the general situation of this year's autumn harvest is still good, and it is expected that the food problem across the country will gradually improve within two months. The price of rice in Sichuan Province has fallen to more than 20,000 yuan. If there is a way to transport and distribute it, grain prices in various places may also gradually decline.

After President Song finished his speech, Minister Peng gave a speech on the issue of the Communist Party:

(1) The conclusion of a complete cessation of conflict lies in the reorganization of vehicles and the determination of military garrison areas. If these two issues cannot be resolved concretely, then conflicts between the troops of both sides may be inevitable.

(2) Regarding the Communist Party's request to reopen the Political Consultative Conference, Minister Peng said: The Political Consultative Conference was convened before April, and agreements were reached on various issues. However, in the past April, the Communist Party has repeatedly violated various agreements, such as: (A) forcibly occupying the Northeast; (B) delaying the submission of the list of members of the National Government Committee; (C) also delaying the submission of the list of the number and commanders of the Communist Army on various pretexts.

(3) The government decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12, and its intention is to bring the period of political tutelage to an end and allow constitutional government to begin. However, although the Communist Party emphasized "reorganizing the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang" in its "July 7th" declaration, it also declared that the Communist Party would not be bound by the National Assembly date determined by the government, and its intention is quite incomprehensible. However, the government has always hoped that the Communist Party can cooperate in a spirit of cooperation to jointly seek the implementation of constitutional government.

(4) The Communist Party's "July 7th" declaration has many attacks on the policy of the US government. The current so-called "anti-American movement" has attracted much attention from all walks of life in the United States. However, after consulting the Communist Party's "July 7th" declaration, it should not be difficult to guess who initiated this anti-American propaganda.

President Song delivered a speech at the press conference. (Photo by China News Agency)

### Sympathy for the People of the Recovered Areas in Cultivating Wasteland: This Year's Rent and Tax Exemptions; The Executive Yuan Has Notified All Localities

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The central authorities, in order to show sympathy for the farmers in the recovered areas, previously issued an order to exempt farmland tax in the recovered areas for one year in the 34th year of the Republic.

### The Fifteen Public Organizations of Shanghai City Give a Farewell to General He Yingqin; Chairman of the Assembly, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Delivers a Farewell Speech; Mr. He's Mission is Important and He Will Surely Bring Glory to the Country

[Our Dispatch] General He Yingqin, head of the Chinese delegation to the Military Staff Committee of the United Nations Security Council and head of the Chinese Military Representative Delegation to the United States, is scheduled to depart for the United States on the 11th of this month. Yesterday at 7:00 p.m., the city's Provisional Council, Local Association, Chamber of Commerce, Industrial Association, Bankers Association, General Labor Union, Municipal Education Association, Journalists Association, Newspaper Association, Municipal Farmers Association, Women's Association, Lawyers Association, Accountants Association, National Diplomacy Association, and the Catholic Public Association, totaling fifteen public organizations, jointly held a grand farewell party on the 14th floor of the International Hotel. Mayor Wu Guozhen, former Mayor Qian Dajun, Commander Xuan Tiewu, bureau chiefs, and Central Committee members residing in Shanghai, including Li Shizeng, Peng Xuepei, Huang Shaohong, and Li Hanhun, were invited to accompany them. Hosts Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Cangbo, Xu Ji, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Xi Yushu, Feng Youzhen, Zhou Feicheng, Zhou Xuexiang, and others, as well as directors and supervisors of organizations, totaling about two hundred people, attended. The assembly adjourned at around 10:00 p.m.

Mr. Pan Gongzhan's Farewell Address

The assembly began with Chairman Pan Gongzhan, on behalf of the public organizations, presenting a commemorative album with the signatures of all members to General He and delivering a farewell speech. He briefly stated: Today, the fifteen public organizations of Shanghai represent the 3.5 million citizens of the city in bidding farewell to Chief He as he is sent abroad on a mission. We are honored that Chief He has taken time out of his busy schedule to grace us with his presence, allowing us to express our respect to him. The citizens of Shanghai have long admired Chief He's past achievements, which need no further elaboration. In his early years, Chief He dedicated himself to the revolution, first following the Father of the Nation and then the President, serving the country by assisting in the founding of the military academy in Guangdong and then leading the Northern Expedition, up to the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan. He planned strategies in the headquarters and won battles on the battlefield. After the victory, he was ordered to preside over the surrender and completed his mission in a very short time. Most recently, he is admired by our compatriots for establishing the Ministry of National Defense due to the unification of the central military organization and issuing a "Letter to All Soldiers of the Nation," leading by example, expressing humility, and leading meritorious soldiers to complete the task of reducing the army, creating a new atmosphere in the Chinese military. Now, Chief He has another important mission to represent China in the Military Staff Committee of the United Nations Security Council as the head of the delegation and also serve as the head of the Chinese Military Representative Delegation to the United States, which will depart soon. China is now one of the five powers, and its actions are closely related to those of other countries around the world. Cooperation with allies, especially with the United States, must be further strengthened to ensure collective world security. His mission is arduous, and with Chief He's history and expectations, he is the most suitable talent to be the head of the Chinese delegation. We firmly believe that he will be able to complete his mission and bring glory to the country. All the citizens of Shanghai respectfully anticipate Chief He's success.

Mr. He Yingqin's Reply

Then, General He Yingqin stood up and gave a reply, briefly stating: Today, I am deeply grateful for the farewell given by the fifteen public organizations of Shanghai. Recalling entering the Whampoa Military Academy in the 13th year of the Republic, following the Chairman, and then following the Chairman in the Northern Expedition and then the War of Resistance against Japan, it has been more than twenty years. During this time, I have mainly been engaged in military work, and fortunately, I have been able to complete many difficult and important tasks. This is truly due to the leadership and guidance of the supreme leader and the concerted efforts of party, government, and military comrades, staff, and local people. This trip to the United States has two major tasks: (1) to cooperate with the international community, and (2) to promote military cooperation and connection between China and the United States. I am aware that the relationship is important and the task is arduous. Entrusted with the mission of the Chairman and the expectations of all sectors of society, my talent and ability are limited, and I hope that everyone will give guidance at any time. Shanghai is one of the largest cities in the world and the economic and cultural center of China. The prosperity of Shanghai can affect the whole country. When I came to Shanghai for the first time after the Japanese surrender last year, I felt that Shanghai had built a lot in the past, and its prosperity was all within the former concession area. Now that the concessions have been recovered and extraterritoriality has been abolished, the good scale should be preserved and further developed, and the bad habits of the past should be eliminated. Recently, the luxurious and extravagant phenomena in Shanghai should be improved, and efforts should be concentrated on developing production industries. Other aspects, such as transportation, security, education, and hygiene, should also be continuously improved. Although things are very ordinary, I hope that citizens can recognize their importance, and I hope that all advanced sectors will cooperate with the government, work together, conduct planned progress, lead the people, and assist the government in building a new Shanghai. When I come back in the future, I deeply hope that Shanghai will be more advanced than it is now. After the speech, he raised his glass and wished the Chairman health and the local leaders of Shanghai health.

Finally, Li Shizeng also, according to He's intention, hoped that the people and the government would fully cooperate, and then international cooperation and world peace could be achieved. He also said that President Chiang and his wife are planning to convene a joint conference of international collective cooperation organizations in China in three years, the same as the one held in the United States before, and hoped that Chief He would introduce the advantages of this kind of conference to China. General He left at 8:00 p.m. due to another appointment.

### Difficulties in Blocking the Yellow River; A Terrible Disaster May Reoccur

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The Yellow River blocking project cannot be expected to be completed due to repeated obstruction by the Communist army, delaying it for as long as two months. Now the water level of the Yellow River is gradually rising, and the breach at Huayuankou has turbulent water, making the blocking project extremely difficult. The iron bridge of the Haizhou-Tie Road in the territory of Zhongmou County was destroyed two weeks ago, and the river water has already overflowed. If the breach cannot be blocked before the autumn floods, the tragedy of the breach in the summer of the 27th year of the Republic in the Zhengzhou-Kaifeng area will be replayed today.

### Sino-American Agricultural Team Arrives in Beijing; Will Go to Various Parts of the Country for Inspection; Then Submit a Report to Our Government

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Chinese and American members of the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Team, more than 20 people, arrived in Beijing by car at 5:00 p.m. on the 8th. Minister Zhou Yichun and Deputy Minister Yan Shenyu welcomed them at the station. The American members of the team arrived in Shanghai from the United States on the 24th of last month and were formally established after meeting with our country's members. The entire team consists of eleven Chinese and eleven American agricultural experts, all of whom were selected and appointed by the agricultural departments of the two countries at the request of our Executive Yuan. The organization of the team is in response to the need for our country to accelerate agricultural reconstruction after the war. The American head of the team, Mr. Hutchison, told reporters at the station: The team will visit President Chiang to pay their respects and visit various universities and academic institutions in the country in order to gain a deeper understanding of the Chinese education system. He himself will return to the United States in November. During this period, he will go to various parts of China, and even the northeastern provinces, for inspection, and he hopes that this trip will contribute to Sino-American agricultural cooperation: (1) Investigate the agricultural conditions of our country and report to our government as a reference for our country's agricultural policy in the future; (2) Study the methods of Sino-American cooperation in the production and promotion of our country's main agricultural export products, such as silk, tea, tung oil, wool, and fish; (3) Suggestions on urgent issues in our country's current agricultural construction. However, all investigation and research results and suggestions are the joint opinions of Chinese and American experts, and at the same time, they are recommended to the Chinese and American governments for reference. The American members are scheduled to stay in China for four and a half months or two years. Our government does not pay their salaries, but only bears the costs of accommodation and transportation. The country will stay in Beijing for about a week and then go to various parts of the country for inspection in groups, first from Beijing to Ping, then to Panyang, via Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, Liuzhou, Guangzhou, Taiwan, Hangzhou, and back to Nanjing, to conduct research together and then submit a report to our government.

### Soviet Newspaper Criticizes American Military Aid to China

[Reuters, Moscow, 7th] Soviet commentator Isakov wrote an article in "Pravda" pointing out that the United States is helping the Chinese Nationalist government, undermining the domestic ceasefire agreement, and preparing to launch an anti-communist movement, which will inevitably lead to further expansion of the civil war. The article stated: If the United States can stop supplying arms and materials to one side that is launching a civil war, then the Chinese civil war will automatically stop. However, American military aid has not ended with the end of World War II, but has continued to extend and expand, such as the Lend-Lease Act and the plan to train and equip one million Chinese soldiers. Lend-Lease supplies stopped in August 1945, but the US government continued to supply China with goods worth 58 million US dollars. The US government continues to supply China with huge amounts of war materials based on laws that have already ceased to be effective, and the activities of the US military in China are the main reason for the current situation in China. The Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference declared its support for the principle of non-interference in Chinese affairs, and the US policy in China is not in line with these principles.

### Executive Yuan, Su-Ning Branch Actively Promotes Work Relief; Completes River Dredging, Road Repair, and Embankment Construction Projects; Mobilizes Disaster Workers to Kill a Large Number of Rice Grasshoppers

[Zhenjiang Correspondence] According to the Executive Yuan, Su-Ning Branch: Since its official establishment on January 16th of this year, it has actively promoted civil engineering projects such as river dredging, road repair, and embankment construction as work relief. As of the end of this month, the branch has completed the earth embankment project of the Jiangnan Seawall, the dredging project of the Zhenwu Canal, the renovation project of the Zhenwu Road, the Guijiang Sanba project of the Jiangbei Canal, small-scale river dredging and embankment construction projects in more than ten counties including Zhenjiang, Wujin, and Jiangyin, the Five Rivers and Six Embankments project in Huaian and Guanyun in the Communist area, and other sporadic work relief projects in various places. As of the end of this month, a total of 700,000 workers and refugees in this province have been mobilized, completing 850,000 cubic meters of earthwork, dredging more than 20,000 meters of sewers in Xuzhou, completing two damming dams on the Jiangbei Canal, benefiting the local area, and relieving disaster victims. The effectiveness is very broad. The branch believes that the farming season is approaching, and various disaster workers and refugees can participate in rural work, so the first phase of the relief work project will end soon, and staff will be dispatched to use the farming season to conduct various water conservancy engineering designs and surveys so as to greatly reorganize the water conservancy highways in the jurisdiction of the branch after the autumn to lay the foundation for post-disaster relief. In addition, according to reports, locust plagues are severe this year in Nanjing Baguazhou Jurong, Jiangpu, Jiangning, Zhenjiang, and Lishui. Since April, thousands of disaster workers and refugees have been mobilized to dig up eggs and catch nymphs, and flour is issued by weight as work relief. As of the end of June, more than 50 tons of nymphs and more than 2,000 catties of locust eggs have been killed. In addition, rice stem borer control work was launched in Wuxi, Suzhou, Wujiang, Kunshan, and other places. A demonstration area for drug prevention and control was delineated, and rice stem borer control associations were organized to actively promote work relief and rice stem borer control. Recently, in the Wuxi Suzhou demonstration area, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the College of Education have jointly spread a large amount of DDT powder, totaling three and a half tons, covering more than 1,600 mu of rice fields, which has been quite effective. Many visitors have come to visit. It is heard that many reporters from the Associated Press and Mr. Gling, the chief agricultural expert of UNRRA in China, have also gone to investigate and visit, and added instructions, believing that the results are satisfactory.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] This morning, Mr. Forrestal discussed matters with General Rockey, Commander of the US Marine Corps, and Mr. Robertson, the American member of the Beijing Military Mediation Executive Department.

[United Press, Beiping, 8th] US Secretary of the Navy Forrestal arrived here last night on Marshal's special plane. He was originally scheduled to leave for Shanghai this afternoon, but it was postponed for one day until tomorrow morning in order to host a cocktail party and a banquet to entertain some of the US Marines in Pingjing. According to the Marines who attended the meeting, they learned very little news from the Secretary, because the Secretary always avoided answering their questions and instead asked them various questions. However, Mr. Forrestal did express concern for the US military itself, repeatedly talking about the military service point system, and was quite concerned about the details of the US military's protection of the North China Railway.

Editorial

### Self-Reflection on Economic Policies

Yesterday morning, Premier Song of the Executive Yuan, at the Shanghai Municipal Government, hosted reporters, listened to the opinions of the press, answered inquiries, and stated that "I have always respected public opinion." Indeed, Premier Song's answers to various points yesterday were very frank and straightforward. For example, regarding the grain loan case, he said that grain merchants who commit fraud should be severely punished, and grain officials who commit fraud should be even more severely punished, and no one will be shielded; if Changjiang Fuzhong and other companies have official capital, they should be punished; the increase in grain prices has been ordered to be thoroughly investigated by the responsible departments; the China Textile Company will definitely be sold to private management in the future; state-run shipping and private shipping must be treated equally; foreign ships sailing on the Yangtze River will be discussed with shipping merchants from an objective perspective; he hopes that domestic unity will be achieved, transportation will be restored, and currency issuance can be stopped, because "currency inflation stimulates prices and is the most painful." All of the above are Premier Song's clear and direct answers, which can at least explain people's previous doubts, and can at least let people know that the authorities are still moving towards the road of "good government." This attitude of the administrative authorities and this style of valuing public opinion cannot but be said to be a symbol of the government's recent progress.

After listening to Premier Song's answers, we would like to raise another issue of self-reflection on economic policies here, because we believe this is a question of whether reality matches ideals. In March of this year, when the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang was held, Premier Song reported to the conference, saying: "The most urgent and serious problem at present is the economic problem. The current economic situation can be said to be unsatisfactory to everyone, which is inevitable. Even I personally feel not only that I cannot be satisfied, but also that I am extremely dissatisfied." Premier Song's frank statement can move us; and what is especially gratifying is that he proposed the Economic Emergency Measures Plan at the Second Plenary Session. This plan stipulates four principles: (1) Expand new sources of tax revenue to curb the rapid expansion of currency; (2) The new sources of tax revenue should be based on the principles of the People's Livelihood, restricting capital and equalizing land ownership, and strive to implement them; (3) Effectively resolve labor-management disputes; (4) Adjust the treatment of public and private school teachers, military officers and soldiers, and industrial workers, striving for fairness and reasonableness. The measures stipulated based on these four principles are: (1) Conduct a general registration of property and levy a one-time property tax, (2) Levy stock exchange tax and transaction tax, (3) Implement a special excessive profit tax, (4) Formulate measures for handling employee treatment disputes in state-owned and private enterprises. Except for state-owned enterprises, which are not allowed to strike or slow down work, a labor-management arbitration committee will be established, which has the power of compulsory arbitration over labor-management disputes in private enterprises, (5) Re-adjust the treatment of public and private school teachers, military officers and soldiers, and industrial workers. From the above description, it can be seen that to solve the economic problem today, it is by no means something that can be done solely by an economic department, nor can it be solved solely by discussing dozens of economic policy guidelines by the Economic Planning Commission, but must rely on Premier Song's decision-making and the cooperation of the Ministry of Finance. To be honest, if we leave the Ministry of Finance, leave the currency issue, and avoid discussing this most fundamental problem, and only want to talk about economics in terms of economics, we dare to say that even if this road is not impassable, at least it will be twice the effort with half the result.

We, the common people, have the right to demand from the government today to first conduct a thorough self-reflection on the current economic policies. Leaving aside other things, let's just talk about this "Economic Emergency Measures Plan" that has been passed for more than three months. Please, the government, ask yourself: How many points have been implemented now? Apart from the establishment of the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee in Shanghai and the Executive Yuan's one-time adjustment of the treatment of public and private school teachers, what other achievements have been made? How many new sources of tax revenue have been developed? Has the general registration of property been carried out? Has the property tax been levied? Has the rapid expansion of currency been curbed? Now, in all economic policies, has attention been paid to the principles of restricting capital and equalizing land ownership? Is the treatment of employees in state-owned industries more excessive than the income of ordinary public and private school teachers? In all of these, the government has clearly and solemnly proposed and the Central Plenary Session has passed the motion. Premier Song, without shirking responsibility, should re-draw the attention and examination of various competent departments, and then it can be judged how the performance of these "government agencies" is. We believe that if this motion is renamed the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan," then any economic-related department of the Executive Yuan has the responsibility to strive to implement it, and no one is allowed to shirk it. Otherwise, if there are no "measures," there is even less talk of "emergency." The result of the de facto shelving will inevitably make the current economic situation still "unsatisfactory to everyone" as it was three months ago, and Premier Song may still be "one of the extremely dissatisfied." If so, how will the various competent departments of the Executive Yuan face Premier Song? How will they face the Second Plenary Session? And how will they face the people of the whole country?

Therefore, we do not need to make any new demands on the government today, but only hope that the government will examine its economic policies without any concealment.

### European Peace Conference Procedural Issues: Soviet Representative Sticks to Original Position; Four Foreign Ministers Met Yesterday Morning and Afternoon; Current Stalemate Still Not Broken

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] London, August 8th, Broadcast: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' meeting was held again this morning, attempting to break the deadlock. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Molotov debated fiercely for two hours. Molotov insisted that invitation letters could only be issued after the peace conference procedures had been decided. However, Byrnes and Bevin stated that procedural issues could be discussed as suggestions but opposed forcing other countries to accept them. As a result of the heated debate, the stalemate could not be broken. In the afternoon (Shanghai midnight), the Four-Power Foreign Ministers will meet again, with secret talks beforehand. It is rumored that the French side has proposed a compromise plan, but it is not yet known whether it will be accepted by the U.S. and Soviet sides.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] London, August 8th, Broadcast: Molotov advocates discussing peace treaties separately with each country: (1) Norway is not allowed to participate in any of the five committees discussing peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. (2) China, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Brazil, Abyssinia, and Poland can only participate in negotiations on the major peace treaty. (3) The United States should not participate in the Finnish peace treaty. (4) Britain, the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India, the Czech Republic can participate in any committee among the five committees. (5) Canada is not allowed to participate in the Bulgarian peace treaty. (6) Greece will participate in the peace treaties with Italy and Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia will participate in the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria.

[Reuters, Paris, August 8th] The Four Foreign Ministers held two meetings today, the first at 11:30 a.m. (8:30 p.m. Shanghai time) and the second in the afternoon. It is expected that the Four Foreign Ministers will strive to break the stalemate of last week, which has prevented the progress of the 21-nation peace conference scheduled for July 29.

[Reuters, Paris, August 8th] The two main points revealed by the debates of the Four Foreign Ministers in the past two days are: (1) Molotov firmly prevents the convening of a peace conference that can decide on the rules of procedure; (2) British Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes also firmly stated that the right of the 17 countries other than the Four Powers to veto opposition to the conference schedule or the conference's formulation of procedural rules must be maintained. Observers here believe that the impression gained from the past two meetings is that Molotov's firm disagreement to issue invitation letters is even stronger than his desire to have people accept his procedural rules. Most people speculate that his motives for not wanting to invite various countries to participate in the peace conference are to place real power in the hands of the Four Powers. Although Western countries have strongly protested, if Molotov can remain unchanged, the peace conference issue may be difficult to progress. Therefore, today's meeting key still lies with Molotov. Only by resolving the peace conference issue can we then proceed to discuss the political situation in Germany, Austria, and Italy. Regarding whether China can jointly issue invitation letters, it has not yet been resolved. The Soviet Union's attitude of opposing China's participation remains unchanged.

### Austrians Expelled from Soviet-Occupied Zone

[United Press, Vienna, August 8th] Austrian officials announced today that Soviet authorities ordered the expulsion of 54,000 Austrians from the Soviet-occupied zone at 6:00 a.m. today. It is reported that Red Army trucks are currently stationed in front of the homes of the expelled Austrians, waiting to load furniture and transport them to other Allied-occupied zones. The Soviet Union's reason for expelling the Austrians is that they are of German descent.

### Independence Movement Unfolds in British and French Occupied Zones of the Rhineland; Difficult to Win Broad Mass Support for the Time Being

[Reuters, Baden-Baden, Germany, August 8th] A movement aimed at establishing an independent Rhineland region has been established in the French-occupied zone, with its headquarters in Kaiserslautern in the Palatinate. Similar movements have already been established in the British zone, but the French authorities have not yet recognized them as formal political parties. According to the leaders of this movement, the independence of the Rhineland can serve as a barrier for France, preventing German attacks, and can also serve as a means of reconciliation between Germany and France. The industry in the Rhineland can therefore be exempted from division due to compensation. The district should be incorporated into the independent state of the Rhineland, and the capital should be set in Koblenz. This issue should be decided by a referendum. Observers predict that this movement will be difficult to win broad mass support for the time being, because the internal divisions are not yet strong. However, if the situation in the Rhineland continues to deteriorate, the Germans, out of disappointment, may turn to this movement in the psychological pursuit of new paths. Currently, the intellectuals in the French Rhineland seem to have anti-Prussian ideas, hoping that Germany can establish a federal foundation with Frankfurt as its capital.

### Anti-Allied Demonstrations Throughout Italy

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] London, August 8th, Broadcast: The anti-Allied demonstrations that appeared in Rome and Taranto last Saturday have now spread to Brindisi, where students broke into the residences of British officers and abducted Italian women who were dancing with British soldiers.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, August 7th] Disturbances continue throughout Italy, and anti-United Nations demonstration movements are emerging one after another. Several incidents occurred in Padua, and there were group demonstration movements in Trieste. A group of students rushed into the café where the British and American military club was located, tore down the British and American flags, replaced them with Italian flags, and then vandalized the building. The police arrived to suppress the situation and arrested several people. In Parma, a statue of King Ahmed II, the former monarch, was destroyed by a landmine. At the same time, for several days, many Italian fascists who were expelled from Switzerland have been approaching the residents of [near the Swiss border].

### Yugoslavia States

[Reuters, Belgrade, August 7th] Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj, after returning from Paris, told reporters that Yugoslavia cannot accept the decision of the Four-Power Paris Conference to internationalize Trieste and its surrounding area, because this decision is similar to the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, which subjects the Slovene and Croat people to the rule of different enemy powers, which is a major blow to our nation. We must continue to strive and ask the Allied nations not to act unilaterally, because we will never accept this decision.

### U.S. House of Representatives Expected to Pass Loan to Britain

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Old San Francisco, August 8th, Broadcast: The U.S. House of Representatives will discuss the loan to Britain today, and it is expected to be passed. President Truman and Byrnes have both addressed the House, explaining the importance of this loan.

### Next British General Election to Be Held in Four Years

### U.S. Congressional Delegation Publishes Observations on the Soviet Union; Most People Friendly to the U.S.

[U.S. News Service, Washington, August 7th] Several U.S. Congressmen visited the Soviet Union, the Balkans, and the Middle East last year and recently published reports describing their observations. The Congressmen unanimously advocated the free exchange of students, scientists, films, and news to maintain good relations between the U.S. and these countries. The observations on the Soviet Union are as follows: The Soviet Union has 185 million non-Communist people, which is a huge latent force friendly to the U.S. If we can find a way to make them understand our sincere wishes, it will definitely promote U.S.-Soviet friendship. In the Soviet Union, as in the U.S., most people seek peace; in the Soviet Union, there is a great need and desire to improve the living standards of civilians. On average, the Soviet people do not have negative feelings towards the U.S. Very few Soviet people understand the scope of the U.S. Lend-Lease Act aid to the Soviet Union. Because the U.S. logos are not obvious, only a few people understand that they are gifts from the U.S. This is not because the Soviet side opposes it, but because the U.S. lacks vision and planning. After we enter the Soviet Union, we can move freely. The telegrams heard and taken by our visitors are all inspected, which is completely true. If the visitors freely express their opinions, it will attract dissatisfaction from the authorities and eventually they will have to leave. All free exchanges of facts, figures, people, news, travelers, and literature can eliminate misunderstandings between the two countries and benefit peace. Soviet military preparations are still continuing on a large scale. The Soviet Union is developing heavy industry and ignoring consumer goods industry. As far as freedom of information is concerned, the Soviet Union lacks modern weapons and mechanical equipment necessary for modern warfare. In the autumn of last year, the Soviet armed forces of the Soviet Union numbered about 12 million. The fact-finding team recommends immediately abandoning the policy of appeasement in every shape and form.

### Indian National Congress Council Accepts Long-Term Plan

[Reuters, Mumbai, August 7th] The All-India National Congress Council tonight approved the resolution of the party's executive committee by a vote of 204 to 51, accepting the British Cabinet Mission's long-term plan on Indian constitutionalism while rejecting the suggestion of the interim government. The debate on this case lasted ten and a half hours, and Gandhi and other leaders of the National Congress Party fully supported it.

### Philippines Expresses Opposition to Four-Power Control of Japan

[Reuters, Manila, August 8th] Opposition leader Concepcion claims that he will publicize to the world his opposition to the four powers controlling Japan alone after the end of the military occupation of Japan. This move is unfair to countries such as the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and India, which have shed blood against Japan. The Far Eastern Commission should allow small countries to participate, and this organization governing Japan should not be controlled by the four powers alone.

### High-Speed Spinning Machine

### Tanaka Continues Testimony at the International Tribunal: The Cause and Effect of Japan's Invasion of Northeast China, Lessons Learned from the Battle of Zhanggufeng, Recognizing Japan's Inability to Wage War Against the US

[Reconstruction Society, Tokyo, 8th] Following Army Ministry Military Affairs Bureau Chief Tanaka Ryukichi's thorough exposure of the Japanese military's conspiracy to invade Northeast China at the International Tribunal on the 5th and 6th, he appeared in court again today to answer cross-examination from the defense. Defense counsel Hayato Itaro first asked the witness why he retired from the army when the Pacific War reached its peak. Tanaka replied: "The Battle of Zhanggufeng made me feel the power of material strength early on. That battle was not a victorious battle as reported. I was a artillery company commander at the time, and I can say with certainty that if the battle had continued for two more days, the result would have been the same as the Nomonhan Incident. Regarding negotiations with the United States, although I was unable to directly inquire at the time, I had secretly heard about the progress of the negotiations from Colonel Sato of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Section and Lieutenant General Kimura, the Vice-Minister of the Army."

Military and Naval Discord, Feeling Despair About the War

"As for my resignation from the army, there were two reasons: First, the air defense equipment was poor, and there was discord between the army and navy, with false reports being made to superiors. If I told the truth, I would offend the Army Minister. Worried about the future of the war, I expressed my despair about the war to Tojo on September 21, 1942, and requested to resign. Another reason is that although Tojo said, 'Fight to the last man,' I deeply believed that this was absolutely impossible, so I asked Foreign Minister Togo to initiate a political movement to force Tojo to step down. However, because this matter violated my intention to oppose the military engaging in political movements, I felt that I was no longer qualified as an active-duty soldier and resigned. Also, regarding the Manchurian Incident, I firmly believe that it was not a hastily planned event before the outbreak." (Question) "The witness said that in 1928 there was a plan to build a 'Kingdom of Righteousness' in the Northeast. Was this Kawamoto's personal opinion or the policy of the Tanaka Cabinet?" (Answer) "It was Kawamoto's personal opinion." (Question) "The witness said that the relationship between Japan and 'Manchukuo' after 1928 was a state of undeclared war. Why is that?"

More Than 300 Unresolved Issues in the Three Eastern Provinces

(Answer) "One reason is that in accordance with the Okura-Guaranty Loan Agreement to build the "South Manchurian" parallel railway, there were more than 300 unresolved issues between China and Japan in the Northeast." (Question) "When the Wanpaoshan Incident and the Nakamura Captain Incident occurred, did you know that public opinion was boiling in Japan?" (Answer) "Yes." (Question) "Did you know that the defense of the Chinese army was also being strengthened day by day, and there was a state of imminent outbreak?" (Answer) "Extremely dangerous." (Question) "Did you know that no Chinese soldiers died in the Liutiao Lake Incident?" (Answer) "No." (Question) "Did you know that in the Liutiao Lake Incident, the Chinese army's artillery fire was extremely accurate against our side?" (Answer) "If a war occurred, it should be like that." (Question) "How many Japanese people were in the Northeast when the Manchurian Incident occurred?" (Answer) "I don't know very well, about 100,000 to 150,000." (Question) "What was the number of the Kwantung Army guarding "South Manchuria?" (Answer) "About 6,000." (Question) "Were the administrative affairs of "Manchukuo" handled by "Manchukuo" officials?" (Answer) "At that time, there was dual nationality in Japan and "Manchukuo."" (Question) "Even if they were Japanese, were they considered officials of "Manchukuo?"" (Answer) "After the abolition of extraterritoriality in 1908, Japanese people were considered "Manchukuo" people on the one hand, and also Japanese people at the same time." (Question) "What was the Japanese government's policy toward "Manchukuo?"" (Answer) "To cultivate it under Japanese control." (Question) "Did Hashimoto Kingoro have any relationship with the Japanese government's decision on the "Manchukuo" policy?" (Answer) "As far as I know, no relationship." (Question) "Did the witness serve in the International Prosecution Section?" (Answer) "Because I have held important positions in the past, I am familiar with all the events related to this court, so at the request of the Prosecution Section, I conduct investigations and provide information every day. This is an order from MacArthur Headquarters." (Defense Counsel Yamada asked) "What was the direct cause of the Liutiao Lake Incident?" (Answer) "The dangerous situation between China and Japan in the Northeast was the direct cause. Regarding the bombing of the railway, I really don't know whether it was done by the Chinese or the Japanese. Taking this as a wedge, the Shenyang Incident occurred." (Question) "Why does the witness say that the Liutiao Lake Incident was a war of self-defense?" (Answer) "I am Japanese, so until the end of the Pacific War, I followed the country's advocacy and believed it was a war of self-defense, but whether it was self-defense or not, this court should decide."

More Than 200,000 Chinese Troops Stationed in the Northeast

(Question) "The witness said that there were more than 200,000 Chinese troops in the Northeast at that time. Did you know that these troops were scattered in Shenyang, Changchun, Kuanchengzi, Gongzhuling, and other places?" (Answer) "I am more familiar with this matter than you, but they were in the barracks, not in the concession." Next, defense counsel Ota stood up and said: "The witness's statement that Doihara once served as an advisor to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council is obviously false." Tanaka admitted that it was a mistake. (Question) "What was the purpose of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council?" (Answer) "The purpose of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council was, first, to cooperate with Japan in anti-communism; second, to establish close relations with both Japan and "Manchukuo"; and third, to control the political, economic, and military issues of the area as desired by Japan, without infringing on sovereignty." (Question) "Why was the Hebei-Chahar Political Council organized?" (Answer) "After the establishment of "Manchukuo," the Nanjing Central Government took the recovery of lost territories as the center of its national policy and diplomacy. In order to avoid friction, a Sino-Japanese friendly zone was established south of the Great Wall to ensure the security of "Manchukuo."" (Defense counsel Okamoto asked) "What kind of organization was the Kwantung Army's Special Service Agency?" (Answer) "The Special Service Agency, with active-duty soldiers as the center, guided the politics and economy of "Manchukuo."" (Question) "When did Doihara, on the order of General Minami, meet with Song Zheyuan?" (Answer) "In mid-September 1935." (Question) "What was the content of the instructions when Doihara went to Beiping?" (Answer) "The first was anti-communism, and the second was to establish an autonomous zone in North China." (Question) "Did you know that on December 31, 1935, the Vice-Minister of the Army ordered Doihara to go to North China to serve as an instructor for the Hebei-Chahar Political Council?" (Answer) "I have definitely seen that order."

Tanaka Repeatedly Receives Threatening Letters

[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] The International Tribunal continued to try Japanese war criminals today. Tanaka Ryukichi testified in court that friction between the Chinese and Japanese people in Manchuria was the reason that prompted the Japanese warlords' determination to seize Manchuria. China's intention to take back Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian, and to abolish the South Manchurian Railway, started an anti-Japanese movement. The defendant's lawyer questioned Tanaka whether the prosecutor had told him that he would testify for the defendant? He replied: "No." He was also asked whether he had received any financial rewards for testifying for the prosecutor this time: "To this day, I have not received a penny." The American prosecutor privately stated: "The situation in Manchuria was indeed tense, but this is not enough to be a reason for Japan to occupy Manchuria."

[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Lieutenant General Tanaka Ryukichi, an important witness in the recent International Tribunal, has received many anonymous threatening letters and phone calls, warning him not to testify again.

Attempting to Exonerate the Japanese Emperor

[French News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] Tanaka Ryukichi has been testifying in court for several days, especially criticizing Tojo. According to our agency's reporter, who is closely associated with Tanaka, Tanaka's actions are not to retaliate against Tojo, but only to exonerate the Japanese Emperor Hirohito. Tanaka opposed Tojo's policies from the beginning of the Pacific War. Until the end of last year, when the American prosecutor's team came here to prepare for the trial, Tanaka made extensive contact and served as a guest of Keenan for several weeks. At Tanaka's request, Keenan went to China for a trip, visited Chairman Chiang in China, and held talks, attempting to make Chairman Chiang believe that it was necessary to exempt the Japanese Emperor from trial.

### The Rong Desheng Kidnapping Case Has Bizarre Circumstances: Shen Xin Factory Director Zhan Rongpei Is Actually the Mastermind Behind the Crime, Colluding with Bandits to Work Together Inside and Out, Police Investigation Confirms It, Will Be Transferred to the Garrison Headquarters Today

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, according to our newspaper's reporter from the police station: Although the bandit leader and part of the accomplices who kidnapped Rong Desheng this time have been captured by the First Pacification Zone Headquarters and sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, several important principals directly related to this case have not yet been arrested, and the military authorities are still making every effort to investigate, hoping to close the case as soon as possible. What is most noteworthy is that the mastermind behind the kidnapping of Rong Desheng was actually Zhan Rongpei, the director of the Second Factory of Shen Xin Cotton Mill (In addition to serving as the director of the Second Factory, Zhan also concurrently served as the deputy director of the Huada Enterprise Company established by Wu Zhigang, an accomplice in this case, at No. 24 Central Road in this city). He had been in contact with the bandits before and after the incident, working together inside and out.

It was found that Rong Desheng was kidnapped at 10:00 am on April 25th. Until May 21st, Rong's family received two personal letters from Rong, asking them to prepare 500,000 US dollars for ransom. At 9:00 am that morning, they also received a phone call, asking them to prepare the money, divide it into twelve packages of 120,000 taels each and thirteen packages of 130,000 taels each, and the location for the handover would be notified by phone at 5:00 pm. At that time, the police checked that the phone number was 7344, which belonged to a Russian-owned bakery at No. 234 Albert Road. The bandit using the pseudonym "Zhu" used the phone. When the detectives went to the address, the bandit had already left. The next day, another phone call came, asking to send the money to Pushi Road on the 25th. Originally, Rong's family entrusted a relative named Wu Kunsheng to contact the bandits, but Wu declined due to timidity. So, Zhan Rongpei, the mastermind behind the scenes, volunteered. When the money was sent to Pushi Road on the 25th, the deal could not be completed due to a misunderstanding between the military and police. On the morning of the 27th, Zhan and Wu Zhigang met again at Jinjiang Tea House on Hualong Road, agreeing to send the money to No. 54 Kangrong Court on Fuxi Road on the 28th. At that time, Wu had to hand over Rong Desheng's personal seal, which he carried with him, as proof of payment. As for the total amount of the ransom, yesterday's report stated 395,000 yuan. However, according to Zhan Rongpei's confession at the police station, the bandits initially asked Rong for 2 million US dollars, which was later reduced to 500,000 US dollars, of which 100,000 US dollars was taken by Wu Zhigang for personal gain when the money was handed over.

After the money was handed over at 10:00 am on the 28th, Rong Desheng was released at 10:00 pm. That night, he went to stay at the home of his son-in-law, Kang Nengwei, on McNini Road. Previously, the military had already captured a bandit named Zheng Liantang in an old temple in West Shanghai, with both the money and the person. According to the confession, Zhan Rongpei was the key criminal who initiated the kidnapping of Rong. The police arrested Zhan on the third day after Rong was released. Now, after the investigation confirmed the facts, Yun Tang's case will be transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters today for joint handling.

### The Small Boat Used to Imprison Rong Has Been Intercepted, The Building Was Originally a Workshop

[Another Dispatch] After Rong Desheng was kidnapped, Rong's small boat was initially intercepted by the police. However, the boat owner has escaped. It is also learned that this person also received a share, totaling 22,000 US dollars. After being held on the boat for three days, Rong was moved to No. 100 Gongyi Lane, Changshou Road, Caojiadu (see picture). The house was rented by bandit leader Luo Wenqing's son under the alias Zhang one week before the Rong case occurred. It was originally rented by a carpenter as a place to make planks, so the room was very messy (see picture). After Rong moved in, it was not cleaned up, and the gate was closed all day to arouse suspicion. The bandit responsible for guarding him was a woman and a child, who lived in the garret. Rong was imprisoned in the back building on the second floor. The glass windows in the room had been nailed with plywood in advance, so it was extremely dark, and candles had to be lit during the day. Rong Desheng, the cotton yarn and flour tycoon, spent a month in this dark room. Every day, the female bandit took care of his meals. According to Rong's post-incident words, it was not bad.

Dr. Wu Yifang, President of Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, will also attend the performance.

[Another Dispatch] According to Mr. Wang Liangchang's words to reporters yesterday, he will follow Madame Chiang's orders, and a group of about five people including Bishop Yu Bin, Huang Qilin, and the general manager of the relief association, Zhuan Ren, will depart for the Northeast at the end of this month to visit the refugees and issue 200 million yuan in funds. The trip will last about two weeks. First, they will fly to Beiping, then Xuan Yang, and then to various places in the Northeast.

### Bureau Chief Reports on Housing Management Methods

[Report from this newspaper] The municipal government held a memorial service for the founding father at 9:00 am yesterday. Director Zhu Ping of the Land Administration Bureau reported: The management of houses is divided into two methods: symptomatic treatment and fundamental treatment. Symptomatic treatment includes guaranteeing the continuation of ownership for owners, ensuring the continuation of residence for tenants, and cracking down on unreasonable rents. In view of the profiteering of second landlords, it was decided to find ways to crack down on them, and special attention must be paid when mediating disputes. For fundamental treatment, citizens are encouraged to build new houses. In addition, the proceeds from the sale of taxes and the reduction of land value-added tax will be used to relieve their investment constraints. As for the new housing land price tax, it is planned to exempt it for one or two years, and a request has been made to the authorities.

### The Epidemic Has Not Diminished Slightly, Schools and Entertainment Venues Are Prepared to Be Converted into Hospitals, The Municipal Association Branch Launches a Fundraising Campaign

[Report from this newspaper] The spread of cholera in this city has not diminished slightly recently. Yesterday, there were another seventy-eight patients and three deaths. A total of 1,445 patients have been reported, with 95 deaths. In addition, the city's original plague hospitals are already full. After repeated attempts, they still feel insufficient. The Health Bureau is actively planning to convert municipal schools (such as Gezhi Middle School, etc.) into temporary epidemic hospitals. In case the epidemic spreads and becomes more serious, or will borrow various entertainment venues (such as dance halls and theaters) to close as temporary hospitals.

When the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Municipal Association held a health research meeting a few days ago, Yin Tiyang, a director of the association, suggested to the association to launch a fundraising campaign to add plague hospitals, aiming to raise funds for 1,000 beds, with 20,000 yuan as a unit, collected by various newspapers on behalf of the association, and to promote publicity to jointly eliminate this public enemy. This suggestion was unanimously approved.

The Health Bureau found that four pastures, Pudong, Yili, Dongfang, Sanyou, and Samsung, were selling skimmed milk as whole milk, seeking huge profits. They were each fined 5,000 yuan.

### The Major Embezzlement Case of the Railway Bureau: The First Court Hearing Investigation, The Families of the Criminals Scold Yu Xiangyan, Zhang Hongtu Puts All Responsibility on His Wife, Li Jie Cries That She Only Knew About Profit-Sharing and Did Not Know It Was Embezzlement

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate, at ten o'clock yesterday morning, conducted the first preliminary investigation by the prosecutor of the entire bureau on the major embezzlement industry of the two railway bureaus. Due to time constraints, only Zhang Hongtu, Zhang Bokang, Li Jie, Sun Xueshan, Zhu Biguan, Wang Renxuan, Zhang Kaiyuan, and other seven people with relatively high suspicion were questioned. They were escorted from the court's detention center at the hospital at 9:35 yesterday morning. The principal criminal, Zhang Hongtu (director of material), wore a white shirt and potential driver's suit pants, with his eyebrows tightly wrinkled and his head bowed. He looked very distressed. His female subordinate, Li Jie, wore a light purple Guan Hua cloth cheongsam and white leather shoes. When she left the detention center, she covered her face with her small hands. Yu Peien wore a silk short shirt and pants, and his face was very haggard. His mother, who was over sixty years old, and his wife saw him, and their grief came from the heart. They shed tears and tried to deliver some of the food they brought to Yu Peien, but were stopped by the bailiff, and Zhang cried loudly from afar. Their families all scolded Yu Xiangyan, believing that the crime was Yu's alone. They were all harmed by her and would not have a good death in the future.

The hearing began at ten o'clock. The principal criminal, Zhang Hongtu, tried to evade responsibility, and when asked about various issues by the prosecutor, he repeatedly said that he did not know the situation and that it was all his wife's business and had nothing to do with him. During the investigation, Li Jie burst into tears, yelling injustice, saying that she only took the money for "profit-sharing" and did not know it was "embezzlement." The investigation was completed at about 12:00 noon, and the defendants were all selected for custody.

### The Secret Informant Will Also Be Summoned Tomorrow Morning

According to a report from our newspaper reporter, the case will still be investigated for the second time by the full inspector at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.

Li refused to accept the verdict and filed an application for retrial. The application has been transferred by the High Court to the Supreme Court. In addition, Li's wife, Liu Yu, and Jin Zongcheng, a director of Xinxin Company, felt that it was quite difficult to manage the Xinxin Company operated by Li after he was detained, so they separately filed applications with the High Court to suspend the election. The High Court formally rejected the application the other day.

### Ministry of Food Announces Details of Grain Handling, Responding to Inspector Cheng's Accusations to the Executive Yuan

Regarding the grain case, Cheng, the Inspector of the Jiangsu Inspection Area, previously submitted an accusation to the Executive Yuan, believing that there was a major suspicion of fraud in the selection process. The Executive Yuan then ordered the Ministry of Food to thoroughly investigate in accordance with the law. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Food submitted a report to the Executive Yuan detailing the handling of the grain. The Ministry of Food has now released the text of that reply, the original text of which is as follows: "Case received from the Executive Yuan's instruction Jing Ba Zi No. 2716 dated June 21, 35th year of the Republic of China: "The Supervisory Yuan's Jiangsu Inspector, Cheng Zhongxing, has submitted an accusation to the Yuan regarding the handling of grain by Yang Xizhi, the Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Administration, etc., for dereliction of duty and abuse of power. It is imperative to send the original accusation for you to quickly and thoroughly investigate and verify in accordance with the law and report back accordingly." This order, etc. One copy of the original accusation is enclosed. Having received this, we have investigated that the handling of loan funds for Shanghai grain merchants was at the request of various related organizations such as the Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Municipal Temporary Council. Because Shanghai had been occupied for many years, the grain trade was controlled by the enemy, and the original large-scale and reputable

grain merchant organizations had been exhausted. At the beginning of the recovery, the food supply for Shanghai citizens was entirely dependent on small-scale merchants and peddlers. Subsequently, prices, grain prices, wages, and transportation costs rose continuously, and the capital of merchants and vendors was limited, making it difficult to turn over funds, and the quantity of purchases and transportation was thereby reduced. The monthly demand for rice for Shanghai citizens is several hundred thousand shi, and there was deep concern that the reserves were too low and it would be difficult to sustain the supply during the transition period. There was a unanimous belief that the government should provide low-interest funds to support grain merchants in fully operating, in order to increase reserves and add to the original reserves. The Ministry's policy has been consistent since the implementation of grain management, which is to support grain merchants in strengthening their power so that they can take on the responsibility of supplying and trading food for the people. Therefore, we instructed the Shanghai Office of the Ministry to consult with the China Farmers Bank to formulate appropriate measures. By April 1 of this year, various parties were urging the matter urgently, so a meeting was held in Shanghai to listen to reports from all parties. It was decided to first use one billion yuan

for a trial loan, and the Grain Administration Office drafted the "Shanghai Grain Merchant Loan Measures," which were personally reviewed and revised. On April 3, the Grain Administration Office was instructed to handle the matter. In order to ensure openness and solemnity, with the consent of Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau, Deputy Speaker Wang Shu of the Municipal Council, and Chairman Xu Jiwang of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, each representing the Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Bean and Rice Trade Association, the lending bank, and the Grain Administration Office, the Shanghai Grain Merchant Loan Review Committee was formed. All the terms and conditions that loan merchants should abide by and the responsibilities that the review committee should bear are clearly stipulated in the loan measures and the committee's organizational regulations. All the review and decisions of loan merchants and the assessment of their business are presided over by the committee, with orderly meeting minutes available for review. The Ministry, regarding this case,

has adopted a cautious and open attitude throughout the handling process, and the policies and measures adopted are, in our opinion, without error. As for Article 2 of the loan measures regarding the qualifications of loan merchants, since the main purpose of the loan is to ensure the accurate acquisition of grain, most Shanghai grain merchants have not yet fully registered. After consulting with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Bean and Rice Trade Association, it was known that grain merchants with a long history and strong responsibility

could not be easily found. Furthermore, in view of the fact that Shanghai grain merchants had been entrusted twice in the past year to purchase military rice, but failed to faithfully fulfill the contract, after careful consideration, it was stipulated that in addition to members of the Bean and Rice Trade Association, any purchasing and marketing merchant with the ability to transport and sell could also apply for a loan. The purpose was solely to select more capable merchants who could purchase and transport more rice to Shanghai from the transportation areas, in order to fully realize the effectiveness of the loan and accomplish the mission. And the loan merchant

review and decision is of great importance. The Review Committee did not have any intention in mind during the approval of the measures to intentionally relax the regulations and leave room for wrongdoing. Later, due to differing public opinions, it was decided to suspend the loan, and the principal and interest of the loan were recovered. The merchants purchased and transported more than 35,000 Shanghai shi of rice to Shanghai in a very short period of time, as evidenced by reports.

Yang Xizhi, the Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Administration, went to the United States on official business and left the country on March 14 of this year. The Shanghai Grain Merchant Loan was only decided on April 1. In fact, the drafting and amendment of the loan measures were not participated in by the commissioner. The loan was decided on April 1, and the Review Committee approved the loan merchants on April 4, which was only four days. The commissioner was in the United States and had no possibility of manipulating the matter.

The commissioner Yang Xizhi is not related to this case. Li Chongnian, the director of the committee, was not originally in charge of the Shanghai Grain Merchant Loan. His introduction of the Lianyi and Jiangbei companies to Wan Molin was only a nomination because the Review Committee believed that they had the ability to transport and sell grain. Each of these companies has its own guarantee for handling the grain, and each company should be responsible for its own performance. As for the Changjiang Company, it was not introduced by Li Chong. Wang Daren, the secretary of the Grain Administration Office who was acting as the director, and Ren Xingya, the chief of the section, only handled the various procedures for this loan. After repeated inquiries from the ministry, they all denied any wrongdoing. However, since the case is under investigation by the Shanghai court and the garrison headquarters, whether these officials have any criminal suspicion should be left to

be handled according to the law. As for whether there are any dereliction of duty in administrative terms, it is also intended to be reviewed after the criminal part is determined. (The original accusation letter, the grain merchant loan measures, the organizational rules of the review committee, and the minutes of various meetings are omitted.)

### Teacher Entices Female Student, Stealing Property and Fleeing

Li Chaosheng, a wealthy businessman in Pudong, is 56 years old and lives at No. 63, Lane 1, South Gaomu Bridge, Lujiadu, Dongchang Road. He has a daughter, Lingmei, 16 years old, who is studying at Peixin Middle School on the same road. Unexpectedly, she was seduced by Zhuang Xuexian, the director of academic affairs, and Lingmei entered his trap. He then instigated Lingmei to return home at 4 PM on June 21 and steal clothes, jewelry, and 2.5 million in cash, totaling over 10 million, and abscond. Her father investigated and discovered the whole story. On June 24, he reported to the police station, which dispatched officers to arrest Zhuang and the girl, confiscate the stolen goods, and take them to the station for interrogation. After verifying the facts, they were handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday morning. After interrogation by the prosecutor, they were instructed to await further evidence and verification. The girl was taken back by her father for supervision.

### Embezzling 200 Million in Public Funds, Poor Teacher Makes a Fortune, Exposed and Arrested

[This newspaper report] The Hunan Electric Power Company of the Resources Committee at No. 6, The Bund, received 200 million yuan remitted by the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing on April 18. A payment order was enclosed in a registered airmail letter. The funds were to be withdrawn from the National Treasury of the Central Bank. Because the letter did not specify a detailed address, the post office was unable to deliver it and sent it directly to the Hunan Guild Hall on Quzhenren Road in Nanjing, to be forwarded by the Guild Hall. At that time, the bookkeeper stamped the letter and casually put it away, unaware that it was an important document. It was left on the account table for a long time, and the outer envelope was slightly damaged. Chen Xun (30 years old), a native of Hunan who was residing in the Guild Hall, was a new English teacher at the China Vocational Education Society. He often walked around the accounting room when he had free time. He saw the letter, examined it for a long time, and discovered that it contained a huge payment order. He took it to the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank to inquire about the procedures for withdrawing the money. He was told that the funds were public funds and could not be directly withdrawn. They needed to be transferred to an account first, and then paid upon presentation of an agency receipt. Chen then forged the names of Fang Xiong, the manager of the Hunan Electric Power Company, Wang Naimin, the audit director, and Li Zhenkun, the accounting director, and privately carved two company seals, one square and one rectangular. On May 27, he applied to the Central Bank to open a special fund deposit account No. 30, and then obtained a book of public treasury checks. On June 5, he began to purchase a bicycle, and signed a check for 500,000 yuan. On the 29th, he withdrew another 500,000 yuan. After receiving the money, he exchanged it for two pairs of gold bracelets and a pair of gold earrings, worth over 800,000 yuan. Until the day before yesterday (the 6th), the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank discovered that there were two Hunan Electric Power Companies, and the deposit was suspected of being inconsistent. After strict investigation, it was discovered that the 200 million yuan deposit in the special fund account was a fraudulent account. They reported it to the Huangpu Branch Bureau, and the branch chief She Chun, the criminal section chief Zhou Guanghui, patrol officer Yao Hongzhang, battalion commander Xia Changgen, Li Wenqing, Wu Qilan, Li Bin, Zhao Kuizhen, and others, personally reviewed the case and sent officers to guard the Central Bank. Unexpectedly, at around 10 AM yesterday morning, Chen Xun again posed as a representative from the Sino-American Materials Company and presented a check for 500,000 to purchase flowers. When he went to the Central Bank to withdraw the money, he was arrested by plainclothes police officers and taken to the bureau for preliminary interrogation. He confessed to embezzlement. There were still several checks he issued, totaling 15 million in legal tender, intending to purchase a Jiefang truck, and to jointly establish a photo studio and purchase a camera, valued at 10,000 yuan. He also deposited 500,000 yuan in the post office, but all were rejected by the Treasury Bureau. Officers were sent to the Hunan Guild Hall to confiscate all the stolen jewelry, which was hidden in the bottom of the thermos. Several counterfeit seals were also seized. He is now being strictly interrogated and will be transferred to the judicial authorities for prosecution in the near future.

### Waiting for the Charity Performance to End, Ma Lianliang Prepares to Surrender

Ma Lianliang, a famous Peking opera actor, 56 years old, organized a puppet theater organization during the Anti-Japanese War to control everything in the theater world, and repeatedly went to the puppet state of Manchuria to participate in disgraceful performances. After the victory, he was reported to the High Court. Ma then came to Shanghai. The High Prosecutor's Office investigated and found that Ma did have a suspicion of collaborating with the enemy, and immediately issued an arrest warrant. It is reported that the municipal police authorities originally intended to arrest him immediately, but Ma has indicated to the authorities that after the charity performance is over, he will go to the High Court to surrender. It is said that the municipal police authorities will send officers to escort him to prevent him from escaping along the way.

### Reopening Old Wounds, The Case of the Japanese Soldier Killed Ten Years Ago, Yang Wendao Retried, Court Date Not Far Off, Supreme Court Deems Original Judgment Inappropriate

[This newspaper report] Yang Wendao, a Cantonese man who was arrested ten years ago for the murder of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo on Shile'an Road, has now been released on bail for medical treatment. However, he has recently re-engaged Tang Huaizhun, the lawyer who has been working on his behalf for ten years, to prepare for a retrial. He recently received a judgment from the Supreme Court ordering a retrial by the original court. The review had already been judged by the Supreme Court on December 17, 1942. The judgment was issued on February 21, 1943, and the date of service was June 29, 1946, with an interval of three and a half years. However, according to general speculation, now that it has been served, the date of the trial must not be too long. The main text of the judgment is "The original judgment is revoked and returned to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court." Yang Wendao and another defendant, Ye Haisheng, also from Guangdong, were both sentenced to death by the Second Branch of the High Court, so they appealed to the Supreme Court. Ye Haisheng has already died in prison years ago.

The reasons for the Supreme Court's judgment can be roughly divided into three groups: (1) The key to this case lies in a physics book with a hole dug in it to hide a handgun. "The book found at the time was English physics, and how it later became Chinese Practical Physics is quite strange! Both trial courts did not pay attention to this, and used this suddenly appearing Chinese Practical Physics as the basis for the judgment. On this point alone, the original judgment is unsustainable." (2) Ye Haisheng had performed the crime during the trial, but the situation at that time could not be considered a free performance, and Ye "cried out for injustice and dared not speak loudly, how great was the threat he suffered? And whether this threat was the result of torture and forced confession by the police is worthy of attention." (3) The cause of the crime: "The original judgment stated that it was intended to expand the influence of the Tongrenyi and Lianghui associations to which the appellants belonged," thus causing a serious situation, but in fact, "what the appellants did was enough to promote the demise of the two associations, so how could they expand their influence." The judgment emphasized that the witness Hu Xiangfu's identification of the murderer as "wearing a sailor's uniform" was not easy to misidentify. And the results of the examination of the deceased's wounds proved that "the shooting distance was about five centimeters. If it were not someone close to the defendant, how dare they approach to commit the crime? This point is particularly worthy of investigation!" The conclusion stated: "The criminal motive identified in the original judgment, the book used as evidence of the crime, and Ye Haisheng's free performance are all suspicious and should be considered grounds for return." The case was handled by the Criminal Fifth Division of the Supreme Court, presiding judge Wang Zhennan, judges Luo Renbo, Sun Baowei, Liu Enle, and Zhang Zehuan.

### Happy Foes in Court, Sheng Xiuying Sues for Abandonment, Bai Yunshan Denies Relationship, Five-Year-Old Mimi Identifies Father in Court

[This newspaper report] Bai Yunshan, who opened casinos such as Lüyuan and Dasheng during the enemy puppet period, was recently sued for abandonment by Sheng Xiuying, a woman from Suzhou, and her five-year-old daughter Mimi. The case was opened for trial in the Criminal Eighth Chamber of the District Court yesterday morning. The plaintiff testified in court that she and Bai were relatives. When Bai opened the Lüyuan wealth platform, she worked as a female employee inside. In the spring of the 30th year of the Republic, the defendant relied on his evil power to seduce her and then forced her to live with him. In November of the same lunar year, she gave birth to a daughter, Mimi. But since then, the defendant has become disgusted with them, neglecting the livelihood of the mother and daughter. More recently, he has made threatening remarks, forcing the plaintiff to leave voluntarily, she said. The mother and daughter cried bitterly in court, which was quite tragic. When questioned, the defendant Bai Yunshan claimed that it was all slander, and firmly denied that he had a marital relationship with Sheng, and that she was the wife of his brother-in-law Qu Bingzhang. The judge then asked five-year-old Mimi, who pointed to Bai as her father. The two sides stuck to their own stories, and the court ordered a rescheduling for further questioning.

### Ministry of Education Issues Circular to Provinces and Cities to Determine Autumn Textbooks

[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing] In order to coordinate the autumn sales of nationally approved textbooks, the Ministry of Education specifically summoned representatives from the supply offices of nationally approved textbooks to meet in Beijing on the morning of the 6th to discuss the matter. Generally, the situation in East China is the best, and the supply this year can reach more than ten times that of last autumn. The situation in West China, North China, and South China is generally good, but work needs to be stepped up. The Central China region can be assisted by the East China region for supply, and there should be no shortage. The eastern nine provinces have been visited by Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, Zhonghua, etc., to print locally in Shenyang, and have already started publishing books. Jinan is currently under siege by the Communist army, and books cannot be transported in. The most critical and independent publishing houses have joined forces to print locally, and the paper is transported by air. The situation in Taiwan is also special. Zhengzhong, Kaiming, and Children's Bookstore have branches there, and the Seven Joint Offices have entrusted them to print locally and supply locally. In order to ensure an adequate supply, the Ministry of Education has issued a circular to the education bureaus of various provinces and cities to formulate quantitative supply contracts with the local Seven Joint Supply Groups, similar to the method used in Anhui Province. The southeastern provinces have begun negotiations separately. Supply groups from other provinces have also been established. It is expected that this quantitative supply method will be approved by the education administrative authorities of various provinces and cities, and there will be no book shortage this autumn. According to reports to the Ministry of Education, the same subject's old books printed by various houses themselves will no longer be sold this autumn. Provinces such as Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan, and Shaanxi have been areas where pirated editions are prevalent, with many errors in content. Recently, the Seven Joint Offices hired lawyers to deal with the matter and requested educational administrative agencies to investigate and ban them, and they have gradually disappeared. In the future, nationally approved editions should be able to be supplied everywhere and popularized throughout the country.

### Answers to Questions About Household Registration

Q: Once household registration is established, can it never be changed permanently?

A: No, people have certain reasons to have their household registration cancelled.

Q: What are the reasons for cancelling household registration?

A: Article 19 of the Household Registration Law stipulates the following six types:

1. Death or declaration of death.
2. Loss of nationality of the Republic of China.
3. Moving to another county with the intention of residing there permanently.
4. Transfer of registration due to marriage or divorce.
5. Transfer of registration due to adoption, recognition, or termination of relationship.
6. Other reasons for cancellation of registration.

Q: Marriage, divorce, adoption, and recognition can establish household registration, so why is it stipulated here that household registration must be cancelled?

A: Article 17, Paragraph 3 of the Household Registration Law stipulates that a wife's household registration is based on her husband's household registration. Therefore, the wife's household registration before marriage should be cancelled after marriage because she follows her husband's household registration, otherwise, one person would have two household registrations. For example, if a woman whose household registration is in Zhenjiang marries a Shanghai man, on the one hand, according to the stipulation that the wife's household registration is based on the husband's household registration, she should establish household registration in the Shanghai husband's location. On the other hand, she should cancel her household registration in her original place of origin, Zhenjiang.

Divorce, because the marital relationship is cancelled, the wife's obligation to establish household registration with her husband no longer exists, and she can restore her original household registration or move to another place with the intention of residing there permanently to establish household registration. Therefore, after divorce, on the one hand, the household registration that was the same as the husband's before the divorce should be cancelled, and on the other hand, a new household registration should be established.

The termination of the relationship of adoption and recognition should be cancelled, and the reason is the same. Adoption and recognition constitute a parent-child relationship, then the household registration of the parents is the household registration, and the parent-child relationship is not established after the termination of the adoption and recognition relationship, so one party should cancel the household registration established due to the parent-child relationship, and on the other hand, establish a new household registration due to the termination of adoption and recognition.

Q: How do I apply for personal household registration or simultaneous household registration for a family?

A: The person applying for household registration is called the applicant. Household registration registration is based on the applicant himself or the head of the family. When applying, the applicant should obtain an application form from the Bao Office or District Office (Township Office in the county) in the current residence or place of departure, fill it out according to the format, and report it to the District Office through the Bao chief for registration.

Yesterday was the first meeting, and only the future review methods were determined. From today, rice shops or rice shops will jointly evaluate the prices of the rice grains they have purchased in the joint market in the morning, and then send the rice samples and prices to the review committee at 2:00 pm every afternoon. The prices approved by the review committee must still be approved by Mayor Wu before the rice shops can sell the rice according to this price. Therefore, in one or two days, in addition to the grain distributed by the authorities, the rice shops will supply white rice purchased by them. The rampant black market rice will be defeated without being attacked.

Also, Ji Mingqi, the chief of the Grain Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday that a large batch of Brazilian rice can be allocated today, and the quantity is very large. Grade A rice shops can be allocated 30 dan, Grade B 20 dan, and Grade C 10 dan. The price of this Brazilian rice will also be announced today. Also, the rice allocated yesterday totaled 5,180 dan, and the rice allocated in the four, five, and six days totaled 18,012 dan and five dou. A total of more than 20,000 dan of rice have been distributed successively. In theory, there should be no panic in the market. In fact, the rice distributed is enough to meet the needs of Shanghai citizens.

The price of flour is still unchanged, weak in the morning and strong at noon. The sales of wheat are still lazy, soybeans are decorated with a small 5-600 yuan, wheat bran is a small 1-200 yuan, oil prices are mediocre, and bean cake is strong.

### Short Sellers Replenish and Public Bonds Rise

After the public bonds stabilized the day before yesterday, they continued to rise yesterday. Some financial institutions replenished their short positions. Since the opening of 480 yuan, Tongbing rose to 600 yuan, and then it was slightly flat. As a result, it rose 100 yuan compared to last Saturday, Jia Yi rose 70 yuan, Ding rose 50 yuan, and Wu Zhong also rose 80 yuan.

### Taiwan Sugar Corporation Conflicts with Merchants Over Profits, Direct Allocation Will Be Necessary When Required

Yesterday, Premier Song Ziwen and Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei received reporters from various newspapers in the City Government meeting room to explain that if the Baoyuan Committee and the Taiwan Sugar Corporation established by the Taiwan Governor-General's Office are indeed raising prices as a pretext, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the competent authorities will thoroughly investigate and suspend operations. Mr. Song Yixin, manager of the company's Business Department, also made the following statement:

Due to transportation difficulties in Taiwan, sugar cannot be purchased in large quantities, which is the only reason for the high market price. Secondly, domestic sales are also very smooth, so supply and demand are disparate. The only solution now is to prohibit sugar merchants from engaging in speculative practices in the market. When necessary, emergency measures will be implemented, namely: (1) direct allocation to users or sale in dry goods stores; (2) restricting illegal transactions by sugar merchants and stipulating a legal profit margin. Mr. Song absolutely denied competing with the people for profits. He said: "It is acceptable to accuse our company of competing with merchants for profits, but it cannot be said that we are competing with the people for profits. The company's business objective is to benefit the general public, and sugar merchants who seek to make excessive profits may be subject to sanctions."

### Raw Silk Loan Arrangement

[This City News] Various silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have requested loans from banks to actively produce silk and ship it abroad to earn foreign exchange, as they have no funds to pay silk workers. After several discussions between the Central Bank, the China Silk Corporation, and several banks providing loans to silk factories, both parties decided that the Central Bank would temporarily advance funds, with the China Silk Corporation responsible for managing the loans. Ninety thousand yuan will be lent per "dan" (unit of weight) for silk grading 11-12, and one hundred ten thousand yuan per "dan" for silk grading 13-15. The total loan amount is 10 billion yuan, to be completed within four months. All three parties will sign an agreement, which is expected to be formally signed and implemented today or tomorrow. It is estimated that 10,000 "dan" of raw silk, worth approximately US$12 million, can be produced within three months.

### Yang Xiaotian and Others Organize a Production Service Cooperative

[This City News] Yang Xiaotian, Li Mingyang, Peng Bingcheng, Tao Zefeng, and others recently initiated the organization of the China Production Service Cooperative. Its business includes entrusted buying and selling, customs clearance and transportation, display and consignment sales, etc. The head office is located in Shanghai, with a capital of 100 million yuan. It is said that services will begin soon.

### Cigarettes Subject to Increased Tax and Price Hikes

It has been learned that the Goods Tax Bureau began adjusting the unified cigarette tax yesterday. Various types of cigarettes have generally increased by more than 20%. The market is fluctuating significantly, with prices rising by about 5% to 10%. However, due to the high cost of production, manufacturers have little profit to gain. After the tax increase, they will have difficulty surviving. Cigarette manufacturers have unanimously requested Director Fang of the Bureau to postpone the tax increase and have voluntarily stopped purchasing tobacco.

### Guangdong Brokers Drive Prices Up, Speculative Funds Follow, Chinese Stocks Gradually Re-emerge, Foreign Stocks Transition From Struggling to Stability

Chinese stocks suddenly rebounded yesterday, with Guangdong brokers driving up prices. Money houses and retail investors with surplus funds actively invested. Large stocks showed their strength upon opening, and buying interest was strong. At the peak, Yong Yarn rose to 463 yuan, Meiya to 2900 yuan, Jingfu to 197 yuan, Xinguang to 220 yuan, and Dongya to 170 yuan. After noon, the market weakened slightly. Unfavored stocks were not yet favored and there was no significant tension. As a result, Yong Yarn and Meiya closed up 10% to 15% higher than the previous day, Liangfu rose by 5%, and Dongya and Xinguang each rose by 10%. Small and medium-sized cold stocks only formed small rises, and veteran stocks remained flat with no progress.

Foreign stocks also showed some stability, but the situation was far less favorable than Chinese stocks, mainly because many held inventory that continued to be temporarily sold. Upon opening, Yisha rose from 7200 yuan to 7600 yuan, then began to struggle. After fluctuating, Yisha, British & Chinese Corporation, and Deji all closed up around 5% compared to last Saturday, while the rest remained stable.

### Looking at Shanghai Education Through Numbers

Average: One in Every 31 People Receives Education

Shanghai has more than 300 public schools at all levels. It is impossible to describe them all in a short article, so this article will only provide a general report based on the numerical data obtained from interviews.

First, we must ask: How many public schools are there in Shanghai? How many students are there, and how many teachers are there? The numbers in the table below are all statistical data from June of this year.

### The Growth of Shanghai Education

Written Collectively by the Newspaper's Interview Department

The total number of students is more than 110,000. Based on Shanghai's total population of 3.44 million (population statistics from the Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department in May), one in every 31 people receives education. This ratio does not seem very low, and in fact, the school-age population is only a portion of the 3.44 million. Adding the total number of students in private universities, church universities, and various private primary and secondary schools, it can be said that education in Shanghai is already quite widespread.

The ratio of teachers to students varies greatly at different levels of schools. In higher education institutions, there is an average of one teacher for every six to seven students. In secondary schools and Western schools, there is an average of one teacher for every ten students. In primary schools, there is nearly one teacher for every forty students, while in people's schools and remedial schools, there is only one teacher for every sixty students. It seems that there are too few people in society who are enthusiastic and dedicated to fulfilling their obligations. (Here, it may be helpful to compare with the statistical data from New York State in 1944. New York State has a population of 14 million, 1.6 million students in public schools, and 70,000 teachers, averaging one in every ten people receiving education and one teacher for every twenty students.)

Regarding the different qualifications of teachers, the Education Bureau has surveyed more than 1,000 primary school teachers and more than 200 secondary school teachers:

It can be seen from the table above that a considerable number of university graduates are working as primary school teachers, which is somewhat of a "waste of talent." On the other hand, there are also some high school graduates teaching in secondary schools, which may be "difficult to handle." Fortunately, the percentage is not large.

The funding for schools at all levels has been increasing every month this year. It was about 110 million in January, 150 million in February, 180 million in March, 320 million in April, and 330 million in May. The allocation in May was as follows: 230 million for national education, 60 million for secondary education, 6 million for vocational education, and 20 million for social education. Clearly, the majority of the funding is used for national education, which is a very correct policy.

The equipment and teaching conditions of all public schools are difficult to compare due to differences in nature and scale. In fact, apart from universities and vocational schools, the quality of a school and its ability to cultivate talent mainly depend on the quality of the teachers. Therefore, how to improve teachers' salaries so that they can have a stable life and focus on teaching is a pressing issue today.

### Eliminating "School Shops" - The Bosses Get Rich, the Teachers and Staff Suffer

It is heartbreaking to say that in Shanghai, where everything is based on money, the education system, which has always been regarded as sacred, has also been distorted by "money." Noble schools have become commercialized "school shops."

This is a unique product of big cities!

Such School Shops

Rent a Shikumen house in an alleyway, use the living room as a large hall and classroom, the back building as an office, the side rooms as classrooms, exercise in the courtyard, and rent out the remaining drying platform. The principal is yourself, the accounting director is your wife (profits cannot be leaked), the general affairs director is your brother-in-law, and the guidance director is your own brother. Hire a tea server and a few female teachers who have just graduated or have not yet graduated, and the personnel aspect is complete. Students are of course recruited from outside, but there are preferential measures: a discount for each person who introduces a classmate to come along, and so on. Discipline can be slightly lenient, and those with poor grades only need to pay extra for tutoring after class. However, students must be responsible for cleaning the classroom every day to cultivate the habit of labor (in reality, even one tea server is too busy). Students are allowed to eat snacks, which are sold by the school's cooperative. Textbooks and workbooks are not allowed to be purchased outside, in order to ensure uniformity. This kind of alleyway primary school is the typical "school shop."

There is a type of cram school that offers many courses. Choosing one course costs tens of thousands of yuan. The slogan对外 is to recruit out-of-school students. Surprisingly, they even arrange special programs on the radio. In movie theaters, there are even more slideshow advertisements. This method of attracting students is not much different from the aggressive sales tactics of ordinary merchants. But it is said that many students are lured in. However, after paying a large tuition fee and attending one or two classes, they feel that it is not as "fascinating" as the advertisements said. As a result, they all withdraw one by one. Thus, the "school shop" owner's anticipated goal can be achieved.

Tuition Distribution

I remember that the Ministry of Education seems to have stipulated that 70% of the school's tuition revenue should be used for teachers' and staff salaries, and 30% should be used for other expenses within the school. Let us use this standard to explain the current operating situation of "school shops"!

Suppose the tuition revenue at the beginning of the semester is one million yuan, the clever "school shop" owner will cleverly utilize it. They may lend it out at high interest rates, or use it for speculation. Teachers' and staff salaries are paid at the end of each month, or even repeatedly delayed. The principal uses the monthly interest to pay teachers' and staff salaries. As for the 30% of school expenses, rent has not increased much compared to before the war, and the consumption of chalk and ink can be offset by the profits of the cooperative. Before the war, schools provided tea in the summer, but now we see that elementary school students bring their own bottles of water, which shows that some schools have even saved this expense.

With this calculation, the boss receives one million yuan at the beginning of the semester, and may still have one million yuan at the end of the semester, with not a single cent missing! If the speculation is successful, it may even be doubled several times.

However, there are also unlucky bosses. For example, the ×× primary and secondary school on Beijing Road failed in stock speculation and lost so much money that they could not even pay teachers' and staff salaries, which is very tragic.

Teachers Suffer

The "school shop" enriches the bosses, while the teachers and staff suffer. They are busy all day long, and have a high stack of papers to grade every day. However, what they earn each month is not enough to maintain their personal lives. Fortunately, the school recognizes their weaknesses and exclusively hires young, low-paid female teachers with family responsibilities or unqualified teachers. Even so, for the sake of their jobs, these poor teachers and staff have to curry favor with their superiors. For example, teachers and staff at a certain primary and secondary school on Ximen Road in this city have to give gifts to the affairs director (the principal's wife) during the New Year and holidays; otherwise, the boss may be rude to you!

In Shanghai, some schools entrust banks to collect tuition fees when school starts. There is also a mutually beneficial condition in this. The bank can immediately use this huge sum of money, but it must agree that the school can overdraw from the bank. This is also a great convenience for some "school shop" owners.

Severe Condemnation

However, it must be said that the emergence of "school shops" has its own objective environment. Shanghai has many school-age children, and the municipal and some well-performing private schools cannot accommodate so many people. Therefore, even if you open "school shops" one by one, you don't have to worry about customers coming to your door. Therefore, to eliminate the term "school shop," on the one hand, it is necessary to make those engaged in education recognize their own sacred and supreme mission. On the government's side, it should also strictly supervise and improve various private schools, and also set up more national schools to accommodate school-age children.

Of course, education is education, and business is business. It is not wrong for a school principal to operate another business. We will not only treat the school like a store, aiming solely to make money. We can only call it a "school shop" and condemn it severely without hesitation!

### School Survey - Provides Research Data for Educators at All Levels, a Reference for Parents Choosing Schools for Their Children, and a Guide for Students Pursuing Further Education

We all know that there are many, many schools in Shanghai, but what is the total number? How many are municipal? How many are private? Which schools have a longer history and better facilities? How many schools were there before the war, and did the number increase or decrease after the war? How does the number of students compare?… These many questions may be something that people who are usually concerned about education would like to know but are difficult to investigate at one time. The reporter has collected information from various sources and made a more detailed statistics. With the great assistance of Shi Chongpeng, the section chief of the Statistics Section of the Education Bureau, the following table has been completed. If this can be used as part of the data for education researchers, a reference for parents when choosing schools for their children, and a guide for students pursuing further education, then the reporter will feel extremely relieved.

According to the numbers in the statistics above, we can know that the number of schools established after the war is almost double that of before the war, and the number of students has also increased by about one fold. The main reason for this phenomenon is naturally because the population was concentrated in Shanghai during the war. Most schools are not fully equipped, and because the school buildings are small, most schools implement a half-day system, with middle schools in the morning and primary schools in the afternoon. Naturally, there are many disadvantages. It is said that the education authorities have been prohibiting and eliminating it, but this is a social problem, and the half-day system is difficult to abolish before the housing shortage can be resolved.

During this war, the schools that suffered the greatest losses due to the destruction of school buildings were Wuben Girls' High School, Jingye Middle School, Aiguo Girls' High School, and Qixiu Girls' High School, etc. Almost nothing was moved out. It is indeed unknown how much difficulty they went through to re-establish the schools. The only comfort for these hard-working people is that the work of re-establishing the schools is relatively smooth, and the number of students has increased rather than decreased. Moreover, most of the students are old students, because most people are always conservative, and once they have faith in a certain school, they really do not want to transfer schools casually.

### The Earliest Public and Private Schools - Which Schools Have the Longest History

Shanghai, after all, is a cultural center. There are about 1,050 public and private vocational, secondary, and primary schools. Among these many schools, which ones were the earliest to be established? The reporter can give readers a brief report here.

Public Schools

(1) The earliest public university to be established can be said to be National Jiaotong University - Jiaotong University was originally Nanyang Public School, founded by Sheng Xuanhuai in the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign (Qing Dynasty). It was approved by the imperial court to have the expenses issued annually by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the China Telegraph Administration. Later, it was renamed eight times in total, and it was not until the winter of the 17th year of the Republic of China that it was renamed Jiaotong University.

(2) The earliest secondary school to be established was Shanghai Guangfangyan Hall, which was approved by Jiangsu Governor Li Hongzhang in the 2nd year of the Tongzhi reign (Qing Dynasty) (49 years before the Republic of China) to study foreign languages. Students were selected from outstanding children under the age of 14 in the vicinity. In addition to foreign languages, the curriculum also included classics, history, and elementary school. At that time, the school was located in front of the old school. In the 31st year of the Guangxu reign, the Ministry of the Army named it the Military Industry Special School.

(3) The earliest municipal primary schools were established in the 28th year of the Guangxu reign (Qing Dynasty). Three schools were established at the same time: Meixi Academy was renamed Meixi Primary School, Jingye was also renamed Jingye School from Jingye Painting Academy, and Yangzheng School was also established at the same time.

(4) The earliest teacher training school was the Teacher Training Institute established by Nanyang Public School, founded in the 23rd year of the Guangxu reign.

Private Schools

(1) The earliest university is St. John's University. The American Episcopal Church founded a school in Shanghai in the 25th year of the Daoguang reign (Qing Dynasty) (1845 AD), which was later renamed St. John's College, and was not renamed a university until the end of the Guangxu reign.

(2) The earliest secondary schools are Xuhui Public School and Qingxin Middle School.

(3) The earliest primary school is also the primary school attached to Xuhui Public School Middle School.

(4) The earliest private school for cultivating teachers was the Teacher Training Institute established by Xiang Wenrui and others, which was established around the 30th year of the Guangxu reign.

### The Door to Practical Knowledge - Technical Training Institutions - Remedial Schools

Speaking of Shanghai's vocational remedial schools, the longer-established one can be said to be the China Vocational Remedial School attached to the China Vocational Education Society. This school had seven branches before the war, and only three schools remain now. The purpose of this remedial school is to teach practical knowledge and skills, train service ethics, and improve employment efficiency. Therefore, their organization is designed to consider the students in every way. Therefore, they are divided into morning classes, day classes, and evening classes, allowing students to choose their own free time and courses. After the decision is made, the school authorities will assign them to the corresponding level.

Fees

As for the fees, they are based on the subject units and levels. A small number of miscellaneous fees are also charged. In the first semester, each subject is 500 yuan for the second level and 2,700 yuan for the advanced level. It is said that starting from the next semester, the fees will be adjusted according to the regulations of the Education Bureau.

Subjects

The current subjects include: university preparatory courses, business courses, women's remedial classes, Chinese and English typing courses, civil engineering specialty, Chinese shorthand courses, and adult literacy classes. The adult literacy classes are specially designed for those who are illiterate or slightly literate. As long as they bring their own books and lectures and pay a miscellaneous fee, everything is free.

Teachers and Students

It is said that in the spring semester of the 35th year, the number of students in the first school was about 1,000. On average, each student chose three subjects. Therefore, all seven classrooms were occupied from 7:10 a.m. to 9:20 p.m. without a break.

There are a total of 35 teachers and staff. They live in extreme busyness and tension every day. However, the remuneration they receive is 700 yuan per hour. If they have eight hours of classes a day, they will only earn 168,000 yuan a month. In fact, it is absolutely impossible for one person's energy to last for eight consecutive hours, not to mention that there are many papers to grade! Therefore, the current teacher salaries are really the thinnest.

Hope

Here, the reporter hopes that the school authorities can give adequate salaries that can provide a decent living to the poor teachers and staff in a reasonable proportion of all tuition and miscellaneous fees, and also hopes that the education authorities can provide a portion of the subsidies so that those who are truly educating for the sake of education will not be discouraged from changing careers. At the same time, they also hope that the government can pay attention to the importance of this type of remedial school and set up more of them throughout the country in the future to help those who already have jobs but still aspire to further their studies, giving them a chance to continue their studies diligently.

### Director Gu of the Education Bureau Inspects the Central National School in the Sixteenth District

[Report from this newspaper] Director Gu and Deputy Director Li of the Municipal Education Bureau have been inspecting various schools throughout the city in recent days, giving instructions on improving various aspects. They have also recorded this in this newspaper. It is now heard that the two directors visited the Central National School in the Sixteenth District of Hongkou again the day before yesterday, staying for two hours. They expressed great satisfaction with the school's re-establishment work and gave very detailed instructions on the method of adding grades in the next semester.

Education in our country has always been considered backward. Shanghai is different because it is a city. However, most families still do not regard their children's education expenses as a necessary expense. A friend told me a story about his childhood schooling. In order to buy a pencil, he asked his mother for three copper coins, but what he got was not money, but a scolding. Most parents are like this. They regard their children's tuition as an unnecessary burden, especially if it is spent on girls.

After the victory, this phenomenon has not changed, mainly because life is still so oppressive that parents cannot breathe. If an average family has three children in school, their parents will not be able to bear the burden. This semester has ended, and after a two-month summer vacation, the new semester will begin. How many parents are starting to worry about their children's tuition fees for the next semester!

It is difficult to determine the amount of tuition fees two months before the start of the semester, but we may as well first review the amount of tuition fees for the past semester. At that time, the various private universities and church universities originally set the fees at 45,000 yuan, except for St. John's University, which set the fees at 75,000 yuan, to be paid in two installments of 45,000 and 30,000 yuan. 75,000 yuan was a considerable amount of money half a year ago, but when paying the second installment, it seemed that the amount of 30,000 yuan was not very large. Due to the soaring prices, other universities also increased their fees one after another. At that time, the tuition fees for universities were probably between 50,000 and 80,000 yuan.

Private middle schools also pay fees in two installments. The first installment for high school is 12,000 yuan for tuition and 4,000 yuan for miscellaneous fees; the first installment for junior high school is 9,000 yuan for tuition and 3,000 yuan for miscellaneous fees, and it is stipulated that the second installment cannot exceed the first installment. However, that is just a general example. As far as the reporter knows, some of the more aristocratic middle schools charge quite high fees. For example, the high school fees for Yuying, Xuhui, Jinke, and Peicheng are all around 40,000 yuan, and the junior high school fees are all around 35,000 yuan.

### Tuition Review

Generally, private primary schools charge tuition in two installments. The first installment is about six thousand yuan for tuition and two thousand yuan for miscellaneous fees. Regulations state that the second installment cannot exceed the first, but some schools charge around twenty thousand yuan. What about tuition for the next semester? Although not yet determined, it is said there is already a "rough estimate." Church universities charge around three hundred thousand yuan, secondary schools range from a high of two hundred and twenty thousand to a low of sixty to seventy thousand yuan, and primary schools range from a high of one hundred thousand to a low of twenty to thirty thousand yuan. Should we criticize these figures? The problem lies in the unstable prices. After February, school authorities will have another view of the tuition amounts. Tuition fees, for universities, are about forty to sixty yuan, for secondary schools, about twenty-five to forty yuan, and for primary schools, about ten to fifteen yuan. If calculated based on rice prices, the "rough estimates" mentioned above may not seem excessive. However, education and school authorities should not ignore the following phenomena: 1. The current economic situation is not stable and cannot be compared to the pre-war period; pre-war schools had more perfect equipment. 2. Regarding education laws and teachers, current schools, whether in equipment or faculty, inevitably have to make do with what they have; 3. The war has created great wealth and abject poverty, with too great a difference between the rich and the poor; this means there are more poor people after the war than before, and it is more difficult for most people to afford tuition; 4. Teachers' salaries are fundamentally worse than before the war; 5. Various expenditures and expenses of school authorities are more economical than before the war; 6. Most schools still operate on a half-day schedule.

We do not want to prescribe a supposedly fair tuition amount here. However, based on the above six points, school authorities absolutely cannot use rice prices or anything else as a standard to measure pre-war and post-war tuition amounts. Our point is that, in order to save Chinese education and students, the "rough estimates" mentioned above are certainly too high.

### National Dignity

— Shao Fu

Readers, please do not treat the following story as a myth.

Due to the issue of German nationals evacuating, Rundell of the Associated Press had a dispute with Chen Guolian, director of the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Because of this dispute, the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has drawn our attention.

What kind of organization is it? What is happening behind the scenes?

Including the director, it now has thirty employees, and its monthly expenses are two hundred and eighty thousand yuan. As it represents the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Shanghai sees people coming and going almost every day, two hundred and eighty thousand yuan is said to be insufficient even for telephone expenses.

Since its establishment, the office has hosted guests twice. Once was a cocktail party held on the fourteenth floor of the International Hotel, inviting consular officials from various countries stationed in Shanghai and people from all walks of life in Shanghai. That bill amounted to nearly half a year's expenses and has not yet been approved; it is temporarily recorded in the books. The other time was when the Siamese delegation arrived in Shanghai, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs repeatedly instructed them to entertain them properly. So, they hosted two tables at the New Life Club, totaling three hundred thousand yuan. The reimbursement claim was returned three times. The last time, they were instructed to have the guests who accompanied them sign the bill to prove it, because the entire Siamese delegation only had seven members, so why were two tables of guests needed? Therefore, the accompanying guests had to sign to prove it.

The staff often has to worry about meal expenses. Fortunately, there is still income from passport and visa fees. Today, three were signed, bringing in fifteen thousand yuan, which is enough for buying side dishes. Tomorrow, four will be signed, bringing in twenty thousand yuan, so meal expenses are not a problem.

The director dares not go out, dares not socialize, partly because his clothing is not presentable (he certainly doesn't have formal attire), partly because the old car often breaks down midway, and partly because he doesn't have money to reciprocate, and can't keep eating other people's food.

This is the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This is a thousand percent true.

When we usually hear the words "diplomatic personnel," what kind of associations come to mind? What about after you read the brief report above? A friend in the Shanghai court said to the people in this office: "In terms of poverty, you are first, we are second. We are slightly better off than you!"

Yesterday, President Song said at a press conference: Under the torment of the current high prices and cost of living, the most virtuous people are those who complain. So, the people in this office are all complaining, but their complaint is: "Please preserve the national dignity!"

### I Fear Doctors

— Chu Lantian

I long for the medical profession; however, I fear them.

The distribution of doctors is very uneven. In general small towns, most sell medicine while practicing medicine. Although they have a fixed address, they still carry the air of a "traveling medicine man." As for the vast countryside, doctors are as rare as stars in the morning. But this profession appears particularly developed in cities. As for Shanghai, it seems to have exceeded the saturation point, as we can guess from the year-round doctor advertisements.

In addition to the family-inherited doctors, Confucian doctors, and old men filled with "Golden Cabinet" and "Treatise on Cold Damage" knowledge, there are also many newly emerging, quickly-trained doctors in the countryside. They mostly treat medicine as a sideline, a jack-of-all-trades, as the saying goes, "once you put down the rake, you have no broom." Internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics, pediatrics, everything is available, as well as acupuncture - injections. Speaking of injections, let me tell you something. A certain doctor, when injecting into a patient's veins, must first burn three incense sticks to show that the great task is accomplished. You must think it strange, right? No, no, in the remote countryside, there is also a medical treatment method involving drawing lots! One person copies various prescriptions into a notebook. When a patient comes, they randomly flip to a page and use that as the prescription. This kind of funny and absurd man-made immortal method of treating diseases is still prevalent in our world!

The small plants on my younger sister's grave are thicker than my arm, but I can't help but blame our country doctor for her [demise]. Her illness came on very slowly, taking about a month. It was a kind of edema. Perhaps it wasn't a terminal illness in medical terms, but because the war was not yet over, transportation was obstructed, and as a result, she only had to drink dozens of doses of bitter medicine and finally died. What's most pitiful is that when she finally closed her eyes, there was still a doctor there to see her off! This old gentleman did not diagnose the patient's rapid death. He watched his medical experimenter die!

Doctors in the city are very advanced. They have a theoretical basis and scientific surgery. Naturally, there are no legendary strange stories in the field of Chinese medicine, and there is no shortage of masters. Not only that, but there are also many large-scale hospitals for collective treatment. Logically, it should be fortunate to get sick in the city, right? But that's not the case!

A month or two ago, my mother suddenly had abdominal pain and diarrhea after midnight, which was very much like cholera, but at that time, the roads were under curfew, the doctors were sleeping, and the hospital wouldn't open the door. Helpless, she could only eat some Ren Dan and Ten Drops Water-like things. Waiting until dawn, I quickly hired a car to take her to the hospital, got an emergency registration, and waited until eight o'clock before I carried her into the internal medicine clinic and put her on the sickbed. The doctor looked at the registration form and asked me:

"What's her illness?"

I roughly explained the symptoms, and he got up and pressed his hands on my mother's abdomen for a few moments, checking the pulse on both sides for less than a minute. The diagnosis was considered complete. I asked him if it was cholera? He replied, "Hmm –" He replied again, "Hmm –" and then went back to writing his prescription, and instructed me: "Take this to get the medicine, take it and then come back. If it's an epidemic, you must be hospitalized!" Heavens, how would I know if it's an epidemic? He just "hmm"-ed twice. More patients continued to come in, so I had no choice but to carry my mother out again. For the sake of caution, I settled my mother in a wooden seat in the corridor. I planned to complete the hospitalization procedures. Who knew that the third class was full, and the second class required an upfront payment of three hundred thousand yuan and also required a guarantor? This blocked all my courage. Thank goodness, after being busy for half a day, my mother's stomachache stopped, and the diarrhea also stopped. "Let's go back, Lan'er. It's more convenient to have tea and water at home!" I carried my mother again and called a car to go home.

Really, as if by a miracle, after being touched by that doctor; after lying on that sickbed for only a few minutes, without taking any medicine, she got better. Its magic is no less than the great medicine vat "West Market Attractant" of the Song Dynasty, magical to the point that drinking dye vat water could also cure the disease.

After recuperating for two or three days, my mother gradually got better, and I couldn't help but feel sentimental about it. "If I had waited for that doctor to treat my illness, I'm afraid I would have reached the Looking-Homeward Terrace by now?"

This is why I fear doctors, whether in the countryside, in Shanghai, or even anywhere.

### Spider

— Dongfang Jing

Among all the small creatures in the world, spiders are probably the most misunderstood and slandered by humans. Flies and mosquitoes are much more terrible, but women only feel a little disgusted when they see them; when they see spiders, they scream. Of course, the "Black Widow" (a type of spider) has brought a bad name to its kind, but even it is not as black as it is in pictures!

In fact, spiders can be said to be friends of mankind. For centuries, they have waged war against insects, protecting mankind and resisting the all-out attacks of insects. The insects captured by spiderwebs include many pests that spread plagues and destroy crops. But what is the reward that spiders receive? Persecution!

In addition to their outstanding contributions to mankind, spiders also have great talents. The webs they weave have countless uses. They use them to build bridges, to transmit messages, and to make highways. After building a web, they will use a single thread to construct a bridge leading to a secret strategic location – where they also have a home. Spiders, like fishermen, patiently wait for insects to come to their doom.

There are many types of spiders, and the webs they weave each have different ingenious designs. Orange spiders weave meandering webs. Grass spiders weave webs shaped like tunnels, with a lifesaver route underneath, for a quick escape in case of emergency. White-shelled spiders can freely turn yellow, and then turn back to white. Trapdoor spiders dig holes in the ground, and use silk to create a door on top. It requires a pound of pulling force to open this silk door. Freshwater spiders breathe air but live in water.

So, please remember, you should treat them with kindness and respect. They are thrifty little animals, and they are also great allies of mankind in the war against harmful insects!

### Postponement

— Bi Yue

Zhang: Lao Wang, you borrowed the money the day before yesterday. It's time to return it to me today, right?

Wang: I'm sorry, can you please extend it for a few days?

Zhang: No, you promised me that day and clearly told me to come to you today to get it. What reason do you have for postponing it? You promised me!

Wang: I'm really sorry, the ceasefire order has been extended by eight days. Can't we postpone this little thing for a few days? Lao Zhang! I'm sorry!

### "America Also Has Black Markets"

— Ying Dai

In American magazines, beer advertisements are always labeled with the words "moderate drink." But now, it has become an important item in the American black market. Its position is the same as that of meat, butter, and other items that are in short supply. Since the US government explicitly ordered it, merchants who manufacture beer have reduced the amount of grain used in accordance with the order. However, the black market does not become slack due to the reduction in quality. On the contrary, public places and nightclubs are willing to pay $20 for half a barrel of beer, while in the legal market, it can be purchased for only $9. But public places start their night business in the evening, and the beer black market also starts with it, earlier than the legal rationing time, otherwise customers will be reduced. And the authorities who stabilize prices have no way to extinguish this, because although rationing beer is limited to individuals buying it in person, the distributors often ignore that the buyers take it for public or private use.

In the United States, the black market for meat is even more rampant. Chicago, the center of the slaughter industry, has a more thriving meat black market than other places. The Daily News there pointed out that the black market for liquor today is like a peanut compared to the black market for meat. One method for the meat black market is for sellers to sell to people who want more than the amount specified on the ration card at prices exceeding the official price. When packaging, they pack it especially small, so that people see that the meat inside does not exceed the officially set amount. New York meat merchants have seen that this summer, housewives will not be able to buy meat except from the black market, and the situation will be worse than during the war. In New York City alone, 90% of all meat is currently purchased from the black market. And when housewives buy meat, they pay the money and dare not ask how much it weighs per pound, for fear that the police will see it and not allow the purchase, leaving them with no meat to eat. Large slaughterhouses accuse small slaughterhouses of having too many numbers. For example, in New York City, on a certain day in March this year, large slaughterhouses slaughtered 8,936 pigs and cattle, while small slaughterhouses also slaughtered 7,137. The meat of small slaughterhouses is, of course, mostly sold in the black market. So, if the situation does not improve, in the near future, all meat will be sold entirely on the black market.

In addition to beer and meat, other foods also have black markets. For example, in New York, ham costs 40 cents per pound at the official price, but 85 or 90 cents on the black market. In Cleveland, beef costs 53 cents per pound at the official price, but 70 cents on the black market. A merchant in Boston bought butter for 75 cents per pound and sold it for a dollar. In the past few months, he made a lot of money. Many unwanted vegetables are sold along with other items, mostly potatoes. A housewife in New York, in order to buy a pound of onions, ended up buying more potatoes and tomatoes. Residents of Philadelphia buy at least 50 pounds of sugar every day from the black market. The official price is 7 cents per pound, but the black market price is 20 to 25 cents. Undoubtedly, part of the rationed food is smuggled and sold on the black market!

### Inferiority and Superiority

— Gui Ting

"Psychological Complex" at work Gui Ting

Inferiority and superiority are originally very normal, but sometimes one shouldn't feel inferior but subconsciously feels inferior, or one shouldn't feel superior but subconsciously feels superior. This is an abnormal psychological state. It is the result of what psychologists call a "Psychological Complex" at work.

A "Psychological Complex" is a special psychological state hidden in the subconscious. According to the most advanced psycho-analysis, the formation of this abnormal psychological state is related to an individual's childhood life, especially regarding the sexual aspect (the famous psychologist Freud advocated this). There are many types of these states, in addition to the inferiority complex and superiority complex, there are also mixed feelings of inferiority and superiority, feelings of persecution, feelings of guilt, feelings of transferred hatred, etc.

Inferiority complex is a problem that ordinary people, especially young people with neurasthenia, are most prone to. In any situation, especially when encountering tense scenes or in a large crowd, they always feel flushed and uneasy. Sometimes they want to say something, but they stammer and can't utter it; sometimes even their hands don't obey commands, and automatically play the pipa. At that time, they really wish there was a hole in the ground that they could immediately disappear into. People suffering from an inferiority complex are truly pitiful. No matter what, they always feel that they are inferior to others in every way. This psychology will of course have a serious impact on their career development.

Recent psychoanalysis has made great progress and has discovered methods to correct the inferiority complex. A book written by a psychology professor at the University of Paris named "Personal Magnetism" lists some simple treatments. The most common is to guide the patient on how to enhance their own "magnetism," and every morning, facing the mirror, repeatedly tell their reflection the following sentences in a strong tone: "I am your master," "I am stronger than you at all times," "I command you to do this, you must obey me." … Over time, it can enhance one's self-confidence and overcome the inferiority complex. It seems like doing this is like joking. However, the results of the experiment have unexpected effects.

The most obvious example of superiority complex is Hitler's megalomania. This manic psychological state hypnotized himself, so all his words and deeds were controlled by the power of his self-hypnosis. So, as soon as he went on stage, he would rant on and on, gesturing wildly. At that time, he even felt that he himself was Germany, the entire Aryan race, and even God controlling the entire universe. Such megalomania can be said to have developed to its highest peak, and in the end destroyed himself and destroyed Germany. This is indeed the most dangerous and most difficult to treat disease!

There is also another type of person who originally has an inferiority complex. Precisely because of this, they desperately use various methods to cover up their weaknesses, and on the other hand, they engage in behaviors that harm others for their own benefit, or even behaviors that are not beneficial to themselves. Those with severe illnesses may develop into criminals. Most of the bandits who commit murder and arson, and the swindlers who take wealth by fraud, belong to this category.

After the outbreak of World War II, according to the survey by American psychoanalysts, they discovered many examples of mental disorders, whether deep or shallow. Believe it or not, during this war, 850,000 soldiers had to be sent to hospitals for treatment due to mental disorders, and there were also many disputes among civilians caused by the same reasons. These examples can be roughly divided into several types: feelings of persecution, feelings of guilt, and feelings of transferred hatred. The reasons why these abnormal psychologies are formed are roughly:

(1) The housing shortage makes many people feel very uneasy in their minds, and they often get angry and fly into a rage;

(2) The cancellation of leave in times of emergency leads to extreme fatigue and tension;

(3) The war has increased people's hatred of each other;

(4) Parents' control over children has been relaxed due to the war, resulting in the habit of barbaric behavior in the next generation;

(5) Killing people on the battlefield is blamed on conscience, so they always feel that they have committed a crime and cannot get rid of it;

(6) Various unfortunate events that occurred during the battlefield period made it impossible for the person's hatred to be vented, resulting in it being transferred to others.

Therefore, the issue of the "psychological complex" occupies an extremely important position in modern medicine and criminology. In the United States, there are a total of more than 3,500 mental therapy experts. As for our country, I heard that Peking Union Medical College used to have this department, but it is not very clear how well they did. However, we are still considered fortunate, because we still have national spiritual therapy experts such as Zhang Tianshi and Tibetan lamas to save us some face.

### The Mystery of Milk Powder and Flour

— Yan An

A few days ago, I heard a friend say that they got diarrhea from eating the free, rationed milk powder. I was a bit skeptical because such a phenomenon might occur if the milk powder wasn't mixed properly or never boiled. Moreover, the milk powder came from America, so the quality should be good. Recently, my son's school also distributed two pounds of milk powder. I was especially cautious, not only mixing it well but also boiling it in a pot. To prevent my child from getting sick, I tasted it first. When I ate it, a layer of very fine white substance settled to the bottom, and the top looked like a layer of clear water. What's even stranger is that when I first mixed it, it seemed to ferment and increase in volume. When I tasted it, I could detect undissolved flour particles, and the taste wasn't like the Klim milk powder we usually eat. What exactly is this stuff? Could the Americans be deceiving us? What exactly is going on? I hope someone can tell us.

A week ago, the neighborhood chief told me that each household could receive flour. In these times of expensive rice and firewood, hearing about flour was like finding a treasure—how exciting! The next day, I prepared a flour sack and went to the neighborhood chief's place. The neighborhood chief said, "This matter was the village head's doing; he asked me to notify you, but I'm not distributing the flour. Please ask the village head." So, I hurried to the village head's place, but the village head seemed to have no idea about the matter. He was a bit stunned. After a while, he replied, "Since the neighborhood chief notified you, go ask him!" I had no choice but to silently pack up my empty sack and walk back under the scorching sun. Silently, because in these eight years, I've been in the occupied zone and developed a servile nature. Now, although I've been helped by others and finally achieved victory, my servile nature hasn't been liberated. Seeing the current village head, I didn't dare to say much. However, I still don't understand: if nothing was going to happen, why bother making a special announcement?

Indeed, there are too many strange things in the great Republic of China for a small citizen to understand!

### Letter to My Deceased Wife, Feng Jun (1)

— Zhou Shoujuan

Feng:

It's been a whole month since you left me. In this month, I feel like I've lost my soul, just wandering around the garden, dazed, not knowing what to do. I see the lush flowers and trees everywhere, swaying in the wind, but I can't see your thin figure. I shout your name at the top of my voice, but I only hear the birds singing on the branches, and I can't hear your clear, bell-like response. Ah! Where did you go? Where did you go?

Thinking back, we've been married for twenty-nine years and have never been separated for so long. There's a line in an ancient poem, "Counting the nights of reunion by the pillow, except for being away from home, we've always been together." That's exactly how we were. Moreover, I never traveled far, always staying with you. The only time I was "away from home" was one year when I traveled to Huangshan with Chen Dingshan and his wife for ten days. You didn't go with me, but we missed each other so much during those ten days. During the Anti-Japanese War, our family returned to Shanghai from Anhui. Every spring and autumn, I had to return to Suzhou alone to visit this dilapidated home. Then we had short periods of separation, three or four days at least, seven or eight days at most. And there was one time when the demons of 76 Jessfield Road were rampant, and Mr. Wang, the manager of Shen Bao who lived with us in Xiangzhuang, was taken away. Manager Ma rushed to pick me up in a car to stay at the newspaper office for ten consecutive days, making you worried for ten days. Apart from that, it was almost always "nights of reunion" and "always together." Who knew that this time you would quietly leave me, leave me for a whole month without coming back, leaving me alone and longing for you! Ah! Where did you go? Where did you go?

When I wandered around until I was exhausted and returned to the temporary parlor in the wooden shed, I saw at a glance the snow-white altar, white candles, white lanterns, white table coverings, and white mourning couplets. I saw your spirit tablet, your portrait. My tear ducts burst, and I cried out loud. I knew, I knew that you had died, that you had gone to another world and would never return! Alas! I remember when you were sick, you held my hand, with tears in your eyes, and said to me very sincerely, "Dear, I can't live without you, and you can't live without me!" Your words are still ringing in my ears, but you hardened your heart and left forever. Of course, I can't live without you, I'll never be able to live without you. Could it be that you can live without me, that's why you left me without looking back?

Speaking of your health, although you weren't very strong, you never suffered from any serious illness, and you never went to the hospital. However, every summer you suffered from "quansha" (summer fatigue), your body would feel hot, and your appetite would be poor, so your food intake would decrease. But by autumn, you would recover. Who knew that this year's "quansha" came especially early. The symptoms were the same as in previous years, but you didn't care and continued to get up at dawn every day and work as busy as usual. Although you took some Chinese medicine, it didn't seem to help much. I advised you to rest, but you refused to listen, saying that "quansha" was a yearly occurrence and would get better after summer. This time, the "quansha" lasted especially long, until after the Mid-Autumn Festival. The fever finally subsided, and your appetite gradually improved. However, you were still thin and hadn't recovered. I advised you to see a doctor and take medicine, but you declined out of concern for my finances, saying that you would gain weight naturally as long as you could eat. In the last ten days of the twelfth lunar month, I returned to Suzhou. You were busy with all kinds of preparations for the New Year, grinding flour, steaming rice cakes, spring cleaning, and you exhausted yourself for several days. When I returned to Shanghai, you were already sick in bed. You took Chinese medicine, but the fever didn't go down. Zheng got anxious and hurriedly invited his good friend, Western medicine doctor Cheng Zulin, to examine you. After examining you, he said that there was a problem with your lungs and that you had to have an X-ray. So, the next day, I insisted that you go to get one, and I asked Ling to accompany you to the lung sanatorium. You reluctantly agreed, still not believing that you had lung disease because although you coughed sometimes when you caught a cold, you had never coughed up blood. The next day, Zheng brought back the X-ray, and it shocked me. The X-ray showed some shadows on both your left and right lung apices, confirming that you were suffering from that most cursed lung disease. Dr. Cheng comforted me, saying that the disease isn't as serious in middle-aged people as it is in young people. As long as you take good care of yourself, there's hope for a complete recovery. He first prescribed some antipyretic and appetite-stimulating drugs, asking you to take them three times a day. Then he bought vitamin B, vitamin C, and calcium injections, a total of more than sixty injections, preparing to return to Suzhou to inject them, because we had already decided to move back to our old home in Suzhou after the Lantern Festival.

### Sex Education for Girls in Puberty

— Yan Juan

(1) During Menstruation

When a girl reaches puberty, her sexual organs develop fully, and menstruation begins. During this period, the most important thing a mother should do is to tell her daughter how to handle it and pay attention to hygiene.

The hygiene of menstruation, simply put, is to keep clean, because at this time, the sexual organs are congested, the epithelium of the uterus sheds, and there are small wounds inside the uterus. Germs can easily breed in the menstrual blood, so local cleaning is very important. But it is best to wash the outside and not take a bath.

At the same time, the spirit is very uneasy at this time, and how to make the spirit calm is also very important.

(2) Sexual Hygiene for Virgins

Generally, parents pay great attention to the hygiene of their children; but they let go of a girl who has reached puberty, which is really wrong. In fact, during this period, changes are most likely to occur in a girl's body and mind throughout her life, so she should be paid more attention than a child.

At the age of puberty, whether male or female, it is not suitable to eat stimulating foods, especially for girls. Because stimulating things can cause sexual desire and make the genitals congested, thus causing "masturbation."

Secondly, pay attention to sleep time. Sleep time and appearance have a deep relationship. If sleep is insufficient, the face will show a tense look, and beauty will be destroyed. Girls must have adequate sleep to make their spirits happy and give the body a good influence. Generally, young women often indulge in reading novels and stay up late, which is already inappropriate. What's more, after reading a novel, they fall asleep and imagine all kinds of fantasies, which causes sexual desire and even leads to "masturbation," which is very dangerous.

During virginity, there is one more thing to pay attention to, which is "homosexual love," which is as harmful as "masturbation," and once you fall into it, it is difficult to get rid of.

The reasons for this bad habit are nothing more than the influence of bad friends and bad circumstances. Female workers in factories and female students in schools often have homosexual love affairs. A virgin in puberty will unconsciously ask for a partner, but if she asks for an opposite-sex partner, she is afraid that society will criticize her, so she becomes close to the same sex and falls into homosexual love. In this case, it is best for the mother and sister to speak frankly and openly with her to help her get out of it. This is the best way.

(3) Sexual Organ Diseases

The causes of sexual organ diseases in virginity are mostly due to poor health during menstruation, or "masturbation," or due to congenital diseases, or due to weak physique.

Generally, people think that women's sexual organ diseases only occur after marriage, which is wrong. And it is also wrong for young women to be ashamed to ask a doctor for treatment after having a sexually transmitted disease for the above reasons. You should know that this kind of disease or sexual organ abnormality in virginity has a great impact on future married life, and both parents and the person themselves must pay attention to it.

In short, the most important thing for the sexual organ hygiene of virgins are the two words "cleanliness," because this part and the urinary organs are often moist, and if they are not clean, it is easy to cause vulvitis, and because grape-shaped bacteria are easy to adhere to the mucous membrane and reproduce, inflammation can also occur.

### This hairstyle is most suitable for beaches or tennis courts. The bun hanging on the neck has a rustic charm. The hair in the front is brushed back and tied in the middle with a hair band, so that it will not be scattered even in a strong wind.

### If you want shiny hair, this style is the most suitable. The hair at the back is curled inward, and with the help of white hairpins, the hair in the front maintains a soft wavy undulation.

### Training Children

— Translated by Chen Xing

Playing with a wooden truck together

I have two brothers who often quarrel over playing with that wooden truck, so they often argue, but my father can't afford to buy a new one so that they each have one. What should I do?

So one night, my father said, "You often quarrel over this truck. Now I'm going to stipulate that you take turns playing with it for a week, but during that week, the person playing with it has to carry firewood to the kitchen to fill the wood box. The person who doesn't have a turn can do whatever game they like."

At first, they thought this agreement was very fair, but soon they found that it was too lonely to work and play alone, so they started playing together again, working together every day to carry firewood to the kitchen. From then on, they no longer quarreled over the wooden truck.

Here is a hairstyle that can be used in a summer night palace. The small braid tied on the top of the head has an artificial beauty. A curve of hair hangs to the back of the head, and four flowers add to the charm. This hairstyle shows a mixed style of girl and lady.

### Science Proves the Greatness of Motherly Love

— Liu Zongwen

Usually, when we praise the greatness of motherly love, we often only have a vague concept.

Now, with the progress of science, it has been proven that motherly love is indeed great.

Dr. Bran of the National Mental Health Association in the United States said: Infants who receive sufficient maternal affection often start speaking earlier.

Dr. Baudemeck's research on delinquent teenagers proves that every child who cannot adapt to the social environment lacks a harmonious relationship with their parents in childhood.

The results of experiments at New York's Brifford Hospital prove that sick children who are cared for by their mothers or "surrogate mothers" recover more easily.

Dr. Hayes in the United States ran a nursery and used scientific methods to test it. The results proved that infants who are loved and caressed gain weight more easily and are less likely to get sick.

These scientific facts fully prove the need and greatness of motherly love.

### A Box on the Fireplace

A friend of mine, who has eight children, often encounters children asking him for money to buy what they need, and he often has to deal with it. Later, he came up with a rule and said to the children: "If you want to buy something, tell me first, and I will put the money you need in the box on the fireplace, but you must not touch it for a week. If after a week you still feel you need that thing so much, you can take the money out of the box to buy what you need. If your need for that thing diminishes after a week, you can take the money out of the box and deposit it in the bank."

This rule has been implemented since they were children and turned into adults, and their bank deposits have also increased to a considerable amount as they grew older, so the things they bought were also more valuable.

### The Three Compilations of Miscellaneous Dramas and the Musicians of Wuxi

— Zhao Jingshen

"Three Compilations of Miscellaneous Dramas" was compiled by Zou Jin of Wuxi. He himself was from Wuxi, so the musicians he associated with were mostly from Wuxi. Therefore, many of the musicians in this book are from Wuxi, and some are from Changzhou near Wuxi. We read Zhou Hui's "Jinling Locked Affairs" and Gu Qiyuan's "Guest Seat Anecdotes" of Jiangning, and we know that most of what is described are musicians from Nanjing; it is the same now. In Zou Jin's "Three Compilations of Miscellaneous Dramas" of Wuxi, most of what is included are musicians from Wuxi or Changzhou near Wuxi.

"Three Compilations of Miscellaneous Dramas" contains thirty-four volumes, one drama per volume. Volume five is Zou Dui Jin's "Empty Hall Talk." The Wuxi Jinkui County Chronicle, Volume 40, Miscellaneous Records, records an anecdote about Zou Dui Jin: "Zou Shujie Dui Jin went north to Beijing in the year of Ding Chou of Chongzhen. When crossing the river and anchoring at Jinshan, a strong wind arose. Shujie saw a boat capsizing, waved his hand and shouted for help, and went out to rescue with gold. Many people competed to row boats and saved eleven people and recovered nineteen dead bodies. He also donated three hundred taels to set up more than twenty lifeboats, called red boats. To this day, those who are good at doing good follow his example. Shujie sold out his assets and returned home, never taking the exam again. His son is Zou Zhongyi, who was selected for the Hanlin Academy." According to the same book, scroll 39, Arts and Literature Chronicle, Zou Zhongyi wrote "Snow Banana Collection."

Volume twenty-nine is Sun Yuanwen's "Starving Dongfang Shuo." Jiao Xun's "Drama Theory," Volume 3, says: "I have always regretted that the songs of the Yuan people did not involve the affairs of Dongfang Manqian, or that they existed but were not passed down. Yang Shen'an of the Ming Dynasty had a scene of cutting meat to leave to his wife, and Mao Xiaoruo wrote "Rebutting Dong Zhongshu's Affairs," both based on official history. Only Sun Yuanwen's "Starving Dongfang Shuo" in four acts, with the Queen Mother of the West as the master, and Sima Qian, Bu Shi, Li Ling, Zhong Jun, and Lady Li as the main characters, is the most authentic, with a tragic and generous spirit residing in the jokes and illusions." The Wuxi Jinkui County Chronicle, Volume 23, Loyal and Righteous, Biography of Sun Yuanwen, says: "Sun Yuanwen, courtesy name Nangong, the youngest son of Ji Gao, a student, had the utmost sincerity, loved drinking, and loved reading. He had read all of the classics, histories, and hundreds of schools. His frame was short, and he took in ancient clothes and crowns. He spoke generously about the affairs of the world, or the successes and failures of ancient and modern times, and exhausted their sources. In the seventeenth year of Chongzhen, he heard that the capital had fallen and the emperor had died for the country; Yuanwen wept day and night. When he heard the poem "Geese" in the autumn, he wrote: "I lived in Jiangnan when I was young and did not hear the mourning of the geese. Tonight, clear tears on my pillow, I know you came from the old capital." Before long, he coughed up blood between the stools, and died when the tears were exhausted. In the forty-first year of Qianlong, he was granted admission to the Shrine of Loyalty and Righteousness." Also, in the same book, Volume 39, Sun Yuanwen wrote "Sunny Day Clogs" and "Stupid Nunnery Collection."

Sun Yuanwen's good friend was Huang Jiashu. Volume 30 of the Miscellaneous Drama Compilations records Huang Jiashu's "Chengnan Temple." The "Little Records of Tin More Knowledge" (preface dated Qianlong 17th year, compiled by Huang Hong) Volume 14, Listening to the Seventeen Sons Club, says: "Corresponding to the Jisha and Fushe from afar, there is a jointly engraved "Manuscripts of the Seventeen Sons Society" that is circulated in the world." Among the surnames of the seventeen sons, Huang Hanchen Jiashu is one of them. The Wuxi Jinkui County Chronicle, Volume 26, says: "Huang Jiashu, courtesy name Hanchen. He was known as a talented student from a young age, and was good friends with Sun Yuanwen. After the change of Jia Shen, Yuanwen died for the festival, and Jiashu abandoned his student clothes. He sat and slept in a small room, refusing to associate with others, and named his collection the Wen Tang Collection to show his ambition. Song Zhi Pu, the prefect, heard his name and wanted to invite him, but he could not. His body was thin and he abandoned himself due to illness. He cultivated silence and had no son. His disciple Ma Hong engraved his posthumous writings, and Su Songling wrote the preface." The same book, Volume 39, Arts and Literature Chronicle, records his "Yanwen Tang Collection" in ten volumes and "Records of Southern Loyalty." Volume 37 records his prose "Records of the Ancestral Hall of the Three Dukes Ouyang Lin and Zeng," which contains the sentence: "The eunuch stole the power, and the three dukes and Donglin began and ended it." Volume 33 records his poem "Passing by the Old Residence of Zhao Zifang," which says: "I remember the past when I struck the building and sang sadly, the birds cry and the moon falls and the wine is full of urns. I regret the road to Xizhou, and the tiger and yellow are empty with the thoughts of Beihai. The pond house still exists but the books are scattered, the clothes and crowns are not old, and the swallows come late. Tian Guang beheaded himself and Jing Ke died, lonely west wind crying for Jianli." Volume 40 Miscellaneous Records says: "Huang Hanchen was on good terms with Sun Ben'an. When Ben'an died for the festival, Hanchen had a letter to Zhang Qiushao saying: "My brother and Ben'an spoke across the river, and their worries were visible in their faces. Ben'an died for the country as expected. As for me, a weak body, still living in the world, eating half a bowl of coarse rice, I don't think I will last long. Only you, brother, pay attention to the literature of my county, which is really reliable. Jiashu wrote while lying sick."

Volume thirty-two is Du Tingqin's "Hygienic Talisman." The Wuxi Jinkui County Chronicle, Volume 16, Election Table, Du Ting's, in the second year of Shunzhi, was a Jinshi in the year of Ding Hai. Also, Volume 39, Arts and Literature Chronicle, has his "Jinlan Collection."

Volume thirty-four is Zou Jin's own "Romantic Tomb." The Wuxi Jinkui County Chronicle, Volume 16, Election Table, in the sixth year of Tianqi, says that he was a Jinshi in the year of Geng Chen.

Volume twenty-seven is Xue Dan's "Zhaojun Dream." Xue Dan was of course also from Wuxi. The Wujin Yanghu County Chronicle records a wealthy man named Xue Dan, but his name and deeds are not similar, so he should be a different person.

Volume twenty-eight is Zhang Longwen's "Qiting Banquet." Although Zhang Longwen was from Changzhou, Wuxi was also within the jurisdiction of Changzhou. The Wujin Yanghu Joint Chronicle, Volume 28, says: "Zhang Longwen, courtesy name Changlin, a native of Wujin, a student of the prefectural school, was outstanding and had a strange air. He lived in seclusion next to the tomb of Jizi. When the large army went to attack Jiangyin, it passed through its territory. Longwen advocated that the villagers resist it, but the crowd collapsed, and Longwen was chopped to death, with wounds all over his body, but he still stood upright by the wall. (Chen Zhizhong: Righteous Shrine Record)

Volumes seventeen to twenty are Zheng Wuyu's four kinds of miscellaneous dramas: "Parrot Island," "Miluo River," "Yellow Crane Tower," and "Tengwang Pavilion." The first page of each drama is signed "Xishen Zheng Yu," which should be Zheng Yu, courtesy name Xishen. But Wang Guowei's "Opera Record" says that he was from Xishen, and he took Zheng Yu's courtesy name as his place of origin. According to, Xishen Mountain is Yushan Mountain, in Wuxi. Therefore, some people say that Zheng Yu is from Wuxi, which seems unreliable.

Because the compiler of the Three Compilations of Miscellaneous Dramas, Zou Jin, was from Wuxi, the musicians he collected in the collection, such as Zou Dui Jin, Sun Yuanwen, Huang Jiashu, Du Tingyi, Xue Dan, and himself, were all from Wuxi. Zhang Longwen was from Changzhou near Wuxi.

Among the other musicians recorded in this book, those whose place of origin can be verified are Wu Weiye of Taicang, the author of volumes 12 "Tongtian Terrace" and "Linchun Pavilion," You Tong of Changzhou, the author of volumes 34 "Reading Lisao" and "Pipa," Mao Wei of Gui'an, Zhejiang, the author of volumes 6 to 11 "Su Yuanweng," "Qin Tingzhu," "Golden Gate Xiao," "Drunk Xin Feng," "Noisy Door God," and "Double Harmony," Meng Chengshun of Kuaiji, the author of volume 21 "Yan'er Mei," Cha Jizu of Haining, the author of volume 24 "Continuing the Western Chamber," and Lu Shilian of Changzhou, the author of volume 31 "Xitai Ji." Taicang and Changzhou are all places near Wuxi.

Those whose place of origin cannot be verified, and some whose names are not even known, are Nanshan Yishi, the author of volumes 12 to 16 "Half-Armed Cold," "Elder Sister Chang," "Zhonglang Girl," "Jingzhao Brow," and "Emerald Hairpin Fate," Zheng Yu, the author of volumes 17 to 20, Zhou Rubi, the author of volume 23 "Lonely Swan Shadow" and "Dream Fate," Bicao Zhuren, the author of volume 25 "Unfinished Fate," Zhang Laizong, the author of volume 26 "Cherry Banquet," and Tushi Daomin, the author of volume 33 "Straightforward Poem Xiao." I guess there are still a few people from Wuxi among them, but unfortunately I can't ask Zou Jin to find out.

### Tomb

— By Masaoka Shiki, Abridged and Translated by Chen Jiayu

To live like this truly has no meaning at all. So, if I could die and be resurrected, take a trip to hell for about a year, and then quietly come back to life during my first death anniversary, giving a public lecture about the inside story of hell, how delightful that would be. But if going to the Western Paradise simply meant the end, then I couldn't be too grateful for that. Though, saying I'm not grateful is nonsense because all things are impermanent, and fortune and misfortune are unpredictable. If tonight the Ox-Head and Horse-Face arrive with the "fiery chariot" (Japanese folklore, the dead are taken away in this kind of chariot) to escort you, you have no choice but to die.  It would be great if I could make a deal, asking for a one-day extension, since my friends are planning to treat me to a night of revelry at "Willow Bridge" (a gathering place for courtesans). But since they're ghosts, they probably wouldn't agree. However, as the saying goes: "Money makes the ghost turn the millstone," so if I slipped a wad of banknotes into their pockets, perhaps the ghosts would yield to me. Unfortunately, I don't have even a single national currency on me. But even without money, one must pretend to have it, lest the ghosts see through you and think you are penniless.

Since death is inevitable, I must leave a will. To die without leaving any memento would be unspeakable.

Oh dear, there's so much noise and commotion in the next room. It sounds like they're debating whether or not to send a telegram saying "critical condition." What's that? It sounds like someone is saying in my ear: Isn't there anything left to say? Alas, how can there be nothing to say? Could you please find a way to borrow some money for me? Just that? No, I like steamed buns, I hope you add more steamed buns when making offerings during the memorial service, please, please.

Why is it so quiet? It's making me feel strangely sad. There's the smell of powdered incense (a Japanese funeral custom where the body is perfumed). I never liked this smell when I was alive, and I still don't like it much after death. There's so much weight pressing on my chest, making my body feel restricted. They must be packing my body with lime. When filling the coffin, they really should have been told in advance to use fresh flowers instead of lime. I forgot earlier, and now there's nothing I can do.

Now we're heading to the cemetery. Judging from the sounds of footsteps and turning wheels, there are probably a hundred or so people attending the funeral. If it were reported in the newspaper, it would undoubtedly say three or four hundred. But, considering my humble self, a hundred or so people is not a small number.

Ah, this truly is the realm of complete death. Until the moment I was carried out in the coffin, I was still somewhat clear, and afterwards, the coffin...the sounds of bells, drums, and various melodies set me on fire, and I vaguely heard people saying things like "What a pity, Lay Buddhist Mu-lian has died." After that, I lost all consciousness. Now I hear a "clunk," and as I look, I am buried in an underground grave. It's truly silent and desolate, completely different from the feeling of seated meditation. Without a doubt, the air of hell is dead.

Ah, so many people have come! Who is it? Oh, it's still those same people from yesterday. Ah, so kind and thoughtful. You must be tired, not fearing fatigue, coming here to see if the burial has been properly completed. I am truly touched and grateful. You may not be able to see me, but I am under the mud and grass, grateful for your commercial friendship and deep kindness. As the saying goes: "The deceased are gradually forgotten," but on the contrary, you are endlessly and continuously honoring the dead. Based on my experience when I was alive, I would usually visit a friend's grave only once, and after that one visit, even though I always intended to go again, I never managed to do so. I pray in the afterlife that you all live long lives.

Time passes quickly. It has already been a year since my death. The memorial tower that my friends contributed money to build for me has been beautifully completed. A marble column stands on a square foundation, which is a bit too elegant. My friends truly went to great lengths for this, and their deep affection for the deceased is truly touching. A few days ago, I encountered two people in the cemetery. From their conversation, I gathered that the memorial tower has indeed been built, but there's no way to publish my manuscript. They want to ask friends for more donations, but since the tower has just been completed, it's not easy to say. Let's wait until next year's anniversary. This statement is unreliable, but on the other hand, even if the manuscript were published a year earlier, it wouldn't necessarily gain much greater fame. It will be good enough if it is published next year. Even if the ghosts laugh at me, I don't care myself. Anyway, since the person is already dead, the achievement can be judged. Really, people won't even come to tend the grave, and of course, there's even less effort to take care of things like manuscripts.

My neighbor in the afterlife, who I suppose is used to living in hell, still remembers the smell of earthworm urine very clearly. Here, I don't care too much about the desolation, but it's painful because my friends don't come, and I have no way of knowing what's happening in the world. What are my friends doing now? I don't know. If my concubine is still herself, then there is nothing I can do, and I must listen to it.

Alas, so lonely. In recent years, I have always been thinking: Maybe someone will come on the anniversary, maybe someone will come on the "Double Seventh Festival," but as a result, no one came. It's been roughly five years since I came here. I don't know what happened to my manuscript. It's probably not published or is making a living by trading. By now, it should have become a small, moderately sized old lady. Did she marry? I don't know. Are the warlords gone? I don't know. Most of the elders must have died, right? I died during the height of the military era. Who is in power now? I don't know.

Oh, it's so cool! There's a somewhat unpleasant wind blowing. It rained a few days ago, and some places have collapsed. The chirping of crickets sounds very close. Why doesn't anyone come to repair it?

Who is coming? At night, reciting poetry and pacing back and forth, it must be a scholar. Oh dear, he's stopped in front of my grave, using the moonlight to read the words on my tombstone. He's even kicking my memorial tower with his foot! This is so impolite. I should transform into a ghost and scare him. But people's hearts are not what they used to be. They are too greedy. If they knew there was a ghost here, they would definitely catch it and put it on display in Asakusa Park to collect admission fees and make money. So it's better to be quiet and not go out. This guy is reciting poetry and walking away.

Recently, those who have come to this place are all here for a purpose. Yesterday, strangely, a scholar wearing glasses came. He kept looking at my memorial tower. It turns out that a magazine has published an essay topic called "Tomb," and he came to gather material. In short, no one comes for nothing these days. Occasionally, there are those who come for no reason, and out of boredom, they randomly knock and destroy the memorial tower, leaving it in an irreparable state.

Ah, so cold, so cold! Now I don't even have skin that can get goosebumps from the cold. The hairs on my body have all fallen out, and I'm practically just bare bones. Alas, even the moonlight, which I thought was the coldest, shines sparsely on the dry bones.

### Victory Ring

— By Feng Qinwei

The V-shaped victory ring that my father personally placed on the ring finger of my left hand is shining brightly. He specially had this ring made for me to commemorate the victory of the War of Resistance. With tears filling my eyes, I gently caress it, as if caressing the thin and veined back of my father's hand. After only two days of painful struggle against the illness, my father was finally taken away from this polluted world by the god of death. Although my father has left us forever, his upright spirit and love will be immortal, shining like this victory ring.

It was in December of last year, not long after the end of the War of Resistance. The world celebrated peace, and every family looked forward to reuniting with their children. At that time, my father, who had suffered a stroke a few months earlier, was also eagerly waiting for his sons to return home, morning and night. When I, covered in dust, carried my travel bag and stepped into the home I had been away from for five years, I slowly walked towards my father's bed. I saw my father. He was sitting quietly on the bed smoking a cigarette. His face, aged and weakened by the burdens of life and the torment of illness, looked even more kind and pitiful. When he suddenly noticed my arrival, he laboriously used his left hand to support himself on the table and slowly stood up, calling out my name in unclear tones, repeating it over and over again. Tears of joy wet my eyes and my heart. I helped him sit down, and he turned around, using his trembling left hand to take out the victory ring that he had prepared long ago from the small leather box beside his pillow, and put it on my finger. He excitedly said to me, "I am so happy, the cruel war will not come again, I want to be with you forever, living a peaceful and happy life." But my father did not achieve his wish and left us so hastily.

What a beautiful and delicate ring this is. The V is placed above a plum blossom, and the ring is set with angel wings on both sides. It symbolizes victory and peace, symbolizing the most precious thing in the world—love.

### Double Perch, Double Flight (79)

— Zhao Qingge

(Fourteen)

Shi Yulou's suicide in protest of the world caused a stir in Beijing's Peking opera circles at the time, and his colleagues felt "the rabbit's death is the fox's sorrow" for a while. Mrs. Mo cried for a long time for the Weng Second Mistress's martyrdom, even making the usually playful and sensible Li Yun feel sad! Li Yun wasn't sad for anything else, but because over the years, the Weng Second Mistress had developed some feelings for her, unlike before, when their relationship was like strangers. However, after a few months, everyone's sorrow faded, and her colleagues and wives gradually forgot about these two unfortunate deceased people! Everyone still had to go their own way for their own lives, and no one could be tired of the world because of the deaths of Shi Yulou and the Weng Second Mistress!

Only Li Hua! She could never reduce her mourning for Shi Yulou's suicide! Moreover, she couldn't forget those unfortunate actors who sacrificed their youth; sacrificed their health; and even sacrificed their lives for "art"! She didn't sympathize and cry superficially like them; she mourned in her heart and remembered in her heart! She often repeatedly recited some of the loyal words that Shi Yulou had imparted to her: A male actor is society's plaything, and a female actor is even more so! A male actor's survival is inherently difficult, and a female actor's survival is even more difficult! Who can avoid illness? Who can avoid old age? When you are sick; when you are old; you have to fall down! Society will no longer look at you directly, and society will no longer hold you up, holding you up like a star, so red! So bright! Shi Yulou fell down, but he was once like a star in the sky! Li Hua, on the other hand, is currently a star in the sky! But one day, she will fade; lose her light; and no longer be so "red"; no longer be so "bright"! So she, too, will fall down like Shi Yulou! Falling into the mud, turning into a stinking, moldy corpse! Every time she thought of this, Li Hua was startled and shivered! She seemed to have already seen, not far ahead, a picture depicting her own fate.
