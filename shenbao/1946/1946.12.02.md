### The Constitutional Draft Can Now Be Reviewed. The National Assembly Holds Its Sixth General Meeting Today to Discuss Grouping and Rosters.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The National Assembly will hold its sixth general meeting on the 2nd. The morning session, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, will be chaired by Bai Chongxi, and the afternoon session, from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM, will be chaired by Bai Yunti. The presidium will consist of Jiang Zhongzheng, Hu Shi, Zhang Lisheng, Gu Zhenggang, Ahemaitijiang, Kong Xiangxi, Huang Guoshu, Ding Weifen, and Guo Zhongwei from the first group. Tian Jiongjin will be on duty. The agenda of the general meeting, in addition to expressing opinions on the constitutional draft, will include discussing the organizational methods of the Root Grass Review Committee, grouping, and roster issues. It is possible that group review will begin as early as the 3rd.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The National Assembly Representatives' Association held a fellowship meeting at the National Assembly First Guesthouse at 10:00 AM on the 1st, attended by over 300 people. Kong Geng, Sun Mujia, and others spoke, creating a lively atmosphere. Important decisions were made as follows: (1) Determine the period for implementing the constitution; (2) Draft a revision of the May 5th Constitutional Draft; (3) Request the assembly to postpone the discussion of the constitutional draft for two weeks. It is rumored that if the constitutional draft is still based on the one promulgated by the National Government, they plan to create their own constitution.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Regarding the term of office of the National Assembly representatives, Representative Zhang Jichuan stated that although the National Assembly Organization Law stipulates that the representative's mission ends when the session ends, if the date for constitutional implementation determined by the assembly must be changed in the future due to circumstances, who will make the decision? The National Government is the highest organ for exercising administrative power, not the highest organ for the people to exercise political power, and clearly has no power to change the decision of the National Assembly. Therefore, in legal terms, the current representatives must re-deliberate. Thus, the termination of the term of office of the National Assembly representatives at the time of constitutional implementation is logically consistent in fact.

[Another Dispatch] The National Assembly Secretariat held a work conference at 10:00 AM on the 1st to review the work of the past month. Secretary-General Hong Lanyou personally presided over the meeting, expressing his appreciation for the hard work of the staff in various units and encouraging them to redouble their efforts in the future to achieve success. During the meeting, each unit raised questions regarding its own work, and Hong provided instructions separately.

### Celebrating the 23rd Anniversary of its Founding, the Youth Party Issues a Declaration Explaining its Views on the Current Situation and the Constitutional Draft

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The 2nd is the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Youth Party. The party is scheduled to hold a press conference at 11:30 AM on the 2nd to report on the party's history.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Youth Party issued a declaration on the 2nd, the 23rd anniversary of the party, explaining the party's attitude towards the current situation and its views on the constitutional draft. It stated in brief: Now that the constitution is progressing from discussion to completion, it is foreseeable that the majority of National Assembly representatives come from the people and must be deeply aware of the people's desire for peace and order. The constitution they formulate will be fair and accessible, capable of promoting national unity, uniting the people's welfare, and a democratic constitution, rather than a biased, stubborn, disruptive, and unable to stop disruption anti-democratic constitution. However, the formulation of the constitution is only one aspect of the country's major policies. During the transitional period from the constitution's deliberation and promulgation to its implementation, the people are suffering, and there are numerous issues to be addressed. How to reform politics, stabilize finance, restore transportation, and promote production, and through domestic consolidation, enhance international status and ensure world peace, all these aspects require the cooperation of all political parties and social elites to strive towards the goal. The party's founding goals are to strive for national unity and independence externally and to strive for the people's freedom and equality internally. If these two goals can be achieved through peaceful means, then it will spare no cost to strive for peace. If they cannot be achieved through peaceful means, then it will spare no cost to engage in revolution. After the Mukden Incident, the party, aware of the severity of the national crisis, prioritized ensuring the country's survival and independence, and began to work hand in hand with various parties in the wilderness to jointly engage in the sacred War of Resistance. After victory, the threat of foreign invasion has temporarily decreased, and the democratic structure urgently needs to be created. It then gathered with parties in and out of the government to advance from consultation to joint constitution-making, aiming to establish a foundation for long-term peace and stability in the country. For 23 years, the goals the party has sought have been gradually realized, but the difficulties ahead still exist. National unity and independence still need to be completed, and the people's freedom and equal rights need to be further protected. This is why the party comrades dare not shirk their responsibility. Today, what the people of the whole country expect is national peace and the construction of a peaceful and prosperous life for the people. To achieve these two goals, it is necessary to resolutely end the turbulent situation of internal and external troubles and constant warfare for 35 years, quickly formulate a constitution recognized by the whole country, and on the basis of constitutional government, complete democratic unification, so that the country's foundation can gradually become stable and peaceful construction can be expected. During the War of Resistance, the party worked together with various parties in and out of the government to lay the foundation for victory. Now, at the beginning of this victory and the beginning of construction, how can it shirk its responsibility? Therefore, at the beginning of the convening of this constitutional National Assembly, the party resolutely advocated participation, and expected leaders of all political parties and social elites to participate together, so that the democratic constitution can be completed as soon as possible and the people's welfare can be guaranteed. The party comrades believe that this hope not only represents the opinions of one party and one faction, but is the common psychology of the vast majority of people in the country. Any democratic party must understand the true public opinion and must decide its own actions based on this public opinion.

### Ma Chaojun Hosted All Vocational Representatives Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Ma Chaojun, Minister of Agriculture and Industry, hosted over a hundred National Assembly vocational representatives, including Wang Xiaolai, Lu Jingshi, and Wen Shaohe, at the Central Party Headquarters at 3:30 PM on the 1st. Ma Chaojun delivered a speech, expressing his deep regret that there was no provision for a vocational representative system in the constitution. It is said that the vocational representative system has a long history in our country. When Sun Yat-sen served as the Extraordinary President in Guangzhou in 1920, he advocated this system and implemented it. The following year, the Guangzhou Municipal Council was established, and some of the representatives were elected by vocational groups. Later, Sun Yat-sen went north and issued a declaration convening a National Assembly, which was convened in Beijing in 1931 and had representatives from vocational armies and women. The election law of 1932 also confirmed the status of vocational representatives, and many local councils also had representatives elected by vocational groups participating. It is a pity that the People's Political Council during the War of Resistance did not have vocational representatives, which was regretted by people both at home and abroad. Sun Yat-sen had already promoted this progressive system 20 years ago, which shows his foresight. Farmers, industrialists, and merchants are the most important elements in establishing a country, while the party, government, and army are only elements in governing a country. If there are only regional representatives and vocational representatives are ignored, then the situation at the lower levels will have no way to reach the upper levels, and all power will be completely controlled by the bourgeoisie, special classes, and local tyrants and evil gentry, forming an unequal phenomenon. I was the earliest advocate of the vocational representative system, and I hope that the most progressive system can be included in this constitution. I also hope that vocational representatives can participate in the provincial, municipal, and county councils in the future. After Ma finished speaking, the representatives spoke one after another, all advocating that efforts should be made to fight for this point. Wang Xiaolai, in his capacity as Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, reported on his contacts with various parties. According to him, when he met with Chairman Jiang the other day, he had personally expressed this hope, hoping that the National Assembly would not forget the farmers, industrialists, and merchants who are the foundation of the country, and must not be lightly regarded or casually dealt with. The representatives elected by the farmers, industrialists, and merchants are the true representatives of the people. To seek national prosperity and strength, it is impossible to abandon the fundamentals and neglect vocational representatives.

### Li Huang Has Been Discharged from the Hospital; Zuo Shunsheng and Others Arrive in Shanghai

[Central News Agency, This City] Youth Party National Assembly representatives Yang Yongjun and Zuo Shunsheng have returned to Shanghai one after another to handle private affairs. On the 1st, Zuo told reporters that after the revised draft of the constitution was submitted to the National Assembly for discussion, two different opinions emerged in the meeting. Some believed that the revised draft could only represent the opinions of the political parties of the Political Consultative Conference and that there were still many points that needed to be revised. Others insisted on using the May 5th Constitutional Draft as a blueprint. The Youth Party representatives did not speak on this matter and planned to express their opinions in the review committee. When asked by reporters about his views on the future existence of the National Political Council, he said that after the current National Assembly closes, there will still be a period of time before the constitution is implemented. During this period, the National Political Council still seems to be necessary, and its powers should also be expanded so that the effectiveness of the public opinion organs can be fully exerted. Zuo is scheduled to take the night train to Beijing tonight to continue participating in the National Assembly. Yang Yongjun is also scheduled to go to Beijing within days. According to Dr. Wu Tianmin, Li Huang was discharged from the hospital on the afternoon of the 1st. His illness has fully recovered. He has not yet decided when to go to Beijing. According to relevant sources, Li did go to Chongqing for a short trip during his illness for recuperation and had no other tasks.

### Mongolian Representatives Host Reporters, Requesting that the Status of the League and Banner Be Confirmed and Autonomy Granted

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The National Assembly's Mongolian representatives held a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters in the National Assembly lounge at 2:00 PM on the 1st. The heads and members of each league and banner representative group attended. The head of the representative group from Hulunbuir Butha of the Jerim League of Mongolia, Jin Yanghao, the deputy head Zhuo Rentuo, and Bao Deben and ten group members. The heads of the representative groups from the Josutu and Juu Uda Leagues of Mongolia, Yun Dan Sangbu, the deputy head Zha Qisichin, and four group members. The head of the representative group from the Alxa Banner, Dalizhaya, and the Ejin Banner, Dawa. Bai Yunti first introduced and gave a speech, stating: The Mongolian issue is the Chinese issue. China is now convening the National Assembly to make a constitution. It is heard that Chairman Chiang advocates adding the Mongolian League and Banner areas to the revised constitutional draft. We also hope to have the following requests when making the constitution: (1) All leagues and banners of the Republic of China are equal, and ethnic minorities living in fixed areas should have their autonomy rights guaranteed. (2) The generation of representatives to the National Assembly should give the Mongolian banners and all counties equal rights. (3) In the election of central government legislators, the Mongolian leagues and departments should elect 30 representatives and 17 supervisory committee members. (4) In the powers of the central and local governments and the local system, the leagues and departments, the provincial banners, and the counties should enjoy equal status and powers. (5) The banner is the local autonomous unit of the Mongolian region. (6) In the national economy, animal husbandry should be protected so that the welfare of herders and farmers can be equally emphasized. Rong Xiang then reported on three points: In terms of politics, since the victory, the banners have handled restoration faster than the provincial government. National identity cards were issued in exchange for enemy and puppet good citizen certificates, but when the provincial government returned, these identity cards were torn up, causing serious problems. We do not want to be exempted from taxes or conscription, and hope that the central government will handle it reasonably. In terms of economy, the banners cannot obtain agricultural loans and relief materials. In terms of education, it is hoped that those who run education in the central government can generally take care of the Mongolian compatriots in the banners. Jin Yanghao then reported on the current situation of the Mongolian banners in the Northeast, stating briefly that the focus of the banner issue is in Wangye Temple. When the 815 victory was achieved last year, the Mongolian compatriots expected the central government to go to take over. When Outer Mongolia announced its independence on August 24 and Tibet had a high degree of autonomy, some people believed that after Outer Mongolia became independent, the Mongolian issue had been resolved. However, Inner Mongolia has a population of 2.8 to 2.9 million, various special products, and more than 7 million heads of livestock. Inner Mongolia can be allowed a high degree of autonomy, and Inner Mongolia also launched an initiative. On January 17, 18, and 19 this year, the All-League General Assembly was held in Wangye Temple, deciding to request the Mongolian banners to be autonomous from the Republic of China. Later, due to the military and economic pressure of the CCP, it moved from Wangye Temple to Hailar. However, they still wanted to contact the central government. In January of this year, it sent a military representative to contact the central government, but when they arrived in Beiping, government officials dissuaded them, saying that the government was busy with restoration. The representative's opinions originally had the following points: (1) What is the central government's policy towards Mongolia? (2) Will the resolutions of the Central Plenary Session on the Mongolian issue be implemented? (3) How will the troops returning from Hailar be arranged? (4) Are those who worked in the puppet Mongolian government considered to have committed a crime? How the central government will answer is still unknown, but they do not want to listen but want to see the 22 Mongolian banners in the Northeast. Only three banners have been restored, and they have only been delivered to the provincial government. There is a lack of funding, and in fact, they have not yet been restored. At the time of victory, the private property of the banners was more than 40 billion circulating notes, and the public property was more than 3 billion, all of which were lost. I now hope that the government will: (1) Issue restoration funds. (2) Restore education as soon as possible. At the same time, the status of the banners should be clearly stipulated in the constitution, the relevant resolutions of the Second Plenary Session concerning the banners should be implemented as soon as possible, and more funds should be allocated for relief. Zha Qisichin then reported the following: (1) The purpose of going to Beijing is to pay tribute to Chairman Chiang and report the local situation to the central authorities and state the hopes and pains of the Mongolian people. (2) Regarding the National Assembly, I hope to follow Sun Yat-sen's teachings and formulate a constitution that allows all ethnic groups in the Republic of China to survive equally and share prosperity, and to determine the autonomous rights of the ancient ethnic groups and the status of the leagues and banners. (3) The Mongolian autonomy movement is the unanimous demand of all Mongolians. (4) Regarding the government, I hope that the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session on border issues will be implemented as soon as possible. (5) I hope that the government will grasp the reality of Mongolia and reform its policy towards Mongolia so that the complex situation in Inner Mongolia can be clarified. (6) The vast majority of the people in Inner Mongolia unanimously support the government and are willing to implement autonomy under the Three Principles of the People. Finally, Bai Yunti made a conclusion, hoping that reporters could speak out more for the small ethnic groups. The meeting dispersed at around 4:00 PM.

### Under the Condition of Not Harming Friendship, the National Army Will Take Over Dalian; The Communist Army is Preparing to Withdraw, and All Materials Have Been Moved Away

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] Sources related to the matter said that under the condition of not harming friendship, the National Army may take over Dalian in the near future. The Communist Army in that area is preparing to withdraw, and all important materials have been moved away. Some have been transported to Jiaodong, and a certain army has made arrangements in Longtutang on both sides of Lushun.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] Official intelligence: The Northeast continues to advance south from Fuxian and has gradually entered the periphery of Dalian.

### The Issue of Inner Mongolian Autonomy: Representatives from Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan Advocate Granting Regional Autonomy; Counties Can Be Abolished Where Mongolians Outnumber Han Chinese

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan National Assembly Representatives Association held a press conference at the National Assembly Hall lounge at 10:00 AM on the 1st. Suiyuan representative Pan Xiuren, Chahar representative Ma Daying, and Rehe representative Cheng Pengyi gave reports respectively. The main points are recorded as follows: (1) Currently, people across the country are concerned about the issue of Inner Mongolia, but some may not be clear about it. (2) The situation in Inner Mongolia is definitely different from that in Outer Mongolia and Tibet because Inner Mongolia is an area where Han and Mongolians live together, and there are also intermarriages. This is not only the case in the county, but also in the banner. (3) According to statistics of Han and Mongolian people in the provinces, Suiyuan has a population of more than 2.3 million, of which Mongolians account for about 150,000. Chahar has a population of more than 2.9 million, of which Mongolians account for about 80,000. Rehe has a population of more than 7.8 million, of which Mongolians account for more than 200,000. Except for a few Mongolian compatriots in remote areas who still maintain a nomadic lifestyle, their lifestyles are mostly the same, and they can speak Mandarin and learn Chinese. (4) Rights and obligations: In terms of rights, Han and Mongolians are equal. In terms of obligations, Mongolian compatriots have always been valued. During the War of Resistance, they were not conscripted or taxed. (5) We sympathize with the principle of autonomy for the Mongolian banners, but it should be regional autonomy, that is, local autonomy. Our proposals are as follows: (1) Equal autonomy based on the local people in the same place, regional autonomy. If Mongolians outnumber Han Chinese, then the Mongolian compatriots should be responsible for local administrative responsibilities. The county government can also be abolished, but one place must not have two administrative agencies. (2) If there are fewer Mongolian compatriots in the county, the Mongolian compatriots should also be guaranteed their due rights and political status. (3) The central government can give Mongolian compatriots preferential treatment everywhere. (4) Mongolian banner education should be specially subsidized. (5) No more land should be opened up in undeveloped areas. (6) More health institutions should be established, and livestock should be improved to develop economic life.

### Chief of General Staff Chen Presides Over the Memorial Week of the Central Training Corps

He especially hoped that they would join forces to build the country. After the speech, he convened a meeting of the directors of the branch corps and the heads of the officers' corps to listen to reports and give instructions: (1) The officers' corps is set up for surplus personnel. Unemployed officers who meet the requirements for training can be approved for training before the end of this month. No more will be accepted after the end of this month. (2) Each officer's corps will be reorganized and gradually abolished from today. (3) Outstanding officers will be retained in military positions.

### Three Days and Nights of Fierce Fighting, Communist Troops Defeated Three Times, Stability Gradually Returns to Dongtai City; Communist Troops in Shandong Attempt to Launch a Major Offensive

[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 1st Dispatch] Taking advantage of the ceasefire, Communist troops concentrated their forces to attack the Nationalist army's positions in Dongtai. In self-defense, the Nationalist army counterattacked. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the Communist army's most elite 11th Brigade, 91st Regiment was completely annihilated. More than 400 Communist officers and soldiers surrendered, and over a thousand bodies were left behind. Their plan to attack Dongtai has been completely foiled. The Nationalist army recovered Dingxi at 4 PM yesterday and entered Caojia at 4:40 AM this morning. Before retreating, the Communist troops set fire to nearby villages and massacred civilians in resentment.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 1st Dispatch] It is reported that Caoji, more than ten li north of Suqian, was briefly captured by Communist troops on November 24th.

He left Harbin and returned to Beiping on the morning of the 29th, stopping in Changchun for fifteen minutes to refuel. Regarding the Northeast branch and the US personnel stationed in Harbin, Ye stated that the Northeast branch remains in its current state, and there is one US representative stationed in Harbin, whose name is unknown. Ye denied recent plans to go to Yan'an or meet with Ambassador Stuart under orders from Yan'an. As for the content of his talks with Marshal Marshall, he only said that it involved general issues. In response to a reporter's question, Ye said that he hoped the Military Mediation Department could fulfill its mission.

### Chinese Compatriots in Western Tanqi Long, Indonesia, Suffered Humiliation and Torture; As Many as 300 Were Killed

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 30th Dispatch] According to Xin Bao, Chinese compatriots in the Balran district west of Tanqi Long are suffering humiliation and bullying from those claiming to be the Indian People's Army. The newspaper recently published a statement from a surviving Chinese compatriot from Bahe Village, stating that at least 300 Chinese compatriots in the area were brutally murdered. Yesterday, the newspaper's main headline was "Villages of Ganmaoli and Ganban'er Suffered Bullying, Torture Rampant, and an Infant Was Exposed to Death." This report from Xin Bao is based on statements from three Chinese compatriot women who escaped to Tanqi Long. The newspaper stated that many Chinese women in Ganmaoli Village suffered torture, and another Chinese woman from Ganban'er also stated that over ninety women in the village also suffered torture under the threat of death. Furthermore, some Chinese compatriots were deprived of freedom of religion and suffered various extortions. It is recalled that a few months ago, Indonesian President Sukarno, while attending a meeting in Yogyakarta, repeatedly expressed regret over the large-scale massacre of Chinese compatriots in western Tanqi Long.

### Pan Chaoying, Chinese Expert Committee Member of the United Nations General Assembly, Arrives in Shanghai

Talks to Reporters About International Perspectives

[Central News Agency, This City] Dr. Pan Chaoying, expert committee member of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, recently returned to China and arrived in Shanghai to attend the National Assembly. According to his comments to reporters, the five major issues of the United Nations General Assembly have not yet reached an agreement. However, according to general observations, the following conclusions may be reached: (1) "Veto Power": The Soviet Union firmly insists on retaining it, and the United States and Britain also express their approval in principle, but hope that it will be used with some restraint. The major premise is that the opinions of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union tend to be consistent. It is unlikely that there will be significant changes. (2) "Disarmament": Countries have not yet expressed confidence and sincerity on this issue, and it is feared that it will be difficult to implement. (3) "Trusteeship": The opinions put forward by various countries, after comprehensive revisions, may lead to an agreement. (4) "Economic, Social, and Cultural Cooperation": Including the United Nations General Assembly, countries have different opinions and disputes are fierce, but misunderstandings will eventually disappear. (5) "United Nations Headquarters": In the future, the eastern part of the United States may be selected. The proposal to locate it in San Francisco is unlikely to pass. In addition, Pan also mentioned that China's future foreign policy must thoroughly abandon "opportunism" and establish its own diplomatic foundation from a stable national policy.

### Full Text of Mayor Wu's Broadcast Speech on the Shanghai Riot Incident

[Our Report] At 8 PM last night, Mayor Wu, at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station at No. 3 Da Xi Road, reported on the situation of the rioters taking the opportunity to cause disturbances in the past two days, and the emergency measures taken by the municipal government to quell the riot and maintain order. He also ordered all stores in the city to operate as usual from today. Those who attempt to cause trouble and endanger public security will be killed without exception. Mayor Wu, accompanied by Ouyang Zunquan, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, Zhu Chubai, Director of the News Release Department, and Zhou Weiting, Director of the Jing'an Temple Police Sub局, went to the radio station at 7:30 PM, where they were received by Chen Bin, Section Chief of the station, and took a brief rest. At 8 PM, the mayor began broadcasting, which lasted for thirty-four minutes. The full text is as follows: "Fellow citizens, I am now reporting to all citizens of the city on the disturbances that occurred in our city yesterday and today. Rioters took the opportunity to disrupt public order, causing damage and insult to everyone and all stores. I would like to express my deepest sympathy to everyone. The course of the riots and the municipal government's handling of this incident are as follows: (1) Let's start with the issue of

Street Vendors. In July of this year, the Municipal Council passed a resolution to ban street vendors in the Huangpu and Old Zha districts due to traffic congestion. The municipal government must consider the interests of the public. Before September of this year, traffic in the central district was often blocked, for at least half an hour, or even one or two hours, causing inconvenience to citizens' movements. After the improvement of traffic in the central district, there has been significant progress. Shanghai is tied to international reputation, and all parties also agree that traffic is too disorderly and must be improved. However, if street vendors in the central district are not banned, the traffic obstruction situation will be difficult to improve. When the decision was made to ban street vendors, their livelihood was also fully considered, so a deadline of August, September, and October was given, urging them to relocate their businesses or find other livelihoods during this period. On the one hand, the municipal government must consider the livelihoods of street vendors, and on the other hand, it must consider the interests of the majority of citizens and strive to maintain order. Therefore, the banning of street vendors is a last resort for the government. (2) Rioters used the street vendor issue as an excuse to spread rumors, claiming that the detained street vendors were refused food and clothing, resulting in deaths from freezing and starvation. They also rumored that the Huangpu Sub局 opened fire and

Killed People. I must clarify this point. The municipal government implements administrative orders to seek public interest. The police bureau executes orders and is extremely lenient in execution. The original plan was to complete the ban by the end of October, but today is already December 1st, which shows that the police bureau's execution is not very strict. However, the implementation of administrative orders must be thorough. Chinese and foreign newspapers have criticized the municipal government for its inability to ban street vendors as scheduled. As for the police bureau's punishment of street vendors, a fine is imposed for the first and second violations of setting up a stall, and detention is only imposed for the third violation. During the detention period, the police bureau provides food and drink. If family members send clothing and food, they only need to obey the order and line up to enter, and there is no refusal. Rioters spread rumors that street vendors starved and froze to death in the detention center. Yesterday, I, along with city councilors and many journalists, went to the Huangpu Sub局 to investigate and found that this was not the case. Bureau Chief Du is willing to guarantee with his life that if anyone died from freezing or starvation, he would accept the most severe punishment. If you find that it is true and provide evidence, you can report it and it will be handled according to Bureau Chief Du's guarantee. Yesterday, there were also rumors that the police bureau opened fire and killed people. This is even more untrue, completely a rumor fabricated by rioters to stir up public sentiment in order to achieve their

Riot Conspiracy. It is also said that the Huangpu Sub局 has abused the detained vendors. If this is the case, the government will thoroughly investigate it. However, after I went to the sub局 yesterday to investigate, I can also guarantee that there is no abuse as rumored. (3) The results of the investigation into the riots in the past two days show that street vendors cannot possibly carry out such a planned and organized riot, and endanger social order and the safety of everyone's life and property. Yesterday afternoon, the crowd in front of the Huangpu Sub局 claimed that there were still more than 300 street vendors detained in the sub局. However, all street vendors had already been released before 12 PM in the morning. When I went to the detention center of the sub局 at 5 PM in the afternoon, there were no street vendors inside. This proves that the crowd surrounding the sub局 was not street vendors, but rioters. This is proof number one. Four representatives of the Huangpu and Old Zha districts came to my house today to declare that the

Disruptive Acts of Destroying Stores, Damaging Vehicles,

Blocking Traffic, and Setting Fires, and other illegal behaviors, have nothing to do with them. They also stated that they only went to the City Council yesterday afternoon to petition and did not go to the Huangpu Sub局 to petition at all. Then it can certainly be proven that those in front of the Huangpu Sub局 were not street vendors. This is proof number two. The four representatives personally wrote a statement, the original of which has been submitted to the Central News Agency for publication and will be available in tomorrow's newspapers. Yesterday, when traffic vehicles and stores were destroyed on Nanjing Road and Beijing Road, many perpetrators were captured. After questioning, it was found that none of them were street vendors. This is proof number three. All of the above proves that the riots in the past two days have nothing to do with street vendors. (4) In the riots in the past two days, rioters divided into groups and routes, disrupting social security everywhere and disturbing everyone's peace. Ask whether street vendors have this organizational ability? It proves that this is an organized and planned disruption of public security, absolutely not done by street vendors, this is obvious. (5) I felt yesterday that rioters wanted to undermine social order and create tragedy. Their purpose was to pressure

Police to Open Fire and Use it as an Excuse to Cause Trouble. Therefore, yesterday, I ordered each sub局 to be absolutely patient to prevent the rioters from taking advantage of the opportunity to endanger innocent civilians in the black night and create the tragedy they intended to create. At that time, our military and police force was originally sufficient to immediately resolve this riot. However, last night, the police only fired blank shots to prevent giving the rioters an excuse. The rioters, on the other hand, completely exposed their identities. If street vendors have any demands, they can petition the municipal government, the city council, or the Executive Yuan. It is not impossible to surround the police bureau or even surround the municipal government. Why destroy stores, destroy cars, block public transportation, and drag out all the machines and materials from the Gao Sheng Paper Store in Dongxinqiao and set them on fire? This is completely to expose their riot plan, endanger social order, endanger the peace of the people, and make stores afraid to open for business, using

A Policy of Terror to Threaten Everyone. Would ordinary street vendors dare to do all of these things? Should the government not severely deal with this kind of illegal behavior? (6) The street vendor issue has been resolved. They can set up stalls in public or private open spaces in a concentrated manner, and the street vendors have expressed satisfaction. This incident has become a riot by rioters endangering public security and endangering the people's peace. The government's responsibility is to protect the safety of people's lives and property, regardless of anyone in the city dragging people out of vehicles, throwing stones, taking things, setting fires, and other illegal behaviors. Shanghai's martial law order has not been lifted. In the past, for the convenience of the citizens, it was not strictly enforced according to martial law. In the future, if there is any damage to people's lives and property, or endangering public order, it will be dealt with strictly according to martial law.

No Pardon for Murder. (7) The military camps throughout the city have absolute power to control Shanghai's security. In order to protect the peace of all citizens, the government will punish unlawful riots. After 5 PM tonight, the city has been peaceful and uneventful. After the Security Command issued a bulletin on suppressing riots, no more incidents of forced shop closures or blocked traffic will be allowed to occur. Tomorrow, everyone can operate as usual, and the government will absolutely guarantee the safety of everyone's life and property. As for the municipal government's basic attitude towards the citizens, we will vigorously implement democracy. I and all the staff of the municipal government are public servants, and all the citizens of the city are our masters. The municipal government must take everyone's welfare as its own. Rioters murder and arson, endangering everyone's interests, so they must be severely punished. The government of the ruling Kuomintang is by no means comparable to the warlord era. Kuomintang members are public servants of the people and have always served the people. If any of my subordinates, whether they are civil servants or police officers, are impolite or abuse or extort money, they can report to me at any time and give instructions at any time. I will humbly accept them. Otherwise, I am not worthy of being the mayor of this city, and even less worthy of being a member of the Kuomintang. At this time of turbulent situation, in order to seek

Citizen Welfare and the Prosperity of Commerce Throughout the City, all policies will be based on the interests of the majority. For example, the implementation of price evaluation is because it does not hinder the interests of the majority for the sake of the interests of the minority. This is completely for the sake of the 4.5 million citizens of the city. If I do not do this, everyone can report it at any time and file a complaint with the Central Government. I am willing to accept the punishment I deserve. Therefore, if there are a few people who attempt to disrupt social order, hinder public order, and engage in riotous behavior, the municipal government cannot but take decisive action. In the events of yesterday and today, the municipal government's handling has left those attempting to riot with no excuse. And the rioters' behavior is not sympathized with by the public. From tomorrow onwards, I hope that all sectors of industry, commerce, and academia will work in factories as usual, operate in stores, study peacefully in schools, and I hope that all citizens of the city can rest assured.

Editorial

### New Developments in the Near East Political Situation

Just as the Four Foreign Ministers Conference had reached an agreement on the issues of Trieste and the Danube River, and the United Nations General Assembly had begun working on the issue of universal disarmament, with the Soviet Union's agreement to implement international management and oversight, various disputes have arisen in the Middle East, specifically among the Arab nations and their neighboring countries. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Ankara on the 28th, King Abdullah of Transjordan's ambition to create a "Greater Syria" has been rekindled. Saudi Arabia has expressed fierce opposition and has deployed troops into Transjordan, with reports of minor skirmishes. Simultaneously, the Secretary-General of the Greek Foreign Ministry and the Secretary-General of the Turkish Foreign Ministry have both traveled to Transjordan. Although the issue of Transjordan may seem like a small spark, due to its international context, it could escalate into an uncontrollable situation if not prevented promptly.

The issue of Transjordan, along with the entire Middle East and Balkans, is not merely a territorial dispute, but also an international conflict. Since the end of World War II, British influence in the Middle East and the Balkans has gradually waned. At the same time, Soviet influence in the Middle East and the Balkans has gradually increased. Unless Britain is determined to withdraw completely, it will inevitably compete with all its might. Britain's competitive moves include: first, not favoring the Jews in Palestine; second, opposing joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the Turkish Straits; third, supporting the Greek government; fourth, refusing to withdraw British troops stationed in Egypt; fifth, protecting Iranian oil fields by force; and sixth, inciting the ambitious King of Transjordan to establish a "Greater Syria." Therefore, the Transjordanian incident is merely one link in the entire Middle East and Balkan issue. When this link moves, all other links are affected. This is why the Secretaries-General of the Turkish and Greek Foreign Ministries have both gone to Transjordan. The Arab League in the Middle East was established with British assistance to appease the Arabs. However, due to the issue of Jewish immigration to Palestine, the Arabs have gradually lost their affection for Britain, and Britain can no longer utilize it. Therefore, it seeks to support the King of Transjordan in building a "Greater Syria," uniting Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and the oil fields of the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf into one entity. If this plan succeeds, the Arab nations could unite to create a great power. Greece and Turkey, due to their vested interests, would naturally support it. As for the ambitious King of Transjordan, it goes without saying that he is willing to use all his strength to realize the construction of this great kingdom.

Although the Arab nation once had a high level of culture in history, its culture gradually declined with the decline of its military power. Now the economy is backward, the people are ignorant, and the real power is in the hands of a few extremely autocratic desert tribal chiefs. They have supreme authority over all their land, with the power of life and death over the tribal people. Their personalities are fierce and predatory. They are the de facto representatives in parliament, and each carries two pistols in the chamber. Whenever the debate becomes heated, they do not hesitate to draw their guns, and the meeting immediately breaks up.

The King of Transjordan is one of the larger of these tribal chiefs. We can imagine that for such a simple-minded and violent national leader, the ideas of traditional heroes are very well developed, and he is also most easily exploited. Moreover, once ambition is aroused, and material and military supplies are received, it is difficult to rein in on the edge of the precipice. On the other hand, the leaders who oppose him have the same temperament. Therefore, as soon as the King of Transjordan's ambition was exposed, Saudi Arabia immediately declared, "It will not hesitate to crush this ambition with force," and deployed troops into Transjordan. This lively drama has now been successfully directed and has begun to be staged. When will it end?

The United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have all been vying for the support of the Arabs, but their methods are subtly different. The American method is to run schools, send students abroad, establish hospitals, and promote Western science and American-style democracy. Now, these individuals who have received American education have a good impression of Americans. The Soviet Union specializes in wooing the lower classes, sympathizing with them and helping them in times of trouble, thereby promoting Soviet-style democracy. The British, however, specialize in befriending the chiefs, providing them with military supplies, and encouraging their ambitions, forming deep ties with them. In a country with a very low level of public education, the American and Soviet methods are relatively slow, while the British method is the easiest to succeed. However, in times of tension, the Soviet Union can also adopt the British method.

We cannot help but express our deepest pity and sympathy for the Arab nation. Because it is a human tragedy when a nation is exploited, used as a puppet, commits suicide and fratricide. Such a tragedy is now not only happening in Transjordan and neighboring Arab countries, but is also taking place intensely in India, Greece, Korea, Iran, and Egypt, reminiscent of the struggles of the past in Spain. If world politicians truly have a compassionate heart and a determination to seek world peace, they should abandon their hegemonic conspiracies as soon as possible and allow the nations of the world to freely handle their internal disputes. At the same time, the leaders of all nations should prioritize the people, examine themselves, stop relying on foreign aid to seize land and cities, and resort to arms, disrupting order, driving the people, and slaughtering their own compatriots. Humanity should be rational, and only by acting rationally can true success be achieved, and the human world can live in permanent peace.

### On the National Assembly in the Draft Constitution

— Chen Ruxuan

The "Revised Draft of the Constitution of the Republic of China" (also known as the May 5th Constitution Draft Amendment), which was drafted based on the principles agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference, has been completed through the fastest legislative process and submitted by the National Government to the National Assembly as a basis for discussion. The full text consists of fourteen chapters and one hundred and fifty-one articles. There are many improvements compared to the May 5th Constitution Draft. For example, it adopts a proactive approach to protecting the freedom and rights of the people, removing the original phrase "not restricted except in accordance with the law"; and strictly defines the scope of central legislation restricting these freedoms, to prevent abuse of legislative power and deprivation of the people's rights. Furthermore, the members of the Legislative Yuan are to be directly elected by the people, so that local public opinion and the national legislative body are closely connected; all laws can fully represent public opinion, and the Legislative Yuan will not be bureaucratized or become an appendage of the government. The provincial governors are not appointed by the central government, but are directly elected by the people of each province; so that the local people have the freedom to choose their administrative managers. Since the provincial governors are elected by the provincial people, they are of course subject to recall by the voters; they will naturally respect the public opinion of the provincial people, in the hope of winning the support of the provincial people, and dare not act recklessly, offend the public, and destroy their own positions. Compared with the provincial governors appointed by the central government, who only seek to perfunctorily implement central laws, please their superiors, and then can boss people around, regardless of the life and death of the people, this is certainly a great improvement. The "Fundamental National Policies" chapter summarizes the major issues of the country's economy, finance, military affairs, national defense, education, and diplomacy in one place, and provides important guidelines for each, in a concise and comprehensive manner. Compared with the May 5th Constitution Draft's scattered arrangement, which focuses on one thing and loses sight of others, this is indeed a better approach. Other improvements include clearly defining the Judicial Yuan as the organ for interpreting the Constitution, making the Judicial Yuan similar to the Supreme Court of the United States as the "protector of the Constitution." Raising the status of the judiciary, unifying the power of interpretation, and preventing those who play with the law from distorting it for their own convenience is truly appropriate. Furthermore, in the chapter on territory, the May 5th Constitution Draft adopted a listing approach, including the names of all provinces and regions in the constitutional provisions; but today, with the independence of Outer Mongolia, the conversion of Taiwan into a province, and the transformation of the three northeastern provinces into nine, the constitutional provisions must be changed. Therefore, the revised draft changes to a general approach, stating "The territory of the Republic of China shall be based on its inherent boundaries," making the provisions more flexible, which is also an improved revision.

As for the points in the revised draft that differ from the May 5th Constitution Draft that still need to be studied, in my humble opinion, there are also several. Now, I will first discuss the two or three most important of these, conduct an analytical and comparative review, and trace the origins of their legal principles and the spirit of the system, for the perusal of those who are concerned with the Constitution. As for the merits and demerits, opinions will differ, and the reader should choose accordingly. (1) Reduction of the power of the National Assembly: The May 5th Constitution Draft stipulated that the National Assembly would be organized by representatives directly elected by the people in the national territory; while the revised draft, in addition to regional representatives, adds all the members of the central Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan, and changes the members of the Legislative Yuan to be directly elected by the people, while the members of the Supervisory Yuan are selected by the provincial and municipal councils (the May 5th Constitution Draft stipulated that both the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members were elected by the National Assembly). In this way, the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, in terms of governance, are one of the five Yuans, and in terms of political power, they are representatives of the National Assembly. When the National Assembly is adjourned, they can represent the National Assembly and supervise the government, just like a standing committee of the National Assembly. As for the functions of the National Assembly, those listed in the May 5th Constitution Draft are five: election, recall, initiative, referendum, and amendment of the Constitution; and the powers of election and recall extend to the President, Vice President, President of the Legislative Yuan, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, President of the Supervisory Yuan, Vice President of the Supervisory Yuan, members of the Legislative Yuan, and members of the Supervisory Yuan. All central laws can be initiated and subjected to referendum by the National Assembly; amendment of legislation is also within the power of initiative and referendum, because of its greater importance, it is specifically listed as a separate item. The revised draft significantly reduces the functions of the National Assembly; the powers of election and recall can only be exercised for the President and Vice President; the Presidents and members of the various Yuans are excluded; the powers of initiative and referendum are limited to amending the Constitution, and do not extend to all central laws, and the National Assembly can only exercise these powers when more than half of the counties and cities in the country can exercise the powers of initiative and referendum. According to this method, in the period after the start of constitutional government, the National Assembly is only an agency for electing the President (amending the Constitution and recall are extremely rare events). The Legislative Yuan's power to decide on all laws is not subject to any constraints or supervision. Except for the President's right to request reconsideration under certain circumstances, and the Judicial Yuan's right to declare a law unconstitutional if it conflicts with a provision of the Constitution, the National Assembly cannot demand a referendum and therefore has no right to intervene. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan is above all else. The drafters of the Constitution believe that the members of the Legislative Yuan and the representatives of the National Assembly are both elected by the people (Article 62 of the draft states that the Legislative Yuan is organized by elected members), and the members of the Legislative Yuan also serve as representatives of the National Assembly; they represent the people on the one hand and the National Assembly on the other. Therefore, the views of the two bodies will not be divergent. The laws decided by the Legislative Yuan are of course agreed to by the National Assembly. In this situation, the power of referendum need not be used. This view is too idealistic. Even if they are both elected representatives, their views are often incompatible. Even if they are members of the same party, the cabinet and parliament are often at odds. The facts show us that this is the case everywhere. If the people are not given the opportunity to express their opinions, who can guarantee that all the legal discussions of the legislative body will fully conform to public opinion? Under the five-power system, the sole responsibility of the National Assembly is to represent the people and control the government. Legislative power is the greatest of the government's powers. Although the people do not legislate themselves, they can use the power of referendum or initiative to control legislation. Now, the people cannot actually initiate or subject central laws to referendum, and they cannot exercise the power of recall over the members of the Legislative Yuan; and the National Assembly, which represents the people, does not have the power to express their opinions on their behalf. Then, wouldn't the Legislative Yuan become an institution that is self-important? If it abuses its powers and produces bad laws, there is no way to remedy it until the three-year election; the danger is indeed conceivable. In parliamentary political countries around the world, the head of government has the power to dissolve the legislature; and their parliaments themselves are mostly divided into upper and lower houses, which supervise each other and discuss issues repeatedly in order to achieve thoroughness. This is to prevent the abuses of legislative despotism. The May 5th Constitution Draft stipulated that the National Assembly has the power to recall members of the Legislative Yuan and the power to subject laws to referendum. Its intention is also here. I feel that this is indeed a point that cannot be erased. As for the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans, who also serve as representatives of the National Assembly, meeting once every six years to elect the President, it seems to be copying the established rules of France, where the members of the upper and lower houses of the National Assembly form a National Assembly to elect the President. (The only difference is that the representatives of the National Assembly in the draft, in addition to the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans, also include some regional representatives.) This method is simpler than direct election; in practical terms, there are no difficult obstacles. However, the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans are those who exercise the power of governance in the National Government; and they are those who exercise the power of government in the National Assembly. They have two qualifications and are very powerful, which is slightly different from Dr. Sun Yat-sen's theory of separate exercise of political power.

In summary, the National Assembly in the revised draft, in terms of organization, seems to be larger and more complex than that stipulated in the May 5th Constitution Draft; in terms of functions, it is simpler and weaker than that stipulated in the May 5th Constitution Draft. Moreover, due to the temporary absence of the powers of initiative and referendum, the Legislative Yuan has become an uncontrolled body. Because the powers of election and recall only extend to the President, it is impossible to establish any relationship or implement any guidance or supervision over the heads of the various Yuans. This National Assembly can only be regarded as an agency for electing the President. Therefore, it only meets once every six years, for a few days each time, and its task can be completed. This is very different from the May 5th Constitution Draft, which makes the National Assembly the linchpin for controlling the government. The importance of its position is completely different, which is what deserves the most attention.

### My Former Ambassador to the Netherlands, Dong Lin, Talks About the Political Situation in the Netherlands and the Remarkable Achievements of the New Monetary Policy

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Former Ambassador to the Netherlands, Dong Lin, returned to the country from his post to report on his work. He arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 30th and immediately went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to meet with Minister Wang and Vice Minister Gan Naiguang to report on his experience as an ambassador to the Netherlands. Dong has been an ambassador to the Netherlands for almost two years, and he has suffered from rheumatism because he is not accustomed to the low and humid climate of the Netherlands. He is now being transferred to serve in the ministry. This morning, he received reporters at his residence and spoke freely about the political situation in the Netherlands, saying: Because the majority of the people in the Netherlands sincerely support the royal family, the political situation is relatively stable. At present, the Catholic Party and the Labor Party have the greatest influence in the parliament. The cabinet is jointly formed by these two parties and is very democratic. In terms of economy, the Netherlands suffered severe damage from the Germans during the war. After the war, due to political stability and the efforts of the people in reconstruction work, water and electricity equipment, production facilities, and various water conservancy facilities have been largely restored. At present, the freshwater flooded areas within the country have already begun to be cultivated, while the planting in the saltwater flooded areas still needs to be completed. At the end of the war, the Dutch also suffered from inflation. The government adopted a new monetary policy, that is, all the old currency of the people was collected into the national treasury, the illegal gains during the war were confiscated, and the income tax payable by each depositor was cleared; then, the government opened accounts with new currency of the same value, which were frozen in the national bank. The government then determined the amount of withdrawals in installments based on whether the depositor was in need of living expenses, and withdrawals were not allowed without approval. As a result of the implementation of this regulation since September of last year, the results have been remarkable within one year, speculative funds have been suppressed, and the strict implementation of the quantitative allocation system has made supply and demand adapt, and the economy has returned to normal.

Dong continued to talk about the Netherlands' foreign trade and the prospects for Sino-Dutch trade, saying: "The Netherlands' foreign trade is far inferior to what it was before the war due to the turbulent situation in the East Indies and the inability to restore trade with Germany. The Dutch government is now signing monetary and trade agreements with various European countries, and has signed a customs union with Luxembourg, and its foreign trade has gradually improved. As for Sino-Dutch trade, it is difficult to discuss at present due to traffic barriers, but major Dutch companies have sent representatives to Shanghai, and there will be developments once sea transportation is smooth."

The Ambassador then said: "Regarding the number of overseas Chinese currently in the Netherlands, there are about 1,500 people, including hundreds of sailors. The government has negotiated with the Dutch to send them back to the country as soon as possible. The Dutch water conservancy projects are world-renowned, and if hundreds of East Indian Chinese students study in the Netherlands, they should also be encouraged to return to their motherland to work."

The Ambassador finally emphasized that Sino-Dutch relations will definitely become more and more consolidated in the future. The Dutch people have always admired Chinese culture, and some technicians have also expressed their willingness to come to China to work. The Sino-Dutch Association, which is currently located in The Hague, is also committed to the exchange of Chinese and Dutch cultures.

### Wuxi Publicly Tries "Accusation of Traitor" Expert - Yang Jiliang Actually Makes a Living by Falsely Accusing People of Being Traitors; Denies Everything in Court with Eloquent Words

[Wuxi News] Yang Jiliang, (also known as Yang Jianying), a resident of No. 9 Tianji Wharf in the city, does not engage in honest work. He uses aliases such as Yang Zongying and Yang Jianying to specialize in falsely accusing people of being traitors in order to extort money. He has done this in no fewer than ten cases. The High Prosecutor's Office referred the case to the local procuratorate for thorough investigation. Yang Jiliang, knowing that his scheme was exposed, refused to accept the summons. The police posted the summons on Yang's door. Subsequently, Chief Ma ordered the police to arrest Yang for interrogation and detention. After the investigation was concluded, he was prosecuted for the crime of falsely accusing people of being traitors. Yesterday was the first public hearing by the criminal court. Yang Jiliang's testimony was cunning, and he denied everything. The details are recorded below:

Yesterday morning around 10 a.m., bailiffs escorted Yang Zongying from the detention center to the court. Yang was a burly man, wearing a dark brown cotton robe. He appeared very calm. In the waiting room, Yang's wife came to see him. Yang's wife was petite and thin. Standing opposite Yang, they were noticeably different in size and height. One was radiant and appeared not to be suffering from being charged in court, seemingly indifferent to death; the other was haggard, with a worried frown, repeatedly lamenting her helplessness. The meeting of this mismatched couple was both pitiful, laughable, and hateful. Yang Zongying then took off a gold ring (weighing about three mace) from his finger and gave it to his wife, saying that there was nothing to worry about and that there were new discoveries, etc.

Then, Judge Xiang Xudong took his seat in the first courtroom. Yang Jiliang admitted that he had two names, Yang Jiliang and Yang Jianying. He used to own a silk store and is now in the real estate business. He is from Sitou in the northern countryside. He had not committed any crimes before, but was once sued by Mao Yaoshan and sentenced to six months for fraud. He is appealing because he did not accept the verdict. He confessed to accusing Tong Shoupei of being a traitor, but no one else. The judge questioned him about the accusations made against Zhang Zhitong, Xu Juncai, Jiang Beizhai, Zhang Shengyi, etc., and asked how he received the provincial government's instructions. He said: "I don't know Zhang Zhitong. Xu Juncai is an old friend, so why would I accuse him? My wife, who is illiterate, received the provincial government's instructions. If I wanted to falsely accuse someone, could I change the name easily but not the address? Before I was detained, I even applied to the court for registration, because someone was using my address fraudulently. A female clerk received it and issued a receipt," etc.

His words were forceful and fluent. The judge had no way to refute him. After all, he was an experienced litigant. Yang also presented his self-written defense to the court. The court then ordered Yang Zongying to affix his fingerprint to the written record of his testimony. Yang received the record, read it over, and, finding no discrepancies, affixed his fingerprint. Yang was returned to custody and the hearing was adjourned.

### Wang Maogong's Observations on Provincial Administration – Orders to Rectify Shortcomings in Various Counties; Strict Prohibition of Vendettas and Other Illegal Activities in Northern Jiangsu

[Report from Our Wuxi Correspondent] In order to understand the administrative situation in various counties and cities in Jiangsu Province, Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong recently personally went to various counties and cities for investigation and interviews. He first conducted investigations and inquiries along the Grand Canal through Huai'an and Xuzhou counties. He also held symposiums with party, government, military, and local figures to review the implementation of the pacification zone's administrative program and coordinate with the military to establish security. Overall, he was quite satisfied. Xuzhou and western counties were able to maintain security independently, and primary school education in rural areas quickly and generally resumed within the shortest time. However, the remaining counties were only partially controlled, and the promotion of political affairs was still ineffective. According to reports from the military and various parties, the results were relatively poor. The counties in southern Jiangsu were also uneven and failed to be implemented in a down-to-earth manner. The various shortcomings found during the inspection are specifically telegraphed to the county magistrates of each county for compliance.

[Report from Our Huaiyin Correspondent] After the recovery of northern Jiangsu, the primary measures were to stabilize people's livelihoods and restore local order. However, recently, the township, district and baojia chiefs in various counties have not been self-disciplined. Some extort money and abuse their power, damaging the people; others collude with communist cadres and fail to report them; others take advantage of remaining evil forces to exploit the villages; others use self-surrender and self-renewal as pretexts to extract wealth; some even hide abandoned supplies for their own use; and plot to take revenge by killing those who surrendered, affecting local security and violating the central government's policy of leniency. The Seventh District Commissioner's Office believes that the township and baojia chiefs are the people closest to the masses and are familiar with those who have gone astray. Except for important cadres or those who willingly act as accomplices to the enemy, who should be reported immediately, all others should be guided to self-renewal or directly reported, so as to clear the local area, establish security, and ensure the supplies abandoned in the recovered areas, which were extorted from the local people, should still be used for local construction or relief purposes, and should not be taken for one's own use. As for the communist army disrupting the local area and causing the masses to hate each other, it is only natural that the masses in the recovered area harbor deep resentment towards those who participated in the communist side, thinking of the past when their families were destroyed. However, they must not seek revenge privately, resulting in blood feuds. Even if the crime is deserved, they can only be listed and reported to the national law. It is strictly forbidden to kill them without authorization, which would make themselves fall into illegality. Yesterday, special orders were given to strictly warn the subordinates, and the masses or groups were allowed to report directly to the commissioner's office.

### Suzhou Adds Self-Defense Corps

[Report from Our Suzhou Correspondent] The Suzhou urban self-defense brigade previously drew over five hundred team members from the 1st, 5th, and 7th companies and temporarily formed a training brigade.

Recently, due to the approach of the winter defense period, in order to meet the needs, it is planned to set up seven directly affiliated sub-teams in the central urban area of Qizhen to strengthen self-defense forces and ensure the security of the urban area.

### A Farmer's Wife in Tang Village, Dangtu County, Ms. Dong, Dies Mysteriously

[Report from Our Dangtu Correspondent] Tang Youhe, a resident of the 8th Bao of Tang Village, Xinta Township, Dangtu County, had a wife named Dong, who was 39 years old. She was originally married to a man named He in Xuancheng and had a son, who is now 19 years old. Later, her husband, He, died of illness, and she had no means of support. Therefore, she remarried Tang Youhe, in order to find a husband to raise her son. After living in the He family in Xuancheng for four years, Tang Youhe took Dong and her son back to Xinta Township to live. They lived a peaceful life. However, on November 15th at 9 p.m., someone suddenly knocked on the door outside, saying that they were sent by the township office. Dong opened the door and saw four people, all with painted faces. One of them said, "Grandma, why didn't you open the door?" Before Dong could answer, he stabbed Dong in the waist three times with a sharp knife, killing her instantly. At that time, her husband was out on business. Her housemate cried for help. Bao Chief Tang Youyu learned about it and reported it to the township office. The township office was closed, and after repeatedly shouting to open the door, he reported the incident to Township Head Hu. The next day, Township Head Hu, together with Township Representative Song Qingde, went to investigate and ordered the Bao Chief to provide a coffin for burial. The coffin is still in Tang Youhe's field, and has not been buried or nailed.

### Grain Merchants in Xiashi Request Loans

[Report from Our Haining Correspondent] Xiashi Town in this county is the largest wholesale distribution center for rice in Zhejiang Province. Grain from the provincial capital and various counties in eastern Zhejiang is mostly purchased here. Before the war, the annual shipment reached over one million shi. Recently, due to the shortage of funds in various stores, the amount of storage purchased is insufficient, and they feel that they are not strong enough. Once supply cannot meet demand, various counties in eastern Zhejiang will suffer from food shortages. Rice merchants specially petitioned the Xiashi Chamber of Commerce to transfer the request to the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, requesting loans from the four banks, and requesting loans against the mortgage of grain, so as to benefit grain merchants and the people's food.

### A Traitor in Tianshenggang Sentenced to Four Years in Prison

[Report from Our Nantong Correspondent] Sun Junying, a native of Tianshenggang, Nantong, willingly turned against the country after the fall of Tianshenggang, Nantong. From March of the 27th year of the puppet regime, he served as the vice-chairman of the Tianshenggang Maintenance Association, recruiting workers for the enemy. In July of the same year, the association was reorganized into an autonomous branch, and he continued to serve as the chairman of the branch, concurrently serving as the principal of Tianshenggang Elementary School, implementing enslavement education for the enemy puppets. At the end of the same year, he was reassigned as the Township Chief of Tianshenggang Township. The following year, he also served as the head of the township's self-defense regiment, maintaining local security for the enemy puppets. He also served as the director of the field tax collection branch, illegally collecting field taxes from the people. In June of the 29th year, the puppet organization in Tianshenggang established a puppet district office, and he was reassigned as the puppet district chief, promoting government orders for the enemy puppets. In August of the 30th year, the port was changed to a temporary district, and he continued to serve as the district chief of the district, also serving as the head of the temporary district self-defense regiment.

The senate believed that the sentence of only seven years of imprisonment was too lenient. At the eighth meeting on the 27th, it was resolved to send a letter to the High Court Prosecutor's Office requesting a protest and imposing the punishment he deserved.

[Report from Our Jinan Correspondent] Zhang Yan, a former special agent of the puppet police department and a special agent of the enemy military police Phoenix Mansion, was sentenced after repeated interrogations by the High Court. The main text: "Zhang Yan colluded with the factory country, resisting this country, should be sentenced to death, all property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, will be confiscated."

### The Suzhou-Ningbo Branch of the Executive Yuan Commences Relief Efforts in March, Focusing on the Liberated Areas of Northern Jiangsu

[Report from our Zhenjiang Office] Jiang Renlong, Deputy Director of the Suzhou-Ningbo Branch of the Executive Yuan, told reporters about the general situation of the branch's work from September to November. Regarding relief efforts, he stated that the branch's resources gradually became abundant after September, with most of them allocated to the newly liberated areas of northern Jiangsu. Xuzhou was the earliest recipient. Huaiyin and the Grand Canal line's Gaoyou, Baoying, Dongtai, and Xinghua followed. Currently, 1,000 tons of flour have been allocated to Xuzhou for emergency relief, while 300 tons of the 1,500 tons of flour for Huaiyin have been shipped. There are also 500 dan of bean flour. Gaoyou, Baoying, and Xinghua each received 300 tons of flour, 100 dan of bean flour, and 150 bundles of used clothing. The 500 tons of flour for Rugao have not yet been shipped due to transportation difficulties. In other combat areas that suffered heavy damage, such as Taixing, Huangqiao, Haian, Baimi, Qutang, and Fanchuan, only 30 to 50 tons of flour were distributed to each place. In the Jiangnan region, the children's nutrition station established in Nanjing provides drinks to over 10,000 people daily. Supplies for Nantong, Taixian, Zhenjiang, and Yangzhou are expected to begin in December. In addition to repatriating 14,900 refugees, including those from Hebei and the Northeast, as well as immigrants and foreigners transiting through Hankou, the branch has established agencies in Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Xuzhou to specifically handle matters related to refugees from northern Jiangsu.

### Murderer Xia Junxian Apprehended in Suzhou

[Report from our Suzhou Office] Xia Junxian, a cadre of the Communist army, served as the leader of an assassination squad in Taixing. He engaged in rape, plunder, and all sorts of evil deeds. On July 11 of last year, he robbed and murdered Zhu Shizhong, Zhu Shixiao, and Xia Nanqing, villagers of Zhu Xuan Township, after an extortion attempt failed. He abandoned their bodies in the fields, shocking passersby. Recently, he was tasked with infiltrating the Jiangnan area to gather military intelligence. Using the alias Xia Zi'an, he obtained a certificate from the Shanghai Pig Trade Association, falsely claiming to be a peddler from the Shenchang Pig Business. He resided at No. 61, Lane 754, Tianyao Road, Shanghai, using this as cover to travel between Suzhou and Shanghai and indulge in his desires. Meng Xun, the head of Zhu Xuan Township, 5th District, Taixian County, had repeatedly suffered illegal abuse by Xia in his hometown. Upon hearing that Xia was active in the Jiangnan area, Meng followed him and encountered Xia on the afternoon of the 27th on Shantang Street outside the Hemenguan Gate in Suzhou. He immediately apprehended Xia and took him to the police station. Under interrogation, Xia Junxian confessed to the aforementioned crimes. He is currently being transferred by the police station to the city defense headquarters for detailed questioning.

### Liuan Commences Winter Defense, Organizing Self-Defense Forces

### The Case of Former Haimen County Magistrate Liu Daoping is Appealed by the Jiangsu High Procuratorate for Review

[Report from our Suzhou Office on the 1st] Former Haimen County Magistrate Liu Daoping was accused of misconduct during his tenure. Residents of the county distributed leaflets, making tearful appeals to all sectors of society and listing eighteen counts of wrongdoing, which were reported to Chairman Chiang, Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province, and the Jiangsu High Procuratorate. After the case was filed, Liu fled to Shanghai and went into hiding. He was recently arrested by the Shanghai Garrison Command and sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for interrogation. The Jiangsu High Procuratorate has now telegraphed the Haimen Judicial Office to conduct a thorough investigation of Liu Daoping's crimes and has consulted the Jiangsu Provincial Government to bring him to Suzhou for legal proceedings.

[Report from our Suzhou Office on the 1st] Xin Yutang, the county magistrate of Pixian County, Jiangsu Province, was previously accused of corruption and dereliction of duty by more than 14 representatives of the county's residents, who jointly filed a complaint with the Tongshan District Procuratorate.

### Plea to Exempt Pudong Vegetable Stalls from Crackdown

Our town is located at Qichang Zhan in Pudong. The vegetable stalls have been located beside the street for decades, and the market's vibrancy depends on them. There is very little traffic passing through this area, so they do not impede transportation at all. In July of this year, we suddenly received an order from the police bureau to move all vegetable stalls to Lane 177. This lane is a very narrow mud lane with houses only on one side, less than thirty storefronts long. There are no shelters, sewers, or other facilities. Whenever it rains, it becomes unbearably muddy, and vegetable vendors cannot set up properly. As a result, they have to hawk their wares along the streets, leading to inconsistent prices. Furthermore, with the harsh winter approaching, the ground will freeze. When it is time to go to market, the ice will melt, making it like a rainy day, causing the citizens to suffer greatly. The prosperity of the market has been greatly affected.

Moreover, the police bureau's purpose is to improve the appearance of the city. However, vendors selling foreign goods, cotton cloth, groceries, and other non-vegetable items are still allowed to set up on the streets, creating piles and stalls everywhere, which is very chaotic. Also, vegetable stalls at Yangjing Eighteen Jian Tang Bridge, Yangjiadu, and Huayuan Stone Bridge are still allowed to set up on the streets. Only we are being excluded. We sincerely hope that the police bureau will consider the plight of the common people and rescind the order. (Citizen Lu Haosheng)

### Suggestions for Public Bus Routes

I recently read in your newspaper that the Public Utilities Bureau plans to open the 9th and 10th public bus routes to improve public transportation, which is very welcome. However, the reader believes that the proposed route for the 10th public bus has room for consideration. Before the war, the city's public buses ran vertically and horizontally, mainly based on actual needs. Thanks to the efforts of the authorities in the past year, most of the original routes have been gradually restored. However, the 9th public bus route from the Bund to Yangshupu is still missing. Currently, transportation in that area relies solely on the 8th tram, which is extremely crowded, and transportation is extremely inconvenient. If there is an accident or a power line is damaged, there is no means of transportation at all. Considering the length of the Yangshupu route (the entire route is one and three-quarters times the length of the route from the Bund to Zhaofeng Garden), the large population in the eastern district (nearly one million), and the severe lack of transportation, it is necessary to restore the 9th public bus route as soon as possible in accordance with the principle of improving the welfare of the citizens. The proposed route for the 10th bus: from Zhaofeng Garden via Nanjing Road to the Bund. This section already has public buses running between the Bund and Jiangsu Road. Although the terminus is different, they are very close to each other and cannot be said to be inconvenient. Moreover, there are already several tram and bus routes running side by side between the Bund and Jing'an Temple. Adding another bus on the crowded Nanjing Road will only make the road narrower and the traffic more congested. The actual need is not as urgent as in Pudong. Weighing the actual situation, I specifically appeal for the 10th route to be changed to run from the Bund to Yangshupu, which would be more in line with actual needs. (Zhou Desheng)

### Shangchuan Train Arbitrarily Raises Prices

The price of passenger tickets on the Shangchuan train in Pudong has been increased by 100% since November 16, which is more than the increase for trams and public buses. At a time when transportation is scarce, poor merchants and travelers are bearing a heavier burden. However, I read in the Local News section of your newspaper on the 21st that Zhao Huijue, the director of the Public Utilities Bureau, reported to the Senate that the Shangchuan train's price increase had not yet been approved. This is quite surprising. I urge the Public Utilities Bureau to punish the Shangchuan train company, which only seeks profit and arbitrarily raises prices, and to reduce ticket prices to benefit the common people and maintain the government's credibility. The company should also be ordered to turn over the excess ticket revenue and donate it to charitable organizations to ensure fairness. (Gu Yingwu)

### Measures for Dealing with Mad Dogs

Recently, there have been daily reports of mad dogs biting people in the city, causing injuries and deaths. However, the authorities have not taken appropriate measures, resulting in a worsening situation, more victims, and widespread panic.

I believe that to prevent mad dogs, it is necessary to first clarify responsibilities. It would be best for the Health Bureau to register pet dogs, issuing dog tags and muzzles at the time of registration, and to administer rabies vaccinations. Any unregistered dogs without dog tags or muzzles should be treated as stray dogs and killed by the police bureau. At the same time, the civil affairs office should notify each baojia (household registration unit) to jointly prevent mad dogs in order to achieve results. (Pan Bosheng)

### Training Public Bus Personnel

Previously, a letter from Mr. Zhang Zhiyuan was published in this column, mentioning the public bus drivers arousing curses from passengers. We have now received a letter from the Transportation Section of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company Preparatory Committee stating: "The drivers of the 6th public bus line were dissatisfied with their treatment last month, and there was an incident where the vehicles deliberately lingered and slowed down in the middle of the route after departing from the starting station, resulting in several vehicles running close together. After investigation, the initiators were given appropriate punishment. As a fundamental solution, their treatment was also adjusted appropriately. This is in line with Mr. Zhang's statement that 'work efficiency is based on work morale, and service spirit resides in service interest.' At the same time, in order to improve the quality of driving personnel, this section has set up a training class, which uses public holidays to conduct rotating training, focusing on discipline, character, and knowledge, and changing habits in order to improve work efficiency and serve the citizens. If there are any further incidents of vehicles not stopping at stations or impolite treatment of passengers, please send a letter to P.O. Box 666, and this section will sincerely accept and make every effort to improve." This is being published to recognize the service spirit of the Transportation Section.

### By Mail

Reply to Mr. Ni Shenqi: Regarding your letter inquiring about applying for an ID card, we have received a letter from the Shanghai 10th District Office stating: "This district has recently been ordered to handle household registration recording matters. All bao cadres are required to concentrate at the district office to transcribe registers and only return to the bao office for one hour each afternoon to work. When Mr. Ni goes to the bao office, it may be during the recording time. Furthermore, according to household registration regulations, an ID card can only be issued after one month of residence. Therefore, it is necessary to check the residence date to comply with the procedures. Mr. Ni's ID card receipt has been numbered Jing No. 61051 and was sent by staff on the 22nd of this month. There is absolutely no truth to the accusations of procrastination or hidden motives mentioned in Mr. Ni's letter. It is regrettable that Mr. Ni was impatient to wait for the ID card and misunderstandings arose. In addition to instructing the bao cadres and notifying all baos to simplify the procedures for applying for national ID cards as much as possible and strive for speed, the circumstances are specifically replied to."

Reply to Mr. Zhang Guobao: Regarding your letter about witnessing the fire at Huonanmen, we have received a reply from the Shanghai Police Bureau stating: "We sent officers to investigate the scene of the incident. According to Lin Jinsheng and others, residents of No. 2, Tonglan Lane, Zhonghua Road, Dananmen, on the afternoon of the 11th at 7:00 PM, a fire broke out due to carelessness by Zhang Defu, who lives at No. 2 of the same lane and deals in celluloid. In addition to the complete destruction of No. 2, the neighboring Nos. 2 and 3 were also affected. The fire department immediately dispatched vehicles to extinguish the fire, and the Penglai Branch also sent police to the scene to implement security. The situation at that time was quite good. We have not heard of any victims running out of the fire or having their handbags snatched and being beaten by volunteer police or having handbags stolen." This is a special reply.

### Gu Weijun Synthesizes Various Opinions, Proposes Concrete Measures for Disarmament; Soviet Union's Lengthy Draft Includes Four Key Points

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 30th] The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued its meeting today to discuss the issue of arms reduction. Dr. Gu Weijun, head of the Chinese delegation, delivered a speech, synthesizing the Soviet Union's proposal and the amendments from Canada and Australia, presenting the following four points:

(1) Organize an international military force in accordance with Article 43 of the United Nations Charter. (2) Although the Atomic Energy Commission should continue to work in accordance with existing rules and procedures, all atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction must be prohibited. (3) Establish an international control and supervision system in accordance with the principles revealed in the Canadian and Australian amendments. (4) All countries should assist the Security Council and the Atomic Energy Commission to facilitate their work.

Ambassador Gu said that China believes that the arms reduction plan proposed by the Soviet Union and the amendments proposed by Canada and Australia can complement each other and do not conflict with each other. The plans of Canada, Australia, and the Soviet Union are all driven by a desire, namely, to promote peace, security, and the happiness of mankind. Any arms reduction plan must be universal, effective, and acceptable to all countries. Any plan that violates this principle should not be adopted. After careful study of the above three plans, I believe that the Soviet plan is the simplest, even too simple, and it is necessary to make some amendments to it. The amendment proposed by Canada is very useful and constitutes a concrete contribution to the Soviet plan. The Australian amendment is the same. In short, China will support all three of the above plans.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 30th] The Soviet delegation tonight synthesized all suggestions on the issue of disarmament and submitted a final draft to the Political Security Committee, the main points of which are as follows:

(1) The General Assembly recognizes the need for universal arms reduction to consolidate peace and enhance international security. (2) The production of atomic energy for military purposes must be prohibited. In this regard, a control agency must be established to implement the Security Council's resolutions in this area. (3) The General Assembly acknowledges that all member states should prepare reports on their troop strength and the total number of domestic weapons and submit them to the Security Council when discussing proposals related to universal disarmament. (4) The General Assembly should call on all governments to do their utmost to assist the General Assembly in fulfilling its responsibilities in order to establish lasting peace and maintain world security. This work is of concern to the people of the world because disarmament can alleviate the heavy burden of excessive military spending, which is not needed after the war.

### U.S. New Plan Incorporates Elements from All Sides

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 30th] While the Political Committee continued to discuss the Soviet disarmament plan and the amendments from Australia and Canada, the United States today presented a new plan, which incorporates the main points of each of the above plans. The new plan will be presented by U.S. representative Connally at tomorrow's meeting, with four main points: The first three points must be submitted by the General Assembly to the Security Council, and the fourth point will be executed automatically by the General Assembly, including (1) The Security Council should immediately draft implementation measures for universal disarmament through international agreements; (2) The Security Council should first consider the Atomic Energy Commission's report; (3) The Security Council should consider the control of arms protection; (4) The General Assembly requests all member states to assist the Security Council and the Atomic Energy Commission in fulfilling their tasks. The plan does not involve the veto power. In fact, the U.S. delegation stated that the use of the veto power may invalidate disarmament efforts.

[United Press, Lake Success, 30th] The United States and the Soviet Union today unanimously advocated that the United Nations should first discuss the issue of atomic energy in its universal disarmament plan, but the two countries' opinions on the principle of applying the veto power are still far apart. China, France, and Britain, together with the United States, oppose the application of the veto power to the atomic energy issue, while the Soviet Union insists that the veto power should be reserved for all issues within the Security Council.

### Samoa's Overseas Chinese Equality - Our Proposal Rejected After All, No Result from Debate on Revising Trusteeship Agreement

[Central News Agency, New York, 30th Special Dispatch] The Trusteeship Committee of the General Assembly has rejected the suggestion of our representative, namely that it guarantees all member countries in today's United Nations be given equal treatment with regard to entry, travel, and residence, etc. on the Samoa Islands. After examining the sixteen provisions of the trustee agreement regarding the Samoa Islands introduced by New Zealand, the committee began to consider supplements and recommendations to the above mentioned treaty articles from other delegations. The first suggestion - the one from our delegation regarding equal rights - was rejected with a vote of seven against one. Most of the representatives abstained, and those who cast opposing votes were Australia, Canada, France, Holland, New Zealand, South Africa, etc. The suggestion regarding revising the trustee agreement also advocated that provisions regarding the rights of the Trusteeship Committee in the United Nations charter should specifically point out that it has to accept petitions for scheduled viewings of trustee regions. Another suggestion for revision from our delegation was also rejected by the committee, i.e. the suggestion that all disputes within the Samoa Islands trustee region should be handled by the Trusteeship Committee and not fall under the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.

[Central News Agency, New York, 30th Special Dispatch] The respective trustee government have already asked for the right to maintain military bases in all trustee territories without needing to consult the Security Council and have gained success in this matter. Today they have also allied to reject the Soviet suggestion that it fix a hard deadline to research the trustee agreement. In revising this trustee agreement, the respective trustee governments oppose the United Nations from establishing any forceful suggestions on revising the trustee agreement. Our country's representative Liu Kai then supported the Soviet suggestion, and Yugoslavia, India, and Iraq also supported the Soviet suggestion, but the respective trustee governments all declared their opposition, so there was no result from the debate.

### India and South Africa's Dispute - Direct Talks Will Begin

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 30th] Regarding the problem of the Indian minority within the borders of South Africa, a suggestion jointly introduced by the delegation from France and Mexico was passed with twenty-four votes for and nineteen votes against; the suggestion advocated that South Africa and India should hold direct talks and resolve this problem before the General Assembly's next plenary session.

### Non-Autonomous Nationalities Should be Granted Opportunities to Convey Their Will

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 30th] The Philippines' chief representative to the General Assembly, Romulo, today introduced a new plan, asking that legal organs be given to non-autonomous people so that they can express their opinions. Britain gave support to it, but the French representatives declared their opposition to it using process-related points. First, the Philippines representative proposed to the General Assembly that the Economic and Social Council should convene international meetings on non-autonomous territories, but the British expressed their opposition, because they believe that this action will cause the United Nations to be outside of its area of activity. Romulo then gave the General Assembly's Justice Committee the new suggestion today, asking that the General Assembly urge countries that manage non-autonomous land to convene area meetings for vassal nationalities, and grant non-autonomous nationalities with the opportunity to express their traditions and will. The British representative Wood said that this new plan had no reason for opposition in terms of jurisprudence and that it may as well be unanimously passed and submitted to the Trustee Committee.

### New York City Generously Donates Land to Serve as the United Nations' Permanent Site

### Difficulties to Formally Set an Agreement Between India and Holland - Military Situation Still Worsens

Our Consul in Pontianak Will Soon Take Office

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 10th] Since the draft of the Dutch and Indonesian ceasefire agreement was released on the 18th of this month, the voices of the respective political parties opposing it increase with each passing day.

### Indian Leaders Fly to England on the Same Plane; Attlee Determined to Make a Final Effort

[Reuters, Karachi, 1st] Indian Viceroy Wavell, along with the Deputy Prime Minister of the Indian Interim Government, Nehru, Muslim League President Jinnah, Finance Minister Ali Khan, and Defense Minister Singh, departed from here on a special plane at 9:45 this morning for London.

[Associated Press, London, 30th] British Prime Minister Attlee met today with Cripps, Lawrence, and Alexander, members of the Cabinet Mission to India, to prepare to personally lead a final effort to preserve the British-proposed Indian independence plan and avoid the threat of civil unrest in India. A round table conference will be held in London next week, scheduled for five days.

Participants in the round table conference include Indian Viceroy Wavell, Muslim League President Jinnah, Secretary Ali Khan, Indian Interim Government Vice President Nehru, Interior Minister Patel representing the Congress Party, and Defense Minister Singh representing the Sikh community.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] The correspondence exchanged between British Prime Minister Attlee and Indian Interim Government Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nehru has recently been released by the British government. Nehru initially refused the British government's invitation, arguing that continued British-Indian negotiations would delay the convening of the Indian Constituent Assembly. Attlee immediately replied, stating that the British government is willing to ensure the success of the Indian Constituent Assembly and does not intend to abandon the plans of the British Cabinet Mission. Nehru then replied with another letter, reiterating that the Congress Party was unaware of the need for continued negotiations, but stated that he would be willing to come to London if he could return to India before the opening of the Constituent Assembly.

### British Army Chief of Staff to Visit Greece Tomorrow; Greece Plans to Appeal to the UN Regarding Border Disturbances

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 30th] British Army Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery is expected to arrive here from Palestine on December 3rd, at which time he will hold talks with British and Greek military authorities to discuss the security of Greece and the organization of the country's army. In addition, Greek Chief of Staff General Souiri Vodopoulos is also expected to return here from London on the same day.

[Associated Press, Athens, 30th] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris formally notified Soviet Chargé d'affaires Kouniov today that he would appeal to the Security Council, accusing external forces of inciting and directing the disturbances in northern Greece. Tsaldaris stressed that Greece maintains friendship with all countries, and hopes that all countries will consider this appeal to the Security Council as solely for the protection of its domestic and international security, and for the maintenance of peace in the Balkans, without any other intentions. Tsaldaris met with the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France yesterday, but has not yet met with the Yugoslav Chargé d'affaires, nor has he indicated a scheduled meeting.

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 30th] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris recently sent a letter to British Foreign Secretary Bevin, explaining the various major problems that Greece must face. According to a semi-official newspaper here, Foreign Secretary Bevin has replied to Tsaldaris, offering a promise that Britain will provide full support in all aspects and believes that although the situation in Greece is very serious, it is not something to be feared.

### Five U.S. Congressmen to Leave Japan for Qingdao Tomorrow; MacArthur Reportedly Satisfied with Japanese Cooperation

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 1st] U.S. Republican Congressman Buffett and four other members of Congress who have come to Japan for a visit met with MacArthur for two hours today. Afterwards, Buffett said that MacArthur was very pleased with the progress of the U.S. implementation program in Japan and the cooperation of the Japanese people. MacArthur told them: "The occupation of Japan does not cost American taxpayers money." This is different from the situation in Germany, where the U.S. has to supply food to the German people, which costs a lot of money. The five congressmen are scheduled to go to Yoshioka tomorrow, then to Qingdao on the 3rd, and then return to the U.S. via Okinawa, Manila, and Pearl Harbor to supplement the 1944 report on U.S. bases.

### Pauley's Proposed Reparations Plan Considered Favorable by the Japanese; They Claim Domestic Instability in China Makes It Difficult to Compete

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 30th] The reparations plan for Japan proposed by U.S. Reparations Commissioner Pauley has been commented on by prominent Japanese figures, who generally believe that although the plan would cause Japan to lose three-quarters of its steel and machine tools, drastically reduce its merchant ships, and completely prohibit its wartime industries, Japan's potential for trade with the Far East remains almost intact, which is unexpected. Japan's future depends on trade with the Far East. Japan's surplus industry not only guarantees its people a reasonable standard of living, but can also supply finished products to other Asian countries that cannot afford to buy American goods. Japan will especially maintain its textile industry and will continue to export cotton goods to the entire Far East. The reparations plan correctly stipulates the tonnage of Japanese merchant ships (a total of 1.5 million tons, of which 250,000 tons are specifically for trade with China and the Philippines) to facilitate Japan's trade with the Far East. On the other hand, the Japanese are convinced that China will be left with outdated and unusable equipment. The Japanese are also not saddened by the industrial equipment being compensated to China and the Philippines. There are two reasons for this: (1) They believe that even if China uses Japanese equipment, it will be difficult to compete with Japan because China's domestic situation lacks stability, which is not conducive to investment; (2) Japan's equipment is already outdated and has been excessively used during the war, and is almost worn out, so it is happy to give it away and hopes to import new equipment from the United States. In fact, the Japanese industrial community is almost impatient with the slow resolution of the reparations issue; they believe that reparations are only a small operation for Japan, and the success of the operation will ensure the future recovery of the Japanese economy.

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 30th] The San Francisco Chronicle today published an editorial supporting the recommendation of Reparations Commissioner Pauley to limit the Japanese steel industry, and also advocated that action should be taken simultaneously to develop the steel industry in China (including the Northeast provinces). It is said that the United Nations should destroy the steel and machinery production controlled by the Japanese. There is no doubt that this is a necessary step to eradicate Japan's ability to invade and to ensure that China will not continue to be threatened. Moreover, the United Nations should not only eradicate its ability to invade, but should also not be satisfied with limiting its production. Someone must take responsibility for establishing the steel industry in mainland China so that it can produce for China's industrialization. To achieve this, it is necessary to provide technical experts, machinery and equipment, and economic assistance to give the steel industry in China (including the Northeast provinces) greater production capacity. Without this active approach to complete its plan, Pauley's proposed plan would only create a dangerous industrial vacuum.

### Japanese Government to Establish Reparations Cooperation Association

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 1st] Because Pauley, the U.S. representative of the Allied Reparations Committee, has suggested to the U.S. government to quickly implement the removal of Japanese steel factories and machinery manufacturing facilities to be used as reparations, the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry plans to organize a "Reparations Facilities Removal Cooperation Association." This cooperation association will order local organizations to form branch associations to serve as agencies to assist the Allies in implementing the removal. In addition, in order to facilitate the handling of removal affairs, the Japanese government will establish reparations sections in the governments of Tokyo, Aichi, Kanagawa, Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Fukuoka, Gunma, and other prefectures to handle reparations affairs. The Japanese government plans to designate a special law, the "Reparations Removal Law," and submit it to the regular Diet session in late this month.

### How Should Japan Pay Reparations? Pauley Plan Announced; Warring Nations to Share According to Reparations List

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th, United Press] According to the recommendations of Pauley, the U.S. representative of the Allied Reparations Committee, which were announced here today, the countries that won the war against Japan will receive the majority of ships, locomotives, steel mills, and other heavy industries. In the reparations recommendations submitted by Pauley to Truman, the following list of goods will be shared by the victorious countries: 114 ships, totaling 3,611,000 tons; 30 to 40 shipyards, including three giant dry docks; 970 locomotives; 30,000 freight cars; equipment capable of manufacturing 220 locomotives, 800 passenger cars, and 4,800 freight cars per year; and approximately 600,000 machine tools. The Japanese reparations list also includes several steel furnaces capable of producing 10 million tons of steel per year, several rolling mills capable of rolling 6 million tons of steel per year, and thermoelectric and hydroelectric power plants capable of generating 2 million kilowatts. These reparations goods can be supplied to the Soviet Union and other Far Eastern countries that request a share of Japanese reparations. With its great industrial strength, the United States intends to make extremely large demands, and then transfer its gains to other countries to assist in their recovery efforts. It has not yet been decided how much each country will receive.

When to Start Distributing

Plans to convene a reparations conference to resolve these issues have stalled due to the Soviet Union's refusal to include the equipment it transported from the Northeast as part of the reparations. Pauley recommended reducing Japan's steel industry to end the reliance of Asian countries on Japan as a source of coal, iron, and steel. Pauley stated that this situation must be reversed, and that Japan must rely on Asia for the supply of pig iron ingots. As such, Japan would be prevented from regaining its war-making capabilities. Pauley also recommended: (1) All of Japan's steel ball and roller bearing manufacturing equipment should be removed to prevent it from manufacturing weapons; (2) The ships used by Japan for commercial navigation should be limited to no more than 5,000 tons each, and their routes should be limited to the islands near Japan, Korea, and China; (3) Pauley also urged action to completely restrict Japan from manufacturing or selling radios of various wavelengths in order to prevent the Japanese government from attempting to inspect overseas shortwave broadcasts; (4) Confiscate steel factories as reparations, and factories belonging to Japan's twenty largest financial groups should be confiscated first, because the equipment of these factories is more effective in terms of military organization than other factories. The Pauley reparations plan report disclosed in today's newspaper indicates that he recommended to Truman that Japan's industry be dismantled to the extent that it is only sufficient for its domestic needs. He predicted that Japan's trade in 1946 would decrease to 124 million yen, and in 1948 it would be only 39 million yen, but before 1948 there might be a trade surplus of 123 million yen. Pauley emphasized, "MacArthur's achievements are outstanding, but a clear reparations policy is still needed to transform Japan's wartime industry into a peacetime state."

Here is a brief summary of Pauley's plan: In terms of transportation, the tonnage of Japanese merchant ships should be reduced to the minimum amount necessary to meet needs. The total tonnage is 1.5 million tons, and the tonnage of each steel ship should not exceed 5,000 tons, with a maximum speed of 12 knots. The distribution method is that 1.25 million tons are needed for trade with the Japanese mainland, 125,000 tons are needed for trade with Korea, Dalian, Taiwan, and China, and 114 ships of 5,000 tons or larger can be used as reparations, as well as 30 or 40 shipyards.

Japan Still Retains Shipyards

Ten large shipyards and twelve small ones. In terms of textiles, Japan still has 2,108,000 spindles and 133,000 looms, but in order to maintain its own economy, it still needs 3 million spindles and 150,000 looms. Its cotton products are used to pay for imported cotton. Silk should be exempted from reparations, but land used for growing food should not be used for growing mulberry trees. In terms of fisheries, because Japan needs food, fisheries are exempt from reparations, but Japan should be prevented from monopolizing and plundering fish in the seas of its neighboring countries such as Korea and China. Regarding machine tools, Pauley's plan states that the tool problem is the central issue in reducing Japan's war potential. The list should be reduced to more than 175,000 units, and its potential for producing new machine tools should not exceed 1,000 units per year. A total of 600,000 units should be dismantled and removed. All items that contribute to the production of munitions will be dismantled and removed.

Regarding the Steel Sector

Pauley's plan states that Japan's blast furnace production should be limited to 500,000 tons per year, and the production of pig iron ingots should be limited to 2.25 million tons per year, which is contrary to the British view that Japan should have more steel production. Pauley's plan will force Japan to import 1 million tons of pig iron each year, thereby forcing it to rely on the countries it previously enslaved. Japan can maintain a steelmaking capacity of 1.5 million tons per year, and all other equipment should be transferred for reparations. Regarding railways, Japan's annual locomotive production should be limited to 22 units, passenger cars should be limited to 800 units, and freight cars should be limited to 4,800 units. For reparations, there are 900 steamships, 70 electric locomotives, 30,000 freight cars, and factories that can produce 850 locomotives per year. Regarding chemicals, this basic military industry should be limited to the production of fertilizers necessary for domestic food production, so that Japan no longer relies on importing phosphate fertilizers from the Pacific region. Nitric acid production equipment with an annual output exceeding 10,250 tons should be removed immediately, so that equipment with an annual production capacity of 240,000 tons of nitric acid can be used for reparations. Japan should retain a nitric acid production capacity of 300,000 tons, and factories should use 450,000 to 500,000 tons of production equipment for reparations. All asphalt distillation plants and factories that manufacture artificial ivory should be removed, just like all

Alcohol and Gasoline Factories

Except for biogas plants, because the plant has been approved to be converted into the manufacture of ammonia. Regarding power plants, Japan has a total of 28,000 power plants with a total electricity production of 4 million kilowatts, half of which should be removed. The number of hydroelectric plants that should be removed for reparations has not yet been determined and is currently under investigation. A portion of the dynamic plants can be used for distilling seawater to solve Japan's salt shortage. Regarding petroleum, all synthetic oil plants should be removed except for the five that are necessary for the manufacture of nitric acid fertilizers. All oil refineries with a daily refining capacity of more than 40,000 barrels, as well as 10 million barrels of oil in storage, should be removed for reparations. Pottery manufacturing plants and various handicrafts, such as cultured pearls, should be excluded, along with silk, tea, glass, cement, coal, wood, various foods, toys, textiles, seafood, paper, fur, rubber, various electric lamp equipment, etc., as Japan's exports, because the above-mentioned items are Japan's main exports during peacetime.

### French Political Situation Still Turbulent; The Three Major Parties Each Have Their Own Merits; General de Gaulle May Make a Comeback

[United Press, Paris, 30th] Representatives of the French Socialist Party and the Communist Party held a meeting here to exchange plans for participating in the future government. The details of the meeting are unknown. However, according to a communiqué issued by the two parties, "At today's meeting, the representatives of the Socialist Party asked the Communist Party how many seats it wants to hold in the future government in order to implement its policy plan, and asked the Communist Party to inform them of the important measures stipulated in the party's policy plan and its administrative methods. The Communist Party representatives immediately answered them one by one and raised the issue of close contact between the president, the speaker of the National Assembly, and the speaker of the Senate of the French Republic. Finally, it was decided that the information exchanged at today's meeting will be forwarded by the representatives of the two parties to their respective parties."

According to political observers, it can be seen from this communiqué that the Communist Party attempted to persuade the Socialist Party to abandon its demand that the speaker of the National Assembly should be held by former Finance Minister Auriol, but the Socialist Party representatives in the National Assembly were very cold to this and believed that only the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party could make a decision on this matter. The meeting will be held on December 3, when the candidate for the speaker of the National Assembly can be determined. In addition, many political veterans in the Radical Socialist Party have not yet expressed their opinions. The Communist Party occupies 182 of the 618 seats in the National Assembly. Even with the support of the 101 seats of the Socialist Party, it still needs the cooperation of the 43 seats of the Radical Socialist Party to maintain an absolute majority. The Popular Republican Party occupies 172 seats in the National Assembly. Adding some non-partisan seats, it has not abandoned its request for the presidency. Once it obtains a favorable opportunity, it will propose Bidault as a presidential candidate. In addition, some people in the Popular Republican Party also advocate that during the transition period, the interim government should be temporarily organized by Finance Minister Schuman, who will focus on financial recovery and limiting public expenditures. The political community attaches great importance to this plan and generally believes that this method can enable the government to take beneficial actions before the president is elected in mid-January next year.

[United Press, Paris, 30th] Amid the various parties' efforts to form a new cabinet, the possibility of de Gaulle, the leader of Free France, being recalled to the political stage to lead a "National Unity Government" is increasing in the political community here. de Gaulle has been living in seclusion in his residence by the Somme River, 100 miles from here, and has long been out of political relations since the referendum on the new draft constitution on October 13. de Gaulle has not actively participated in the current fierce party struggles and has clearly stated that he has no intention of doing so.

### Hitler's Secret Oration; Brutal Ambitions Unveiled; Washington Releases Shocking Nazi Documents

[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] The U.S. War Crimes Reporting Bureau today announced shocking Nazi documents, containing Hitler's secret oration to Nazi generals in his mountain villa in Obersalzberg in 1939, two years before the invasion of the Soviet Union. Hitler listed Stalin, Mussolini, and himself as "the only three major politicians in the world." Emperor Hirohito was listed as "weak, cowardly, and hesitant." These remarks were made on the eve of the German-Soviet Pact, that is, ten days before Hitler's invasion of Poland. Hitler declared: He intended to work with Stalin temporarily, "to discuss the redistribution of the world." And said: "Only Stalin and I have far-sighted vision." It is reported that the document was submitted to the Nuremberg International Tribunal, but not as part of the trial record. Hitler encouraged his subordinates to brutally attack Poland, saying that Nazi power lies in "our swiftness and cruelty." Genghis Khan killed millions of women and children with one person's will, and was pleased with it. History respects him as a great founder of the country. "We must take Japan into account. I will give Japan a whole year to decide, but Japan is like the last Czar, weak, cowardly, and hesitant. If there is a revolution, it may be overthrown. The current opportunity is better than ever. The only thing I fear is that Chamberlain or other pigs will come forward and propose a plan to me or seek to change my mind." Opinions of American beauty experts

### US Authorities Announce Establishment of First Permanent National Defense Force: Continuing Wartime Missions, V2 Missile Test Successful

[Associated Press, New York, 30th] Government authorities have announced the establishment of the first permanent national defense force to continue the missions of the wartime national defense force. This organization will include atomic warfare defense plans. Its tasks will include handling serious domestic disturbances, disaster relief, domestic security, and organizing passive defense mechanisms to provide rescue work in the event of enemy bomb or rocket attacks.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st Dispatch] Last week, a V-2 controllable missile was test-launched from White Sands, New Mexico, successfully ascending to an altitude of 63.5 miles. The missile contained special, excellent machinery, which was installed by the Army Air Corps.

### US Coal Miners' Strike Causes Significant Losses to Production Industry; Even Miners in the Ruhr Region of Germany React

[United Press, Washington, 30th] The government today decided to record individual fines for coal miners during the strike period, from one to two dollars per day, to be deducted after work resumes. This money will go to the medical fund of the Mine Workers Union, still managed by the union. However, this decision has gradually extinguished hopes of resolving the strike outside of court. The lawyers representing the Mine Workers Union and its president, Lewis, are not discouraged by this move and have formulated a new strategy to engage in legal battle with the government at the continued hearing on Monday. If they fail in federal district court, they will appeal to the circuit court of appeals. During the appeal period, they can avoid execution of penalties for contempt of court. Private mine owners of the Southern Coal Producers' Association are scheduled to meet here on Monday because Chairman Peek announced he was willing to negotiate all conditions, including wages and working hours, with Lewis, or else he may be removed from his position. The strike of 400,000 miners nationwide has lasted for ten days, and 100,000 steel mill and other workers have been laid off as a result. Another 167,000 people have been placed on weekend leave due to a lack of fuel in factories. According to a report from the American Iron and Steel Institute, the coal miners' strike has reduced steel ingot production by 500,040 tons this week. This amount could be used to manufacture 3.5 million household refrigerators or 200,000 automobiles. The total output lost due to strikes last year has reached 12.35 million tons. Furthermore, according to Steel magazine, the coal miners' strike has greatly reduced steel production rates, impacting the entire national industrial economy. If the stalemate is not broken soon, it will cause endless troubles. According to an Idaho telephone report, sugar factories will lose 11 million pounds of production if they do not receive sufficient coal allocations. Far away in Germany, the coal miners of the Ruhr region have also reacted to the American coal miners' strike. According to an Essen telegram, some German miners wish the American miners well in improving their working conditions, while other Germans fear that the American strike will reduce the amount of relief supplies shipped to Germany, forcing them to tighten their belts again. At the same time, the US Department of the Interior announced that it is currently negotiating to transport natural gas from the Southwest to the coal-scarce areas of the East using large and small pipelines.

### Pearl Harbor Attack Case Nears Completion, Trial for Abuse of Prisoners of War Begins; International Tribunal Enters Final Stage

[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 1st] The Far East International Tribunal has been in session since April of this year and has now been underway for eight months, currently examining the Pearl Harbor attack. Former US Combined Fleet Commander Richardson testified on the 25th of last month, stating: (1) The Japanese Navy had been plotting the attack on Pearl Harbor for ten years, and its strategy was centered on aircraft carriers. On the day of the attack, December 8th, the ratio of American to Japanese aircraft carriers was six to ten. (2) Japan violated treaties by secretly arming the islands under its mandate in the South Pacific. (3) The Japanese consulate in Hawaii had been under orders from the Japanese Navy to become a spy organization. After this important testimony, the examination of the Pearl Harbor attack has come to a conclusion. During the examination of this issue, Japanese international law scholars' wartime papers claiming that "the attack on Pearl Harbor was not illegal, but an act of self-defense" were presented and refuted, as well as sophistical arguments by Japanese statesmen at the time of defeat. On the 27th, the trial for the abuse of prisoners of war began, with various witnesses detailing the horrific conditions in prisoner-of-war camps. Thus, the trial is gradually entering its final stage. Chief Prosecutor Keenan flew back to Washington on the 28th to report on the progress to the authorities and to receive further instructions.

### Rioters Continued to Cause Trouble Yesterday; Authorities Determined to Suppress Violence and Restore Order; Any Further Transgressions Will Be Severely Punished; All Stores on All Roads to Resume Business Today

[Our Newspaper] The Huangpu Branch Bureau's handling of street vendors the day before yesterday caused a disturbance. After the detained vendors were released, things had settled down. However, starting in the afternoon, some troublemakers took the opportunity to create disturbances, and the disputes escalated. Yesterday, the aftereffects continued, causing most stores on all roads to close. However, by 5 p.m., the situation had gradually stabilized. The mayor gave a special broadcast to the citizens last night (see page 2). After persuasion from the authorities, the stores have decided to resume normal business today, and public order can be ensured without worry. Furthermore, according to a police bureau announcement, the bureau has submitted to the city government a proposal to remove restrictions on the types of street vendors in each district. Private and public vacant lots in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts will be allowed to be used for concentrated business operations.

Continuous Disturbance from Dawn to Dusk

Yesterday morning, the situation was relatively stable, and traffic was normal. Only a few pedestrians were standing in the rain in front of the Huangpu Branch Bureau. However, starting at 7 a.m., rioters formed small groups, ranging from two or three hundred people to several dozen, and went to various food markets to stop business operations. Then they scattered to various parts of the city, forcing stores to close. Many stores were vandalized for closing slightly late.

Around 9 a.m., the crowds gathered in front of the Huangpu Branch Bureau became larger and larger. It so happened that the Lao Bei Men Daxin Fresh Fruit shop was newly opening yesterday and set off firecrackers. The crowds mistook the sound for gunfire, and the order broke down. The police immediately took emergency measures. As the crowds of over a thousand people fled, some unscrupulous elements vandalized over forty stores along MinGuo Road, YanHai Road, and FuYou Road. Stores in the Nanshi area were all closed. At the same time, two or three hundred rioters were found on Fuxing Road, forming groups and causing disturbances. On Moore Road, rioters attempted to seize a police officer's handgun, injuring two pedestrians.

Starting at 9:30 a.m., rioters also did their best to stop traffic, vandalizing and looting various means of transportation. At the intersection of Tongfu Road and Fuxing Road, rioters rushed into a No. 3 public bus, drove the passengers off the bus, and smashed the glass windows. At the same time, a group of rioters in the Hongkou district caused trouble at the North Railway Station in the Binshan Road area.

At 9:40 a.m., rioters caused trouble at the Jinmen Grand Theater on Fuxing Road and forced stores to strike. At the same time, public buses at Yidingpan Road and Jinling East Road were all blocked.

Around 10 a.m., near the North Station, rioters forced stores to strike. On Wuchang Road, Sichuan Road, and Jinling East Road in the Hongkou area, rioters fired guns to show their force.

At 11 a.m., at Yunnan South Road, North Zhejiang Road, and Huaxing Road, rioters shouted slogans and forced stores to strike. Guard police officer No. 6297 at Lao Bei Men in the Yimiao district was shot and wounded by rioters, and one pedestrian was injured.

At this time, the situation around the Huangpu Branch Bureau was still stable. However, at 11:45 a.m., someone fired a shot at the bureau from the third floor of the Zhonghui Building behind the Huangpu Branch Bureau. Someone inside a building near the Huangpu Branch Bureau fired three shots in a row at the bureau, fortunately without injuring anyone. The police fired warning shots and immediately began searching, but found nothing, and the situation suddenly tightened.

At the same time, on Xinjiang Road in Zhabei, there were over two hundred rioters. At the Lao Chenghuang Temple in Nanshi, there were over seven hundred rioters, forcing stores to strike.

After 1 p.m., over four hundred unscrupulous elements riding in trucks engaged in incitement everywhere and intercepted two public buses, No. 2, No. 353 and No. 3, No. 357, and a General Staff Headquarters vehicle, No. 32018, forcing the drivers to drive to the racetrack and claiming that the mayor would be speaking at the racetrack. They were then dispersed. At this time, the rioters vandalized the glass windows of the Grand Bright Cinema, the Xiende Photo Studio, and the facades of the Carlton Apartments along the way. The police arrested dozens of people, but released them after questioning.

At 3:05 p.m., over a hundred rioters gathered at the Fujian Road Telephone Company, holding national flags and vandalizing trams.

Starting at 4:15 p.m., the situation at the Huangpu Branch Bureau suddenly deteriorated again. Rioters dragged the furniture and doors from the already vandalized Gaoshengda Paper Company to the road and set them on fire, preventing the fire brigade from extinguishing the fire. Over a thousand people gathered, and the police fired again. A stray bullet injured one plainclothes police officer, and two rioters were injured. At this time, three armored vehicles from the Special Operations Company of the Garrison Command arrived to strengthen security, and large teams of military police and mounted patrols also arrived. The crowds near Henan Road were dispersed, but over a thousand people were still gathered in front of Gaoshengda on Fujian South Road, blocking traffic.

At 5:30 p.m., representatives from the crowd, Wei Boshun, Shen Shiqi, and Lu Songfu, approached the Huangpu Branch Bureau to negotiate, saying that four street vendors were still being detained and requesting their release. After being met by Chief Du, they were allowed to inspect the detention center, but there were no street vendors being detained. After the three representatives explained this to the crowd, the crowd dispersed, and the sky was gradually darkening.

### Mayor Convenes Emergency Meeting to Discuss Strengthening Public Order; Disturbance Reported to Chairman

Regarding the handling of the dispute, the mayor convened a temporary emergency meeting at his residence yesterday afternoon, inviting City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, City Chamber of Commerce Xu Jiqing, City Police Bureau Xuan Tiewu, Jiangsu Inspector Cheng Cangbo, City Party Headquarters Secretary-General Xie Renjian, Songhu Garrison Command Tao Yishan, and City Government Investigation and Statistics Director Wang Xinheng. In addition to ordering the police authorities to maintain calm, they also decided to strictly investigate the troublemakers last night and punish them according to the law. In addition, they discussed with Xuan Tiewu how to strengthen public order in the city. If unscrupulous elements take the opportunity to cause trouble, attempting to create unrest in the city, strict measures will be taken. It is reported that Mayor Wu continued to convene the aforementioned individuals at his official residence around 6 p.m. yesterday to discuss how to protect the city's stores and business operations and prevent troublemakers from causing disturbances. At the same time, he advised all stores to open for business as usual and not close their doors for any reason.

Mayor Wu told our newspaper reporter that the situation of the city's disturbance had been reported to Chairman Chiang, and the central government has not yet expressed any opinion on the matter so far. This matter is a local event and should be handled by the local government, but due to the relationship of the situation, it was reported to the central government. Furthermore, according to city government sources, Director Xuan had sent a telegram to the central government for instructions at 10 a.m. yesterday, and after the city government meeting, he requested instructions again.

### Shanghai Student Federation's Open Letter to All Students in the City

The Shanghai Student Federation issued an open letter to all students in the city last night regarding the unfortunate disturbance in the city, stating five points: First, to this day, no party should engage in the terrifying acts of gunfire and bloodshed, or the arson and vandalism of stores that escalate the situation. Second, oppose the riots that take advantage of the chaos to harm the lives and property of innocent merchants and civilians, and oppose any third party that could exacerbate the chaotic situation and be drawn into the vortex. Third, the authorities must immediately order a fair punishment for those responsible for the inappropriate measures. The government authorities must not shirk their responsibility for any death or injury of the people. Fourth, organize an investigation committee from all sectors of society regarding the course of this tragic incident and immediately publicize the complete truth to the citizens. Fifth, we demand a society based on the rule of law, and we also demand the protection of civil rights. People's livelihoods should be more valued than the tidiness of the city, and peace and order are the only way to seek social welfare.

### Garrison Command Issues Proclamation; Emergency Measures Implemented; Any Further Riotous Actions Will Be Killed Without Exception

[Our Newspaper] The Songhu Garrison Command, in order to suppress violence, quell unrest, and maintain public order, implemented emergency measures and issued a proclamation at 5 p.m. yesterday. The original text reads: "It has been found that the city police bureau was ordered to rectify traffic in the central district of the city and to ban street vendors in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts. As a result, rioters took the opportunity to incite and gather crowds to cause disturbances, even vandalizing stores, forcing businesses to close, attacking vehicles along the way, obstructing traffic, and even shooting and injuring people and causing arson. In terms of their actions, the problem is no longer just about street vendors. The entire situation involves rioters taking advantage of the situation to harm the city's public order. In this martial law area, and during the winter defense period, this command cannot tolerate the suppression of violence and the protection of the people's livelihoods. It has ordered the city's military police to be on strict alert. If rioters again vandalize stores, damage traffic, shoot guns, or cause arson, they will be killed without exception. It is hoped that the people of the city will live in peace and security and not have any doubts. This proclamation is hereby issued." At the same time, the police headquarters had already instructed the Lao Zha and Huangpu branch bureaus yesterday morning: "Anyone who uses violence to force stores to strike or force vehicles to stop, shall be arrested immediately. If they resist with guns, they may be shot and killed on the spot, without exception. The victims of the crimes must be immediately ordered to provide a detailed report of the crimes."

### Street Vendor Representatives Visit the Mayor; Declare No Transgressions

[Our Newspaper] At 10 a.m. yesterday, Zheng Zhizhang, Zhou Yizhong, Ren Jiansheng, and Chen Xiangshui, representatives of street vendors in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts, went to the City Council to state that the actions of surrounding the Huangpu Branch Bureau and vandalizing companies and stores on Nanjing Road the day before yesterday were absolutely unrelated to the street vendors. They were accompanied by Secretary-General Xiang of the City Council to visit Mayor Wu at his official residence. The four representatives also stated to the mayor that they had not taken any action other than petitioning the City Council the morning before yesterday. The surrounding of the Huangpu Branch Bureau and the wanton vandalism of stores in the afternoon were definitely not done by street vendors. Mayor Wu expressed his appreciation for the frank statements of the four representatives and promised to do his best to find public and private vacant lots for them to continue their business operations. The four also represented all the street vendors in the two districts and wrote a written statement, the original text of which is as follows: "We are the representatives of the street vendors in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts. At 11 a.m. yesterday, we petitioned the City Council, and the City Council called the City Government. The City Government notified the Huangpu and Lao Zha branch bureaus to release all the street vendors and, with the City Council, we were told the City Government had allowed us to set up stalls in public and private vacant lots. As for the disturbances in front of the Huangpu Branch Bureau and the vandalism of stores, cars, and trams everywhere in the afternoon, they are absolutely unrelated to us street vendors. [Signed] Zheng Zhizhang, Zhou Yizhong, Ren Jiansheng, Chen Xiangshui, December 1, 1946."

### Vegetable Markets Forced to Close…A Scene of Desolation

[Our Newspaper] Starting at 7 a.m. yesterday, just when the vegetable markets were opening, groups of three to five rioters went to the vegetable markets on Ninghai East Road, Baxianqiao, Shandong Road, Beijing Road, Fuzhou Road, Shaanxi Middle Road, Julu Road, Seymour Road, and Fuyou Road in the Nanshi area to stop vegetable vendors from doing business and force stores along the way to strike. Around 8 a.m., stores along YanHai Road and Fuyou Road were angered by the rioters for closing late, resulting in over forty stores being vandalized. The once lively vegetable markets presented a scene of desolation yesterday. Most households had no choice but to use salted goods as dishes. Therefore, the salted goods stores south of the Sixteen Piles in Nanshi made three times the profit.

### Xu Jiqing·Du Yuesheng Advise Stores of All Kinds to Return to Normal; Livelihood of Street Vendors Being Properly Resolved

[Our Newspaper] City Chamber of Commerce Chairman Xu Jiqing told our newspaper reporter at 9 p.m. last night: At 6 or 7 p.m. last night, order had greatly improved, and many stores had opened for business. The authorities have now taken effective measures, and it is believed that everything will be fine today. As for the livelihood of street vendors, the government is determined to find a solution. The main reason for the ban in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts is that the population is too dense and they are important transportation routes. As for remote areas, there is no intention to ban them. As for compensation for the losses of stores in the chaos, it is difficult to talk about it for the time being. Furthermore, this disturbance and vandalism is no longer a street vendor issue and obviously has another background. Business people must clearly distinguish and think carefully in this situation, be calm, and not be incited. Yesterday morning, some shops on Nanjing Road and Fujian Road were not closed, probably because they did not fully understand the truth. It is hoped that after this advice, they can immediately return to normal and jointly maintain order. As for local public order, the municipal authorities are responsible, and businessmen do not need to be alarmed by alarmist remarks, etc.

Another Report: Shanghai Local Association Chairman Du Yuesheng made a statement on the street vendor issue yesterday, saying: "Yesterday, the situation fluctuated due to the street vendor issue. By today, almost all prosperous areas have been forced to close, which is a rare chaos. Speaking of the causes of this matter, on the surface, it is about the livelihood of street vendors, but in reality, it is a serious economic problem. This is too far to say, so let's not talk about it for now. The municipal authorities have taken emergency measures to maintain public order, which is very proper. After consultations, the location of stalls can also be resolved. This issue has come to an end. It is hoped that all industries in the city will return to normal business as usual immediately, and the municipal authorities will definitely provide effective protection without hesitation. Furthermore, the banning of street vendors is actually for the purpose of cleaning up the city, smoothing traffic, and seeking public welfare. As for the livelihood of street vendors after the ban, we deeply feel the difficulty and express our sympathy. Before this dispute occurred, the parties concerned were already discussing and planning. The authorities were not using the ban as the final solution."

### A Crowd Shouts to Burn Again · Shop Assistants Kneel and Beg, but to No Avail · Gao Sheng Great Paper Store Completely Burned Down · Police Open Fire, Injuring Three

[Report from Our Newspaper] Gao Sheng Great Paper Store, located at 250 Jinling Road, was previously destroyed by a mob during the disturbances of the other day, with the paper from the store dragged onto the road and burned, as reported in yesterday's edition of this newspaper. Yesterday morning, as the situation seemed relatively calm, the store staff hired people to begin repairs and erected a bamboo fence in front of the store. Unexpectedly, around 3 PM, a mob gathered around the store, and chaos erupted again. Someone in the crowd shouted, "Burn it again!" and over a thousand people responded in unison. They then tore down the remaining paper from the store that hadn't been burned the other day, along with the door panels, display counters, and the newly erected bamboo fence, and burned them all, creating a raging fire. At that time, firefighters arrived to put out the fire as the flames shot high into the air, but were blocked by the mob and unable to turn on the water hoses. Traffic was completely blocked, and the noise was deafening. The fire continued to burn until 6 PM without being extinguished. One of the store staff members knelt on the ground to beg for mercy, but the mob completely ignored him. All of the store's assets were completely destroyed in the blaze. The police then opened fire to disperse the crowd. One person was seriously injured, and another lightly injured during the chaos. An undercover police officer was also injured. It is reported that the military and police authorities have arrested one person who directed the arson and are currently interrogating him severely. As for the report in yesterday's paper that boiling water was poured down, the store has stated that this is inaccurate.

### Surprised and Delighted · Under an Atmosphere of Tension · Congratulations on New Marriages Everywhere

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the calendar, yesterday was an "auspicious day" and also a Sunday, so many people chose this day to hold engagements and weddings. Although the entire city was shrouded in an atmosphere of immense desolation, the happy events of the newlyweds were not affected in the slightest. Yesterday afternoon, this reporter drove to locations such as Kang Rong, International, Jin Long, Wan Xun Hall, East Asia You Yi Lou, and the New Life Clubhouse. Everywhere, the halls were adorned with "Double Happiness" characters, and guests were constantly arriving to offer congratulations. In stark contrast to the streets, where traffic was cut off, guards stood watch, and stores were closed, this was a completely different world. They and their partners are truly blessed!

### Yesterday Evening, the City Council Announced · The Handling of the Street Vendor Case · The Street Vendor Problem Has Been Resolved Satisfactorily · Three Points of Advice Proposed for Speedy and Proper Settlement

The Shanghai City Council has issued the following statement regarding the handling of the street vendor problem, including its progress and opinions: It has been found that the Municipal Government Police Bureau, in order to facilitate traffic and improve the appearance of the city, prohibited street vendors from setting up stalls in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts. The police sub-bureaus of these two districts strictly enforced this prohibition, detaining many street vendors. On the morning of November 30th, street vendor representatives Zhou Yizhong, Liu Huashan, Bao Guizhi, Zheng Zhizhang, and 24 others gathered at the City Council to appeal. These representatives then made two oral requests: (1) Immediately release the detained street vendors to prevent them from suffering from hunger and cold. (2) Delay the implementation of the prohibition or find alternative business locations for them to maintain their livelihoods. Secretary-General Xiang Changqu received the representatives and immediately contacted Mayor Wu by telephone to report the situation. Mayor Wu replied that the detained street vendors could be immediately released by the two sub-bureaus and that he would consider finding alternative locations for them to operate in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts. The representatives were satisfied upon hearing this and requested that the City Council, considering their livelihoods, continue to negotiate with the Municipal Government before they departed. At 3 PM (November 30th), during a meeting of the chairpersons of various committees to discuss routine cases, Councilors Tang Shichang and others, due to the Huangpu sub-bureau prohibiting the delivery of food and clothing to the detained street vendors, causing them to suffer from hunger and cold, and the beating of street vendor family members, considered the situation to be serious. They proposed a temporary motion, which was resolved by sending Councilors Tang Shichang, Zhu Wende, and Wang Xianqing to investigate the truth and act accordingly. Shortly after 4 PM, more than ten street vendor representatives, accompanied by the family members of the detained street vendor Ji Xi'en and Ji Zhennian, came to the Council to state that Ji Zhennian had been beaten and injured while delivering food. They were informed that councilors had already been sent to investigate. The vendors then left. Previously, on November 14th, the City Council received a petition from street vendors in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts and, in accordance with the Council's First General Assembly Resolution No. 3 (Method Clause 2, to re-designate street vendor areas on the principle of not hindering the appearance of the city and not hindering traffic), requested the police to investigate and respond. At that time (5 PM on the 30th), a reply also arrived, stating: "In consideration of the livelihoods of the street vendors, this bureau has submitted a request to the Municipal Government for a slight accommodation, allowing the street vendors to choose public or private open spaces within the two districts to operate in a concentrated manner and has instructed the relevant sub-bureaus accordingly." The City Council believes that the police bureau's response has accommodated the vendors' requests and immediately forwarded the letter to the vendor representatives that evening. As for the gathering of crowds surrounding the Huangpu sub-bureau at the afternoon of the 30th, hoping to disrupt public order, and the destruction of cars and shops by the mob in the evening, the representatives Zhou Yizhong, Zheng Zhizhang, Ren Jiansheng, and Chen Tongqian stated to the City Council (at noon on December 1st) that no street vendors participated in these events. They also stated that they are satisfied with the police bureau's response and measures. Therefore, the street vendor problem has been resolved. As for the mob surrounding the police sub-bureau on the 30th, the destruction of cars and shops along the way, and the continued coercion of shops to close on the morning of the 1st, the authorities believe that there are unruly elements taking advantage of the situation to disrupt the mourning and that it was clearly not done by street vendors. The Council Speaker and Councilors Tang, Zhu, and Wang personally went to the scene of the incidents to investigate and strongly urged the Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to handle the matter. The Council believes that the following points should be handled separately in the aftermath:

(1) Please request the Municipal Government to designate open spaces within the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts, in accordance with the resolution of the City Council, to allow street vendors to register and set up stalls and to return the goods and equipment confiscated from the street vendors in order to allow them to actively make a living and reduce their losses. The prohibition of street vendors in other districts that have not been banned should be temporarily suspended.

(2) If the Huangpu sub-bureau has indeed prohibited street vendor family members from delivering food and clothing and has committed unwarranted beatings, it is a violation of humanitarian principles. The superiors should investigate and deal with the matter in accordance with the law to demonstrate the government's respect for the legitimate rights of the people.

(3) As for the spreading of rumors, disrupting the market, and coercing business closures, it is clear that a small number of unruly elements have other intentions. In addition to supporting each other and maintaining order, the citizens of the city have the right to demand that the Municipal Government and the military and police authorities do their utmost to maintain law and order and protect businesses. We make this solemn announcement and hope that all citizens will not easily believe rumors and alarm themselves during this time. In particular, we hope that shops in all districts will immediately resume normal business hours so that social order can be restored to normal as soon as possible.

### The Disturbance Can Be Quickly Quelled · Citizens Need Not Be Alarmed · Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu Issues a Statement

The Central News Agency reporter learned last night that the Garrison Headquarters would issue a notice to enforce martial law in order to suppress the violence and restore order. He specially visited Commander Xuan at the Garrison Headquarters, who received him and issued a statement, saying: After the establishment of the Garrison Headquarters last year, it was reported to the highest authorities and approved to declare this city a martial law area. This martial law order is still in effect. In the spring of this year, in order to facilitate the night travel of citizens, the curfew was lifted, but this did not mean that the martial law order was cancelled. This time, unruly elements have caused disturbances in this city. The Garrison Headquarters could have declared special martial law, but in order to avoid inconvenience to the people of this city, who are numerous, it had to proceed with caution. However, in order to eliminate violence, maintain the security and order of this city, and curb the spread of chaos, it had to take appropriate measures and severely punish illegal violence. There are strong police forces deployed in all parts of the city, which are sufficient to suppress the riots and protect the merchants and people. There is absolutely no need to worry about security. It is believed that after the Garrison Headquarters issues the notice and implements it earnestly, the disturbance can be quickly quelled. He hopes that all merchants and people in the city will live and work in peace and not alarm each other.

### Talking About Police Administration in the Midst of Winter Defense

— Special Article from This Newspaper

Since Shanghai opened as a port, under the operation of international capital, it has superficially become a prosperous metropolis, displaying its superior position. However, the residents from all directions are of mixed quality, so from the side of the metropolis, it is actually a den of vice. All acts of deception, plunder, swindling, drug trafficking, murder, and robbery can be found here. Especially in the past during the concession period, many criminals often acted recklessly under the protection of foreigners, using the concessions as a shield.

According to the police bureau's report, there were a total of 19,963 criminal cases in the year after the victory, averaging 547 cases per day. This is an alarming number, and maintaining Shanghai's security is not an easy task. At the same time, the more developed material civilization is, the more cases of fraud and deception there are. The precise planning and swift action make it even more difficult for the security bureau to be responsible for maintaining order. Therefore, it has to adopt newer prevention and control techniques and institutions, such as wireless radio patrol cars, which have appeared in Shanghai one after another. Shanghai's police administration has been advancing along this historical path.

The weather is gradually getting colder. In the northwest wind, the poor can't stand the cold and hunger even more. Criminal behavior is more common than in warmer weather. They take advantage of the cold night when most citizens are hiding in their warm beds, and the rustling of the wind drowns out the sound of their actions. They use stealing and looting to solve the problem of hunger and cold. The annual winter defense is arising in response to the situation. This year's winter defense has already begun. On cold and snowy nights, the police officers will intensify their work even more.

### Evolution of the Shanghai Police Bureau

The Shanghai Police Bureau was initially called the Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau. It was reorganized and established on July 22nd, 1927, from the former Songhu Police Department. On July 1st, 1930, it was renamed the Shanghai Public Security Bureau according to the regulations of the City Organization Law. On January 1st, 1947, it was renamed the Shanghai Police Bureau. The evolution can be divided into four stages:

### Patrol and Baojia Bureau

In the past, Shanghai County set up positions such as county sheriff and patrol inspector to be responsible for patrolling and arresting thieves and governing traitors. These official titles continued to be used in the early Qing Dynasty, but the number of personnel was limited, so there was no administrative efficiency to speak of. It was not until after the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising that the Qing government intensified its efforts to rectify local administration, promulgated the Baojia Regulations, promoted the Baojia system, and established the Patrol and Baojia Bureau. The bureau was established with a chief patrol officer appointed by the Shanghai Daotai to manage patrol and Baojia affairs inside and outside the city. The main bureau was initially located at Chenxiang Pavilion in the city center and later moved to Changpingcang next to the county government. Nine branch bureaus were subsequently set up in the east, south, west, north, and outer parts of the city, including Beixinjing, Yinxianggang, Hongkou, and Pudong. The personnel in the bureaus were assigned from the garrison military camps and were all under the jurisdiction of the main bureau. At that time, the chief patrol officer of the bureau issued a notice stating: "This chief patrol officer is ordered by the constitution to supervise the patrol and Baojia affairs inside and outside the city. It has been reported that there are notorious ruffians, as well as swindlers, matchmakers, kidnappers, pickpockets, thieves, and foreign gangsters, gathering in groups of three or five in tea houses and wine shops, calling it 'eating Jiang tea'; colluding to defraud and acting lawlessly, harming the local area, and falsely claiming collisions, extorting money, snatching hats, stealing objects, seizing women's jewelry, fabricating rumors... Especially, there are unscrupulous people who gather crowds to open gambling dens, collecting commissions and profiting from them, such as Pai Gow, dice throwing, Ya Bao, Fantianyin, and various other names... In order to eliminate harm for the people, this chief patrol officer should arrest and severely punish them by name. However, considering their ignorance, I cannot bear to punish them without teaching them. If they can refrain from now on... then they will be spared from the past; if they continue on the same path... they will be immediately named and investigated." From this, it can be seen that the management matters of the bureau were only like this.

### Road Works Aftermath Bureau and Recruitment Regulations

During the Patrol and Baojia Bureau period, the military and police were still mixed and undivided. In the twenty-fourth year of Guangxu, the Road Works Bureau in the southern city was renamed the Road Works Aftermath Bureau. As the outer roads had recently been built, the "Chinese Patrol Police Station" was established for the purpose of suppressing patrols and investigations. Three locations were set up in the P灘 area, and patrol officers were selected from the Yongding battalion of the Jiangsu Fubiao army stationed there. Recruitment regulations were also established: "1. Must be physically strong; 2. Around 30 years old; 3. Regardless of which province they are from, they must be familiar with the local situation and be able to speak the local language; 4. Must have a proper shop guarantee; 5. Must not smoke opium, be addicted to alcohol, or gamble; 6. Must take the examination at the bureau in person and not be allowed to be replaced; 7. One person is not allowed to register under two names, violators will be penalized; 8. Those who are absent will be deducted from the register and will not be allowed to retake the exam; 9. The bureau's servants who have been dismissed for reasons are not allowed to serve as patrol officers; 10. Separate regulations for patrol and Yongding officers will be established and strictly followed, violators will be punished." Later, 60 patrol officers were selected, and the Shanghai Daotai subsequently hired six Indian patrol officers. When Wusong planned to open a port, it was proposed to set up a patrol police station, but it was not realized. In the 30th year of Guangxu, the Zhabei Engineering Bureau requested official operation due to insufficient commercial funds, which was realized in the 32nd year of Guangxu.

### From Police Academy to Patrol Police Bureau

The establishment of the bureau and the recruitment of patrol officers was merely imitating the concession regulations and did not establish a police administrative system. In the thirtieth year of Guangxu, the Qing government added the Patrol Police Department. The Shanghai Daotai drafted a plan and submitted it to the Jiangdu and Sufu for approval to set up the police. The Shanghai Magistrate was appointed as the director, and one officer stationed in the camp was appointed as the co-director to assist him with five local gentry. The training of talents was started first. The Qiuzhi Academy was changed into the Police Academy. A student majoring in police administration who had studied in Japan was hired as a teacher. One hundred Yongding soldiers stationed in the camp were selected to study in the academy, and students were also recruited at the same time. Starting from the thirty-first year of Guangxu, the Police Station was opened and the Patrol and Baojia Bureau was abolished, renamed the Patrol Police Bureau. Due to limited funds, the scale was very small, and the regulations were also very simple. In the thirty-third year of Guangxu, the Jiangdu sent a telegram to the Shanghai Daotai, stating that "the security of Shanghai is related to the overall situation, and we must devote all our efforts to protect our sovereignty." The police administration was promoted, and a candidate Daotai was appointed as the director. The Zhabei Engineering Bureau, which had been changed to the officially run Shanghai North City Road Engineering Patrol Bureau, was reorganized again into the Shanghai Patrol Police Bureau, planning the police area into four districts and twenty sub-districts. The following year, the Qing government changed the Ministry of Civil Affairs and sent a telegram to Jiangsu Province to set up a Patrol Police Daotai. Shanghai set up a Patrol Police Daotai to implement policing in the four districts and twenty-two sub-districts. Later, the Patrol Police Daotai was transferred to Suzhou, and the Shanghai Patrol Police Bureau was changed to a bureau director.

### New Look After the Republic

After Shanghai was restored, the director of the Zhabei Patrol Police Bureau fled without a trace. The city's police affairs were under the jurisdiction of the Director of the Police Department of the Shanghai Municipal Government. In the second year of the Republic of China, the Yuan government promulgated the "Uniformity Order of the Current Local Police Office Organization," and the Songhu Police Department was established, with jurisdiction over the two counties of Shanghai and Baoshan. The internal departments included the Secretarial and Inspection Offices, and the General Affairs, Administration, Justice, and Health Sections; the external departments included one to six district offices, and 19 sub-offices under the districts. There was also a security police team, four patrol police teams, a water patrol police team, and a detective police team, totaling more than 3,000 people. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Special City was formally established, and the Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau was established to be in charge of Shanghai's police administration. In the 19th year, it was renamed the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. In the 26th year, it was renamed the Shanghai Police Bureau. However, the scope of jurisdiction was limited to the suburbs. After the victory, the two concessions were taken back, and the authority was also taken back at the same time. Shanghai's police administration was thus unified.

### The "Patrol Police Station" of the Past

"Go to the Hangli" has become a common saying in Shanghai. The so-called "Hang" is the patrol police station that used to maintain security in the concessions. Police is a modern professional term, but the two concessions still used the old term "Patrol Police," and the agency was also called the Patrol Police Station.

Sounding the Alarm

When the concessions were first established, only a few Chinese were hired as watchmen to sound alarms. This was under the jurisdiction of the consul. In 1854, the Small Swords Society occupied Shanghai County, and residents flocked to the concessions. The three countries of Britain, the United States, and France jointly established a Municipal Council. At the same time, citing the practical need, they organized a patrol police team and hired Clifford, an official from the Hong Kong Patrol Police Station, to serve as the chief patrol officer in Shanghai. This was the beginning of the establishment of the Patrol Police Station in the concessions.

According to the land regulations first established, the Chinese government expressly stipulated that a police office was not allowed to be set up in the concessions. When the Taiping Army invaded, Shanghai County still had to beg for British and French protection, so it was natural that the concessions could not be taken care of. The consuls of Britain, the United States, and France arbitrarily amended the land regulations and established a police office.

The Patrol Police Station belonged to the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council. If there was any infringement of the consul's authority, the consuls would be dissatisfied. In 1855, the Small Swords Society withdrew from Shanghai County, and order gradually recovered. The consuls thought that it was dangerous for the Municipal Council to place weapons in the hands of the Patrol Police. After consultation among the consuls of Britain, the United States, and France, the result was that they jointly issued a notice stating that the current Patrol Police officials had been suspended from their duties and that they could not perform their duties without the approval of the Chinese and foreign authorities. Four months later, British Consul Aliguer signed an agreement with the Municipal Council, and since then the Public Concession had a standing patrol police force.

Initially, There Were Only Eight Police Officers

Initially, there were only eight police officers in the concession, led by the chief patrol officer. In 1860, the Taiping Army attacked Shanghai, and the number of Chinese entering the concession suddenly increased to 300,000. The number of police officers in the concession also suddenly increased to 200. In 1864, the Taiping Army was defeated, and most of the Chinese refugees returned, and the Chinese population in the concession fell to about 70,000. It was quite difficult in terms of administration economy, so the police force was reduced to 164.

Initially, the police officers in the concession were all foreigners. The hiring of Chinese police officers began in 1865. In this year, the Public Concession had 61 foreign police officers and 42 Chinese police officers. In 1884, Indian police officers began to be hired. In 1926, 30 Japanese police officers were also hired and stationed in the Hongkou area. The area of the concession expanded day by day, and the population became denser day by day. The number of police officers increased accordingly, and the strength of the guard also increased. By 1937, the police office of the Public Concession had 452 foreign police officers, 272 Japanese police officers, 3,452 Chinese police officers, and 555 Indian police officers.

Former French Concession

As for the French Concession, Consul General Eitang was the first to oppose the patrol police system and stated that he did not want to be involved in the Municipal Council of the Public Concession retaining patrol police. However, since the failure of the Small Swords Society, the market situation in the French Concession had also gradually prospered. In 1856, at a meeting of landlords, there was a proposal to organize a patrol police station in the French Concession, and three foreign patrol police officers were hired to patrol day and night. However, this was cancelled at the beginning of the following year due to landlord opposition. It was not until December of that year that 12 patrol police officers were hired, and the patrol police station was formally established.

In 1862, the French Concession separated from the Public Concession and became independent, and the Public Board of Directors was established. The directors were appointed by the French Consul. From that time on, the patrol police station was also placed under the jurisdiction of the Public Board of Directors. After taking over, the Public Board of Directors actively reorganized the small patrol police station and appointed Nengde, a retired French soldier stationed in Shanghai, as the chief patrol officer. At this time, the number of arrest warrants had increased to 4, and there were 20 patrol officers. By 1906, Vietnamese arrests were added, and the number of Chinese arrests was also increased to more than 150. By 1935, there were more than 2,000 police officers in the French Concession.

The administrative head of the police office was the police chief supervisor, who was directly ordered by the French Consul General stationed in Shanghai. However, the expenses of the police office and the salaries of the police officers were borne by the Public Board of Directors of the French Concession. This was different from the system of the Public Concession.

After the victory, the patrol police stations were also dissolved along with the concessions. Most of the foreign police officers who had served in the two concessions had been dismissed, and Shanghai's police power was thus unified.

### The "All-Knowing" of the Concessions Era

In the past, the police departments of the two concessions in this city had plainclothes detectives, commonly known as "Bao Da Ting" [All-Knowing]. These individuals were familiar with the situation of Shanghai society, divided into categories, each with a defined scope, generally classified as "political," "gambling and opium," "bandits and thieves," and "prostitution tax."

In addition to the above, the "Bao Da Ting" of the French Concession had a special temporary task: protecting important Chinese government figures passing through or residing there. When necessary, they even took up permanent residence in the homes of these important figures, taking shifts around the clock until the figures left Shanghai, at which point they would withdraw.

These "All-Knowing" carried pistols on their person for immediate execution of their duties. However, because they were in plainclothes, they could often achieve "lightning-fast" results. There were amusing stories of robbers and petty thieves attempting robbery and extortion against the "Bao Da Ting," only to be captured on the spot and turned into prisoners delivered to the door.

The current municipal police bureau still employs plainclothes officers, but the name "Bao Da Ting" is rarely heard anymore. Especially for those newly arrived in Shanghai from other places, if you mention that name to them, they will surely be at a loss as to what you mean.

### Shanghai's Female Police Officers

In the city, there are many who commit crimes, and they spare no effort to evade the eyes and ears of law enforcement. They even exploit ignorant women to carry contraband, engaging in various cooperative criminal activities involving both men and women. Because male police officers are restricted by gender differences, they are often unable to directly exercise their authority even when encountering suspicious individuals. Thus, female police officers emerged as needed.

New York was the birthplace of female police officers. In our country, Hangzhou was the first city to establish a female police force, followed by Peiping. Their performance in service has been very good.

In the spring of the eighteenth year of the Republic [1929], the Shanghai Sixth District Party Headquarters proposed to the municipal government the establishment of female inspectors. Mayor Zhang Yuejun ordered the Public Security Bureau Chief Yuan Liang to conduct recruitment examinations. The qualifications for application at that time required excellent character and scholarship, age over thirty, and familiarity with social conditions. Although there was enthusiastic registration, only twenty were selected after the examination. After reviewing their resumes, they were all highly educated, and most had served as school principals, teachers, and civil servants. After being selected, experts were hired to train them, and then they were assigned to stations and docks for service. They performed well, and over the years, they cracked countless cases of kidnapping women, bandit gangs, gambling dens, drugs, and weapons. However, these female inspectors mostly worked in plainclothes, unlike female police officers.

The formal addition of female police officers in Shanghai began in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic [1936]. First, Public Security Bureau Chief Cai Jingjun, seeing the need for female police officers in the city, specifically requested the municipal government's approval to establish a female police training class within the police training center. Forty female police officers were recruited, with 274 applicants. 228 people actually took the test. Most of the applicants were junior high school graduates, totaling 154; 74 were elementary school graduates, 12 were high school graduates, and 7 had college degrees or higher. On August 12, the results were announced, with 25 officially selected and 5 as alternates. The remaining 15 vacancies were filled by a second round of recruitment on August 24. After the two rounds of examinations, a total of 36 fully qualified candidates were selected. The opening ceremony was held on September 1 at the Longhua Police Training Center. The female police uniforms were uniformly black tops, white pants, and black hats, solemn and neat. After four months of training, all graduated on New Year's Day of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic [1937]. On January 7, they were formally assigned to various branch bureaus to assist in household registration investigations and serve as female investigators, and they were diligent and competent in their work.

### Bamboo Cloth Long Gown and Melon-Cap Hat: Such Strange Attire for Chinese Police

When Chinese police officers were first employed by the French Concession, their attire was very unique: in the autumn and summer seasons, they wore melon-cap hats with a large red knot sewn on top, and long gowns made of bamboo cloth. There were no regulations for the style of shoes. In the winter, they wore felt hats with gold tassels and gray cotton robes, covered with Western-style overcoats. Badges and numbers identified them, and they carried a "swagger stick" as a means of self-defense.

Soon after, the uniform was changed to a sky-blue feather satin jacket, similar in shape to a mandarin jacket but slightly longer, with a badge and number worn on the left lapel to show uniformity. However, the pants and shoes could still be worn at will. Except in summer, when they wore red-tasseled rattan hats, they usually wore large red-tasseled hats. Later, the red tassels on the hats were changed to red, white, and blue. Eventually, the dark-colored pants were abolished and replaced with uniform pants identical to the jackets, which began to resemble police uniforms somewhat.

### A Brief Account of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps

This special organization for defending Shanghai has a history almost as long as the concessions themselves. Throughout its long history, it has undergone many reforms, and its ranks are quite modernized. In the past, Shanghai repeatedly suffered from war, and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps certainly fulfilled a great responsibility.

The Shanghai Volunteer Corps began with the "Volunteer Force" organized by British residents in 1853. At that time, the Taiping Army had taken Nanjing and Zhenjiang, and foreign residents in Shanghai were fearful. They armed themselves to remain neutral, and organizing the Volunteer Force was the first thing they did. In 1855, the Taiping Army's momentum waned, and the Volunteer Force gradually became nominal. In 1860, the Taiping Army again captured Hangzhou and approached Suzhou, so the Shanghai British Volunteer Force was reorganized to protect the concessions.

In 1862, a light cavalry unit was also organized, and the existence of the Volunteer Corps gradually became permanent. On July 2, 1870, the Volunteer Corps held a meeting and decided to be governed by the Municipal Council, becoming a formal organization. Since then, it has been expanded and reorganized many times, and affiliated units have continued to increase. Some affiliated units were disbanded midway, such as the Customs Team, but most were maintained until the disbandment in 1942. The establishment dates of each unit are listed below:

"A" Company British 1853

"B" Company British 1855

Shanghai Light Horse British 1862

Shanghai Artillery British 1870

Japanese Company Japanese 1900

American Company American 1906

Portuguese Company Portuguese 1906

Chinese Company Chinese 1907

Shanghai Engineer Corps British 1907

Shanghai Scottish Company British 1914

American Cavalry American 1923

Russian First Company (Regular) Russian 1927

Russian Second Company (Regular) Russian 1927

Russian Fourth Company (Regular) Russian 1932

Philippine Company Filipino 1932

American Machine Gun Company American 1932

American Reserve Company American 1932

Transport Company British/German 1932

Signal Company Austrian/Italian/Czech/British/German/Austrian/Italian/Czech 1932

Interpreter Company Chinese 1932

Air Defense Company 1932

Jewish Company Jewish 1932

### Chinese Company

The Chinese Company in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was reorganized from the Chinese Merchants Gymnastics Association. After Shanghai became an international city with the opening of trade, Chinese people were often discriminated against by foreigners. In 1905, the case of Li Huang led to a major disturbance at the Mixed Court, causing unrest that lasted for days. Thereupon, Chu Qiaqing, Hu Jimei, Yuan Hengzhi, and others initiated the organization of the Volunteer Corps to maintain local security and protect the lives and property of residents. They raised funds and initially established it within the Chinese Merchants Gymnastics Association, later changing it to the Chinese Company Public Association. At one time, more than 500 people responded to the call, divided into four infantry companies, one cavalry company, and one military band. They opened up vacant land on North Zhejiang Road as a parade ground, purchased firearms, and hired instructors, and they became a proper army.

One year after the Chinese Company was established, it never had any relations with the concessions, and the number of members gradually decreased. The initiators decided to request to join the Shanghai Volunteer Corps as the Chinese Company. With the consent of the Municipal Council, they signed a contract to join the Corps on March 17, 1907, at the Municipal Hall on Nanjing Road at the time, becoming one of the affiliated units of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.

### Five Conditions

When the Chinese Company first joined, the Municipal Council stipulated five conditions: (1) The number of people should be between 50 and 100. (2) Members must be respectable merchants, unrelated to politics, and in good health. (3) Each person must have a substantial guarantor. (4) The company commander must be a Westerner. (5) Firearms and bayonets must not be taken home; they must be collected before use and returned to the armory after use. At that time, the members compromised and maintained a pure union, which was warmly admired by both Chinese and foreigners. In particular, when they participated in the shooting competition for the first time in 1909, they won the "Brainsby" trophy, which was greatly praised. They gradually received equal treatment with the other national teams, which made the later prosperous situation.

Since its establishment, the organization of the Volunteer Corps has been expanding daily. Initially, the Municipal Council signed a contract with the British War Office to borrow regular army officers to serve as commanders, but after the outbreak of the European War, volunteer officers took over. The training of the Volunteer Corps included marching, shooting, marching drills, mobilization exercises, riot control, and field warfare and camping, etc. The target range in Hongkou Park is where the Volunteer Corps practiced shooting. The target range was originally located near North Henan Road on Target Road, but because the nearby residents gradually increased, it was moved next to Hongkou Park in 1895.

In September 1942, the former Municipal Council resolved to disband the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. The 90-year-old Shanghai Volunteer Corps thus became a name in Shanghai's history.

### Mounted Patrol

In the past, during the concession era, whenever there were large parades or troops departing, there were always several Indian police officers riding tall horses leading the way. Even for the grand funerals of wealthy families, they were used to clear the road. This was the Mounted Patrol of the concessions, a very special decoration of Shanghai.

The Mounted Patrol originated in 1864 and was officially established the following year, initially starting in Yangshupu. At that time, Macleod Road was still a wilderness with no inhabitants and no patrol police. There was a so-called "Light No. 96," which was the only police light in the area, allowing citizens coming from afar to safely return to the city at night. The authorities lit this light to protect the safety of the area. Every time the sun set, the Mounted Patrol would send two people to guard it, and they would return only after the light was extinguished the next morning. At the time, this work was considered adventurous, so the Mounted Patrol was established to handle it.

Later, the Mounted Patrol gradually expanded to the entire Public Concession. The section from the Racecourse to Jing'an Temple was the patrol area of the Mounted Patrol, performing a rather interesting task: prohibiting galloping on the road and carriages from speeding, because Shanghai people at the time liked to race in carriages, so-called "showing off." Later, as the population increased in the Hongqiao area, the duties of the Mounted Patrol expanded to Macleod Road. The Mounted Patrol played a special role in Shanghai's police administration. The areas where roads were built beyond the boundaries were all patrolled by them, serving as a security guarantee. However, since the popularity of automobiles, the Mounted Patrol has lost its value, and it was disbanded in September 1940 due to feed difficulties.

The personnel of the Mounted Patrol never exceeded thirty people. At the time of dissolution, there were two foreign and two Indian police officers, and 22 Indian police officers, most of whom had served in the Indian Army. The organization was quite similar to the Royal Canadian Northwest Mounted Police, aiming to achieve greater results with fewer personnel. This 26-person Mounted Patrol was sufficient for the entire Public Concession at the time. The team had forty fine horses, most of which were donated by horse owners in the city, and many were famous steeds that had triumphed at the racecourse. When the Mounted Patrol was disbanded, they were returned to their original owners.

### The Former Indian Police, Annamese Police, and Japanese Police

In the past, Shanghai's police, in addition to Chinese officers and Western police of the concessions, also included Indian police, Annamese police, and Japanese police. These many people of different ethnicities jointly defended this international city.

Indian police can be said to be a special decoration of Shanghai. Each one was a burly man, with a full beard and a red turban, which contrasted interestingly with their dark brown skin. The Indian police in the Mounted Patrol, riding on tall horses, felt even more imposing. No wonder some people would use Indian police to scare crying children late at night. "Ah San" became a synonym for Indian police, but its origin is unknown.

Indian Police

When did Shanghai have Indian police? In 1860, when the Taiping Army attacked Shanghai County, it was said that they were once repelled by Indian soldiers, which shows that Indian soldiers had already arrived in Shanghai at that time. However, the Public Concession formally employed Indian police 24 years later. According to the Municipal Council's population survey, in 1880, there were only 4 Indians, but by 1885, the number had increased sharply to 58. This is related to the Indian police issue.

In 1883, the Municipal Council's record of rectifying the constables included a plan to employ 65 Indian police officers, followed by new regulations for recruiting Indian police officers. The existence of Indian police in the concessions began at that time. In 1884, the Municipal Council's accounting report showed that expenditure on constables increased by more than 10,000 taels, which can also be determined to be due to the employment of Indian police officers. That year, the Sino-French War broke out, and the Municipal Council believed that it was necessary to set up police to protect foreigners outside the boundaries. Therefore, in addition to the existing Chinese police officers managing traffic, Indian police officers were added to Jing'an Temple Road and neighboring roads. This can be seen in the Municipal Council's annual report, which is the earliest official record mentioning Indian police officers. If we count until the outbreak of the Pacific War, Indian police officers were in Shanghai for more than 50 years.

Annamese Police

The French Concession Police Department began employing Annamese people as constables in 1900. At that time, the Boxer Rebellion was rampant, and foreigners in the Tianjin area were killed one after another. The people of Shanghai were panicked, especially the foreigners. Therefore, they successively mobilized warships and berthed in the Huangpu River, claiming to protect the concessions.

The French Concession established a Defense Committee to prepare for emergency measures. At the same time, the board of directors of the Public Police Bureau felt that it was inappropriate to employ many Chinese police officers in the concessions under the anti-foreign trend. In order to implement the policy of "controlling the Yellow with the Yellow," it was decided to employ Annamese police officers. At that time, French Consul Bazzet de Maisonneuve asked Vietnamese Governor-General Doumer to send Tokyo residents to Shanghai. In mid-July, 29 Annamese police officers sent by the Vietnamese Governor arrived in Shanghai. This was the beginning of the appearance of Annamese police officers in Shanghai.

By March 1901, the war had ended, and a peace treaty had been signed. These 29 Annamese police officers of wartime nature were also sent back to Annam by the Public Council. In 1906, the board of directors of the French Public Works Bureau decided to recruit Annamese police officers again. This is what we saw in the French Concession before the war. Shanghai officially employed Annamese police officers from that time.

Japanese Police

The nature of the Japanese police was different from that of the employed Indian police and Annamese police. They were established at the request of the Japanese residents in Shanghai, specifically to protect their safety.

In 1914, the Municipal Council already had three Japanese police officers engaged in translation and handling disputes between Chinese and Japanese people. In 1916, Japanese Consul Ariyoshi Akira and Municipal Council Japanese Director Fujimura Yoshirou suggested to the Municipal Council that Japanese police officers be added, and it was adopted and implemented. The Police Department then hired three police officers and 27 constables from Tokyo to Shanghai. In November of that year, the Japanese Police Patrol Team was established and assigned to the North Sichuan Road area to begin service.

The number of Japanese police officers gradually expanded as the number of Japanese residents increased. By 1926, the number of Japanese police officers had increased to 96, and in 1927, it increased to 256. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the power of the Japanese police became even greater. In the Hongkou area, they used their special power to create many tragedies.

### Ample Supply of Domestic Goods: Import of Woolens Should Be Restricted Foreign Goods Are Dumped, and Production Cannot Develop: Actual Sales This Year Are Only 1.5 Million Yards

[Our Report] The Shanghai Woolen Textile Dyeing Industry Association believes that domestic woolens are on the verge of collapse due to the recent frenzied dumping of foreign goods. At the beginning of the promulgation of the Interim Measures for the Revision of Import and Export Trade, it specifically reported the current production and sales situation of the industry and the fact that domestic woolens are sufficient to supply the needs of the whole country. It requested the Executive Committee of the Temporary Import and Export Control Committee to strictly restrict the import of woolen products in order to save the industry and cultivate the foundation of the country. Excerpts from the report are as follows:

Current Production Capacity

(1) A total of 59 member factories of various sizes belong to this association. According to the survey in February of this year, the equipment included: 18,000 spindles for coarse spinning and about 9,700 spindles for fine spinning, and 1,050 looms (excluding those added after February). By October of this year, this association conducted a detailed survey of the production quantity of each member due to the new sales tax. The statistics are as follows:

(A) Production volume during the peak season of August, September, and October:

1. About 500 looms were operating during the daytime (less than half of the total).

2. About 200 looms were operating day and night (less than one-fifth of the total).

Each loom can weave 11 yards per shift regardless of thickness, for a monthly production (26 days) of about 250,000 yards. The total production volume for August, September, and October was 750,000 yards.

(B) From January to July (off-season), due to the lack of restoration and the unavailability of raw materials, less than one-tenth or one-twentieth of the factories were operating. Therefore, the total production volume for the seven months was 200,000 yards.

(C) The actual sales volume of each factory only reached 60% of the production volume (due to the frenzied dumping of foreign goods everywhere and the weak purchasing power).

Figures for Dumping of Foreign Goods

According to the above statistics, the total sales volume of domestic woolens this year is below 500,000 yards, less than 20% of the total production volume. On the other hand, the volume of foreign woolens that arrived in the past 10 months was over 1 million yards (according to customs and woolen industry survey reports). The quantity ordered and about to arrive is also about 1 million yards. Among them, the majority are Melton woolens for coarse spinning and women's woolens. Based on the above facts, the sales of domestic woolens are less than half of those of foreign goods.

Excellent Quality of Domestic Goods

(2) In terms of the quality of woolens and yarns, the members of this association have accumulated more than 20 years of experience and firmly believe that there is further progress in technology every year. If the original materials are the same, the products can be comparable to foreign goods. Test the attached samples of various domestic and imported goods. The quality of domestic products has surpassed that of imported products. All kinds of machinery and equipment are available. Only since the victory, foreign goods have been frantically dumped. And import merchants, ignorant of the situation, each acts on its own. Many consider the import of woolens as a source of huge profits. Blind and frenzied imports have led to oversupply and losses for both parties. (Among them, private goods from a large number of Jewish merchants are the worst.)

Domestic Production Is Already Excessive

(3) In terms of production and actual sales:

(A) Minimum production volume of the spinning industry:

1. Woolens: Based on the 1,050 looms surveyed in January of this year (not counting those added later), each loom can produce 11 yards per shift, so operating day and night can produce far 600,000 yards per month. Shanghai alone can produce at least 7 million yards per year. And the output of the state-owned China Textile factories can offset all private factories. Adding the factories in North China and Southwest China, the total national output is often around 20 million yards.

2. Wool yarn: Each wool yarn factory in this association can produce 300,000 pounds per month. And the two foreign-owned factories, Bee and Jardine Matheson, can also produce 300,000 pounds per month. Shanghai alone can produce about 7 million pounds.

(B) Actual sales volume of woolens and yarns this year:

The actual sales of woolens and yarns are limited to cities and have not been popularized in rural areas. In recent years, people's livelihoods have been declining, purchasing power is weak, and sewing costs are extremely high, making sales even more difficult. According to the above statistics, domestic woolens only sold 500,000 yards this year, and foreign goods sold more than 1 million yards. The total actual sales were only about 1.5 million yards, less than one-tenth of the total production volume, which is already considered oversupply. Therefore, in the past month, when woolens and yarns were in season and selling well, prices fell by 30%. The unsold inventory of each factory has reached 40%. It is fundamentally unnecessary to import foreign woolens and yarns, and it is only destroying the foundation of the domestic industry.

Reasons for the Decline in Production

(4) Furthermore, the reason why domestic goods cannot compete with foreign goods in recent years is entirely because costs cannot be reduced. And the biggest reason why costs cannot be reduced is that production cannot be fully utilized. For example, if a factory has 50 looms, it is currently only running 10 looms during the day, and can only produce 110 yards per day. If all 50 looms were running during the day, they could produce 1,100 yards per day. The production volume is a ratio of 1 to 10. It is a waste of human and financial resources to use the equipment for producing 10 yards to make one yard of woolens, resulting in an opportunity for foreign goods to be dumped, causing domestic factories to sink deeper into the mire and unable to extricate themselves. Thinking of this, I am really worried about the future of the industry. However, learn from the past, and the future can be pursued. Hereafter, I earnestly request that the association weigh the pros and cons and quickly prohibit the import of foreign woolens and yarns listed in the attached table (3) 119, 122. Then our domestic woolens will have lower costs due to higher production volume and lower selling prices, and factories will compete with each other, which will not only make significant progress in technology, but also allow business to develop mutually, thereby laying a solid foundation for the industry. At that time, even if there is competition from imported goods, we can be prepared for any eventuality. Moreover, domestic woolens can not only be sold throughout the country to recover our rights, but also be promoted to Southeast Asia and other places to earn foreign exchange for the country, and the day of glorifying and expanding is just around the corner.

### Stores Closed: All Will Open Today

Yesterday was Sunday. The banking industry and major businesses were closed as usual. Due to the unresolved hawker unrest, several stores were forced to close. For safety reasons, many stores closed their doors voluntarily. The scene on the streets was almost the same as during the New Year. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has issued a notice advising them to resume business. All will open today.

### Coal Prices Are Difficult to Stabilize: Transportation Is Restricted: Sales Are Not Free

The price of coal in this city has risen sharply due to the increased demand as the weather has turned cold. The current price of bituminous coal has risen to the 400,000 mark per ton. Coal balls for cooking for citizens have also risen to 12,000 to 13,000 yuan per load, and there are frequent shortages, which poses a great threat to people's livelihoods. According to the Fuel Management Committee, the biggest difficulty at present is the transportation problem. If the quantity of coal shipped to Shanghai from various coal-producing areas is not restricted by transportation, it will be sufficient to meet the city's needs. Taiwan can also ship out a large quantity. Therefore, the source of coal is not a problem in itself. It is now in contact with allocating special ships to transport coal to the coal-producing areas, so that the reserves in this city will become more and more abundant, and the black market prices can be eliminated. The production and sales of bituminous coal in this city are strictly controlled by the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee, and merchants are not allowed to freely mine and transport coal. Because the committee also restricts the allocation of goods, the market price has skyrocketed.

### Fujian Paper Mill Revives

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 30th] The provincial government has approved the registration of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Economic Construction Company. The company has recently decided to invest in the establishment of the Fuzhou Tap Water Company and the revival of the Fujian Paper Mill. According to the company, the scale of the mill is huge. Before the war, it produced 6 tons of bamboo pulp and 5 tons of paper per day, with a maximum paper production of more than 10 tons. It was bombed and stopped work in 1938, suffering heavy losses.

### List of Edible Oil Joint Allocation Conference: Distribution and Sale in Seven Zones Citywide: If the Market Price Is Lower Than the Negotiated Price, Sell at the Market Price

[Our Report] The Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office held an important meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m. The attendees included Zhang Chao, Chen Zhonghe, Qin Linsheng, Zhang Kejia, and others, 10 people in total. Zhang Chao chaired the meeting. The following important matters were decided: (1) The burden of routine expenses shall, in principle, be subsidized by manufacturers in the industry. If there is a shortfall, please ask various industries to subsidize. (2) The distribution of edible oil will be carried out in seven zones citywide. The seven zones are the Pudong Zone, Zhabei Zone, Hudong Zone, the Old Eight Districts Zone, H unan Zone, Huxi Zone, and the Central Zone. The number of groups in the seven zones will vary depending on the population and will not be uniformly regulated. Each group will have one director, responsible for the supply of edible oil to 30 households. First, conduct a detailed survey of the actual needs of users, and then supply them as much as possible. As for the selling price, the meeting decided that if the market price is lower than the negotiated price, it will be sold at the market price; conversely, if the market price is higher than the negotiated price, it will be sold at the negotiated price. If the quantity of edible oil is insufficient in the future, Mayor Wu has already instructed in the past that the China Edible Oil Company can provide subsidies. Today, the persons in charge of the Joint Allocation Office will visit Mayor Wu to report.

### U.S. Dumping Stored Bristles Affects Sichuan Bristle Exports

The quality of Sichuan bristles surpasses that of other regions in the country, and foreign factories are very willing to use them. In the past, the U.S. government proposed dumping 100,000 pounds of stored bristles, which also affected the Sichuan bristle market, and the price dropped to $2.70 per pound. Recently, due to supply and demand, the pig bristle market has become active again, and the market price has risen to $2.95 per pound. More than 1,600 dan (a unit of weight) were shipped out last month. Transactions this month are larger, estimated at about 2,100 zu (another unit of weight), and more than 1,800 dan have already been shipped. There are still 300 dan to be loaded at the end of the month. Yesterday, export businesses received a telegram from New York stating that the U.S. government will sell its inventory again. If this is true, our pig bristles will undoubtedly be hit. According to Sichuan pig bristle industry insiders, if the U.S. market price drops, they will not be greedy to do business because the current cost in Sichuan has already increased, and there is almost no profit to be made at the price of $2.95. It is said that the China Trust Bureau plans to order 2,000 dan of Sichuan bristles to repay debts. Yesterday, it signed a contract with the Animal Husbandry and Heyuan companies for 1,100 dan. The remaining 900 dan will be handled with Baoti and Chongde companies.

### Small Hardware Business Stagnant

The members of the Small Hardware Parts Industry Association in this city are currently experiencing sluggish business, reaching the most depressed situation. It is understood that the main reason is the high cost of hardware materials, and many members are exploited by usurious loans, and sales are sluggish. Currently, business has plummeted.

### 35,000 Tons of New Medicines Among U.S. Military Surplus, Atabrine Can Supply the Entire Country for Five Years

[Report from this newspaper] At a time when the nation's industry and commerce are precarious, the development of the new drug industry is also considerably affected. Yesterday, this reporter specially visited Mr. Shi Zhifu, the chairman of the New Drug Business Association in this city. He said that although the new drug business has declined compared to six months ago, there is generally no serious phenomenon. Generally speaking, goods imported before June of this year are still profitable. Goods arriving after June have suffered interest losses due to the long-term strike of American sailors. At the same time, there are no statistics on the import of new drugs, and people outside the industry are placing orders, and postal packages of medicines sent directly from abroad also have a considerable impact on the business of the industry, and many are losing money. Mr. Shi also stated that the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan purchased various medicines totaling 35,000 tons from U.S. military surplus materials on 16 islands in the Pacific Ocean, totaling more than 1,900 types. It is said that Atabrine for treating malaria is stored in Qingdao, and the quantity is sufficient to supply the entire China for five years. Some say that the medicines purchased by Lida Trading Company are merely the garbage from outside the islands, to describe the abundance of materials. These medicines will be shipped in batches in a few months, and then various parties will consult with the New Drug Business Association to discuss distribution. A new agency will be established for the allocation of these materials. The price of medicines on the market may be stable. At the same time, in order to take into account the business of the pharmaceutical industry, the new drug industry will absolutely cooperate closely with the pharmaceutical factories, and pharmaceutical raw materials will be supplied to the pharmaceutical factories as much as possible, and all kinds of conveniences will be provided. If domestic transportation is smooth, the medicines produced by domestic pharmaceutical factories and the existing goods in pharmacies can be sold in large quantities to various places, and the future of the pharmaceutical industry is quite optimistic. However, according to Mr. Shi, most of these surplus medicines are for surgical use, and pharmacies generally need only one-tenth or two-tenths of them.

### Cargo Transportation Decreases, Tonnage Oversupply

According to sources in the shipping industry, before the war, our country had more than 500,000 tons of shipping vessels nationwide, plus 400,000 tons from companies such as Taikoo and Jardine Matheson. However, at that time, our country often leased 100,000 tons of shipping vessels to other small foreign companies, so in fact, only about 400,000 tons were used by Chinese businesses. Because foreign shipping vessels joined in operation at that time, 400,000 tons were sufficient for transportation. Currently, there are 600,000 tons of shipping vessels nationwide, of which about 200,000 tons were recently purchased from the United States. However, in the past two months, affected by the economic downturn, cargo transportation has gradually declined, and companies with smaller scope feel it is difficult to maintain. If we observe the current situation, even 500,000 tons of shipping vessels can maintain transportation.

### Four Cooperative Factories, Two Are Unusable, Funding is a Problem

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the organization of silk cooperative factories, after detailed discussions among the National Cooperative Supply and Marketing Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs, the China Silk Corporation, and the Bureau of Social Affairs, the biggest difficulty found was the raising of funds. Of the four factories promised by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, two cannot be used due to internal materials and other reasons, so only two factories can actually be operated. The planned capital for operating two cooperative factories is 800 million yuan, but Zhong and the Ministry of Social Affairs can only contribute 50 million yuan together. The original share capital borne by workers was 100 million yuan, but currently only more than 100 workers can be accommodated, and whether they can subscribe to the planned shares is questionable. Moreover, the general silk industry is currently depressed, and the maintenance and development of cooperative factories in the future will also be a difficult task. However, despite the above difficulties, the three parties will actively prepare, starting with absorbing capital, to make the ideal of cooperative factories a reality.

### Gold Prices Too High, Will Attract Large Quantities of Smuggled Goods

[East China News Agency] Recently, gold prices in this city have soared. Because a few people mistakenly believe that gold prices are relatively low, they have been buying frantically. However, according to financial sources, gold prices in this city are actually extremely high. The U.S. Treasury Department currently holds 576,503,353 ounces of gold, valued at $20,212,617,504. According to U.S. official estimates, each ounce is no more than $35, which is only worth 117,250 yuan in legal tender, which is more than one and a half times the current Shanghai gold market price. Therefore, based on international gold market prices, Shanghai gold prices are generally high, except for a few small countries in the Near East. If gold is shipped from the United States, Canada, or Mexico to Shanghai for sale, huge profits can be obtained. Therefore, international smugglers are rushing to smuggle gold to Shanghai in order to make huge profits.

### Taiwan's Industrial Recovery is Rapid

[Report from this newspaper] Relevant sources told this reporter that the recovery of Taiwan's industry is very rapid. In terms of electricity, the power generation in December last year was 40,000 kilowatts, and in September it was about 120,000 kilowatts, and in November it may reach 160,000 kilowatts. Currently, the main task of the province's industry is not to create but to repair, because during the war, the province's industry suffered 50% losses. As for the speed of repair, it depends on the ability to quickly concentrate materials and manpower. In terms of manpower, a large number of technicians have recently gone to Taiwan to work. In terms of materials, most of the replenishment of industrial equipment is allocated from self-help relief materials and U.S. military surplus materials. Among the equipment received in the past, textile equipment accounted for the largest proportion. Currently, the surplus materials on Da Liuqiu Island are being classified and sorted, and some transportation equipment will be allocated in the future. Also, machine tools were obtained from relief materials in the past, which are indispensable materials for the revival of the province's industry.

### Easing Industrial and Commercial Loans, Methods Still Under Discussion

### High Tax Rates Destroyed Commercial Ethics

— Gan Yunshou

Time flies like an arrow, and in the blink of an eye, we will welcome the New Year of the 36th year, and the industrial and commercial sectors will also follow the routine of replacing a new set of account books. We earnestly hope here that the new account books of this year must express the true and accurate situation, and must not repeat the mistakes of the past, always showing incorrect and unclear records. However, having said that, there are also unavoidable difficulties and reasons for the inaccurate results of past accounts. Standing on an objective position, we are really inconvenient to be too critical. Because the taxes are too heavy (business tax, stamp tax, interest income tax, profit tax, etc.) and the currency continues to inflate, these are ironclad facts. In order to maintain their original foundation, merchants try to secretly hide part of their assets or profit and loss accounts. This is also due to the actual needs and cannot be completely said to be wrong. Just think: if they are faithfully and fully expressed, wouldn't it reduce their original assets and affect their survival? To give an example: the 34th year's profit tax was levied according to the simplified collection regulations of the tax bureau, which was based on the net profit of various industries in the 34th year plus 50%. If the profit tax of the 35th year is levied next year, and the authorities repeat the old trick and add another 50% or 100% for levy, can they still afford it? Since past taxation has been unreasonable, then, of course, we must be vigilant about the future. For the present plan, if we want to ensure the accuracy of the industrial and commercial accounts for the coming year, we can only hope that the tax authorities must earnestly do the following points. First, there must be a clear and concrete expression for the method of levying the 35th year's profit tax, and absolutely no longer levy taxes according to the old method of the 34th year, so as not to cause suspicion and misunderstanding among merchants. Second, the various tax rates in the direct tax must be revised again and effectively reduced. Recently, some wholesale industries are said to have very little gross profit in each transaction after deducting stamp tax and business tax, or even no profit at all, or even losses. In addition, most of the net profit obtained must be dedicated to the government. Like last year's method, it is necessary to declare and pay 50% more based on the net profit. Therefore, when merchants talk about the issue of tax payment, everyone feels a headache and fear. Their minds naturally turn to how to evade taxes. Therefore, if the tax rate is not reduced, the false accounts of various industries will not be easily eliminated. Third, the treatment of tax officials must be reasonably adjusted to avoid improper behavior that helps to undermine tax laws. The ancients said: When clothing and food are sufficient, then one knows honor and disgrace. Recently, newspapers often expose the corrupt behavior of tax officials. This shows that on the one hand, the tax rate is too high, and merchants mostly want to evade taxes; on the other hand, the treatment is too low, and a small number of officials have to collude with merchants to do all kinds of illegal things. Therefore, raising treatment and reducing tax rates are the urgent tasks at hand. If the above points are adopted and implemented by the authorities, I believe that the industrial and commercial accounts of the coming year will definitely be more faithful and accurate. Merchants will never be willing to make false records deliberately, and of course there will be no more than two or three sets of account books. At the same time, the national tax revenue will definitely not be much worse than it is now.

### Ministry of Education Designates Four Universities to Establish Scholarships for Nanyang Students, Applications to Begin in the 36th Year

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Nanyang is closely connected with our country, and there are many overseas Chinese. In recent years, due to the absurd propaganda and instigation of the Japanese invaders, there have been conflicts between the indigenous people and the overseas Chinese from time to time. Now that Nanyang has been restored, foreign relations need to be adjusted urgently, and cultural exchange is an urgent routine. In view of this, the Ministry of Education plans to establish "Nanyang Student Scholarships" in Central, Sun Yat-sen, Peking, and Tsinghua Universities, two students per school. Students of all ethnic groups from Annam, Siam, Burma, Malaya, Borneo, Dutch East Indies, etc., who have graduated from secondary schools, are under 25 years of age, and have an interest in studying Chinese culture, may be guaranteed by the local government to apply for the scholarship. The amount is temporarily set at 100,000 yuan per person per month, and will be adjusted at any time according to the standard of living in the future. The application procedure is held once every two years by our country's consulates in various places in Nanyang. It is said that applications for the scholarship will begin in the 36th year.

### Mr. Li Ximou Discusses the Five-Year Education Plan: Establishing National Schools Throughout the City

The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, in order to eliminate illiteracy and in line with national policy, has now formulated a five-year plan to revitalize education in the city. Yesterday, a reporter visited Mr. Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, who gave the following account:

Establishing an Educational Foundation: Establishing National Schools Everywhere

According to Mr. Li, the first task of this five-year plan is to establish national education, so as to lay the foundation for primary education. The current plan is to establish national schools throughout the city, with one central national school in each district and one "bao" (neighborhood) school in each "bao." The school buildings of central national schools in urban areas must have 20 to 30 classrooms, and in rural areas 10 to 20 classrooms. The school buildings of "bao" national schools in urban areas must have 6 to 20 classrooms, and in rural areas 10 classrooms. The exact numbers must be determined based on the population density in each area. As for the construction style, lighting, sports grounds, and sanitary facilities of the school buildings, engineering experts and education and sports experts must be consulted to make decisions.

Cultivating Technical Personnel: Emphasizing Normal Education

Once the foundation of national education has been laid, the next step is to promote secondary education. Four secondary education zones will be built in the four suburbs of the city. Public land will be allocated in each zone, or private land will be requisitioned, and all public and private middle schools in the urban area will be concentrated there. In rural areas where transportation is inconvenient, junior middle schools must be established everywhere to ensure balanced development. In addition, emphasis will be placed on promoting normal education, cultivating technical personnel, and establishing joint vocational schools for animal husbandry, sericulture, machinery, architecture, maritime affairs, pharmacy, and other fields.

Instilling Basic Knowledge: Focusing on Social Education

Once the above foundation has been laid, the focus will be on the development of social education, in order to instill basic knowledge and enable the people to have some understanding. This will include the following fifteen projects: (1) National Library, (2) Public Education Center, (3) Public Education Experimental Zone, (4) Museum, (5) Science Museum, (6) Gymnasium, Sports Hall, (7) Music Hall, (8) Academic Hall, (9) Educational Cinema, (10) Educational Theater, (11) Educational Radio Station, (12) Zoo, (13) Botanical Garden, (14) People's School, (15) Supplementary School.

It is expected to be completed on schedule within the next five years.

### This Evening's Morning Friends Cup Basketball Game: Hua Lian Meets Chen Bai

The Morning Friends Cup basketball game will be held today starting at 6:00 PM, with three games in the A and B groups, still at the Eight Immortals Overseas Chinese Youth Association Gymnasium. However, due to the conflict between the police station and the vendors near the Youth Association in the past two days, the order has been quite chaotic. As of press time, the authorities have not yet announced whether it can be held tonight. Among the three games, the final game is expected to be the most exciting. However, the Hua Lian team members are scattered. Filipino players Cai Wenhua and Zhang Zhengyi have already accompanied the Qingbai team to Hong Kong this morning. There are rumors that Da Li is tired of playing, and A Di is working for Ren Yu. According to general speculation, it is possible that they will forfeit. However, A Kong and others are doing their best to mediate, and they are still a strong enemy for Yong Youbai.

Chen Youbai is the incarnation of Ren Yu, and their condition has been quite good recently. In the Morning Friends Cup, they have the ambition to win the championship. Players such as Yao Wenyi and Shen Juju are clear-headed. They are rare and promising talents. However, the main player, Wang Huaiding, went to Ning Tong a few days ago. It is certain that he will not return today. If Hua Lian forfeits, then the Chen Youbai has already secured the Group A championship. Today's order is as follows:

You Yi - Yu Guang (Yi Chen) 6:00 PM

Lian Qing - Chen Youlan (Yi You) 6:30 PM

Hua Lian - Chen Youbai (Group A) 7:30 PM

### The Problem of Implementing Electrified Education

— Du Weitao

1.  Introducing the Problem

Electrified education has been implemented in our country for ten years. In the beginning, the promotion was very smooth. The Ministry of Education advocated and led from above, and the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, as well as other educational institutions, worked hard to promote it from below. For applied equipment, some could be manufactured domestically, and importing from abroad was not difficult, and the price was not very expensive, so it was very popular. If it had not encountered the misfortune of the eight-year war of resistance, it should have been popularized in schools at all levels, social education institutions, and the general public throughout the country long ago. After the start of the war of resistance, the original institutions promoting electrified education gradually withdrew and merged, the loss and damage of equipment was great, and it was impossible to replenish it in large quantities. Prices were high, and sources were lacking, making it more difficult year by year. Although every method was tried, it was impossible to maintain it. However, from an objective point of view, it was needed more and more each year. During the eight years, electrified education was also able to shoulder the mission of the war of resistance, and its value was greatly increased. Everywhere there was such a warm welcome and urgent expectation, making our few staff members feel unable to cope. It was clear that electrified education was so needed and so effective that we really couldn't bear to give up our only old equipment, and we had to endure extreme hardship and do our best. In this way, there was no problem with the implementation of electrified education in the objective aspect. Schools and the public were increasing their demands day by day. The excessive difficulty lay only in the lack of equipment, shortage of funds, and shortage of personnel. However, today, the situation has changed somewhat. In addition to material difficulties, there are also psychological difficulties. Material difficulties are easy to solve, but psychological difficulties are not easy to overcome. After the victory of the war of resistance, the source of equipment will not be a problem. The problem is whether there are funds to buy it. The amount of funds depends on whether the supervisors at all levels are willing to allocate them. As for whether a large number of talents can be cultivated after the war, it also depends on the decision of the supervisors at all levels. In the end, the fundamental problem now is that the educational administrative organs at all levels do not attach importance to this education! They do not have a deep understanding of the objective needs, and they do not fully understand the great functions of electrified education, so they put it at the very end of all educational undertakings. It can be said that the reason why electrified education cannot be developed is not because there is no way to solve the problems of equipment, funds, and talents, but because it is placed in the last position and has no opportunity to raise its head. I say this, and most people engaged in electrified education and social education work will agree. Therefore, the first problem in implementing electrified education is to break through the psychological difficulties. As long as the educational administrative organs at all levels are determined to promote electrified education and can attach importance to electrified education, then the difficulties of equipment, funds, and talents can be easily solved.

2.  The Process of Implementation

Electrified education was promoted and advocated by people who were enthusiastic about science education and social education more than ten years ago. It was first experimented and promoted in several science education and social education groups, and developed from the Beijing-Shanghai area to the south and north. The earliest implementation was carried out in the Zhenjiang and Xuzhou Public Education Centers in Jiangsu Province, and it was very successful. Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi also gradually developed. In schools, Jinling University, Daxia University, and Jiangsu Provincial Education College promoted it earlier and achieved good results. At that time, magic lanterns, movies, and broadcasting were used as teaching tools, and many places could independently produce educational films. Zhenjiang Public Education Center first used cars to implement electrified education, which is still envied today. Jinling University first established an educational film department and created an electrified education specialty to train electrified education talents. Jiangsu Provincial Education College also established an electrified education specialty in 1936. The Ministry of Education, in view of the importance of the electrified education cause, began to lead, supervise, and promote it in 1935. It purchased a large number of various film and broadcasting equipment and distributed it to educational institutions in various provinces for application. Two committees, a film education committee and a broadcasting education committee, were established within the ministry, and electrified education personnel training courses were opened, with a total of three sessions, and 322 graduates were trained. After the start of the War of Resistance, the two committees merged into the Electrified Education Committee, and a third section was established in the Department of Social Education to handle electrified education. In 1942, the China Educational Film Studio was established to produce 16mm educational films, and an electrified education specialty was established in the National Social Education College to train talents. Each province established an Electrified Education Service Office (reorganized into a counseling office after the war) in the Department of Education, and also established an Electrified Education Traveling Work Team, with as many as seven or eight teams and as few as two or three teams. Most schools and social education institutions were equipped with radios, and a small number of provinces planned to establish educational broadcasting stations. The promotion of electrified education was all the rage in the short two or three years before the war. After the start of the War of Resistance, although the electrified education institutions and equipment in various provinces were gradually damaged and reduced, the Ministry of Education still tried to subsidize and maintain them. In the absence of any other way, they tried to find a way and organized ministry-affiliated electrified education teams to directly promote teaching work. The National Social Education College's electrified education specialty was once changed to an independent electrified education technical school, but it returned to its original state due to the difficulty of equipment, funds, and talents. The China Film Studio worked hard for several years and completed 50 films, which can be regarded as having exhausted its ability. In the last year or two of the War of Resistance, the promotion of electrified education reached the most difficult and tightest period. The Electrified Education Committee of the Ministry of Education was abolished, and only the third section of the Department of Social Education handled electrified education work. However, they reorganized laws, intensified research and experimentation work, tried to find and purchase equipment at home and abroad, strengthened international cooperation, prepared a development plan for the aftermath, and united with the British and American News Agencies to work hard on lantern slide and film propaganda for the War of Resistance. Not only did they not neglect their work in these most difficult two years, but they also laid the foundation for post-war development. In this way, the people in the electrified education positions have done their best in the implementation of electrified education. Now that the opportunity has improved, they can make great achievements. However, they need enthusiastic people in electrified education and in the work positions to carry out extensive propaganda and vigorous promotion.

3.  Future Efforts

The matters we are working on now are to continue to lay the foundation for electrified education, improve the status of electrified education, and expand the financial resources of electrified education, so that the preparation of equipment, the increase of institutions and personnel, and the training of talents can all advance simultaneously. However, we can still discover by reviewing past gains and losses. In the past, one of the biggest mistakes was to treat electrified education as administrative work too much. Everything was relying on the government to support it, there was no foundation at the lower level, the people did not participate in this cause, and businessmen did not care about it at all. This is exactly the opposite of the most developed electrified education in Britain and the United States. China is a poor country. Every undertaking relies on the government's power. If the people and groups do not work hard on their own, how can they not have such a result? Although electrified education costs money, it does not necessarily lose money. It can make money in the future. If the people do it themselves and businessmen actively invest, there is no need to worry about the market. For example, publishing, news media, and broadcasting are all educational and cultural undertakings. Even if the government wants to supervise and manage them, they are all social undertakings and also a kind of enterprise. The manufacture of film, broadcasting, and magic lantern equipment is an industry. Applying it to teach is a social undertaking. The people should strive to create and run it themselves, and then the government will supervise and assist it. If this is done, it would have developed long ago. Just look at the educational films in Britain and the United States, which are all produced by various film companies. The film and broadcasting equipment used in schools and educational institutions are self-provided, not issued by the higher-level educational administrative organs. The government has not put much effort into promoting and developing these undertakings. Although the situation in our country is different from that in Britain and the United States, we cannot but have the government lead the way first. However, the cause of electrified education cannot rely solely on the government's power to promote it as a political decree. This principle is always correct! Speaking of this, let's turn back and hope that the government will still pay more attention to promoting this educational undertaking when the people and local areas do not have the power to run it themselves, especially at present, it is necessary to determine the direction and formulate policies first to make a kind of promotion, and then expect the people and local areas to do it automatically. At the same time, I also hope that educational people in general will work harder from the lower level and use their own strength to do their own business. Not only should the electrified education undertaking be like this, but all undertakings for building the country should be like this. (Written on November 30, 1946, at the Ministry of Education)

### Inspecting Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provinces

— November 24th Air Mail Report from Our Kaifeng Reporter Wang Shoumei

Leaving Shacheng Lightly Equipped

On the morning of November 16th, as the gentle morning sun of Sui shone across the land, the jeep of the reporter from Lai quickly arrived at my door. Councilor Yin from the 68th Army jumped out of the vehicle and urged me to leave. I put on my coat, grabbed my camera, and, without any luggage, lightly got into the car, sitting down next to the driver. Without any delay, the car sped off.

Ten minutes later, the car had left the ancient city of Shacheng and headed east along the flat highway towards Caozhou. The driver, Wang Mashi, the captain of the 68th Army's motor transport team, skillfully handled the car, keeping it steady and smooth on the flat road, making it feel almost like flying in the air if you closed your eyes.

The clear blue sky was like a pool of autumn water, still and without a ripple. There was no wind, no dust, and the entire earth was immersed in the charming morning sun. Everything on the earth seemed to be dreaming a light dream, so peaceful and mysterious that no one would believe it was a northern early winter morning!

Wild dogs chased after the car, but were left behind. Small birds raced with the car in the sky, but were also left behind. An endless stream of large trucks saw the jeep coming from behind and immediately yielded the way. Our jeep sped eastward like a meteor. In seventy minutes, we completed the hundred-li journey from Kaifeng to Guanfeng. After stopping in Guanfeng for forty minutes for breakfast, we got back into the car and headed northeast. Forty-five minutes later, we arrived at Kaocheng. Without stopping, we bypassed the city. Because the road was congested with vehicles transporting supplies to the front lines, our jeep had to proceed intermittently. About forty minutes after leaving Kaocheng, Brother Yin Jinghu told me that we had entered the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border area, which was formerly the Communist "Liberated Area." Upon hearing the word "liberated," I felt a sense of threat and restraint in my mind, and my eyes involuntarily looked around. However, the road here was wide and flat, and the farmers in the fields were still working peacefully. But I only saw smoke from cooking fires and no village trees. The birds in the sky seemed particularly few. I was wondering when the driver, Captain Wang, pointed out to me: "Not long ago, our Third Army encountered the Communist forces here. Although the smell of blood is gone, the unburied bodies are often dragged onto the road by wild dogs. The first time I drove through here, there were dead people everywhere, and you couldn't see a single person in the villages." I felt a chill run down my spine. I knew I had stepped into the "present battlefield." I had no mourning thoughts, only a sense of terror. I was afraid to see the corpses of those who had died unjustly, and I was afraid to smell the piercing stench of blood. I closed my eyes, covered my nose, and hoped that the car would quickly drive me through this terrible area.

Strict Guard at Diaozhuang

Around two o'clock, the car arrived at Diaozhuang, fifty li from Caozhou. It was a small village, but it had defensive fortifications like a net from the sky. On the newly built stockade walls, there was a pillbox every three steps and a fort every five steps. Logs and rolling stones were scattered on the top of the walls. Outside the stockade walls was a deep ditch filled with river water. Outside the ditch was a barrier made of thorns, tightly surrounding the ditch. Outside this barrier, there were two more layers of walls made of short wooden stakes. The three layers of walls surrounded the deep ditch, and the deep water encircled the solid stockade walls. Our car passed through the innermost barrier. The sentries on the stockade walls, with their round eyes peeking out from under their helmets, stared at the travelers on the road. The moment the sentry's eyes fell on me, my nerves involuntarily twitched. I asked Councilor Yin why the guard was so tight here. He said it was an important stronghold. In the villages not far from here, there were still sporadic Communist forces lurking, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, so they had to take special precautions. The six or seven armed soldiers in the car all pushed bullets into their rifles and fixed their bayonets. They watched the pedestrians on the road until the car drove far away, then they looked for new targets. At that moment, I felt like I was on the battlefield.

At three o'clock, the car finally arrived safely in Caozhou.

A Hasty Look at Caozhou

"Caozhou" is a historical geographical name. It is no longer Caozhou Prefecture but Heze County. In the Spring and Autumn period, it was the State of Cao. During the Qing Dynasty, it was the seat of Caozhou Prefecture. In the Republic of China, it was renamed Heze County because of the abundant water of Heze. In the past, due to its important geographical location and abundant resources, it became a leader in politics, economy, and culture in western Shandong. It was an important town in western Shandong with a glorious history and a brilliant position. It nurtured prominent figures in Chinese history. Most of the heroes in the Water Margin were from here. We should not forget General Zhao Dengyu, who was the first to sacrifice his life for the country in the epic of the Anti-Japanese War. His home was in Heze County.

This is indeed a good place, but now it has become like a pear blossom after the rain, a beauty that has been devastated. Many of the ancient and magnificent buildings have lost their doors and windows. The prosperity of the past has been reduced to desolation. Although there are a few shops on the streets, they are often closed. Even if they are open, they are just empty shells. However, the small vendors selling glass combs in the streets are soliciting customers. However, even in this famine-stricken land where it is difficult to survive, they cannot help but fold their arms and sit on the sidelines. There are no restaurants offering packaged banquets, only small restaurants selling steamed buns and noodles. Pedestrians are scarce, and the nights are even more desolate. If it weren't for the trucks from the rear supply agencies coming and going, you would think this was a dead city. This historical ancient city usually has a population of more than 40,000. After being occupied by the Communist forces on September 24th last year, two-thirds of the population fled. When the Communist forces retreated on August 24th this year, another third was forced to leave. When the National Army recovered this ancient city, there were almost no people left in the city. According to an old man who believed in Catholicism, "When the Communist forces retreated, they forced the people to fill in the wells and forced them to flee. No one wanted to fill in the wells, and everyone was watching and didn't want to leave. They threatened, saying, 'If you don't leave, the National Army will kill you all.' The people were uneducated, so they all fled. When the National Army entered the city, no one knew how many old men and women there were in the whole city. But soon, those who had fled gradually returned. Now there are more than 30,000 people in the city. This must be attributed to General Liu Ruzhen. After General Liu Ruzhen stationed in Caozhou, he comforted the refugees, provided relief, bought seeds for the farmers, repaired houses for the residents, and maintained strict military discipline, which was widely praised. As a result, those who had fled to other places returned with their families."

The walls of the streets and alleys are covered with slogans written in red characters on a white background. But under the new slogans are the old slogans, and under the old slogans is an even more blurred layer of slogans. The new slogans were written by the National Army, the old slogans were written by the Communist forces, and the most blurred slogans at the bottom were written by the enemy and puppets. The three layers of slogans represent three periods, which shows what kind of life the people of Caozhou have been living in recent years.

Before the war, this was the most educationally and culturally developed place in Shandong Province. The provincial normal school and provincial high school were the best in Shandong. Even the elementary schools were very well run, because this used to be an experimental county in Shandong, so there were almost no out-of-school children here. But now, this city of culture doesn't even have a school. The school buildings have collapsed, the weeds are overgrown, and there are school-age children everywhere. Moreover, there is no preparation or hope for reopening in the near future. This is so heartbreaking and terrible!

The city walls here were demolished by the National Army at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War. During the enemy and puppet period, the people were forced to rebuild them. Last year, after the enemy surrendered and the Communist forces occupied the city, they forced the people to tear them down again. This time, after the National Army recovered the city, the people, under the leadership of the National Army, rebuilt the ten-li-long city walls in two months, and they were rebuilt exceptionally strong and magnificent. Cars can almost drive on the city walls. Outside the city walls is a deep ditch. The difficulty of the project and the greatness of human power cannot be considered a miracle. When General Liu Ruzhen accompanied the reporter on a tour around the city, he said with great emotion: "To mobilize such a large civilian force and do such a large project to defend against internal unrest is a great injustice and waste. If the Communist forces laid down their butcher knives and we returned to our fields, and the people used this great power entirely in production, how much would we harvest?" I nodded and sighed. An old man who was repairing the city walls said while working, "General, it doesn't matter. We ordinary people don't have anything else, just a little bit of stupid strength. As long as the National Army can protect this city forever after we rebuild it once, and not let us tear it down and rebuild it again, we will be endlessly grateful." The reporter looked at General Liu Ruzhen, who smiled at the old man.

### County Magistrate Discusses the Red Terror

Heze is now the location of the Commissioner's Office of the Sixteenth District of Shandong. The county government and the Commissioner's Office operate independently. To understand the military, political, and economic measures taken during the period when the Communist army occupied this area, the reporter interviewed Commissioner Zhu and County Magistrate Zhang separately. County Magistrate Zhang is a local and has served as a district chief in the past. He is now the county magistrate and concurrently the secretary-general of the Party branch, so he is very familiar with the local situation. According to him, soon after the Communist army occupied Heze, the "Jilu豫 Border Region Government" established an administrative office in Daoli. Heze was changed to a municipality, and the area within the county seat and Dikou was placed under the jurisdiction of Heze Municipality. The former Heze County was divided into four counties: Heze, Nanhua, Linze, and Qibin. The so-called "Jilu豫 Border Region" was under the jurisdiction of the "Jinji魯豫 Border Region Government" (located in Handan). In addition to this, it also included the Taihang, Taiyue, and Jinan Border Regions. It included the area south of the Dushi Railway, east of the Pinghan Railway, north of the Longhai Railway, and west of the Jinpu Railway. In terms of the administrative organization of the administrative office, there were four departments: civil affairs, finance, construction, and education, and three bureaus: industry and commerce, transportation, and public security. With the strengthening of the Communist army's ruling power, farmers' associations, women's associations, and children's corps were also established. In the countryside, the Communist army first sent "Anti-Japanese Associations." These were their organizational personnel. They single-handedly created farmers' associations and then organized "gun squads." This was the most important step, ostensibly to use local forces to protect the area, but in reality, it was the grassroots work of expanding the Communist army. After a period of "processing" by them, the peasants were forced to join the Communist army. More than 90% of those who died in battle in various places were these Communist soldiers who had joined the army after being "processed." The last time the Communist army attacked eastern Henan, there were casualties everywhere, and they were all kind people from here. Therefore, the elderly, weak, women, and children here will never forget the hatred of the Communist army, and the tricks of the Communist army will never fool them again. The Communist Party also established many cooperatives here, and their staff members also engaged in business for profit. However, their cigarette factories monopolized the market, and their factories enjoyed exclusive rights. Businessmen suffered unspeakable hardships but were still not allowed to close their doors. If you closed down, they would take all the merchant's houses, goods, and furniture for their own use "for the sake of production." Under such industrial and commercial policies, a phenomenon of commercial depression and economic collapse was created. This situation cannot be recovered in three to five years.

The reporter then asked County Magistrate Zhang what the county government had done after the county seat was recovered. He said, "After the Communist army left, the county government mainly focused on pacifying the refugees. Immediately afterward came the disputes left behind by the Communist army regarding land, property, marriage, and grievances. These cases have kept the county government very busy. The county government is still busy with these matters. For example, land was 'struggled' and divided at that time. The ownership still belonged to the landlords, but some landlords sold their land to others to pay the 'struggle' fines, which is troublesome. There are many cases of retaliation, but we always try to reconcile them unless the cases are particularly serious. Because those criminals who were exploited are all local bullies, hooligans, and ignorant wretches. We don't want them to form new grudges and repeat the tragedy."

Shedding Tears While Talking About "Struggle"

In the "Liberated Areas," the slogan of "struggle" was prevalent everywhere. Only through "struggle" could the poor "share the money," and only through "struggle" could the slaves "turn over." This was the Communist Party's consistent propaganda program. How exactly was "struggle" carried out? The reporter can answer the readers with a statement from Mr. Zhao, the owner of a bathhouse here. He is a kind and honest old man of sixty. He did not escape during the Communist army's occupation and, like many who did not escape, was "struggled" twice. He said, "After the Communist army entered the city, I didn't escape for the sake of my family and my business. I was arrested, my home was robbed clean, my children were also arrested, and my business was suspended. I wanted to die, but I couldn't. Those local bullies, hooligans, rascals, and shrewish women all became important people. The Communist army gathered these people together to 'struggle' against the honest people. Although I feel sorry for them now, they were simple-minded at the time and, with the support of the 'Anti-Japanese Association' and 'cadre class,' did commit a lot of evil. They did plant unforgettable hatred in the hearts of ordinary people." "How exactly was the 'struggle' carried out?" I asked him. He continued, "The Communist army's 'struggle' meeting was prepared and mobilized for a long time. To 'struggle' against someone, the 'Anti-Japanese Association' would first instruct the 'cadre class' and then instruct the 'farmers' association' to mobilize 'members' to fabricate the crimes of the person being 'struggled.' Under threat and inducement, they turned this into a double act. I was 'struggled' on February 11th this year. That day, they gathered hundreds of people, even the tea boys in my bathhouse were brought there. First, they pushed me onto the stage, and then a staff member of the 'cadre class' asked loudly to the people below the stage why they wanted to 'struggle' against me. Some people below the stage said that I had beaten and scolded them before, and some said that I had borrowed money from them before and didn't lend it to them. He then asked the tea boys in my bathhouse how I had abused them. Those children didn't say anything, so he slapped them twice. Then he kicked me down on the stage and asked me to 'confess, confess.' I hadn't done anything wrong, so of course, I didn't say anything. But at this time, those children's corps, under coercion, urinated on my face. The staff member of the 'cadre class' even shouted at me to open my mouth, so I had to do it. One finished urinating, then another urinated. I don't know how much I drank. Later, I heard that if I didn't confess, they would sentence me to death in public, so I had to shout loudly. I said I was a 'bastard,' I said I 'exploited the poor,' I said I 'abused apprentices.' At this time, the crowd below the stage shouted in unison under a kind of manipulation: 'Beat him to death!' 'Sanction him!' I lowered my head, waiting for their disposal. Carelessly, with a 'thud,' a raw egg was thrown on my face. The egg white and yolk ran all over my face, but I wasn't allowed to wipe it off. There was a burst of laughter below the stage. After a while, a paper hat was put on my head. They tied me up and paraded me through the streets, parading through the main streets and alleys of the city. I was hoarse from shouting that I was a 'bastard.' That night, they wanted to fine me. The amount they wanted was two million. Because I didn't have money, they took over my bathhouse, but I couldn't sell it. In the end, I chose to sell it to them, but I didn't see any cash. They said it had been allocated." At this point, he burst into tears and couldn't bear to recount it further. After a long time, I asked him again, "Under such 'struggle,' how did the old people in the city and countryside feel about the Communist army?" He said, "Regardless of whether they were poor or rich, everyone was terrified. At that time, some songs said:

—One or two acres stand in front of the door, three or four acres are criminals, five acres or more are big bastards, those without houses and land are immortals—

—The rooster has a long tail, the chairman of the farmers' association is Yama, if you say no, you will suffer—

—A tree, bare and bright, riding a big horse back to his hometown, the house is collapsed, the grain is finished, parents shed tears when they see him—

—A white tree, blooms white flowers, the Eighth Route Army comes and ransacks the house—

—The Eighth Route Army makes a lot of noise, they are afraid to charge when they see the devils, they are afraid to move during the day, they come out and show off at night, grab the ladies for military rations, grab the sisters-in-law for clothes—

—The Eighth Route Army loves money, they try their best to get it when they see the rich, the rich say no, and immediately get the 'stubborn' hat—

After listening to these songs, you will know the situation of the people at that time."

### General Zhao's Old Mother Picks Cotton in the Courtyard, Her Old Age is Desolate

General Zhao Dengyu used his fresh blood to write the first page of the history of the War of Resistance. His loyal soul is forever buried underground, his heroic name will forever remain in the world, what about his family after his death? Now that the reporter has come to the general's hometown, he cannot but visit the general's family. The general's house is in the northwest corner of the city, a semi-old courtyard, the gate and threshold are lost, the whole courtyard is desolate, the hall is desolate, the three main rooms have collapsed in the middle, the east and west wing rooms are also like cold ancient temples, gloomy and eerie, making people feel a bit creepy when they are in it. The general has an old mother, who is already eighty years old, deaf but not blind, very old and frail, in a very pitiful state. When the reporter went, the general's mother was picking cotton in the courtyard. The reporter asked about the family's living conditions, and she told the reporter, "There is no way, it's terrible, the cattle are gone, the grain is gone, everything is over when the child dies, if it weren't for the Commander-in-Chief (referring to General Liu Ruming) sending wheat seeds and money, our family wouldn't be able to survive"! As she spoke, she only trembled. The reporter was filled with emotion and quickly took a photo of the old lady and went to the front yard. It is said that the general has a wife, a younger brother, and children, but the children have always said that the times are not good and the family is poor, so they have no opportunity to be educated. The general died for the country, and his family is like this after his death, which is truly heartbreaking and infuriating!

Peonies are the Best in the World

Caozhou peonies are the best in the world. This is the kingdom of peonies. Those who have read Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio and old Chinese novels should know that this place was famous for peonies many years ago. The number of peony varieties here is the highest in the country, and the planting area is also astonishing. The sales area extends as far as Guangdong and Southeast Asia, and as close as Pingjin, Beijing, and Shanghai. As long as there are peonies, it goes without saying that they are from Caozhou. Everyone says that Luoyang peonies are good, but who knows that Caozhou is the mother's home? The people of Caozhou are often proud of this.

Peony Township is located in Zhaolou, about seven miles northeast of Caozhou City. The reporter once took a jeep to go there to explore the flowers. Peony Township is about ten hectares in size, with pine and cypress forests standing tall and the environment is beautiful. It is a pity that there is no spring in the world, and the flowers do not bloom. All that can be seen is a field of fragrant tombs (peonies are naturally weak and cannot withstand the severe cold, so they are buried in winter). The reporter only sighed and lamented in the flower township for a while before reluctantly returning to the city.

I was entertained by General Liu Ruzhen in Caozhou for three days. On the morning of the 20th, I drove back, hurriedly, just like I came hurriedly. When I left Caozhou, I turned my head back and looked longingly at this ancient city that I had just met and parted with, until the clouds and smoke covered her face, and then I looked at my own way home.

Ghosts are feared, but the car broke down in Pengzhuang, a dangerous area. After repairing it for three hours in anxiety and fear, it was finally repaired. We drove at full speed and arrived in Kaocheng at 4 pm. Hungry and exhausted, we went to the headquarters of the 55th Army in Kaocheng and were entertained with fried fish by the district commander. We dared not stay long and continued on our way. It was already 4:30 when we started driving. It was 170 li to Kaifeng. The driver was anxious, and the reporter was even more anxious. There were very few people and cars on the road. A round red sun about to set was smiling nostalgically at the earth. The car chased it like a gust of wind. It sank little by little, and the car jumped forward. But in the end, it didn't catch up. It sank down, and a faint twilight scene appeared on the earth. Where is Shacheng? I tasted the two lines of poetry: "The cool breeze doesn't care about the thinness of the traveler's clothes, and the setting sun knows the difficulty of the road!"

When the car entered Lanfeng, it was already lit up with thousands of lights. There was no way but to visit General Liu Ruming, Commander of the Fourth Pacification Zone. The business card was handed in, and General Liu personally greeted me with a smile and said, "I received a call from the 55th Army and knew that you would definitely stay here tonight. I have been waiting for you for a long time!" At this time, I couldn't help but smile too. After eating dinner, I talked with General Liu for two hours. He recounted his experiences of joining the army in his youth, leading troops in his prime, guarding the dangerous Nankou alone, and relieving the siege of Xi'an on horseback, as if he was reciting family treasures. He made me feel completely relieved of my exhaustion. I was very interested in this elegant general. Finally, he urged me to go to bed, and I went to sleep.

Gunfire in the Middle of the Night

In my sleep, I was suddenly awakened by dense machine gun fire. I was confused and didn't know what to do. Deputy Director Yang knew that I had been awakened and was afraid that I was timid, so he kept telling me, "It's okay, it's okay, don't panic." But he himself held the telephone receiver in his hand and asked everywhere, but no one knew what was going on. The gunfire was intermittent, and the news came in fragments. Finally, I learned that in the area of Zhangliangfen, five or six li west of the city, the National Army found the Communist army destroying the railway and opened machine guns to drive the Communist army away. A false alarm, fortunately, there was no harm done. I fell asleep again.

The next morning, General Liu prepared Western food for me. While having breakfast, he told me that tens of thousands of Communist troops had gathered in the Dongming and Changyuan areas and were brewing a new war. They would definitely try to make a desperate gamble against our defense zone again. Now, we have new deployments. If they really want to run into a wall, then we can only eliminate them with pain. I followed his finger and looked at the map, but I was thinking in my heart: The violent storm is about to come again, what is the crime of the people?

When I got in the car to Kaifeng, it was already twelve o'clock.

### Overseas Chinese in Siam

—Bangkok Air News on the 14th, by Huang Shusun, Traveling Reporter for This Newspaper

Siamese Schools Add Chinese Classes

There are more than 10,000 overseas Chinese abroad, and Siam accounts for one-third. Whether it is in large cities or small towns, whether it is in poor villages or remote areas, they are everywhere, living there and passing on from generation to generation. Overseas Chinese control 95% of industry and commerce. If you are there for the first time, you really can't believe that this is foreign land.

In the year or so since the end of the war, in various parts of Southeast Asia, either the turmoil has not ended or the anti-Chinese sentiment has become increasingly strong. Only Siam is more stable. With the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Siam, the status of overseas Chinese has been significantly improved. They now have complete freedom to hold meetings, form associations, and publish. The Siamese also look at the overseas Chinese with new eyes. Former Prime Minister Nai Biri, who was known for his anti-Chinese sentiment, visited China and paid homage to the President. Many descendants of overseas Chinese have recognized their ancestry. The Siamese Minister of Education encourages Siamese schools to add Chinese classes. In various cities in the mainland, and even many Siamese officials, send their children to Chinese schools to study and use Chinese names. They often enthusiastically participate in public welfare undertakings held in the overseas Chinese community or donate money to help. The various harsh regulations promulgated during the period when Phibun was in power, although they have not yet been completely abolished by formal order, have long been stopped in practice.

Due to the restrictions of the Anglo-Siamese Agreement, Siam's main products, such as rice and timber, are either forcibly purchased or prohibited from export, resulting in economic stagnation and commercial depression. This not only affects Siam's entire national fortune but is also a major blow to our Chinese overseas Chinese.

Extortion and Blackmail According to Law

Overseas Chinese have always been seen as gods of wealth, and many people think they are weak and can be bullied. During the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia, due to the abundance of Siam's products, and at the same time, Siam still maintained a trace of free trade, there were many who made fortunes. This opened the door for officials from the motherland. First, there was Lan, then Xing and Li. They all used the name of "punishing traitors" to threaten and extort those who made fortunes during the war. Nine out of ten of those who made fortunes during the war had engaged in collaborating with the enemy, aiding the enemy, and serving the enemy. In their fear and trepidation, they wanted to use money to cover up their bad deeds. The officials got what they wanted, and each took nearly 10 million baht in Siamese currency and a large number of gold bars to enjoy themselves. At present, this wind of extortion and blackmail has not subsided. For example, the release of more than 100 overseas Chinese required 1 million baht in Siamese currency, and the negotiator got 300,000 baht. There are countless people who use false names to make money in Siam. This is a joke overseas. The central authorities of our country recently made a resolution to organize an overseas roving supervisory team. Overseas Chinese all hope that it will be implemented as soon as possible.

Three Mores Plus Three Mores

"Many monks, many temples, many women." These are Siam's original "three mores." After the war, the overseas Chinese community in Siam added "three mores": "many overseas Chinese leaders, many parties, many newspapers." These "three mores" are all mutually causal and related. In the early days of Japan's surrender, those who had engaged in collaborating with the enemy, aiding the enemy, and serving the enemy knew that their sins were serious, so they either hid or claimed to be dead to avoid attention. Later, with the power of money, they were able to show their faces again and swaggered in the overseas Chinese community, pretending to be "overseas Chinese leaders." Those so-called "overseas Chinese leaders" mostly had different opinions, set up their own houses, and ambitious and shameless people attached themselves to them, often claiming to belong to a certain "party" or becoming a certain "faction." They often slandered each other, and even fought each other or carried out assassinations. The so-called "overseas Chinese leaders" and certain "parties" and "factions," under the attack and condemnation of overseas Chinese, took money out of their own pockets to start newspapers as a tool to speak and defend themselves. For example, Zhang Lanchen, Chen Zhenjing, Chen Yongqiang, and others are all well-known traitors. In particular, Zhang Lanchen collected more than 100,000 overseas Chinese workers and sent them to build the Siam-Burma Railway for the enemy. Those who died of abuse and disease numbered in the hundreds of thousands. The ghosts cried and howled, which was extremely tragic. More than 3 million overseas Chinese all wanted to eat his flesh and sleep on his skin. Their official newspapers even called him "meritorious in the underground work of resisting Japan."

Unresolved Issues Between China and Siam

The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Siam and the arrival of the envoys made overseas Chinese extremely excited. Everyone placed their hopes on Ambassador Li, hoping that he could fight for the overseas Chinese. However, the embassy has been established for two months, and many important outstanding issues between China and Siam have not been negotiated and resolved. Ambassador Li is busy with social events and socializing, dancing parties and evening parties, with almost no time to spare.

The Highest Institution of Learning for Overseas Chinese

More than 300 Chinese schools have resumed classes one after another. However, the lack of teachers has become the most serious problem. Many intellectuals with real talent and learning fled the country during the period when Phibun was in power and when the Japanese occupied Siam. Therefore, at this time, anyone who knows a little bit and has an "overseas Chinese leader" to speak for him or a friend to recommend him can fill the position without qualification. Take Zhonghua Middle School, for example, this is the highest institution of learning for overseas Chinese in Siam. Because of the lack of teachers and the incompetence of the person in charge, there is nothing to show for it. Overseas Chinese education in Siam is still waiting for revival, and the cultural garden of overseas Chinese in Siam is still waiting to be cultivated. May educators and cultural figures from the motherland enthusiastically go south!

### Viewing National Reconstruction from the Perspective of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty

— Jiang Junzhang

The Sino-American Commercial Treaty was officially signed in Nanjing on November 4th. The full text of the treaty, consisting of thirty articles, has been published, along with an appended protocol clarifying certain terms listed in the treaty as an attachment. Since the abolition of unequal treaties, this is considered the first commercial treaty China has signed with an industrially advanced friendly nation. Therefore, the people of the whole nation are paying close attention to this treaty, and many are expressing their opinions and criticisms. We can summarize the opinions from all sides into two aspects: praise and criticism. The praise mostly consists of stating that this treaty is an equal and reciprocal one, which we need not quote at length. The criticisms mostly assert that this treaty will turn China into an economic appendage of the United States. The rights given to China by the United States, it is said, cannot be utilized by China due to insufficient national strength. On the other hand, the rights given to the United States by China will be fully utilized by the United States due to its superior national strength, material resources, and manpower. As a result, it will become a one-sided preference rather than an equal reciprocity. A Mr. Ma Qilun even said, "This commercial treaty is the precursor to a large-scale American economic invasion." We dare not criticize the right or wrong of these statements, and there is actually no need to do so. However, we must specifically point out that both China and the United States have their respective needs in entering into such a commercial treaty during this period. What does the United States need? It is the so-called transfer and maintenance of wartime industrial prosperity and full employment of the people. What does China need? It is to build the dilapidated China into a prosperous, strong, and happy nation. This is a major undertaking that China must accomplish in the next few years. Large-scale national reconstruction requires sufficient materials and excellent technology. However, how can China, which is originally backward and has been at war for a long time, solve the problems of capital, equipment, and technology required for reconstruction? Under this need, the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was established.

(1) The First Phase of Economic Construction Principles and the Sino-American Commercial Treaty

We know that the reconstruction of rehabilitated countries in the world has taken place in three different ways: one is the Turkish style, one is the Soviet style, and one is the method of the three South American countries. Before World War I, Turkey was like China before, heavily bound by unequal treaties. After World War I, it abolished the unequal treaties. Afraid of the previous suffering, it absolutely did not enter into debt relations with foreign countries, and cautiously carried out national construction only with its own financial and material resources. Therefore, Turkey's construction progressed very slowly and was very small in scale. Before the Second World War, Turkey was still a very backward country compared to the Western powers. The Soviet Union underwent a communist revolution in the process of World War I. Later, it implemented the Five-Year Plan, using political power to control the country's agricultural products, and then exchanged these agricultural products for machinery and other necessary materials needed for national construction. It did not hesitate to pay high salaries to hire foreign technical talents. The three South American countries did not refuse to use foreign capital, and absorbed foreign capital, equipment, or technology under the principle of equality. Therefore, they achieved twice the result with half the effort in the process of national reconstruction. China's reconstruction does not adopt the Turkish method, but the method of the three South American countries. The Father of the Nation's "Industrial Plan" was based on the use of foreign capital and technology. China's more than eight years of resistance war have raised its international status, and China's contribution to world peace has also been fully recognized by friendly nations such as the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. China's post-war reconstruction is not only a problem for China itself, but also a part of the entire world peace. In particular, the United States, both the government and the public, have a particularly clear understanding of this point and are very concerned about the various problems encountered in China's reconstruction and are willing to provide the necessary assistance. In order to welcome this era and adapt to this need, China specifically passed the principles of the first phase of economic construction at the 148th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council in late December of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944]. This principle includes a total of seven points, of which three points are:

(1) The proportion of foreign investment in Sino-foreign joint ventures should not be subject to fixed restrictions. In addition to the chairman of the board, the selection of the general manager of the company is not limited to nationals.

(2) After being reviewed by the government in accordance with the general construction plan, state-owned enterprises may borrow from abroad by the competent authorities, or be invested in by foreign countries. Private enterprises may also negotiate on their own and submit them to the competent authorities for approval and record.

(4) Foreigners who directly invest in and operate businesses in China shall abide by Chinese laws and regulations. Special businesses must be licensed to operate, and must first be submitted to our government for review and approval.

This was China's own preparation before the end of the war. The original Chinese laws, such as company law, etc., which are related to economic construction and conflict with the above principles, must be revised by the Legislative Yuan to avoid hindering the progress of attracting foreign investment. The Chinese government is doing such work in advance, but it is only seeing the possible trends in the international community and removing all obstacles first. After all, there is still a big gap between this and the actual work of absorbing foreign capital to engage in construction, because it cannot be realized without the actual assistance of friendly nations. The Sino-American Commercial Treaty can be said to be a formal recognition of China's economic construction principles receiving practical assistance from the United States, and another layer of obstacles to the inflow of American capital, equipment, and technology into China has been removed. We can say that because of the establishment of this treaty, China's policy of attracting foreign investment to engage in large-scale economic construction has been advanced another step.

(2) Formal Equality and Practical Significance

The main purpose of both parties to the Sino-American Commercial Treaty is to solve their respective current major problems, and what is manifested in form is equality and reciprocity. As stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 2, the form of equality is fully expressed, that is, according to the regulations of this article, Americans can engage in or operate businesses, manufacturing...etc. in China, and Chinese people also have these rights in the United States. Americans have the right to build or lease houses, etc. in China because they engage in these businesses, and Chinese people also have these rights in the United States; only two points need to be noted: First, occupations exclusively reserved for nationals of the host country are not within the scope of business; second, all businesses operated must comply with the laws and regulations promulgated by the legal authorities of the host country, including future promulgations. This form is implemented throughout the Sino-American Commercial Treaty. On the surface, it is naturally equal, but in practice, because the United States is an industrially advanced country and China is a poor and backward country, and has been devastated by a long-term war, there is a world of difference compared to the United States in terms of science, technology, equipment, and capital. Therefore, the rights and preferential examples set in the Sino-American Commercial Treaty must be enjoyed more by Americans, and what our Chinese people enjoy must be extremely limited, and it is actually extremely unequal. This is the focus of criticism of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty by general critics. It is based on the form expressed by the commercial treaty, and it can be said that the true meaning of the commercial treaty is not thoroughly understood.

We have already said that China needs large-scale industrial development, especially China after more than eight years of long-term resistance war, it is really full of devastation, and everything is waiting to be done. Our people, except for a few who made war fortunes and corrupt officials and merchants who received property, have all reached the point of being unable to afford adequate clothing and having difficulty making a living. Since the people are poor, the national treasury is of course also empty, not to mention the national treasury that has been excessively burdened for a long time? Therefore, the construction funds that we can raise ourselves are very limited! When we look at the world situation again, it really does not allow us to raise funds at our leisure and slowly develop industries. Since we need a large amount of foreign capital and welcome a large amount of foreign capital to build our country, how can we impose various restrictions or open the door for foreign capital inflow very small, and not give the rights to build houses and lease land needed for the construction of factories? Other issues related to foreign capital inflow, such as debt recovery, property protection and disposal, inheritance of estates, application of patents and trademarks, levying of taxes, and fair implementation of conscription and control of overseas Chinese, if not properly resolved one by one, will somewhat hinder our goal of attracting foreign investment for national construction. The current China is like a person who needs recuperation and nourishment after recovering from a serious illness so that he can restore his health in order to engage in work. A certain amount of expenses is required during the recuperation period, and he cannot raise it himself. Although it is out of borrowing, it is also a way out of no way. As long as there is a way to borrow, it is considered a way. Never stick to the concept of balanced income and expenditure, and never borrow debt that can be borrowed, but let this newly healed patient work himself to pay for the expenses of recuperation and nourishment! The Sino-American Commercial Treaty will inevitably have unequal facts, but our purpose is construction, just like a newly healed patient needs to borrow money to take tonic, which is the only way out of no way.

In addition, we must pay attention to three points: First, the validity period of this commercial treaty is five years. We know that President Chiang's book "China's Destiny" put forward a five-year construction plan. These two periods are not coincidental; Second, this commercial treaty still maintains a reserved attitude towards the rights to explore and develop mineral resources, and only stipulates that when given to "nationals, legal persons or groups of any third country, this right shall also be governed by the relevant laws and regulations currently or in the future implemented by the legally constituted authorities (if there are such laws and regulations) to bind nationals, legal persons or groups of the other party". Here we can see how cautious the country is in attracting foreign investment in the development rights of mineral resources! Third, every time the commercial treaty involves a right, it must state "should be in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations currently or in the future implemented by the legally constituted authorities", which means that if there are malpractices in attracting foreign investment, laws and regulations can be used to remedy them, which has the effect of preventing problems before they occur, and can be said to be very thorough.

(3) Conclusion

In short, the root of the establishment of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty is that China wants to carry out the great cause of national construction, while the United States wants to find a way out for its surplus capital and materials, and their respective purposes are on the back of the paper, but what is expressed is a set of equality and reciprocity. Therefore, our scholars and critics have based their arguments on the future occurrence of unequal facts, which has led to misunderstandings and deviations; if we look at the significance of this treaty from the perspective of construction, and then understand the key links in the treaty, we can know that this treaty is beneficial to the future of our country.

The period of five years is easy to pass. Just look at the fact that more than a year has passed since Japan's surrender? In this year, what foundation has our country laid for the great cause of national construction? As of now, the achievements are still very few. The establishment of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty is only a part of the broad scope of national construction. Another more important foundation is the creation of a national construction environment, which still has no clue. If this situation continues, then although the commercial treaty has been established, the progress of national construction will still be difficult, and the original intention of the treaty will inevitably be impossible to realize. This is the most terrible thing!

### West Lake in the Cold Wind

— November 30th, Hangzhou News, Our Hangzhou Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

In early winter, West Lake shivered from a cold wind, and then there was a warm sun again; although the branches and leaves on the lake are fading, it is still quite verdant and lush when viewed from the lakefront. It is already mid-winter, and West Lake does not show any signs of withering. Only in the Hangzhou newspapers, articles in the columns compete to describe the desolate midwinter. People with a heart are worried about next year's rice harvest due to the warm weather, and also worried about how so many poor and helpless people will survive if the weather suddenly turns cold.

Overnight, the sharp northwest wind blew the French parasol trees on both sides of Xinshi Market Road bald; the lakefront, Su Causeway, and Bai Causeway were covered with fallen branches and leaves. Although the sanitation workers swept them away, they would soon be scattered on the road again in the blink of an eye. Looking into the lake, the verdant and lush trees have become withered and yellow.

When Winter Comes, the Boats are Idle

In this harsh winter, the boats in the lake have their cloth awnings removed and lie lazily on the lake. The boatmen have nothing to do, waiting for the severe cold to pass, so that they can be active again in the coming spring. There are more than eight hundred of them in total, with more than five hundred boats. Including their families, about four thousand people live by rowing boats. Many boatmen rent boats from others to row, and split the boat fare with the boat owners at a rate of four to six. The city government stipulates that it costs two thousand yuan for an hour of rowing, but in the winter when the northwest wind howls, even if the boat fare is reduced to two hundred yuan an hour, I am afraid no one will be interested. Their whole family depends on the savings from the income of the spring, summer, and autumn seasons to get through this harsh winter. Some people who have no savings can only resort to borrowing from usurers. Of these many idle people, not counting the old and young, there are many, many young and strong people. How can we prevent them from wasting their useful time?

Winter Relief Shouts Resound Through the Sky

Here, the shouts for winter relief resound through the sky, but on the sidewalks along the bustling lakefront, many people rely on a reed mat and some tattered cotton wool to huddle under the eaves at night. Some of these people seem to be in their sixties, and some seem to be of the age to receive national education. The Zhejiang Daily reported that an old man and two young children starved to death near Henghe Bridge because they had no food. Such situations must be happening all the time.

Children's Shelters are Not Yet Full

The Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan and the Zhejiang Provincial Relief Institute jointly operate a shelter for orphaned children. Posters of a letter to orphaned children, thousands of words long, are posted everywhere. It is said that since its establishment on November 1, it has successively taken in 123 children, which is still less than the original quota of 200. However, there are still many children on the streets in tattered clothes. This evokes a terrible memory for me, which is that during the war, Guiyang also had a shelter for homeless children, but after being taken in, he stole his clothes and bedding and ran outside, sold them for money, and still roamed the streets. The environment has already educated him in the life of wandering. He is no longer accustomed to norms and is incorrigible by nature. This is of course the responsibility of the social environment, but those in charge of the children's shelter must take this as a warning.

Low-Priced Canteens are Deserted

Another relief institution is the low-priced canteen jointly operated by the Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan and the Hangzhou District of the Youth League. This canteen has been operating for three months. Each customer pays two hundred yuan and can get a cup of milk, a bowl of beef, three steamed buns, and a bowl of soup. Business was booming in the first month, with people shoulder to shoulder. In the last ten days of the second month, the beef ran out and was replaced with spinach and bean vermicelli, and the number of diners gradually decreased. In the third month, it was already deserted. Is it not cheap enough? Is it too far from the slums? Is it because there is no beef? Is the flour for the steamed buns not good? Is the milk too weak? Are the Chinese not used to it? These all seem to be worth the careful study of the organizers. Otherwise, there is a low-priced canteen, but the meaning of relief is not completely fulfilled!

Practical Relief and Serious Investigation

The Zhejiang Branch's winter relief plan includes distributing 2,000 packages of old clothes and making 20,000 cotton-padded clothes for distribution. Zhejiang Province has also established a winter relief committee to solicit donations of cotton-padded clothes, bedding, rice, grains, and miscellaneous grains to distribute to helpless poor people. Of course, such righteous deeds are worthy of praise, but how to distribute the relief to the truly poor people is a current problem. In our country, which does not pay attention to statistics, the exact number of the population is still under investigation. How many poor people are there in Hangzhou? How much rice, grain, cotton-padded clothes, and cotton-padded quilts are needed to be just right? Not to waste? Not to have too little porridge for too many monks? I think this is the time to investigate, but the investigation must be fast, and the relief must also be fast. The relief undertaking is originally different from handling official business in the yamen. But to distribute relief haphazardly in order to be quick would defeat the purpose of true relief. I advocate that an investigation must be conducted beforehand, so that it can be used as a basis for future relief undertakings. Moreover, after the investigation, when the investigation is conducted again at this time next year, the progress and shortcomings of the relief undertaking can be measured.

Useful Years Cannot be Used In recent months, there are fewer girls standing on the side of the road on the lakefront and in the downtown area to sell smiles. There are two explanations in the Hangzhou newspapers. One says that the weather is gradually getting colder, and they cannot bear the cold wind coming from the lake, so they have gradually disappeared; the other says that the municipal police station has driven them away, and they are now going to Gongchen Bridge to prosper the market. According to the facts, the latter statement seems more accurate. Most of these poor girls are selling their flesh out of desperation. Among them, the oldest looks like forty years old, and the youngest is a girl of thirteen or fourteen who has not yet fully developed. From the point of view of education, they should all be useful years. The municipal police station has driven them away from the city, but they are still doing things that they do not care about because they cannot use their useful years. Then, although there are no traces of them in the city for the time being, are they still smiling and selling themselves in other places? In this harsh winter, they stand in the sharp north wind, and if they do not receive a guest, they will go back to be beaten. If they receive a guest, it is only enough for their own food and clothing. These people should have been relieved. Then, in the voice of winter relief, why has no one planned to truly contribute the abilities of these female compatriots with useful years?

Fortune Tellers at the End of Their Road on Chenghuang Mountain Chenghuang Mountain is one of the famous scenic spots in Hangzhou. These days, the fortune tellers on the mountain have also closed their doors to celebrate the New Year. Relying on their own intelligence and some education they have received, they do fortune-telling and fortune-telling because they have no other choice. On the mountain, they rely on the patronage of tourists in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons to save some money to get through this severe winter. After the victory, due to the widespread unemployment phenomenon in the country, the number of fortune tellers on the mountain has increased a lot. Due to the increase in fortune tellers, they cannot earn much money either. This winter will also be quite hesitant. Among these fortune tellers, there are indeed old people, but young people also account for a large number. How to prevent this large number of young people from wasting their years in "idle chatter" is also worth considering by the government and the relief authorities!

Winter is here, and there are fewer tourists at West Lake, unless it is a snowy day, and people with special enthusiasm come to see West Lake in its plain attire.

### The Characteristics of the Ford Motor Company

— Ren Hengliang

(I) Ford's Outlook on Life

(1) To Be an Entrepreneur, Not a Capitalist: Ford said, "I am an entrepreneur, not a capitalist." Although I possess incalculable wealth, I do not wish to possess it privately or hide it away. I am merely a legal guardian of these assets. If there were a reasonable trustee committee, I would immediately be willing to hand over these assets. My wealth is entirely put to active use within the factory, to produce goods and support workers. Any surplus is used to expand the business. In short, my outlook on life is to benefit mankind, to ensure that everyone has work and everyone has food to eat."

(2) Replacing Charity with Employment: In society, many sacrifice the happiness of millions, amass vast fortunes, and then use one ten-thousandth of their wealth to purchase the facade of a philanthropist. Ford is different. He does not want to be a hypocritical philanthropist. His motto is "Replace charity with employment." He believes that receiving aid harms a person's dignity. The world generally believes that cripples, such as those with clubfeet, should be given aid, but Ford can provide them with simple jobs. Because a blind person still has functional limbs, and a person with a clubfoot can still work while seated. Therefore, his factory has many disabled workers. His outlook on life is that they are still human and it is not enough to provide them with a little relief. They should be given appropriate work so they can support themselves and live a stable life. That is the highest expression of human compassion.

(II) Internal Characteristics of the Ford Motor Company

(1) The Eight-Hour Work System: Generally, capitalists treat labor as a commodity. They believe that wages are the price of labor, like using money to buy goods. Therefore, they strive for minimal expenditure and maximum labor, extending a person's working hours to twelve or thirteen hours, believing they have struck a great bargain. However, they have not considered the adverse consequences of excessively long working hours on the factory itself. A person's energy is naturally limited, and there should be activities outside of working hours, such as washing clothes, bathing, and obtaining mental nourishment. Only then can one recover from work fatigue and find joy in family life. If one works dozens of hours a day, the monotony of personal life is needless to say, and various malpractices will inevitably arise in the work methods due to insufficient energy. Shoddy work is to be expected. Therefore, excessively long working hours are greatly detrimental to the factory itself. One cannot help but admire Ford's foresight in voluntarily implementing the unprecedented three-eight system.

(2) Wage Increase: Ford pays his factory workers wages that cover the minimum living expenses for the entire family. When Ford suddenly increased these wages to this standard, they were nearly twice as high as those of other manufacturers. Tens of thousands of workers wanted to work at the Ford factory. Ford believed that to ensure a worker's peace of mind, he must be provided with sufficient living expenses to support his entire family. Otherwise, working while worrying about household expenses would directly affect work efficiency and product quality, and would also affect the factory's future prosperity. Ford was aware of this, so he had to first stabilize the workers' lives, enabling them to work with peace of mind, doing their best and fastest work, and viewing the factory as their own home.

(3) Scientific Management: When Ford implemented the eight-hour work system and increased wages, other capitalists secretly laughed at him. They believed that shortening working hours and increasing wages would undoubtedly increase costs. They ridiculed Ford, believing that his factory would turn into a bubble within three months. But the facts proved them wrong. After implementing these measures, Ford made even more money. Ford had a method. Because Ford thoroughly implemented scientific management, although working hours were only eight hours, workers were fully focused on their work during those eight hours. Therefore, the efficiency of eight hours of work surpassed that of twelve hours of work in other factories. Moreover, his factory used a division of labor and cooperation system, where each worker only needed to specialize in one type of part. Because the work was simple, it was especially easy to become proficient. One person's work in a day could easily equal two days' work in other factories. Therefore, although wages were high and hours were short, work efficiency far exceeded that of other factories. As a result, costs were actually lower than those of other factories. To those unfamiliar with the details, it seemed like a great miracle.

(III) External Characteristics of the Ford Motor Company

(1) Returning Profits When Excess Earned: One year, the Ford factory earned more than the deserved profit. Therefore, Ford proposed at the shareholders' meeting to distribute the excess profit proportionally based on the number of vehicles sold, returning it to each Ford car customer. This proposal was, of course, met with extreme opposition from other shareholders. Since the beginning of commerce, there has been infighting and a pursuit of profit above all else. The more profit, the better. There is no reason to return money that has already been earned to customers. Ford thought differently. He believed that the purpose of life is service. Factory owners should make the best products possible, but they should not extract illegal exorbitant profits. If everyone greatly increased profits, on the one hand, it would directly affect customers' purchasing power, and on the other hand, it could be said to contain deceptive behavior towards customers. For these reasons, Ford resolutely returned these illegal profits to customers. Although he broke up with a few profit-seeking shareholders over this matter, it planted an indelible positive image in the minds of many customers. They all believed that Ford was truly a loyal servant of society. As a result, business became even more prosperous. His motto was "Small profits, high volume."

(2) Facing the Approaching Storm: After the First World War, the United States also experienced an economic panic. The market was sluggish, and there was a general atmosphere of economic recession in industry and commerce. In particular, the Ford factory was heavily in debt. Newspapers published forecasts that the Ford factory would go bankrupt. Bankers wanted to lend money to Ford to obtain high interest rates. This act of bankers willingly lending money to Ford would probably have been eagerly sought by others. But Ford had his own far-sighted views. He believed that if he borrowed these high-interest loans from bankers, these interest rates would undoubtedly be added to the costs. If costs were high, the selling price would inevitably increase. If the selling price was high, the volume of consumption would decrease. Continuing this cycle would simply be a dead end. Therefore, he resolutely rejected the bankers' offer to lend him money. Thus, Ford used his great courage. The first step was to sell off the company's inventory at factory prices. In doing so, he cleared most of the debts, and the cash flow became more flexible. The second step was to transfer most of the people from the administrative department to the factory to participate in direct production work. In this way, Ford overcame this difficulty. Some estimated that if Ford had borrowed debt from a bank during the economic storm, it would have created a tragic situation of high car prices and poor sales, and he might have gone bankrupt long ago. This shows that Ford's foresight is very admirable.

The above is just a brief overview of the Ford factory. Among the industrialists in our country, only Rong Desheng, the cotton yarn magnate who was recently kidnapped and escaped danger, is somewhat comparable to Ford. Ford's characteristics are actually what all industrialists should emulate.

### An Introduction to Business Administration

— Xu Baiyi

Employee Training and Job Security

Regarding the hiring of employees, psychology can be used as a basis for implementing testing, which has already been discussed. Now we want to discuss other issues regarding the hiring of employees:

(I) Training of Female Workers

We have talked about the strengths and weaknesses of female workers, as well as the criteria for deciding whether to hire male or female workers. Now we will discuss the training of female workers. Ordinary male workers, because they have already worked as workers, or in fact cannot do other mental work, only do physical work, so their understanding of the factory is deeper than that of female workers. Therefore, the training required by female workers is often more than that of male workers.

During the First World War, various factories established affiliated schools. These schools were the necessary path before entering the factory. Regardless of male or female workers, before formally joining the factory, they must first undergo training in that school, and only when the time is right can they be formally employed. This type of school is often in a separate location in the factory, equipped with the same machines used in manufacturing, so that future workers can learn there, instructed by specialized technicians and full-time professors. The implementation of this work has the following benefits:

1.  Female workers often feel overwhelmed and very timid when they first join the factory because of the change in environment. This situation is very inappropriate for the progress of manufacturing work. After training, they can remove this mentality.

2.  Making bad goods in the manufacturing plant is a loss. Roughly, bad goods are made? On the one hand, it is due to negligence, and on the other hand, it is because of lack of training. Therefore, after training, future losses can be reduced. Therefore, it is worthwhile to do some training work before hiring.

3.  Making a product requires several steps, and each step must cooperate with each other. If this point is trained, the working level of workers can meet a certain standard, and the problem of cooperation between each other can also be solved.

The Shanghai Telephone Company used to have a school in the Fujian Road branch, specializing in training professional talents in the field of telephone. Participants must take an examination before entering the school. After training for a considerable period in the school and deemed qualified, they will be sent to the company to serve. For general manufacturing plants that produce specialized goods and are of considerable scale, this type of training is very beneficial.

### Colors Used in Factories

— Lin Hanming

There has been a lot of recent development in the academic theory of colors used in industry. We want to make a simple explanation of this. It is best to first talk about some basic issues of industrial color usage. The colors in the sunlight spectrum are familiar to everyone. It slowly changes from deep purple, one wavelength at a time, to deep red. However, industrial primary colors rarely use pure colors in the spectrum, usually using warm or light grays with many different appearances and effects. Single colors are rarely used except when emphasizing or requiring attention.

It is better to say that color is a feeling than to say it is a property of matter. The same color feeling may be completely different under different conditions. For example, there is a big difference between a blue piece of paper lined with a black background and a green background. Similarly, color can also affect the feeling of other properties. The most obvious is the concept of size. A white circle seems to be larger than a black circle of the same diameter, and the size of a gray circle seems to be between the two. Some colors can make an object appear first, and other colors can hide an object in a dark place. Still other colors can produce a warm effect, such as yellow, peach, and red; other colors, such as blue, green, and outdoor colors, produce a cold effect.

In addition, there are psychological factors. For example, red is the most famous and powerful color in the spectrum. It is combined with strength and movement and has a great influence on human nature. Yellow is brilliant and pleasant, and green is cold and has a spirit-rejuvenating power, but it is neither exciting nor depressing. It may even be the most popular of all colors.

The most important thing in using colors in industry is the selection of machine colors. The scope of this selection is very wide, and it is not limited to a single color. The color of the machine must have a sufficiently high reflectivity, so that the brightness of the environment is roughly the same as the brightness under work at any time. The surface of the machine should be semi-frosted, so as to minimize the intensity of strong light and glare in practical application.

In some jobs, it is very convenient to make the tool appear semi-black against a bright background. Semi-black can also be effectively used as a reflective background to adjust the brightness of the environment during work. Reflective surfaces that evenly reflect light on cursors and work lines should also be painted in semi-black.

The accent colors are a small part of the pure colors and are suitable for machine coloring. The purpose of using it is usually two, one is to indicate dangerous places, action levers, and buttons. The second is to add beauty to a bright place and serve as a decorative function.

The color of the factory building

In large factory buildings, it is rare to use only one color; sudden changes in the color of adjacent factory buildings are also often avoided, and related colors are used instead. It has been proven by experience that there are three main steps to achieving first-class color work in a factory: First, the equipment must be arranged in order, mixed things must be moved away, and placed in another separate room as much as possible. Anything that easily causes chaos in the factory must be carefully placed properly. Second, provide adequate lighting. If the inside of a factory cannot be arranged correctly, it is impossible to achieve beauty, and if the light is not appropriate, it is impossible to make the factory an efficient and talkative factory. Brushing with appropriate colors is very important for good lighting (but few brushings can overcome the obstacles generated by dazzling lights directly in the worker's environment). Third, is to choose the appropriate color, which is based on the principles described above.

In short, in the industrial field, the concept of planning to brush with appropriate colors is not a recent discovery; due to its many benefits, it is believed that its application will be more extensive in the near future.

### Remembering Mr. Dafu

— Yecao

In the late autumn of the 24th year [likely of the Republic of China, corresponding to 1935], I and several friends agreed to travel to West Lake. We stayed in Hangzhou for half a month, enjoying the scenery, drinking, and chatting. During those half a month, I met Mr. Dafu three times, both before and after. Unexpectedly, these few meetings were the last. Ten years have passed easily, and Mr. Dafu's voice, appearance, and smile still remain in my mind, but he has already sacrificed his life overseas, which is truly heartbreaking!

One morning, we found the poet Mr. Wang Yixin. Yixin was my old classmate. That day, in a lakeside restaurant, he ordered many dishes, and also ate drunken crabs and drank Daran Huadiao wine. In the afternoon, Yixin did not go to work, and I did not participate in the lake tour. In the evening, I went to see Mr. Dafu with Yixin. He invited us to dinner and drank a lot of good wine again.

During the meal, Mrs. Yu [Dafu], Ms. Wang Yingxia, told us that they moved to Hangzhou mainly for the convenience of the children's schooling. Moreover, the air by the lake is good, and the cost of living is low, which is suitable for Mr. Dafu's writing and health.

"If you want to drink good wine," Mr. Yu said calmly, "you can come to my house often. Friends sent me nothing but good wine, enough to drink for a while. Also, let me tell you, if you go to Shaoxing, unless you go to the house of someone who likes to drink, it is difficult to find good wine on the market."

Mr. Dafu had a considerable alcohol capacity and was especially fond of drinking. He drank and talked without showing any fatigue.

"Dafu's health has not been good in the past few years," Ms. Wang Yingxia interjected, "I have repeatedly advised him to eat less; now, the amount he eats is relatively small, and the amount of wine he drinks each time is gradually decreasing."

Mr. Yu smiled without saying a word.

We continued to talk. Mr. Yu was a very eloquent speaker; he had unique insights on creative techniques and several better literary works in our country after the May Fourth Movement. He turned his face and smiled at me and said:

"Yixin is a poet with the strongest artistic temperament, he loves wine, he loves the moon, and he loves West Lake; if one day wine is banned, or if someone does not allow him to eat it at all, then I think his source of poetry may dry up!"

From Mr. Yu, I learned that Yixin likes to drink alone very much. Every night when the moon is white and the wind is clear, he buys a boat to buy wine, and drinks happily alone in the heart of the lake, and then good poems are created.

After dinner, we talked about some trivial matters. Yixin asked him to criticize my articles. Mr. Yu humbly said:

"People in good health have more courage; they can write longer works. ..."

His sincere attitude and enthusiastic tone are still deeply imprinted in my mind.

On the third day, an organization held a reception for a certain cultural group that came to Hangzhou in the auditorium called "Minghu Ying" (?) on the lakeside. We were also invited to participate and sat with Mr. Dafu. In that hall, there was a couplet of tiger skin mats written by Mr. Yu himself, which was very outstanding in the middle, and the text cannot be remembered now.

At that time, the government was stepping up the promotion of the New Life Movement, and no one smoked in the hall. However, Mr. Yu took out a pack of Kretek cigarettes from his long gown pocket and handed one to me. I took it and smiled at him. He knowingly said:

"Just smoke, it doesn't matter ..."

We were the only two people smoking in the entire place. Those who were being entertained looked at us, making people feel a little embarrassed, but Mr. Dafu's expression was exceptionally relaxed.

Later, Yixin told me that Mr. Dafu lived in Hangzhou as a celebrity and gained a lot of convenience and preferential treatment.

The day before we left Hangzhou, we went to his house to say goodbye, but he happened to be out socializing. When we left that day, we unintentionally saw Mr. Dafu and his wife at Hangzhou Station. He said he was sending his wife to the train to Shanghai to collect royalties for him. He himself may come to Shanghai to play soon, and everyone can meet.

The following year, he wrote a lot of travel notes, almost every one of which was a masterpiece. It is said that he had traveled for a period of time on the highway in the border area of Zhejiang, Anhui and Jiangxi provinces.

Some time later, I heard that he went to the Fujian Provincial Government and took up the nominal position of a counselor. Until the August 13th Incident occurred, we did not exchange a single letter.

In the 30th year [likely of the Republic of China, corresponding to 1941], I received a letter from a friend, which briefly mentioned his family changes. I didn't believe it much at the time and thought it must be a rumor.

In Xi'an, in the spring of the 32nd year [likely of the Republic of China, corresponding to 1943], Mr. Xie Bingying and I co-edited a publication, and asked several friends to solicit manuscripts from him. The friends replied that they had lost contact long ago and did not know his location! After the victory, we returned to Shanghai and inquired in many ways, only to learn that Mr. Yu had indeed been killed overseas.

Mr. Dafu's encounter with family changes in his later years was unfortunate enough; he himself then died tragically, can the grief and mourning of all who love him be described in words!

### Literary Trends in a World in Turmoil

— Hualin

What is presented to us now is not family ideology, partisan concepts, or even national issues or ethnic relations. Without a doubt, it is the entire world issue! The development of science and industry has shrunk the world to the point of being significant. Not only electricity! The speed of transportation and the convenience of airplane travel, even in terms of the atomic bomb, have destroyed the boundaries of countries without residue!

George Bernard Shaw and Albert Einstein both felt that if there were another war in the world, culture would be destroyed! Because on this small earth, if the atomic power in the universe is used to destroy it, the entire world can be destroyed immediately! Therefore, the world has reached today, and there is no need to distinguish any boundaries, nor is there any need to be self-centered. Those countries that leave the interests of the human masses, hold the ambition to rule the world, and want to trample on other nations are really foolish and pitiful.

What is urgently needed now is that the world unite as one and not waste human talent on destroying the world. On the one hand, the old and ancient old society cannot be allowed to continue to exist, and on the other hand, everyone must have good food to eat, and everyone is responsible for transforming the world. No one can survive outside the world!

Harming others is harming yourself, needless to say. People and I cannot be separated, just like the cells in the body. If one part is rotten, it affects the safety of the whole. It is not an ideological problem now, nor is it a philosophical problem, but a matter of fact. It is like family brothers disagreeing and arguing endlessly over the father's inheritance. When they are angry, they take a big bomb and explode, intending to destroy others, but they do not know that they will die together.

Therefore, we want to call for help, and literary friends all have foresight, and their feelings are more sensitive than others. It is even more impossible to establish their own schools and despise each other. If everyone has universal love in their hearts, then their tolerance can accommodate the vast sea. Everyone is better than me, this is a happy thing, everyone is not as good as me, and I must be more responsible. The entire world requires the support of everyone! Literary artists are saving humanity from its unfortunate fate. What is before our eyes is the whole world problem! We are in the same boat in the storm, in a precarious situation. If the world does not unite on the basis of human morality and justice, it will soon be destroyed by atomic bombs or more advanced weapons. At that time, famous mountains will not be able to treasure masterpieces, and Buddhist caves will not be able to leave their fragrance for thousands of years!

### Moonlit Prayer

— Authored by G. Faure of France, Translated by Yan Dachun

The author is a contemporary poet and essayist. He lived in Algeria for many years, deeply immersed in Arab tribes. He has written many novels, mostly depicting the customs and character of Africans, and the local scenery. —Translator's Note

The sky was exceptionally clear, a sheet of blue. In the radiant distance, each day, the sun, in its endless rotation, cast its brilliance upon the parched wheat. The sunlight was intensely hot, practically an unquenchable fire. Not a single dewdrop touched the ground; in the arid breast, the seeds received not a single drop of the moisture they needed for life. The majestic sky had been clear for another week; its immaculate color presaged hunger and suffering, threatening to dissolve this Mohammedan people, as an Atlas vulture swoops down on a rotting corpse.

Could it be that the deity of these believers would allow his beloved children to perish? Would he allow adults and children, bloodless and timid people, to beg for a loaf of bread at the gates of the Romans, so they could eke out another day?

Prayer was needed!

In the murmuring night, myriads of stars were scattered across the sky, like a handful of golden lilies, a slender crescent moon suddenly appearing against the vast black backdrop. The new moon cast a milky radiance, not harsh to the eye. Its light gently enveloped the sleeping fields, and painted long shadows at the feet of all things, slowly moving, like the steel hands on a clock face.

Suddenly, the silence was shattered; a commotion arose from the village. It was the black people, dressed in white, lined up in rows, walking and dancing awkwardly, sending monotonous, guttural pleas to the warm and hazy breeze. Their steps were slow, moving to the passionate rhythm of dull copper drums and clear clappers. The crowd gathered behind them, echoing the last line of the plaintive music with voices of distress. In front of the houses, women wore holiday clothes, intermittently drowning out the songs and merriment passing by with their piercing voices. Children followed along the sides of the procession, young girls wearing gold or copper caps, with wide belts bound with silk and silver threads, wearing bright and pleasing gauze skirts, searching for beloved youths in this sorrowful tide of people.

These excited black people kept moving forward, constantly hopping slightly, their dirge becoming increasingly hoarse. They advanced, the eyes of the villagers fixed on the silver sickle of the moon, as if drawn by an invisible force. At that time, the moon moved lightly, majestically rising among the shimmering, magnificent stars. On the thin and wrinkled heads of the black people, sweat, like bitter tears, poured onto their sunken temples, and their thick hair was also wet. A bestial maw folded back huge lips, revealing ivory-colored tusks. They stared transfixed. They stopped from time to time, forming circles, and the dance began to become more fervent and rapid. The singing became doubly rough, extremely hoarse. The tones of the copper drums and clappers exploded terribly, dominating this hellish music. The piercing cries of the women flashed through the clear night.

In the dimly lit huts, the half-naked old women knelt before roaring charcoal fires, concocting herbal remedies and burning incense, the air filled with the fragrant mist of resin and nard. They were gaunt, bowed over the sacred fire, chanting incantations in trembling, shrill voices. Beneath their slender fingers, they stirred spikenard and galbanum, rose and sandalwood. From time to time, they straightened their busts, worn out by age and prolonged fatigue, stretching their arms, clenching their fists, tilting their heads back, their hair disheveled, in a state of ecstasy, with their limbs extended, they cried out several devilish curses.

The night ignored the ardent prayers, flowing on solemnly and grandly. Now, the moon was descending into the abyss, to rise again from there tomorrow night. Its horns touched the mountains monopolizing the horizon. A minute later, the desolate sky gradually pressed down a black cloth embroidered with silver towards the ground, as if covering a memorial platform.

The singing of the black people no longer sounded like singing; they wailed, shouted, and gasped. The withered long arms only clumsily struck the drums, hitting them quickly and unnaturally. Their wrinkled faces showed extreme agitation, their eyes gleaming, like the eyes of wild beasts. They stamped their feet forcefully, sustained by an excessive faith and devotion to the deity. All their ability, all their desires, their entire soul, their entire flesh, were completely devoted to a superhuman prayer.

Suddenly, just as the moon disappeared over the hillside, a great wind arose in the plain, wailing and shivering. At the same time, large patches of black clouds covered the sky. As the thick clouds slowly pushed forward, the stars gradually went out. The night grew darker and darker. The songs of the men, the cries of the women, the thunderous copper drums grew louder and louder. In those huts, the hunched old women straightened their fleshless, naked bodies, stroking their ugly skin, folding up their loose, already flattened long corsets. In the past, when they were young and happy, in the days when they imitated dignity and their lives were rich, they had thrown handful after handful of mysterious spices onto the blazing charcoal fire. But now, they could only recite incantations in their lost dreams.

Warm, shower-like raindrops fell on the parched earth, lightning flashing, illuminating the distant horizon, thunder roaring majestically from afar. The storm arose magnificently and astonishingly. At this time, the entire crowd felt a sense of happiness and gratitude, and they knelt down tremblingly, their foreheads touching the damp ground, thanking the deity for not despising their prayers.

"Only Yella is God, Mohammed Yu is our Yella!"

### The Flute Player

— Su Honglie

I don't know from what day, following the footsteps of the lonely dusk, the flute player once again held his beloved small flute, and mournfully played that sorrowful and plaintive flute sound.

I pushed open the window and looked down, at those deep eyes, the pale face, he eternally silently gazed into the distance, as if lost in thought, lonely wandering on this starry and moonlit night.

He, I don't know in what year, from what method, was sent to this strange place.

He never received a bit of human warmth, only borrowing this dim moonlight, using those thin and pale fingers, lightly pressing out a sorrowful and plaintive tune.

He, every night relying on the crumbling wall, perhaps he wants to recapture the old dreams of the past? However, what the facts tell him, is what kind of miserable memory—human feelings are as thin as paper.

So the flute player began to sob quietly again, under that withered long hair, on the pale face, overflowing with tide-like tears, he gradually made me tremble from staring.

Pale frost, completely filled his hair. Cold wind, violently pounced on his thin clothes.

Gradually, he began to tremble, he curled up his body, accompanying him was no longer the sorrowful and plaintive flute sound, but gradually began to sob.

### Written Before Mao Aili's Solo Recital

— Danshui

The year before last winter, after Ms. Mao Aili held a concert in Shanghai, she planned to go to the mainland. Before she left, at that farewell party, she gave each of us friends a small booklet of the music program, with her name signed above and below, a portrait, and the lyrics. When I got it, I joked with her, "It's really a good gift, with one volume in hand, her 'voice and appearance are as if right here'." She smiled, without getting angry, but sent a "white eye."

Since she went to Chongqing, everyone has not exchanged a single letter, but I am a bit concerned about her recent situation and singing voice; later, from the newspaper, I learned that she had held several concerts in Chengdu, Kunming, and Chongqing, which were very popular; a friend told me that she was also in the Department of Music at Chongqing National Music Academy, and was teaching vocal music, and the Yanjing University Department of Music specially gave her a diploma (a bit of honorary meaning, because she only studied for three and a half years of the major credits.)

Although Aili has been away from this place for a full two years, in our memory, her singing voice, especially the Chinese songs she sang, was so full of rich emotions, her plaintive eyes, hovered in front of us, making us feel an eternal melancholy... Two years later, although she is slightly thinner, although she did not sing a single word for us, although she used a smile to replace all words, she is so often silent, but unwilling to make a permanent silence on life... Recently, after holding this farewell solo concert, she will go abroad for further study. In addition to earnestly expressing our ardent hopes, we hope that in her singing after a long absence, our hearts will, along with her lingering sound, once again enter a dreamlike state, a quiet stream in the jungle, a clear and beautiful high sky... There, she will give us infinite lingering charm.

### Anecdotes from the Literary World

— Zhan Weng

Kuang Refeng

Mr. Kuang Refeng, a man of letters and elegant demeanor, was widely talked about. In his later years, he lived in Suzhou and still had a penchant for singing and selecting beauties. One day, Wu Quan'an hosted him at a hotel in the city and summoned a prostitute whose appearance was not particularly outstanding. However, Kuang was astonished and thought her to be a celestial being, and composed a poem with Quan'an to give as a gift. Some of the guests laughed at him, but Refeng said, "This sister is pure amidst the impure, which cannot be understood by vulgar eyes."

Refeng adored Mei Lanfang and attended to him meticulously. He once went to the backstage to watch Lanfang put on makeup, gazing intently and admiringly. Afterwards, he told people, "The one who does the makeup for Mei Lang is an unbearable boor, using rough silkworm hands to apply powder and grease, caressing Mei Lang's face twice. Mei Lang allows him to touch and play with him without showing the slightest anger. I didn't expect a boor to enjoy such good fortune, it really makes one feel the sentiment 'I would rather be a boor than envy an immortal!'"

Mr. Liang Rengong once wrote a calligraphy fan for me, which I have cherished for many years and never asked anyone to paint on. I happened to see Mr. Zhu Qiangcun's plum blossom paintings somewhere, and although they were just playful strokes, they seemed rare and precious, so I asked him to paint one. He unexpectedly agreed. A plum blossom branch was painted the next day, simple and charming. However, not a single word was inscribed, only a seal was stamped. Later, I visited Mr. Zhu and asked why he was unwilling to write an inscription. He said, "I have always looked down on Rengong as a person and did not want to match him." Mr. Refeng, upon hearing this, told me, "To pair Rengong's calligraphy with Qiangcun's painting is no different from transmitting Han Fei and Lao Tzu together. You are truly a mischievous person."

### An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 110

— Ye Jingfeng

That group of people, as if startled, turned around in unison.

"Ah...!" The kimono-clad old man, probably the Inoue that Pingzi spoke of, let out a sound like a sigh and a cheer. "Here...it's here!" His voice was old, and although it was a bit trembling, it was extremely loud.

There was a commotion here at that time; Pingzi, hearing the old man's words, although frowning slightly, could not hide the joy on her face. At the same time, she leaned closer to Hejian, leaning back comfortably, as if waiting for the car to start. The gentleman with the single eyeglass, on the contrary, raised his comfortable body, rested his hands on the back of the front seat, and looked at the group of people, one by one, from the old man to the two attendants. The group of people who came all followed behind the old man and ran towards Pingzi's car.

"Be careful!" The single-eyed gentleman gave a warning to his own people in German.

"It's Shajun again!" The old man leaned his head in from outside the car window, looking at the single-lensed gentleman with a half strange, half funny expression, squinting his eyes, looking like he was smiling and crying at the same time, "I have to trouble you to get out of the car and talk to me for a few words, would you be so kind as to give me this face? ... Oh!" The old man glanced at Pingzi and saw Hejian, "Oh, and there's a handsome young man, of course it's Hejian Yuer!"

The single-eyed gentleman immediately showed an awkward expression, tapping his fingers on the back of the chair three or four times, perhaps it was some kind of secret signal, then he opened the car door and got out of the car; closing the car door with a bang. The old man reached out a hand, stroked the single-lensed gentleman's back, and invited him to walk to the opposite side of the road. At this time, Hejian suddenly felt a soft, moist little hand reaching over, gently stroking the back of his hand, one index finger, constantly tapping, Hejian knew this was a secret telegraph warning—tap tap dit tap—after the warning was tapped, then came the telegram: "Beware of the cigarette case. The road ahead is clear, beware of the cigarette case, the road ahead is clear! ... This is a German secret agent, their sergeant, is Konoe... Prime Minister... Gather your courage! Beware of the cigarette case, it's best to give it to me!"

"Who is the old man?" Hejian gently pulled out the hand receiving the telegram, stroking Pingzi's hand, tapping in the same way, sending a telegram.

"Sorry" Pingzi again followed the original pattern, tapping rhythmically, "I thought you knew them... The old man is a close disciple of the Yuanlao faction, Xigongsi, Inoue Kiyoki Elder, the head of the national Buddhist sect..."

"Understood..." Hejian replied, "He is my 'kendo' ancestor—my master's ancestor, the old man's kendo is invincible, if you know him, I ask you to introduce me, I want to learn a few tricks from him... Is he related to the Black Dragon Society?"

"The Dharma is boundless!..." Pingzi replied, "There is no country he can't enter, let alone the Black Dragon Society!... His disciples and grandchildren are all over the world, ... 'I am unworthy' is the latest disciple he has selected to join his sect, specializing in learning 'Mysticism'..."

"Then, you are my ancestor's generation, I am very disrespectful...! What is 'Mysticism'?"

"You're welcome, you're welcome"; we are equals. I am preparing to worship you as a 'Judo' master, if you think I am qualified: then, we can call it even... In addition, I also want to practice Chinese language from you, learn Chinese poetry... 'Mysticism' and 'Banghe Technique' are largely the same; in India it is the Brahman sect, transmitted to Tibet, evolved into Tantrism, in cultivation, it is the gate to becoming a Buddha, in magic, it is the 'Vajra Powerful Force', which can control all military force, as long as you concentrate, and point with your hand, you can immobilize, you can kill..."

### Street Vendors

— Shaofu

The conflict between the vendors can be said to be the largest mass brawl that occurred in Shanghai after the victory of the War of Resistance. Without discussing the issue of responsibility for this incident, the authorities should have given careful consideration to the crackdown on vendors beforehand. One cannot rely on a piece of paper to issue an order and arrest those who disobey, in order to crack down on vendors, to enhance appearances, to stop smuggled goods, to eliminate the black market,... To be honest, to achieve the above goals, only cracking down is to abandon the fundamental for the superficial. Moreover, vendors cannot be cracked down on so easily.

Nothing in the world is more serious than hunger. They originally sought profit and did a little business, their purpose was only to make a living. If they had large capital and ways, why would they be standing on the streets in such rainy weather?

We support the crackdown, but we also hope that the authorities will arrange a way out for them when cracking down, that is, to allow them to make a living. Otherwise, it is easy to force them to take risks.

The vendors themselves must also consider for the policymakers. All demands, taking actions outside the track, will not help their own problems, and the consequences will be unimaginable. This is definitely not a smart way. Now, the problem is finally coming to an end. If it is exploited by a third party's conspiracy, it will lose social sympathy.

### Current Affairs Q&A

— Huiqun

Common Sense About the United Nations Translated from the English "Westminster Gazette"

The most important news from these major countries is the United Nations General Assembly in New York. In addition to the news of the National Assembly, the newspapers are filled with news about the League of Nations General Assembly: what is the limitation of the veto, the amendment of the United Nations Constitution, the five-power conference, which makes people who do not understand international politics have a headache, and they do not understand what the five powers are busy with. If you are one of them, just spend three minutes reading the following article, and you can get a clear and concise idea of the Charter of the United Nations, so that you will not feel a headache when you see this kind of news——

Q: What is the purpose of the United Nations Organization?

A: The charter states that the purpose of the United Nations Organization is "to maintain justice, to respect obligations arising from treaties, to promote social progress, to raise living standards, to implement freedom of thought and belief, to live together in harmony, to unite the strength of the member states to ensure peace, and to prevent new wars."

Q: How can this purpose be achieved? How do the United Nations cooperate?

A: First, representatives from each member state, regardless of whether it is a large country or a small country, participate in the United Nations General Assembly; in the General Assembly, each country has one vote, regardless of size.

Q: Doesn't Russia actually have three votes?

A: The Soviet Union has only one vote, but the Ukrainian Republic and the Belarusian Republic also have one vote each because they have independent foreign ministries and foreign ministers.

Q: Doesn't the British Empire have six votes?

A: The self-governing territories, India, and the United Kingdom (the British mainland) each have one vote, just like in the League of Nations before.

Q: What is the task of the United Nations General Assembly?

A: The United Nations General Assembly discusses various international issues and can make recommendations to all member states.

Q: Can it recommend amendments to existing treaties?

A: No. At the San Francisco Conference, Egypt proposed giving the United Nations General Assembly this power. This motion only received the support of a few countries. Most countries believe that this would add more difficulties to the United Nations General Assembly than it could solve.

Q: What is the "Security Council"?

A: The Security Council is the executive body of the United Nations. Its task is to study, discuss, and resolve disputes between countries by peaceful means. If a country disrupts the peace or carries out aggression, the Security Council will convene member states to take the necessary steps to ensure peace.

Q: Does this mean that the Security Council can order a country to participate in a war?

A: No. Any member state, if it wishes, can conclude a special agreement to hand over all or part of its military force to the Security Council for use. The Security Council can only request member states to sever economic or political relations with the aggressor. Member states do not have the obligation to participate in a war.

Q: What should happen if there is a dispute between two member states?

A: They should resolve it peacefully themselves as much as possible. If it cannot be resolved, either party can bring the dispute to the Security Council; or the Security Council can automatically intervene.

Q: What happens next?

A: The Security Council will first conduct an investigation. After the investigation is clear, it can recommend methods for resolving the dispute; if the issue is a legal one, it can ask the International Court of Justice to handle the matter.

Q: What is the International Court of Justice?

A: The International Court of Justice is composed of many well-known lawyers selected according to specific rules. It has the power of adjudication. The International Court of Justice can accept and judge issues such as doubts about the interpretation of treaties in accordance with international public law.

Q: Does the International Court of Justice also handle political issues?

A: No. The International Court of Justice only handles purely legal issues. Political issues should be resolved by the Security Council itself based on the principles of the United Nations Charter.

Q: Should all member states abide by the laws of the Security Council?

A: Yes. All member states "agree to accept and implement the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the Charter."

Q: Then, is it the case that in all cases, all disputes should be resolved peacefully by the countries involved, or resolved by the Council?

A: Yes. Resolving all disputes by peaceful means is an important task of the Security Council. (To be continued)

### Rule of Law

— Zhan Weng

It was reported that the president of the Wuxi Court, while riding in a chartered car through a certain place, did not listen to the traffic police's instructions and even gave the traffic police two slaps. The onlookers all discussed that the president knew the law but violated it. I think that knowing the law will definitely not violate it. Perhaps the traffic police's interference with the president should be punished with two slaps according to law!

### The Organization of Beggars 4

— Huang Jiamo

"Seizing the Bucket" Wars

Since the outbreak of the war, the construction of new alleyways has completely stopped. Some new-style alleyways have even added watchmen and police. In order to maintain cleanliness, beggars are absolutely not allowed to establish "buckets" in the alleyways. Therefore, the number of buckets has only decreased, while the emerging new beggars are thriving. The new beggars often lament that there is no "bucket" to accommodate them, so they have to launch invasion wars. Before launching an offensive, the invaders create incidents out of nothing and make unreasonable demands on the existing bucket beggar gangs. The beggar gangs refuse. Then the invaders deliberately publicize to escalate the situation. The defenders, aware of this, hurriedly gather their followers and send out calls for reinforcements. Once both sides have completed their deployments, a martial drama begins. The outcome will determine the ownership of the "bucket." However, no matter which side wins, the loser will never give up. They reorganize their forces and come back for another fight. From then on, disputes are endless, and bloody tragedies follow one after another. Therefore, generous and honest beggars do not dare to easily start trouble. Moreover, beggar gangs consider accommodating displaced beggars to avoid disputes. This is also a virtuous policy of the beggar gangs to avoid internal strife!

The Technique of Snatching Leftovers

The old brother beggar gangs originally regarded "snatching leftovers" as the only way to solve people's livelihood problems. Since the outbreak of the war, the supply of firewood and rice has been difficult, and food delivery services have closed down one after another, causing great suffering to the people in the beggar gangs. Fortunately, after the victory, everything is gradually returning to normal, and merchants are again offering food delivery services, so the old brothers can restore their previous enjoyment. In the inland areas, beggars can beg for leftover food from residents. But in Shanghai, every household hires maids and drivers with large appetites, so no matter how much food the masters have left over, it is all taken care of by these subordinates. Moreover, the old brother beggar gangs have never had the right to beg from residences. Their only method is to stop people on the road to snatch leftovers. Every day, Shanghai shops must provide two meals, each delivered by these carriers. After eating, there is often a lot of leftover rice and cold soup. The beggars wait on the roadside, and when the food carriers pass by, they surround them and force them to stop. They automatically and forcefully seize the opportunity to sweep away the leftover rice and leftovers. After snatching, they must give a portion to the "grandfathers," and the rest is devoured to fill their stomachs. Given the size of Shanghai, the number of people eating catered meals is at least in the hundreds of thousands, and the amount of leftovers every day is enough to sustain the lives of the beggars.

However, snatching leftovers is not a very peaceful job. Whenever beggars stop people on the road, the shop employees will not submit docilely and allow themselves to be robbed. They will take out the carrying poles as weapons and hit the children on the head. At this time, the children are determined to snatch the food and are unwilling to fight, so they adopt a policy of non-resistance and endure the beatings. They express that they can endure hardship, but the food must be snatched. The beggars' reasoning is: "You have already earned enough money from the catering, and these leftover foods do not belong to you. They are left to feed the poor children."

### Do You Have These Bad Habits?

— Wang Jiande

When "Loyal Heart" was showing at a certain theater, there was a short film with abundant laughter that was added to the show. This film portrayed the many bad and strange habits that could occur in theaters. These habits feel realistic and relevant in many theaters in Shanghai.

The most common thing is that people still refuse to take off the hat that protects their head when the show starts, letting the audience behind them enjoy a patch of darkness. Some gluttons, even when the show starts, refuse to let their mouths rest for a moment. Peanuts, melon seeds, shelling, and the sound of opening paper bags can sometimes create a racket, making the audience see only the protagonist's mouth opening and closing on the screen, and making them confused about what's being said. Some people sitting by the aisle are also very comfortable, stretching out one leg, and some reckless latecomers often trip over it. The warm sofa is still uncomfortable and unsatisfactory for some audience members. Their feet extend into the seats of the people in front of them, tossing and turning. It is embarrassing that people spend several hours trying to find some entertainment, but you interrupt their enjoyment. Maybe some people are born restless! They are often uneasy in their seats, and even in a short one or two hours, they keep switching seats, squeezing in and out, making everyone stand up for you, and sometimes even enjoying the taste of being stepped on. Smoking in theaters has long been prohibited in Shanghai, but that day I saw with my own eyes a spectator with a cigarette in his hand. You see how leisurely he is, but it is in the dark, and the movie is playing.

Pig and Cow

### Fable

— Ge Ming

The people of Jiangnan huddled up in fur coats in the northwest wind. The cold clouds of the night fell tightly. The voices of the poor people demanding winter relief became more urgent and pitiful.

It is considered a matter of course for the rich to nourish themselves. Whether they are willing to relieve the suffering of the poor or shelter others from the cold is only clear to them. For a poor person like me, I have the will but not the power. I really don't know what to do. So I will tell a new Aesop's fable to offer to the rich.

That is the story of a pig and a cow. On this day, the pig complained to the cow, saying that it was really unpopular and didn't stand out. The pig said, "People always praise your generosity and kindness!" Then the pig went on and on: "That's right, you can be milked, and you can also be made into cheese, but my contribution is really more than yours! I give away meat, not to mention ham. In addition, I also give people bristles, and people also pickle my legs! But people are still not happy with me. A pig is always a pig in the end. What is the reason for this?"

The cow thought for a while at this time and replied: "That may be because I contribute everything I have while I am alive, which is completely different from your style."

After reading the above story, I don't know if you (as a human being) have also thought about it. Many people, while alive, are stingy. Apart from consuming or seizing some of the things that originally existed in the world, they have never produced, increased, contributed, or given anything. With a "wisdom" that may not be above the wisdom of pigs, even before death, they pretend to be generous and passionate. I think their fate is often more destructive than praiseworthy, and more failures than achievements, and they are only exhausted physically and mentally.

### Stop Profiteering: Set Up Ticket Offices

— Hesong

It has been two weeks since the tram fare increased. The tram company's reason for requesting a fare increase, in addition to "high prices," also included the losses caused by "soldiers riding without tickets." Some people say that as long as the tram conductors don't profiteer and hand over all the ticket money to the company, the company can increase its income. It is a "well-known fact" that conductors profiteer. I hope the tram company can find a way to eliminate this situation. I would like to make a suggestion to the tram company.

Conductors profiteer by not giving change and not giving tickets. These two methods are mostly used when the passengers are crowded, because no one wants to make too much trouble when it is crowded.

It is probably impossible to avoid crowding at present. There are too many people in Shanghai. But the reason why conductors can cheat is entirely because they handle money. The only way to prevent them from handling money is not to sell tickets on the tram. I suggest that ticket offices be set up at major stations to sell tickets all day long. In this way, everyone has enough time to buy tickets, and the conductors will have no way to cheat.

Moreover, if this is done, there only needs to be one manager on each tram, unlike now where one person is in charge of the door and one person sells tickets. The company can save a sum of money. Wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone?

When a ticket seller works in a tram full of people, the frustration of the conductor is conceivable, and the passengers will also feel extremely unpleasant. What's more, this kind of profiteering often happens? For the sake of passengers and for the company itself, I hope the tram company can try "off-tram ticketing"! Before American-made automatic ticket vending machines are used in our country, this may not be a good method.

Understatement
— Fang Wen

### Somewhat Gratifying

The Chinese people lament that they are backward in everything. Only in the traffic system, from driving on the left to driving on the right, have they finally caught up with modern European and American countries.

### Twelve Provinces

More than half of the Taiwanese twelve zodiac bandit gang has been captured. The Shanghai scalpers, who profit like tigers, have long been targeted. Recently, wild chickens have been eliminated by drawing lots, and water rats have also been paraded through the streets.

Twelve zodiac signs, Taiwan and Shanghai, share the same fate.

### Adding a Lot of Color

Banning street vendors and beautifying the city has resulted in beautifying the city with banana peels and chestnut shells all over the street, as well as beggar women lying on the cement along the street, hugging broken cotton and catching lice, adding a lot of color to the city!

### Reversal of Extremes

Maritime commerce has always followed the formula of "big fish eat small fish, small fish eat shrimp," with department stores overwhelming large stores, large stores overwhelming small businesses, and small businesses overwhelming small stalls.

Now everything has changed. The united markets of vendor concentration camps are cheap and of good quality, and the doors are crowded like a marketplace. Department stores are instead "deserted and lonely." Sixty years of feng shui turns around and cannot escape the law of reversal of extremes.

### Discussing the Draft Constitution: Talking about Dr. Wang Chonghui

— Chunfu

The National Assembly has been convened in Nanjing for more than ten days. The amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China, which is related to China's century-long plan, will be submitted to the National Assembly for deliberation and approval. The person who organized this draft constitution is Dr. Wang Chonghui, who is mentioned here.

Regarding the content of the new draft constitution, Wang said to our reporter on the 25th of this month: It was drafted based on the principles of the Political Consultative Conference and compromises the opinions of all parties. The new system is a new system between the presidential system and the cabinet system. We can probably remember that Wang has always had unique attainments in constitutional law. In the first year of the Republic of China, when the Nanjing Provisional Government was established, Wang served as the first Minister of Foreign Affairs and wrote "A Preliminary Draft of the Constitution of the Republic of China," which attracted the attention of Chinese and foreigners.

Wang is a world-famous jurist and a senior veteran in the diplomatic world. He has served as a judge of the Hague International Court of Justice twice, and has served as Minister of Justice and Foreign Affairs in China.

Wang's courtesy name is Liangju. He is from Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, and is from the same village as Jiang Guangnai. His father, Yuchu, was an old pastor with a strong Taoist spirit, and he was an old friend of Sun Yat-sen, Chen Shaobai, and Qu Fengchi. Wang studied at Queen's College in Hong Kong in his youth. He was intelligent and often debated religious principles with his father, incurring his father's wrath. He fled to Shanghai to work as a teacher at Nanyang Public School. He then graduated from Beiyang University, studied in the United States, and majored in law, earning a doctorate in law from Yale University. Soon after, he obtained the qualifications of a British lawyer in England and practiced law. Wang was the first Chinese to practice law in a foreign country.

Wang also has a connection with the revolution. As early as before the establishment of the Tongmenghui, Wang, in Tokyo, co-organized the "National Newspaper" with Shen Xiangyun, Qin Lishan, and Ji Zhi, advocating nationalism and promoting the revolution. At that time, Wang was responsible for writing the English section. In the thirty-first year of Guangxu, Sun Yat-sen arrived in New York, and Wang was also in Philadelphia, USA, promoting the revolution. Sun Yat-sen wrote to Wang, asking him to meet in New York to discuss the way forward. At that time, he published an important document in the history of the Chinese revolution—a declaration to the outside world.

When the Nanjing Provisional Government was established, Wang served as the first Minister of Foreign Affairs. During the Shao Yi cabinet, he transferred to Minister of Justice. Because he opposed Yuan Shikai's policies, he resigned at the same time as the Kuomintang cabinet members. At that time, Sun Yat-sen established the Railway Corporation in Shanghai and was hired as a consultant. Later, he also served as the Minister of Justice in the Lushi Yi cabinet and the Minister of Education in the Tang Shaoyi cabinet, and once served as the acting Prime Minister, organizing a "good people cabinet."

The Chinese diplomatic community is indeed bound to the surname Wang. Wang Chonghui, Wang Zhengting, and Wang Shijie have all served as Ministers of Foreign Affairs. Wang Chonghui succeeded Zhang Qun as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the 26th year of the Republic of China. At that time, foreign insults were imminent. Wang relied on his touted "three no's"—no pushing, no perfunctory, no fear of difficulty—and achieved considerable success. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Japanese side repeatedly spread rumors and divisions, saying that Wang was "dissatisfied with the party and government" and "determined to leave," and babbled wildly in the pseudo-"Xin Shen Bao."

Wang is good at rhetoric. It is still remembered that before the 21st year of the Republic of China, China was still in a state of division. At the conference convened by the League of Nations, Wang Chonghui represented the Nanjing National Government. At that time, a representative of a certain country asked Wang: "Does the government you represent represent the central government of your country? Or does it represent the southwest government of your country?" This question was undoubtedly a manifestation of the Westerners' contempt for China, but our Dr. Wang leisurely replied to this rude questioner: "What I represent is the government of our country recognized by the world." In the end, just as Wang hoped, we also hope that "the new constitution can satisfy the majority of the people!"
