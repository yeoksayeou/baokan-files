### Shao Lizi Expresses His Opinion: The Constitution Draft Must Conform to the Five-Power Constitution; All Parties Hope to Abandon Preconceived Notions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The ninth general assembly of the National Assembly was held in the morning. The speeches of the representatives are recorded as follows:

Yao Qinru: This constitution draft has been revised based on the opinions of all parties and can be said to have been carefully considered. However, the provisions related to the welfare of the people are still too brief, especially regarding the two points of economy and education, which have not been fully enumerated. There are only five articles related to the economy and only three related to education in the entire constitution draft, which is inevitably a case of missing the forest for the trees. I believe that the development of the economic system, the development of educational goals and systems, and the relief of out-of-school youth and children should all be included in the constitution. The founding father once said: "The first priority of construction is the national economy and the people's livelihood. If education is not cultivated, there is no point in talking about people's livelihood." Therefore, basic national policies for economy and education should be stipulated in detail in separate chapters to ensure long-term stability and prosperity of the country.

Lin Li: The representatives have rarely expressed their opinions on the two points of nationalization of the military and democratization of politics. I would like to briefly express my views on the basic national policy: the so-called national defense must also include the nationalization of the military. I would like to briefly outline it as follows: (1) Civilian and military separation, which is stipulated in Articles 134, (2) Separation of the military from political parties, (3) Conscription system, (4) Security for the appointment and removal of military officers, (5) In the current atomic age, attention should be paid to scientific national defense.

Huang Zhengqing: According to Article 5 of Chapter 1, which stipulates that all ethnic groups in the Republic of China are equal, the so-called equality should naturally include rights and obligations, so that they have equal opportunities. However, the constitution draft still fails to broadly include the status and rights of ethnic minorities in the border areas, which is a pity. The Tibet mentioned therein usually refers to Rear Tibet. In fact, the provinces of Sichuan, Qinghai, and Kang also have Tibetan populations totaling more than four million. They have their own types of culture, economy, belief, and habits. However, the constitution draft does not clearly stipulate provisions for the border residents scattered outside Tibet. Moreover, within the so-called Tibetan region, they cannot compete with other ethnic groups in the provinces concerned. Therefore, if the constitution draft does not clearly stipulate the national assembly representatives they should elect, their rights will undoubtedly be deprived. Sun Yat-sen said in the Outline of National Construction: "We should support all small ethnic groups in the country so that they can self-determine and self-govern." Based on the above reasons, we cannot allow the rights of the Tibetan people, who occupy such a vast area of the country, to be ignored, and hope that the constitution will not have this shortcoming.

Wu Chunwu: A perfect constitution must stipulate the welfare regulations related to the people. We should observe two phenomena in the current society: (1) widespread corruption, and (2) continuous soaring prices. I believe that the reason lies in the lack of restrictions on private property, the national property is declining, and private individuals are generally poor and corrupt. Therefore, I believe that private property must be restricted so that the state can effectively implement capital control and equalization of land ownership.

Li Zonghuang: In this constitution draft, regarding the chapter on the provincial and county systems, I believe that the power of the province is too high and the power of the county is lowered, which should be remedied. The method can stipulate that the county and city are autonomous units, with the county as the main body of autonomy. Conversely, the province is not an autonomous unit, nor is it the main body of autonomy. This provision can stabilize the national politics, and the constitution will not fail.

Shao Lizi: I have many thoughts, but I am not sure whether I can finish speaking due to time constraints:

(1) I advocate supporting the system and spirit of the Five-Power Constitution. This is a basic principle that cannot be violated. The spirit of the Five-Power Constitution that the Premier said lies in the division of powers and functions. What the people hope for is an omnipotent government, but it cannot be achieved suddenly and must have certain conditions. The United States has a presidential system, the United Kingdom has a cabinet system, and France also has a presidential system, but it is different from the United States. Therefore, although they are all three-power systems, they have mutual differences. Our constitution is naturally different from the three powers. I participated in the CPPCC and the Constitution Draft Review Committee and felt that the success of the Premier's doctrine, that is, the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, cannot be separated. During the discussion of the constitution draft, if you have good opinions, you can also modify it, but it must be made to conform to the Five-Power Constitution.

(2) Many representatives emphasized that the interests of the people should be above those of the parties. You should know that the parties are not outside the people. I represent the Kuomintang and say that the Kuomintang has not left the people, nor has it deviated from the scope of the people. The Premier said, "Pioneers for the people." The Kuomintang is the pioneer for the people and, of course, cannot deviate from the people. Other parties are also within the scope of the people and should also be the pioneers for the people. We respect our own party and also respect other parties. I hope that everyone will abandon preconceived notions. The more restrictions on parties in the constitution draft, the more inappropriate it is. During the CPPCC meeting, all parties abandoned their own prejudices for the interests of the people. I hope that this discussion of the constitution draft, regardless of which unit each representative comes from, can also consider the wishes of the people.

(3) Regarding the section on basic national policies, I absolutely agree with the foreign affairs part. What we need is independent and autonomous diplomacy. Regarding the United Nations Charter, some people think that it must be deleted. I think it is unnecessary because it is the lofty ideal of the late President Roosevelt of the United States, and our country's leaders also signed it. We don't have to think of it as temporary. We should support it and make other countries in the world support it as well.

(4) Regarding elections, if a general election is conducted, those who have not participated in the public office candidate examination cannot participate. According to our country's social customs, it will make many virtuous people give up their right to vote and be elected because they are unwilling to participate in the exam. This seems to be a loss. According to the constitution, the test committee should be elected by the people. Candidates for public office in various counties have not yet been produced, so where does the Examination Yuan come from? Therefore, we can only wait for the future on this matter and hope that the representatives will seriously consider it.

### Minister Peng Announces at Reception: National Government Executive Yuan to be Reorganized; Figures from All Parties Expected to Participate

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department announced at a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters on the afternoon of the 5th that the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan will be reorganized in the near future, and party leaders and non-party figures are expected to participate. Peng made this statement in response to a reporter's question: "There have been rumors recently that the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan will be reorganized. What stage has this reached? Will all parties participate?" In addition, there are other important questions and answers as follows:

Question: What is the military and political situation in Dalian and Lushun? Does the Chinese Navy intend to enter Lushun? Has the National Army entered Dalian? Can the minister give us details?

Answer: Recent reports in various newspapers that the National Army is advancing to Dalian and the Navy is heading to Lushun are not true.

Question: Where is Okamura Yasuji now? Today's repatriation is over. Is he still serving the government?

Answer: Okamura is still assisting in the repatriation of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war who have not yet been sent back as a liaison officer because there are still some Japanese nationals and technical personnel retained in China, and some Japanese war criminals who have been acquitted should also be repatriated. There are still some Japanese prisoners of war in the Communist area.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The issue of the reorganization of the National Government has not yet surfaced because it is currently busy with constitution-making, but the government is preparing to proceed. As for the Social Democratic Party's participation in the government, according to its consistent statement, it prioritizes constitution-making and then participation in the government. There has been no change at present. It is reported that Li Daming, one of the leaders of the party, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and will come to Nanjing soon to attend the National Assembly. The government will invite him to discuss the reorganization of the government. Jiang Yuntian went to Shanghai by night train on the 5th and will return to Nanjing in a few days.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] It was recently learned from reliable sources that the Xinjiang representatives did not submit any written proposals to the government, and will not do so in the near future. The rumors are not credible.

### Li Zongren Recuperating in Nanjing; Rumors of Resignation Completely Untrue

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Regarding the rumors from Beiping, Xiao Yishan, Secretary-General of the Parallel Executive Headquarters, told a Central News Agency reporter that the rumors were completely untrue. Director Li has been recuperating for the past two days due to a recurrence of stomach problems, which prevented him from attending the National Assembly. He will fly to Beiping as soon as his health recovers.

### Liu Chunyi's Funeral; Madame Chiang Presides

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The remains of Liu Chunyi, a female representative to the National Assembly, were buried at the China Funeral Home at 2:00 PM on the 5th. Hundreds of representatives attended. Madame Chiang personally presided over the ceremony, with Yu Youren and others accompanying her. Madame Chiang looked sorrowful, and many female representatives wept.

### Review of Representative Qualifications; Three Methods Decided; Review Began in Nineteen Groups Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The National Assembly Representative Qualification Review Committee reviewed the qualifications in nineteen groups in the Second Rest Room of the National Assembly Hall at 8:30 PM this afternoon. Representative Zhang Lisheng, the convener, reported three review methods: (1) Representatives who have not submitted their election certificates should be notified by the Secretariat to submit them. (2) If the election certificate is lost, two representatives from the same unit should be asked to prove it. (3) Selected representatives and representatives from various parties should ask the Election General Office to prove their qualifications. The groups then began the review, which lasted two hours. As a result, it was found that a majority of representatives had not renewed their election certificates, and they were notified to submit them separately.

### "Peace Elder" Well Received; Gleanings from the Ninth National Assembly

— Our Reporter Zhang Ming

Peace Elder Shao Lizi's seat number is 456, a very auspicious number. He had been silent since the meeting began, but on the afternoon of the 5th, he finally got the opportunity. As soon as he walked onto the platform, applause burst out below.

The Peace Elder began with an introduction, saying: "I have many thoughts, but I am afraid that I will not be able to finish speaking due to time constraints. I am not sure." But it was too long after all. Chairman Zhang Ji repeatedly rang the bell, but the ringing of the bell was the law, and his face was smiling, which was not without human touch. So the Peace Elder asked to continue speaking and asked, "Is it okay?" Old Zhang did not answer, but applause burst out from below like a string of firecrackers, and people shouted "Good!"

Old Kong Geng ran onto the stage during the speech of a certain representative, tilted his head and wrote on the table. After a while, he realized that it was a poem he had written last night after listening to the speeches of the Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party. It is now recorded as follows: "The Youth and Social Democrats speak like rivers, the Youth Party's voices are particularly loud, the only great view is the theory of power and ability, the Founding Father's last words (omitted), the national anthem." Below is signed "Occasional feeling on the pillow."

There are too few reporter seats, and some reporters were squeezed out. They had no choice but to sit in the representative seats. Someone joked: "Reporters are obviously one level higher than representatives because reporters were squeezed out of their seats and became representatives."

A certain delegation left its seat for a while and did not receive the documents that should have been received. They were very angry and called the staff in the venue. However, there were too few staff members to be assigned. A certain representative immediately slapped the table and accused them. A certain staff member said very politely, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry." Fortunately, the "case" was not a public case, so the slap was not loud.

For the issue of "stopping extensive discussions," Zhang used lightning-fast methods and immediately put it to a vote. Although some people shouted that they did not hear it, the voting machines already had points of light.

A certain representative did not call him, so he walked onto the podium by himself, but did not speak. The chairman was already processing other issues. In the end, he did not get an order and walked down alone. The reporter said that this is autonomy, self-government, and self-awareness. He went up by himself, did not speak on his own, and consciously walked down the stage.

The female representative Liu Chunyi died, and Chiang Soong Mei-ling, as a female representative, also sent a wreath.

Some people are keeping records of the actions of the "National Assembly Flower," such as yesterday's hair was combed into oil curls, today's hair is combed into oily strips, the coat started wearing white, now it is black, and they are frequently studying her words and deeds. Each representative's special fee is 500,000 national currency, which is issued early in the morning. The representatives rush to receive it. They are all brand new linked bills. Someone asked what level the month's currency had depreciated to. Yu Huizi arrived early and requested Bao's calligraphy. He wrote very quickly. Those who requested included representatives, reporters, and staff in the venue. Everyone was happy.

### Hu Shih Says "Will Never Form a Party" and Has Not Learned "White House Techniques"

Hu Shih solemnly denied at a press conference at the Central Propaganda Department on the afternoon of the 5th that he would form a party and declared that he did not intend to publish magazines in the short term. Hu did not avoid answering the above two questions. After the reporter who raised the question asked again, he said: "I, Hu Shih, will never run a party. You can believe that my interests are now mostly in non-political aspects, in other words, in academic aspects. I have no intention of running a party, nor do I have the time to form a party." As for whether "Independent Review" will be republished or whether other magazines will be published, Hu replied: After the September 18th Incident, I gathered twelve like-minded people and raised 5,000 yuan to run an Independent Review, which was published for five years and published 1,400 manuscripts without paying a penny of manuscript fees. It can be said that it has achieved true "independence." However, in today's world, independence is not easy because the professors who write the articles are now very poor, and they care about every grain of rice. It is impossible to give a small manuscript without paying. In addition, the current paper costs and printing costs are very expensive. After considering various aspects, I have no intention of starting a magazine.

Dr. Hu Shih, a member of the National Assembly Presidium, publicly received Chinese and foreign reporters at the invitation of Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department on the afternoon of the 5th. The reception was held in the exhibition room of Chen Shuren's painting exhibition at the Public Friendship Association. Some men and women who visited the painting exhibition admired Hu's reputation and stood around to watch, all wanting to see Hu's demeanor.

At the reception, Hu first said that his wife had lived in Washington for four years, but unfortunately, she did not have the opportunity to participate in the bi-weekly press conferences held at the White House, so she had never learned the "techniques" to deal with it. Today, he met with reporters as "a student studying the constitution draft." (December 5th)

### Era of Flying Fortresses and Atomic Bombs; Location of National Capital Has No North or South; Hu Shih Says Constitution Draft Can Be Passed Smoothly

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Hu Shih, one of the members of the National Assembly Presidium, attended a press conference at the Central Propaganda Department on the afternoon of the 5th and answered various questions about the constitution draft and the National Assembly. His remarks, both solemn and humorous, won a lot of laughter from more than 200 Chinese and foreign reporters. After Minister Peng gave a brief introduction, Hu stood up and made a humble self-introduction, saying that he was willing to answer questions based on what he knew at today's press conference, but because he had not participated in the CPPCC and the subsequent Constitution Draft Review Committee, he only answered questions as a student studying the constitution. Someone specifically mentioned that National Government Chairman Chiang gave him a constitution draft at the National Assembly. In fact, this was only a historical coincidence because he was the chairman that day and there was no deep meaning. When answering questions, Hu said that it was difficult to say what kind of decision the National Assembly would make on the constitution draft in the end. In his personal opinion, the constitution draft was generally expected to be passed and there would not be any major or fundamental revisions. Judging from the mood of the assembly in recent days, it can be seen that the participants oppose any control or restraint. The assembly has the power and will be more perfect. However, if analyzed calmly, it can be seen that this constitution draft is generally reasonable and modern. It is the result of a long period of discussion by parties and non-party figures, so there will not be any fundamental changes. Someone asked during the assembly's extensive discussions that some representatives believed that this constitution draft was a party's constitution and not a people's constitution. Hu said, this question can be answered by Mr. Shao Lizi's speech at the National Assembly this morning. Shao said that because this constitution draft was drafted by all parties, it cannot be said to be the constitution of one party, but is a true representative of the people's interests. This point is very correct. Regarding the position of the Legislative and Supervisory Committee as representatives of the National Assembly, Hu also believes that the two should not be national assembly representatives at the same time, and believes that this provision may be deleted in the future. Regarding the issue of the national capital, Hu believes that in this era of flying fortresses and atomic bombs, any location can be the national capital and is not suitable as the national capital. Historical views no longer apply today. When a reporter asked where Hu would support when the National Assembly voted on where the capital should be located, Hu, holding the constitution draft, replied in a humorous tone that according to Article 128, voting should be conducted by secret ballot. Therefore, I have the right not to tell you. After speaking, everyone laughed. A reporter mentioned that some representatives believed that there was too much capitalism in the constitution draft. Hu did not think so. He pointed out that in the five articles from Article 138 to 142 of the Basic National Policy, only the first half of "141" "The state should protect private wealth and private enterprises" can refer to this statement, but the other four and a half articles can be said to be socialist thought. In fact, even the Communist Party does not deny the need to protect private wealth, so it cannot be said that there is too much capitalism. Regarding the assembly's schedule, Hu believes that if it cannot be concluded after being extended to December 19, it may be extended again. When the assembly will reopen depends on the review situation. If one or two groups have completed the review, the assembly can be convened. He believes that the chapter on people's rights and obligations has fewer problems. After review, it may be submitted to the assembly for a public decision immediately. As for the fact that the review meeting will be held in secret and reporters cannot participate, on the one hand, it is because there are too few houses and it is difficult to accommodate everyone, and on the other hand, it is because of this. Later participants can specifically discuss and carefully consider the articles so as not to compete with each other in order to gain the attention of the audience. He cited the non-publicity of the Philadelphia Constitution Conference in the United States as an example.

### National Assembly Women Representatives Will Fight for Women's Rights; Prepare to Form a National Organization

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The women representatives of the National Assembly have decided to launch a National Women's Representative Congress after the National Assembly closes, unite women compatriots across the country, and organize a national organization to fight for the development of women's rights.

### Mr. Stuart Continues to Work on Peace Talks; Mr. Yu Dawei Has Conveyed the Government's Opinion

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] It is reported that Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart are still working on peace talks. It is reported that Special Envoy Marshall has submitted a memorandum to the government, but has not received a formal response from the government. Yu Dawei visited Special Envoy Marshall on the 4th, and it may have been to convey the government's opinion to Special Envoy Marshall. At 10:00 AM on the morning of the 5th, Special Envoy Marshall visited Stuart for a long talk. At 7:00 PM, Special Envoy Marshall also invited Madame Chiang to dinner at his residence. Stuart and his advisor Chuan Jingbi went out at 6:00 PM and had not returned to the embassy by 9:00 PM. Observers believe that, according to President Truman's recent statement, Special Envoy Marshall may not return to his country for the time being.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 5th] Minister of the Interior Zhang Lisheng told our reporter today that peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will not resume immediately because the resumption of talks depends on the disputing parties. It is reported that the Communist Party recently demanded the dissolution of the National Assembly, which is absolutely unacceptable to the government.

### Kirk Arrives in Shanghai and Announces to Reporters: 4,000 American Troops to Withdraw Soon; Five U.S. Senators Arrive in Shanghai This Afternoon

[Report from Our Newspaper] Admiral Kirk, Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Qingdao. At 4 p.m., he hosted a reception for reporters at the Cathay Hotel, stating that approximately 4,000 U.S. Marines from the Seventh Regiment and Navy personnel stationed along the railway line and coal mining areas from Qinhuangdao to Tianjin and Tanggu to Beidaihe would withdraw back to the United States in the near future. The number of Marines remaining in China and the question of their stay will be discussed in its entirety at the United Nations Security Council and will be announced by the council in the future.

The U.S. established a consulate in Dalian several months ago, protected by the U.S. Navy, but communication there was poor. On November 20, Admiral Kirk led several consulate staff members on a small landing craft, carrying supplies and communication equipment for the consulate staff. He stayed there for less than two days and paid a return visit to Soviet Brigadier General Zogov. A reporter asked whether Zogov's presence in Dalian proved that Soviet troops were stationed there. Admiral Kirk replied, "There are some troops there." Kirk also said, "I don't believe Dalian is currently under the control of the Chinese Communists, but depending on the situation, it may be under Soviet control." There are currently about 5,000 Japanese troops in Dalian awaiting repatriation, and ships will be dispatched from General MacArthur's headquarters in Japan to transport them.

Admiral Kirk also reported that the U.S. Marines and local Americans in Qingdao jointly run a small school that admits not only the children of U.S. military families, but also children from other countries. There are a total of 160 students, about half of whom are American, and 11 are Chinese. There are also children from more than ten other countries, including England, the Soviet Union, France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Spain, and Korea. The school has an excellent organization, with a self-elected student council chairman, and publishes a school newspaper. Each person pays US$20 per month. The school has now been expanded into a middle school. Marshal Marshall and others recently visited the school and praised it highly.

Kirk also said that five U.S. Senators, including Isak, Brewster, Brewster, Hurley, and Mansfield, will arrive in Shanghai at 11:30 a.m. today for a two-day stay and will host a reception for reporters this afternoon.

### Ye Gongchao Discusses Shenzhen Incident: We Negotiate Compensation with Britain; Yunnan-Burma Border Issue Remains Unresolved

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Foreign Ministry spokesman Ye Gongchao announced at a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters this afternoon that after the Shenzhen incident, we sent a letter and telegram to our embassy in the UK, and negotiated with the British embassy here at 8:30 last night. At the same time, the British government in the area has also instructed the garrison to apologize to us, and the two sides are currently negotiating compensation issues. The facts are not yet very clear, and an investigation of the relevant facts is underway to determine countermeasures.

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] At today's afternoon press conference, a reporter asked about the undemarcated Yunnan-Burma border and the South African federal government's land policy discriminating against overseas Chinese. Foreign Ministry spokesman Ye Gongchao answered that there are two sections of the undemarcated Yunnan-Burma border. In the southern section, China and the UK exchanged notes on June 18, 1941, to determine the longitude and latitude, but boundary markers have not yet been erected. In the northern section, the two countries have not discussed the border line in detail. Regarding the undemarcated border, the two countries had initial discussions before the outbreak of the Pacific War, but these were stopped after the Pearl Harbor incident. Regarding the South African land policy, our country attaches great importance to it. In principle, our government opposes any racial discrimination, and this policy has caused our overseas Chinese residing there to suffer economic oppression. Therefore, we have repeatedly instructed our Consul General in Cape Town, South Africa, to make representations on this matter. However, we are only concerned with the aspects of the policy that affect our overseas Chinese, and we have no opinion on the aspects of the policy that involve South Africa's internal affairs.

### British Trade Delegation Visits Guilin, Returns to Guangzhou on the Same Day by Original Plane

[Report from Our Newspaper, Guilin, 5th] A British trade delegation of twelve people flew from Guangzhou to Guilin on the morning of the 5th, met with Chairman Huang, and after attending a banquet hosted by Chairman Huang at noon, left the provincial capital at 2:30 p.m. on the original plane and returned to Guangzhou to transfer to Hong Kong to return to their country.

[United Press, Guangzhou, 5th] Bowers, head of the British trade delegation to China, told our reporter today that Britain hopes to purchase large quantities of soybeans from the nine eastern provinces of China to manufacture margarine, which is in great demand in Britain. Once the port of Dalian is opened to international shipping, purchases can begin. The inflow of American goods into China does not affect British trade, for two reasons: (1) Britain does not have the capacity to supply a large batch of goods at this time, and (2) the Chinese market is vast and can accommodate trade from both the U.S. and Britain.

### British Resident Commissioner in Penang Awards Certificates of Appreciation to Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, Penang, 4th Dispatch] The British Resident Commissioner in Penang, Mr. King, today awarded certificates of highest appreciation to seven local overseas Chinese, one Malay lumber worker, and one Malay and one Chinese from Wellesley in his office for providing food and other assistance to the Allied forces during the Japanese occupation.

### Chinese Communist Party Extraordinary Committee Bitterly Criticizes Mao Zedong, Issues Letter to All Party Comrades, Advocating the Launching of Anti-Maoism

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] The Central Extraordinary Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued a lead-printed "Letter to All Party Comrades on the Current Urgent Situation," advocating: (1) Immediately dismiss the external delegation led by Zhou Enlai and dominated by Mao Zedong's followers. (2) Each liberated area should elect cadres of all colors from anti-Mao Zedongist party, government, military, civilian, and academic circles as representatives to the National Assembly. (3) Reorganize party organizations at all levels to launch the struggle against Mao Zedongism, anti-warlordism, and anti-military opportunism and the revolution. (4) From bottom to top, strictly reorganize all existing troops and the people's armed forces in the liberated areas. The letter bitterly criticized Mao Zedong's bureaucratic leadership, which still makes the party's policies wander in the mire of opportunism, saying that Mao's fundamental mistake lies in misjudging the current revolutionary situation in China, so that narrow theories replace the revolutionary views of Marxism-Leninism. On the other hand, he overestimated his own armed forces. It also said: the excessive left-leaning tendency in land policy, the massacre of rich peasants, and the shaking of the middle peasants caused the masses in the liberated areas to disperse, objectively helping the Kuomintang's offensive against the liberated areas. In propaganda, the over-radical anti-American slogans were put forward, and they did not know how to win assistance but instead set up enemies everywhere. Therefore, the guiding ideology of Zedongism is a new Li San line that is more than enough to make.

### Communist Troops Inside and Outside Shanhaiguan Are Short of Food and Ammunition, Military Morale Wavering, Many Surrender; CCP Central Committee Decides on New Policies to Reverse the Decline

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th] A military strategist from outside Shanhaiguan said: Although the Communist troops have recently launched offensives in various places, their strength is very weak. After the Communist troops outside Shanhaiguan were driven to Northern Manchuria, they faced extreme difficulties in supplies, suffered from hunger and cold, competed with the people for food, and were unable to fight, let alone counterattack. As for the Communist troops inside Shanhaiguan, because ammunition cannot be replenished from outside Shanhaiguan, materials cannot be exchanged, and the original rich areas they occupied, as well as areas in Zhangjiakou, Huailai, and Eastern Shandong with mineral deposits and ordnance factory equipment, have all been recovered by the National troops and cannot be used. They now mostly use homemade weapons to fight, which is difficult to resist the National troops. The Communist troops fled to the barren mountains, separated from production, with no hope of resupply, and do not know how many years they will be displaced, so their military morale is wavering, and their resentment towards the war is increasing. The number of people who bring weapons back to the National troops to surrender is increasing day by day. The Communist Party's long-term rebellion plan is probably impossible in modern tactics.

[Report from Our Newspaper, Hankou, 5th] Huang Zaixing, a senior cadre of the former Communist troop Luo Houfu, recently announced his surrender and has been sent back to his hometown by the government.

(3) In terms of administration, expand the scope of settling accounts and turning over, firmly grasp the countryside, and lay the foundation for rural administration in each district.

Editorial

### Sino-British Commercial Treaty and Hong Kong Kowloon

The British commercial delegation has been in China for two months to investigate the actual situation in various places, which will greatly contribute to the promotion of trade between China and Britain. According to our newspaper's Nanjing telegram yesterday, we learned that the draft of the Sino-British commercial treaty has been submitted by the British Embassy in China, and negotiations are expected to begin soon. The people of the whole country have high hopes for this. It is generally believed that the relationship between China and Britain has always been close, and during the war, the two countries fought side by side and struggled together against aggression, and their friendship has been tempered by blood and become more solid. Therefore, after the end of the war, the Chinese people hoped that Britain would change its past imperialist approach to China and resolutely return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China in order to heal the rift between the people of the two countries and wipe out the stain on the diplomatic history of China and Britain. However, the British authorities have not yet made a clear statement on this matter, and their reluctance to let go is obvious, which has long caused deep dissatisfaction among the Chinese people. Recently, upon hearing the news that China and Britain are about to start commercial negotiations, everyone hopes that the government can raise the demand for the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon during the negotiation process. The Shanghai Municipal Council had already made a resolution on demanding the government to recover Hong Kong and Kowloon. In recent days, general public organizations have also sent telegrams to the diplomatic authorities to contribute their opinions, and some even advocate that the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon should be a prerequisite for the conclusion of a Sino-British commercial treaty.

At this time when the people of the whole country are expecting a new page in Sino-British relations, it is suddenly heard that British troops suddenly invaded Shenzhen from Kowloon, shooting and killing our compatriots, killing a villager on the spot. Although the government has lodged a strong protest with the Hong Kong authorities and has obtained a verbal apology from the Hong Kong Garrison Commander, the British army's act of infringing upon our country's territorial sovereignty and harming the lives of our people is indeed enough to arouse the anger of the Chinese people. Its impact will not only affect the future Sino-British relations, but also directly suffer its adverse impact on the upcoming Sino-British commercial treaty negotiations. British diplomats are known to the world for their long-term vision, but it is puzzling that they insist on clinging to Hong Kong and Kowloon, which are detrimental to Sino-British relations, and refuse to let go.

The unequal treaties previously signed between China and various countries began with the Treaty of Nanjing after the Opium War, and the cession of Hong Kong to Britain was the product of the Treaty of Nanjing. Therefore, our country's abolition of unequal treaties and the recovery of ceded lands and concessions should begin with the recovery of Hong Kong. In 1943, all unequal treaties between China and Britain were abolished, but the British government still refused to return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China, which has long caused deep dissatisfaction among the Chinese people. Even the great politicians and diplomats of various countries consider it unwise for Britain to adopt this attitude. According to the fact that during the war, the heads of state of China, Britain, and the United States met in Cairo to discuss the century-old plan for the Far East, they also unanimously agreed in principle to return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China. The late US President Roosevelt promised to uphold justice on this matter; however, after the end of the war, Britain still refused to let go, and American congressmen also criticized Britain for refusing to give up Hong Kong and Kowloon. The British authorities were forced to adopt a delaying policy and issued an ambiguous statement: "Once the time is ripe, negotiations will be held with China to discuss the return of Hong Kong." Therefore, the Hong Kong and Kowloon issue has become an outstanding issue between China and Britain.

The British government and the public have many complaints about the recently concluded Sino-American commercial treaty and are deeply anxious about the increasingly declining position of Britain in China. Therefore, they urgently hope that the Sino-British commercial treaty can be concluded as soon as possible. We can fully understand and sympathize with their distress and anxiety. Because post-war China needs peace and prosperity, it does not want to discriminate against or differentiate between any of the great powers, whether it is Britain, the United States, France, or the Soviet Union; and it is willing to conclude commercial treaties with various countries separately on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. However, we must also make the British government and the public understand our country's national aspirations for Hong Kong and Kowloon. Our newspaper editorials have repeatedly pointed out that the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon is the unanimous desire of our people. If Britain cannot satisfy our national aspirations, the stain on Sino-British relations cannot be wiped out, and there is no hope of turning a new page in the diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Leaving aside political reasons and considering economic factors, Britain should also return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China. The only goal of negotiating the Sino-British commercial treaty is to promote trade between China and Britain, but how to increase the volume of trade between the two countries? The first step is the economic recovery and prosperity of China. However, the special status of Hong Kong has always been a major obstacle to China's economic construction. To this day, it is still the source of smuggling, tax evasion, and foreign exchange evasion. In particular, including Hong Kong in the scope of foreign navigation will make it impossible for China's nascent shipping industry to ever rise. Therefore, if Britain does not return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China, Sino-British commercial negotiations will be impossible. The people of the whole country have such a view, and the wise diplomatic authorities will surely be able to see the advantages and disadvantages. Taking a step back, we are thinking about the British government, and Hong Kong and Kowloon should also be returned to China as soon as possible. Because as long as these two places are not returned to China, the rift between the people of China and Britain will not be healed, and misunderstandings and estrangement between the two countries will become deeper and deeper. Taking the situation in the past year as an example, in September this year, when our country established a government in Kowloon City, Hong Kong argued unreasonably and obstructed it, which aroused our country's protest. Last month, a tragic incident occurred in Hong Kong in which a policeman kicked and killed our compatriots, casting a shadow on the hearts of the Chinese people, who believe that today's British Labour government still maintains the imperialist style of the Conservative Party. Recently, British troops even crossed the border and shot and killed our compatriots, which has aroused the anger of the people of the whole country. Therefore, if Hong Kong and Kowloon are not returned to China, such unfortunate incidents will inevitably occur one after another, and the impact will not only prevent Sino-British relations from becoming closer, but also the feelings of the people of the two countries may deteriorate. We cannot help but worry about this.

Finally, we must once again say a word to the British government and the public: the decline of Britain's position in China is not due to competition among the great powers. Competition from other countries is not to be feared, but the most terrible thing is that Britain itself does not know how to eliminate the rift between the people of China and Britain. Britain clings to Hong Kong and Kowloon and refuses to let go, thinking that it is gaining an advantage. On the surface, it seems to be beneficial to Britain, but in reality, the price that Britain pays is unimaginable. Please, the wise Labour government, weigh the pros and cons and choose between Hong Kong and Kowloon and the Sino-British commercial treaty!

He also said that the county treasury is so tight that it is no wonder that Gu Wenxiang, the captain of the security brigade, reported to him that someone in the county government had 10 million yuan lent out at high interest rates. At that time, he instructed Captain Gu that he could not talk nonsense without concrete evidence. From this point of view, there is indeed a basis.

### Letter to the Editor

Having read "Local News Briefs" on page three of the first section of your newspaper dated November 27, 1946, I noticed the statement "Zhengyangguan News: The Huainan Mining Road Bureau established a textile business unit in the old cooperative in Beijie, selling Tianjia'an Huainan coal at only 120,000 yuan per ton."

### Indian Leaders Insist on Not Yielding, London Talks at an Impasse, Nehru States India's Destiny Should Be Decided by Indians

[This Newspaper] London, 5th Broadcast: Prime Minister Attlee, the Governor-General of India, Nehru, and Jinnah held separate talks today, but no results were achieved. Another round of talks are scheduled for tonight. According to well-informed sources, regardless of success or failure, Nehru is determined to fly back to India on Saturday. Relations between India and the Muslim League are not optimistic.

[Reuters, London, 5th] Today is one of the most important days for the talks between Indian leaders and British government officials. Although authorities in London are reluctant to disclose anything, according to the London correspondent of the New York Times, the talks have reached an impasse and there is no hope of success. The Indian Constituent Assembly is scheduled to open in New Delhi on Monday, but Jinnah still refuses to consider returning to the alliance, and Nehru is unwilling to make any concessions. The British side feels very discouraged about the situation in India. The date of the round table conference has not been announced to this day. London newspapers this morning carried a public speech by Nehru, stating that India's destiny should be decided by the Indians themselves; otherwise, there is no hope of solving all problems. Even well-intentioned interference from others will only make the situation more complicated. If there is outside interference, our attention will inevitably be diverted. Today, many Indians are unwilling to boldly face the facts that we must face, and they only seek help from outsiders. Therefore, the most important thing now is to make Indians understand that the real solution should be the responsibility of the Indians themselves, and if it fails, the consequences should also be borne by the Indians. Nehru also said that he will return to India in two or three days. What the results of this trip will be is still unknown. However, on this trip, he will see many old friends who are about to set off to return home. Tonight, Nehru will meet Professor Laski, a senior member of the Labor Party.

However, as of noon, no formal announcement has been made as to when the round table conference will be held. The Indian Constituent Assembly is scheduled to be held next Monday.

### Lewis Fined 10,000 Yuan, Protests Sentence, Determined to Appeal, Coal Supplies to France, Belgium, Italy, and Denmark Cut Off

[United Press, Washington, 4th] Federal Court Judge Goldsborough ruled today that UMW President Lewis was in contempt of the court's strike injunction and fined him $10,000, but exempted him from imprisonment. The UMW was fined $3.5 million. Defense lawyers declared their dissatisfaction and filed an appeal. The judge denounced the anthracite coal strike as a "horrendous event." If this threat is realized, it will cause Americans to suffer hunger, cold, and poverty, overthrow their government, and replace it with dictatorship. If a choice must be made between destroying the union and maintaining the country, the country should be given priority. The judge then issued a preliminary injunction to the union and Lewis. If the strike does not end quickly, there is a possibility of heavier punishment.

Lewis glared angrily at the judge, his facial muscles twitching. Lewis must post bond tomorrow, and the $3.5 million fine will be paid in fourteen days, averaging $250,000 per day. When the judge announced the sentence, he advised Lewis not to defy the law again. The defense lawyer shouted that this was a "heinous and abnormal punishment." Lewis retorted angrily in court, accusing government lawyers of lying, and the judge warned him. As a result of the coal strike, at least six European countries have had their American coal supplies cut off. France, Belgium, Italy, Denmark, and Switzerland are the most affected. Sweden, Norway, and Germany reported that there were no signs of industrial stagnation, but it is expected that difficulties will also increase if the coal strike does not end quickly. British officials are closely monitoring the situation, fearing that the prolonged strike will jeopardize Britain's already scarce supply. In the United States, the number of unemployed workers has increased to 570,000, including 400,000 striking miners. After the railways ban freight transport, the total number of unemployed will jump to 2 million within a week or ten days.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] The coal strike, with its disastrous consequences, has now entered its third week. Although the Federal Court has fined the UMW $3.5 million and threatened to re-prosecute Lewis and the UMW for contempt of the injunction and implement the Smith-Connally Act, the strike has been difficult to curb. Lewis is determined to suffer imprisonment or any other punishment rather than obey the court injunction or withdraw the union's termination of the government contract. Railway labor representatives called on the government and miners to stop the standoff and to have the President appoint a committee to find a solution. This call has not been responded to by the government or miners.

[United Press, New York, 5th] UMW national local leaders have denounced the Federal Court's fine as an attempt to destroy the coal miners' union. According to a presidential aide, President Truman's broadcast is under discussion, but no decision has been made yet.

### Molotov Adopts Compromising Attitude, Disarmament Proposal Passes in Principle, Handed Over to Twenty-Nation Committee to Draft Proposal

[This Newspaper, New York Correspondent, 5th Dispatch] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov recently stated in the UN Political Committee that the Soviet Union will not insist on veto power over the implementation of international disarmament, but the major powers should simultaneously reduce armaments in accordance with the Security Council's resolution. Molotov opposed signing an international treaty because it would be delayed and could not be implemented as soon as possible. Representatives of the United States and Britain unanimously welcomed this move by the Soviet Union. Observers speculate that the Soviet representative has received new instructions from Moscow after delaying this issue for two days, proving that the Soviet Union has changed its policy.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 4th] Discussions on the issue of world disarmament made some progress today. After listening to the arguments of British and American representatives against the use of veto power in disarmament matters, the UN Political Committee appointed a subcommittee to draft a joint disarmament draft. The subcommittee consists of twenty countries: China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Canada, India, Czechoslovakia, Panama, Norway, Mexico, Egypt, Brazil, Australia, Colombia, Belgium, Syria, Ukraine, and Argentina. Before passing this decision, Soviet representative Molotov made a new proposal, and American representative Connolly immediately welcomed this action by the Soviet Union. However, at the same time, he stated that the United States does not intend to accept Molotov's amendment at this time, but is willing to give it the most serious consideration. The United States still insists that the jurisdiction and credibility of the Atomic Energy Commission cannot be impaired and will continue to carry out its original tasks. British representative Shawcross stated that any disarmament proposal should be based on the following four principles: (1) Before the Atomic Energy Commission prepares its plan, the parts of the disarmament resolution concerning atomic energy should still be handled by the Atomic Energy Commission, and the UN General Assembly should not interfere with its work. (2) Disarmament should not be limited to only part of it. For example, although the manufacture of atomic bombs has been prohibited, other weapons with collective destructive power, such as rockets, have not been prohibited, which is absolutely unacceptable. The Atomic Energy Commission should complete its current work and propose a plan to control atomic energy. After this plan is universally accepted, it should be implemented simultaneously with the control methods of other large-scale destructive weapons. We believe that the control of atomic energy should be limited to eliminating the possibility of its use for war. We should also encourage the peaceful use of atomic energy. (3) Any disarmament system must have an immediate and effective control and inspection system. Therefore, all military information should be disclosed at the same time as the establishment of the inspection agency. (4) The work of this control and inspection agency should not be subject to the control of veto power, whether for existing or future inventions of new weapons. We believe that there should also be an agency for controlling future inventions of new weapons, because we believe that after the abolition of atomic bombs, scientists will inevitably strive to develop even more terrifying weapons. Therefore, there should be an international agency that is not restricted by veto power to deal with this situation at any time. Molotov then stated that he did not object to the atoms listed by Shawcross and was prepared to accept the US proposal as the basis for discussion, and at the same time hoped to accept the Soviet Union's amendment.

### Four Foreign Ministers Argue Over War Reparations

[This Newspaper, New York Correspondent, 5th Dispatch] The four powers' treaties with satellite countries are now stalled again. Molotov is waiting for new instructions from the Soviet government, while Bevin is preparing to return to England by ship on the 14th. The current difficulties delaying the signing of the treaty are two: (1) After everyone believed that the reparations issue had come to an end, Molotov raised new demands. Molotov argued that Italy should pay Albania $10 million in compensation, but the Paris Conference had already rejected this approach. Bevin and Byrnes still insist on their original positions. (2) Problems also arose with the amount of compensation for the losses of Allied assets in satellite countries. Italy and the Soviet Union agreed that the compensation amount accounted for 25% of the losses, while Britain and France insisted on 75%. After negotiations, Bevin agreed to reduce the British demand to 66%. (3) Byrnes expressed acceptance, but Molotov only allowed 40%, and France has not made concessions in this regard.

### Gu Weijun's Speech Agrees That Franco Should Hand Over Power, He Was the First to Recognize the Puppet Government

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 4th] The UN Political and Security Committee met today to discuss the Spanish issue. First, Gu Weijun, head of the Chinese delegation, stated that the Chinese delegation fully supported the US proposal that Franco should hand over the Spanish government. Franco was the first to recognize the Chinese puppet government. As for the proposals put forward by Poland and Belarus, I dare not agree with them. The United Nations does not need to sever diplomatic and economic relations with Spain at this time, because the Franco regime does not pose an imminent danger to world peace. As for the proposal put forward by the United States, it is consistent with the doctrine of non-interference and can also respect the sovereignty of the Spanish people, so it is the most desirable.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 4th] The UN Political and Security Committee today appointed a subcommittee to review the various proposals on the Spanish issue. The committee represents fourteen countries: China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Belgium, Belarus, Chile, Cuba, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama, Poland, and Yugoslavia. Most of them have proposed severing ties with Franco's Spain or have expressed sympathy for this move.

### British MP Goodwill Delegation to Visit China Next Year, Seeking to Promote Trade Relations with China

[Reuters, London, 5th] Minister of State McNeil said in the Lower House today in response to a question from a Member of Parliament that the British Parliamentary Goodwill Mission to China will first seek the opinion of the Chinese government before deciding to travel to China in order to know whether it agrees with this move. Labor MP Williams believes that this proposal will be welcomed by the Chinese government, and he suggests that it can be launched in the summer of next year. When McNeil mentioned trade issues with China, he said that the British government's proposal on establishing trade with China was submitted to the Chinese government at the beginning of this month. The British government hopes to start these negotiations in the near future. Labor MP Barton also asked: Although British consuls in China have made unremitting efforts, British influence in China has disappeared. Is the government paying attention to this? Britain needs to continue to maintain friendly relations with the Chinese people. Has the authorities taken formal steps to promote this relationship? McNeil replied that he was willing to consider any specific steps. Former Foreign Secretary Eden then said: I think the government will be willing to obtain the closest and most complete trade relations with China based on the opinions put forward by MP Barton. McNeil replied yes, which is why the British government has made a commercial proposal.

### French Parliament Elects Prime Minister, Three Major Parties Compete, Thorez Fails in First Vote

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 4th] French Communist Party leader Thorez asked to obtain the post of Prime Minister of the Cabinet. In today's National Assembly, he received only 259 votes out of 79. The National Assembly is scheduled to hold a second vote tomorrow. Some members of the National Assembly said after the fact that although the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party decided to support Thorez, most of the Socialist Party members did not vote for Thorez. Members of the People's Republican Party held a meeting after the National Assembly adjourned today, but no decision was made on the candidate for prime minister. It is now scheduled to meet again tomorrow. It is widely rumored in the National Assembly that the Socialist Party intends to nominate a prime ministerial candidate from its own party, while the Communist Party intends to re-nominate Thorez as a prime ministerial candidate to counter the People's Republican Party.

### MacArthur Orders Japanese Government to Prohibit Contact with Foreign Countries

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 5th] MacArthur Headquarters issued a notice today, reprimanding the Japanese government for failing to comply with the ban and privately making direct contact with representatives of foreign governments stationed in Japan. Foreign representatives seek to obtain information, inspect equipment, or discuss other issues. As this has not been authorized by the US authorities, nor has it been notified to the US authorities, the Japanese government is to blame. Informed sources pointed out that this order applies to foreign representatives stationed at MacArthur Headquarters, because these representatives have recently not been allowed by the US authorities to contact Japanese government agencies in order to explore the possibility of restoring commercial relations in the future. MacArthur's announcement implies that the US authorities intend to strictly control all trade negotiations between Japan and foreign countries, with the exception of Japan-US negotiations.

### British Side Sends Back Over Two Hundred People from Burma, Alleged Unruly Officers and Soldiers are All Innocent Civilians, Investigation Reveals Only a Few with Genuine Military Status, Garrison Command Reports to the Ministry of National Defense for Instructions

[Report from this newspaper] The two hundred plus so-called "unruly officers and soldiers" sent to Shanghai from Burma by the British side a few days ago, after days of interrogation by the Military Law Office of the Garrison Command, it has been found that only a few of them are genuinely of military status. The rest are all innocent civilians, mostly from Guangdong, followed by Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan. There are also quite a few from Shandong and Hebei. Some of them were workers who built the Burma Road. After the road was completed, they stayed in the border area between Shanghai and Burma, changing their profession to transporters, etc. Some are local residents of the border area, frequently traveling back and forth between the Shanghai-Burma border for small-scale commercial activities. There are also some who are farmers near Myitkyina. The reasons for their arrest are no more than the following: (1) During the Anti-Japanese War in the Burma border area, there were American troops stationed there. After the victory, the American troops left, but left behind a lot of military uniforms, which were worn by many local civilians, and thus they were identified as soldiers by the British. (2) Occasionally, they quarreled and fought with others over trivial matters, and were arrested and sent away on this pretext. (3) There are even more who, according to their confessions, were arrested inexplicably. They themselves did not know what crime they had committed. Many of them have families, wives, and children in Burma. This arrest and deportation has separated families and cut off livelihoods, making the situation very miserable. The Garrison Command has now reported the interrogation situation to the Ministry of National Defense for instructions and intends to contact the Executive Yuan to provide funds for them to return to their hometowns.

The reporter was surprised that since these two hundred plus people are mostly innocent civilians, why did the British side detain and deport them? Why did our diplomatic authorities have no objection to this? Deeply puzzled, yesterday I made a special visit to Chen Guolian, director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to him, the office received only a few telegrams, vaguely referring to them as "unruly officers and soldiers," but there was no explanation of the individual "unruly" behavior of each person. It is not known whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing has received detailed case files from the British side. It is now planned to determine measures after the Garrison Command officially notifies the results of the interrogation.

### Huangpu and Old Gate Districts Still Cracking Down on Vendors, Show Window Collapses Near White Rock Road, Nearby Shops Panic, Fight at Dongxin Bridge Turns Out To Be a False Alarm

[Report from this newspaper] The vendor crisis has calmed down, but yesterday, the police in the jurisdictions of the Huangpu and Old Gate sub-bureaus still strictly cracked down, either driving away vendors or releasing them with a fine of 1,000 yuan. Therefore, people are once again feeling uneasy. Around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a large glass pane of a show window at No. 84 White Rock Road, Sincere Laundry Shop, which had just opened on the first day, was scratched with a metal object by an unknown person, causing it to fall and shatter. Some busybodies added fuel to the fire, spreading rumors that another incident had occurred with the vendors. Nearby shops closed their doors one after another, affecting the International Hotel area. At the same time, a fight broke out between vendors at Dongxin Bridge, which was also mistakenly reported as a vendor riot, causing passersby to flee and shops to close. Later, the police bureau dispatched a large number of personnel to investigate the truth, and the false alarm was dispelled. It was later heard that a similar situation occurred in the Taishan District.

### Police Officer Appeals to the Council Regarding the Vendor Incident, Hoping That People From All Walks of Life Will Make a Fair Judgment

Liu Xiaoqing and over one hundred twenty police officers from the Jing'an Temple sub-bureau in the city, in view of the fact that people from all walks of life do not understand the truth about the recent vendor incident and have been critical, have jointly appealed to the council. The original text is recorded below: "Respectfully addressed to the Speaker and Councilors: As an international metropolis, this city is the focus of attention both domestically and internationally. Since the victory, under your leadership, we have eliminated the old habits of the enemy and established a new democratic style. Municipal construction and national rejuvenation depend on this. This time, the problem of cracking down on vendors has caused a great wave, which is certainly due to the mischief of a few villains and bandits, but unruly vendors blindly following riots are also to blame. After reading various newspapers, you all value the poor vendors and criticize the police officers. You may not know that there are police officers who are even poorer than the vendors, and have already been forgotten by you all. The police are the enforcers of national laws and regulations. Although we cannot be the guardians of the people or the guides of society, we are duty-bound to protect the lives and property of the people and will make every effort to do so. If we ourselves have any dereliction of duty, we should be brought to justice. Otherwise, we do not want others to slander and insult us. Our monthly income is about 100,000 yuan, with an average of only three to four thousand yuan per day, far less than the price of a few fruits from the vendors. We still rely on this small amount to support our families, and our families are freezing and starving, which is commonplace. Once the uniform is removed, we are no better than prisoners and beggars. Every day, regardless of morning, dusk, day, night, rain, snow, wind, or frost, we endure hunger and cold, and work hard. What are we doing? We only hope to do our best to protect the people for the cause of national reconstruction and gain spiritual comfort. You all lead the entire city and not only have you not paid attention to it, but you have also severely blamed and criticized us. We have lost both material and spiritual things, so why should we continue in this position and be ridiculed? Even if we cannot abruptly stop working, we will jointly resign. This is a special letter to you, hoping that you will announce it to the world and make a fair judgment on all matters. We will be extremely grateful."

### Bureau Director Fang and Others Console Injured Police Officers

As a result of the vendor unrest in the city, some stores were destroyed and innocent citizens were injured. The Municipal Police Bureau and Deputy Director personally dispatched Bureau Directors Fang Zhichao and Sun Jialiang and the heads of each sub-bureau to visit various businesses and hospitals to offer condolences the day before yesterday. It is reported that yesterday afternoon, Bureau Director Fang and Xu Xu, director of the Personnel Office of the Police Bureau, visited forty police officers and patrol officers who were injured in this incident to offer condolences.

### Salvage Work on Sunken Ships to Begin in Taiwan and Xiamen, Tools to Be Requested From UNRRA

[Report from this newspaper] The [Salvage of Sunken Ships Planning Committee], approved by the Port Affairs Committee, will hold its first meeting next Monday afternoon at 3:00 PM, convened by the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau. At that time, the newly hired specialized committee member, salvage expert Oia, and maritime law expert Wei Wenhan will both attend and report. According to Li Gufan, director of the Shipping Administration Bureau, the mission of the committee is to actively promote the early establishment of a salvage company. The tools used by the salvage company will be requested from UNRRA. In the past, due to the lack of good tools, proper exploration could not be carried out. After the company is established, it plans to conduct exploration first and report the results to the shipowners to ask if they are willing to salvage. All costs required for salvage will be borne by the shipowners. One-third of the salvaged ships will go to the salvage company, and two-thirds will go to the shipowners. If they are enemy or puppet ships, the salvage costs will be paid by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau. One-third of the salvaged ships will be awarded to the salvage company, and two-thirds will go to the Handling Bureau. After the ships are salvaged, they will be repaired immediately. If the salvaged ships exceed the salvage costs, the salvage company will be responsible for it. Salvage work will begin in the waters off Taiwan and Xiamen. Salvage of ships inside and outside the port of Shanghai will have to wait until April next year. The salvage of ships in the waters north of the port of Shanghai will be delayed even further.

To apply for a loan to salvage and repair ships, the following conditions must be met: (1) The gross tonnage of the ship is over twenty tons. (2) The ship's age is less than twenty years. (3) The ship is registered with the shipping administration authority and has a sailing permit. (4) The salvage and repair costs do not exceed six-tenths of the current cost of the ship.

### Longhua Airport Undergoing Renovation to Become an International Aviation Base, Taking Four to Five Months and Costing 85 Billion

[Report from this newspaper] After the signing of the Sino-US Aviation Agreement, Longhua Airport will be renovated so that giant aircraft can land and become a modern international aviation base. This project will take approximately four to five months and cost 85 billion yuan in national currency.

According to reliable sources, the Ministry of Communications has established a special agency to rebuild Longhua Airport and has appointed technical personnel in charge on November 15. In fact, the project is already underway. The runway will also be rebuilt to be able to bear the weight of aircraft weighing over 150,000 pounds. According to the requirement that C-54 giant transport aircraft require a runway that can carry 85,000 pounds, the monthly target of this reconstruction is to make super-sized aircraft usable.

In addition to this main runway, auxiliary runways and parking lines will also be built. Hangars will not be built for the time being due to the excessive cost, but it may be possible to build some of them for specific purposes in the future. The entire project was originally scheduled to be completed within three months, but due to insufficient equipment, especially the lack of transportation equipment, it will not be completed until April or May of next year.

Before the completion of the Longhua Airport project, American airlines may cooperate with Jiangwan Airport and temporarily borrow the airport for use in accordance with the provisions of the air transport agreement. Jiangwan Airport was originally built by the Japanese army and later improved by the US Air Force. It is now exclusively used by aircraft belonging to UNRRA and the US Air Transport Group. In the future, it is planned to be exclusively used for the needs of Chinese military aircraft.

According to the air transport agreement, American aircraft will also be able to land, pass through, and operate in Tianjin and Hong Kong in the future, but due to economic limitations, the airports in the two cities have not yet been renovated. However, after the renovation in the future, Tianjin will be more important than Hong Kong. Guangzhou currently has Baiyun and Tianhe Airports for use. Negotiations with other countries on similar Sino-US air transport agreements have not yet begun.

### Launching a National Believer Movement to Practice Spiritual Construction, Progressing in Three-Year Phases: Third Day of the Christian Conference Meeting

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, during the third day of the 12th National Christian Conference, representatives paid great attention to Chairman Chiang's call for spiritual construction.

### National Defense Medical Center: The Best-Equipped in the Country, Hospital with 900 Beds, Medical School Can Accommodate 4,000 Students

[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to improve military medical services and cooperate with the construction of a new national defense army, the Military Medical Department recently convened a business meeting in Shanghai with the presidents of the general hospitals of the Joint Logistics Headquarters from all over the country. They plan to use the hospital and other buildings built by the forward enemy in the city center to form a National Defense Medical Center, engaging in training new military medical technicians to meet the needs of various health units of national defense. Yesterday afternoon, the department also hosted the city's press corps for a visit.

The National Defense Medical Center covers an area of more than 200 acres, including the Military Medical School, General Hospital, General Health Materials Depot, Health Camp, Health Experiment Institute, Library, and Museum. Among them, the Military Medical School is divided into departments of medicine, dentistry, nursing, health service, medical technology, and basic health training, accommodating over four thousand eight hundred people. The scale and equipment of the General Hospital are the best of any hospital in the country. There are more than 900 beds, and various equipment is received from the former Japanese Army Hospital, such as fluorescent lights, infrared rays, electrical massagers, shortwave viewers, X-rays, special surgical equipment, and dental equipment, all of which are fully equipped. Even cooking and laundry have steam and gas equipment, showing the scale of the facility. There are currently more than 200 wounded and sick officers and soldiers in the hospital, with lung disease patients being the most numerous. The Health Experiment Institute has a saline injection manufacturing facility, which produces large quantities for nationwide supply every day. The institute also keeps dozens of white rabbits to test whether the manufactured saline has any reaction. The Health Materials Depot currently has dozens of new-style ambulances donated by the United States, each with 14 stretcher beds, and another type with four stretcher beds, which can also seat 16 lightly wounded people. One vehicle is equivalent to several ordinary ambulances.

The Military Medical Department believes that the biggest shortcoming in China's military medical services is the lack of talent, so it will actively promote this medical center, transferring military medical personnel from various troops and agencies to receive training here, and recruiting students to specialize in various subjects. In addition, medical personnel with excellent performance are selected and sent to the United States Military Medical Center for practical research in separate groups. In August of this year, 121 people were specially transported to the United States. As for the resettlement plan for veterans, in addition to setting up hospitals for those who are severely disabled and unable to make a living to provide lifelong care, the rest will be assisted in education, employment, or sent back to their hometowns. These tasks still rely on the joint assistance of social organizations to seek solutions.

### "Jade in a Prosperous Year, Grain in a Famine Year": The Sorrow of Antique Dealers, Groaning Secretly in a Quaint Environment, Longing for the Early Arrival of a Peaceful and Prosperous Era

[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] "Jade in a prosperous year, grain in a famine year." In today's world of constant wars, high prices, and economic decline, it is no wonder that ordinary antique dealers are crying out in distress!

The word "antique" in English is called "Curious," which is interpreted as a treasure, or "Antiquities," meaning ancient relics. However, in addition to the two conditions of "ancient" and "precious," some say that it must also be valuable for historical and artistic research to be called an antique. The scope is also very broad, including porcelain, gold and stone, jewelry, calligraphy and painting, rubbings from stone inscriptions, miscellaneous objects, and so on.

According to people in the industry, in the Qing Dynasty, due to the wealth of the people and the abundance of goods, ordinary princes and ministers liked to collect antiques. With this trend, they all offered high prices to compete for them. Therefore, the antique industry at that time was truly a golden age. Later, because fewer and fewer Chinese people liked antiques, and they were also limited by economic conditions and unable to collect them, after the Republic of China, they relied entirely on foreign businessmen to maintain the industry. Later, because the trend of digging and robbing tombs prevailed everywhere, the government issued an order prohibiting the export of antiques. During this period, fake goods and forgeries also emerged in an endless stream.

To imitate a bronze ware in the style of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, using salt and other substances to scrub it and then bury it in the soil, after a few months or even years, it can also have ancient rust spots, and it will be mixed with the relics of the three dynasties. There are many things that are difficult to tell whether they are genuine or fake, and even we antique dealers may not be sure whether they are genuine or fake.

Beijing and Nanjing, which were once capitals, are mostly the centers of the antique industry. There are also many antique shops in this city, and there is also a large-scale antique market on Guangdong Road. However, due to the economic downturn, it is difficult to have a transaction. A few days ago, the China Antiquities Research Society held an exhibition. Among the exhibits, a Jiajing high-footed cup was priced at 1.5 million, a Ming Dynasty Wucai Langxi-style double phoenix large bowl was priced at 6 million, a chicken-blood stone seal was priced at 4.5 million, and a set of carved lacquer large screen was priced at 30 million. Many people went to visit, but they all just "looked" at them. Just think, in this year when food and clothing come first, who has so much spare money to buy back this kind of thing that cannot be eaten when hungry or worn when cold. After all, there are only a few wealthy literati and those nouveau riche who imitate the elegance.

A Pile of Scrap Copper and Rotten Iron, But Rare Treasures

To those who are obsessed with collecting antiques, what "outsiders" see as just an old painting, a fossil, or a pile of scrap copper and rotten iron, may be regarded by them as rare treasures worth a fortune, and they will spare no effort to occupy it for themselves. It is because of this desire to possess that many historical examples have resulted in the loss of property and damage to morality. For example, the He Shi Bi of King Zhao Huiwen of the Warring States period, King Zhao of Qin used a vast city to exchange for it. Emperor Taizong of Song sent a debater to fraudulently obtain Wang Xizhi's calligraphy treasured by a monk, and even wanted to take it into the coffin after his death. Zheng Chu of the Qing Dynasty said in his "On Antiques": "Bones and flesh cause lawsuits, and friends breed suspicion. When they are rich and noble, they are worth thousands of wonders, but when they are poor and lowly, they are not enough to exchange for cakes." These words have exhausted the disadvantages of antiques.

An enlightened antique dealer said to me well: "We should be based on the perspectives of archaeology, history, and art for antiques, to explore and discuss, with the premise of connecting ancient and modern culture and art. Otherwise, indulging in things will lose one's ambition, and it is not just a waste of money. Today, excavation work is certainly important, but we should try to preserve the cultural relics that have been unearthed."

In the Five Months After Victory, American Soldiers Inquired About It Slightly

According to the statistics of the International Trade Bureau, in the two years of the Republic of China, 21 and 22 alone, the export of antiques has been worth a total of 2,302,997 yuan in national currency. Think about how much material there is for studying ancient Chinese history and archaeology, and you will know that this is a major loss to Chinese culture. Now, when Chinese people study their own history, they sometimes have to travel across the ocean to libraries in London or Paris to borrow and copy materials, which is truly an endless feeling!

"Three years without opening, opening to eat for three years," was originally a portrayal of the high profits of antique dealers. However, today, let's take the shopkeepers in the antique market as an example. Because there has been no business, they have accumulated nearly one million yuan in rent arrears to the market. An old man who has been in this business for decades said to me with great emotion: "The antique industry will be good only after all industries are good. If all industries are not good, the antique industry will bear the brunt and be the first to be bad. After the victory in August last year, because the US Navy came to Shanghai, there was a period of five months when there was a little business. But they only bought some scattered items to take back to the country as souvenirs. Some even ran into the toilet because they had no money in their pockets, took off their underwear to exchange for money, and bought some things worth ten or eight US dollars. But when they were transferred to Qingdao and other places, this kind of business also decreased.

Business Is Very Different From the Past, and Antique Dealers Are Changing Careers

After the victory, antiques have not been formally exported, and foreign businessmen have not yet come to purchase them. The reason is of course that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cannot cooperate, and prices are rising. To tell you shamelessly today, many antique dealers have changed careers to sell newspapers, shine shoes, perform magic tricks, and set up stalls to be peddlers. ... He shook his head and smiled bitterly, looking forward and saying: "The antique industry will only improve when the country is peaceful and the weather is good!"

This is the sorrow of today's antique dealers! They live in an environment of pearls, jade, calligraphy, paintings, and inscriptions, which is quaint, but these things cannot be eaten when hungry or worn when cold. Now, they only have to endure hardships and put their full hope on the early arrival of a peaceful and prosperous era!

When will this world of war and chaos be peaceful and prosperous? And it is not just antique dealers who are looking forward to it.

### Involving Six Countries, Complex Real Estate Disputes, Resold as Enemy Property, Former Owners Trying to Recover, Executive Yuan Rejected the Original Lawsuit

[Our Newspaper's Report] During the period of the enemy puppet regime in this city, there were many disputes between Chinese and foreign people over the sale and purchase of real estate, resulting in a large number of real estate dispute cases after the victory. An American company, American & Foreign Distributors Corp., had mortgaged vacant land and 14 factory buildings located at 1363 Yangshupu Road to Banque de l'Indochine. It had previously repaid 70% of the mortgage. After the Pacific War, the remaining amount was not repaid, and the guarantor, Wang Detang of Spanish nationality, repaid the full amount. Due to this relationship, on March 21, 1942, Banque de l'Indochine entrusted British business Jardine, Matheson & Co. to transfer the title to Wang Detang's name. Wang Detang sold the property to the Japanese company Shanghai Warehouse Trust Co., Ltd. at a price, and had already transferred the ownership to Jardine, Matheson & Co. After the victory, the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau took over the property and nationalized it. The company actually entrusted lawyer Luo Jie to submit a presentation to the Enemy Property Administration Bureau applying for its return and appealing to the Executive Yuan. The process of the case is very complicated, involving six countries including China, the United States, Britain, France, Spain and Japan. Now the Executive Yuan rejected the original lawsuit based on the first paragraph of Article 8 of the Law of Appeal.

The reasons given by the Executive Yuan are as follows: "First, the property was originally owned by Japanese nationals, or was purchased with funds from Japanese puppets. The property rights are all owned by the central government. The third paragraph of Article 4 of the Measures for the Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Property in the Recovered Areas has clear provisions. The real estate in this case was formally purchased by the Japanese company Shanghai Warehouse Trust Co., Ltd. from Wang Detang, which is an indisputable fact. Therefore, the original disposition agency's disposition of nationalizing the property in accordance with the aforementioned measures is not inappropriate. As for the appellant's claim that the real estate was sold privately by a person without ownership (Wang Detang) and without the consent of the person who has the right to dispose of it (the appellant), it should be invalid according to law. Regardless of whether it is true or not, it is a matter of private rights dispute. If the appellant suffers any damage as a result, he should file a lawsuit with the competent judicial authority for verification. He must not request the revocation of the administrative disposition based on the existence of ownership, because the disposition made by the administrative chief agency in accordance with administrative laws and regulations is not absolutely bound by judicial precedents."

### To Protect People's Health, the City Council Suggests to the National Assembly to Add Articles to the Constitution

[Our Newspaper's Report] The fourth meeting of the Health Committee and the fifth meeting of the Regulations Committee of the City Council passed the "Proposal to the National Assembly to Add Articles to the Constitution to Protect People's Health"! It was also decided by the joint meeting of the conveners of various committees that the council would send a telegram to the presidium of the National Assembly to adopt and implement it. The council has sent the proposal to the chairman of the National Assembly yesterday. The original telegram reads as follows:

To the Presidium of the National Assembly of the Republic of China in Nanjing: We respectfully state that the strength or weakness of the people's health is related to the rise and fall of the nation, and the cultivation of the people's physique, the pursuit of hygiene, and the ability of the government to advocate social assistance, so that the people, regardless of rich or poor, can enjoy equal opportunities for nutrition, hygiene, medical treatment, and prolonging life. For the past hundred years, our country has been plagued by internal strife and foreign aggression, politics has not been on the right track, and the system has many loopholes. Measures to improve the health of the people have not been significantly developed, resulting in the people's physique becoming increasingly weak, their spirits depressed, and their ambitions depressed. This has led the countries of the world to regard our people as the "sick man of East Asia," which is extremely shameful. Although there have been many people with insight who have advocated in many ways, the people do not value hygiene, and social customs are simple. If this continues, it will have a profound and significant impact on the survival of the nation and the rejuvenation of the country. However, the crux of the problem is that although it is due to the people's own mistakes, the state has failed to formulate a comprehensive and concrete policy, which is also difficult to shirk responsibility. According to the major cities in Europe and the United States, they all regard people's health care as an important social issue, and all have organizations such as medical services for the people, health care for the people, or disease insurance. The central government does not hesitate to do its best to coordinate the overall situation and make it a national policy to protect the health of the people. As for France's formulation of the Fourth Republic Constitution, Article 22 of the Declaration of Human Rights clearly stipulates that "the state guarantees that all citizens can enjoy national health and the protection of pregnant women, the development of sports, public health, and various measures from science," which is sufficient to be a model for modern democratic countries to seek welfare for the people. Now that our government is convening the National Assembly to formulate the Constitution, all the rights that the people should enjoy must be within the consideration of all of you. The council has passed the "Proposal to the National Assembly to Add Articles to the Constitution to Protect People's Health" at the fourth meeting of the Health Committee and the fifth meeting of the Regulations Committee. It was also "resolved by the joint meeting of the conveners of various committees: This council will elaborate on the reasons and send a telegram to the presidium of the National Assembly to adopt and implement it." The record is on file, so we specially state the ins and outs and send a telegram to your group to issue a photo, give it adoption, hand it over for discussion and implementation, so as to extend human rights and strengthen the nation. We are extremely apprehensive and await orders. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai City Council, Xu Jiqing, Deputy Speaker (Hai Wei) bows.

Shen Weiting was the chairman of the Puppet Zhonghua Tobacco Distribution Association, and testified that the Puppet Zhonghua Tobacco Distribution Association was divided into two parts, Chinese and Japanese, and the foreign ports were all managed by the Japanese, so Yu Yiming's affairs cannot be discussed. The court ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing, and Yu Ding and Shen were detained.

### Continuing the Trial of Nazi War Criminals, Shen Ke Testifies in Court

The German Nazi war criminal Ochtor and his 20 accomplices are still on trial in the US military court. Yesterday, Shen Ke, who had been acquitted, testified in court for the defendants. According to Shen Ke, not long ago, he had sued Randall, the director of the Far East Branch of the United Press International. After a month of trial, the US military court declared Shen Ke and five others innocent, but they were still detained in the Tilanqiao Prison and not released. Shen Ke had been a reporter for the German news agency for many years and had been in contact with Ochtor and others, but claimed that he was not a member of Ochtor's spy network, and claimed that after Germany surrendered, the spy organization was preparing to disband. After Germany surrendered, it notified the organization to find a way to contact the German side. The German spy agency and the German Consulate were located at No. 2 Beijing Road in the same year (now the US Navy Headquarters), and the scope was later expanded. Shen Ke admitted that he was a German reporter at that time and had a very high salary, receiving a salary of more than 1,000 marks per month. The house where he lived was on Haig Road, and later became the official residence of General Stone, the commander of the US 14th Air Force. The judge then asked what kind of house he lived in, and he claimed: "Very good! Very good!" There was a sense of unbearable recollection of the past, which also shows the general preferential treatment of the Germans to news personnel. Shen Ke was questioned by lawyers from both sides for two hours. The court will today be... The prosecutor told reporters that the group of German war criminals, whether they are convicted or acquitted in the future, must all be repatriated to Germany for punishment in their home country.

### Reader Consultation - Medical and Health

(Persistent Dysentery for Seven Years)

Zhou Zhicheng asks: My relative has suffered from dysentery for seven years, recently with bloody stools, abdominal and navel pain, and although the appetite is still good, food is passed unchanged after eating, leading to exhaustion. I would like to ask: (1) A stool test reveals the presence of amoeba. What disease is this? If it is bacillary dysentery or intestinal tuberculosis, how should it be treated? (2) How should chronic constipation be treated?

[Answer from Dr. Gu Yuqi, Medical Doctor] (1) Your relative's dysentery needs a detailed stool test to determine if it is amoebic dysentery, bacillary dysentery, intestinal tuberculosis, or colitis. According to your letter, the fact that food is passed unchanged after eating suggests another cause. Perhaps there is a decrease in gastric and intestinal secretions, leading to indigestion. A confirmed diagnosis is the priority. If it is chronic amoebic dysentery, Enterovioform and Emetin injections can be effective. If it is intestinal tuberculosis, treatment is difficult and rarely effective. (2) For chronic constipation, Nujol can be used, taken one or two tablespoons morning and evening, until the bowel movements are smooth, then discontinue.

(2) Lymph Node Tuberculosis

Chen Qian-guang asks: I have a weak constitution. Twenty years ago, two nodules appeared on both sides of my neck, without pain or itching, but a slight discomfort when turning my head, and a slight fever. Recently, they have been gradually enlarging. The doctor said it is tuberculous lymphadenitis. I have had six or seven injections of glucose calcium and vitamin B, but they have not subsided, and small nodules have appeared below them. I would like to ask: (1) Is this lymph node tuberculosis? (2) Will injections of glucose calcium and vitamin B be effective? (3) Are there more effective treatments? Please recommend a specialist doctor. (4) After glucose and vitamin injections, red patches appear on my ankles and calves, slightly sore to the touch. What is the reason? Is it related to the injections?

[Answer from Dr. Gu Yuqi, Medical Doctor] (1) The nodules on the side of the neck are lymphadenitis, possibly due to pulmonary tuberculosis. An X-ray examination or photograph can be used for diagnosis, or it may be due to other reasons. It is best to have a blood test to determine the cause. (2) Injections of glucose calcium and vitamin B are beneficial for pulmonary tuberculosis, but if it is due to another pathogen, they will not be effective. (3) After a confirmed diagnosis, appropriate medication can be used. (4) For tuberculous lymphadenitis, in addition to the above-mentioned injections, oral cod liver oil capsules, and nutritious diet, you can also consult a specialist to study whether X-ray irradiation is possible.

When the central bank stopped supplying gold, it turned around. The central bank distributed 180 bars at a price of 2,782,500. After 10:00 AM, buying interest was strong again, immediately crossing the 2,800,000 mark, forming a scramble to buy and gradually rising.

### Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau Ordered to Crack Down on Underground Banks

### Coal Briquette Raw Materials Depleted - Factories Close Down One After Another

The supply of coal briquettes in the city is manufactured by the machine-made coal briquette industry and the hand-cranked coal briquette industry. Their raw materials depend on the allocation of the Shanghai District Fuel Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The allocation to the hand-cranked coal briquette industry has been suspended since November, and the machine-made coal briquette industry also only received 10,000 tons of allocated coal in November. However, the previous city-wide monthly demand was more than 40,000 tons, which was only enough to meet one-quarter of the actual sales. Factories such as Yitai Xing Nanyang have successively suspended production this month due to lack of raw materials, causing great panic among the people for household cooking fuel. The black market price has reached the high price of 400,000 yuan per ton. The door-to-door price of coal briquettes is 16,000 yuan to 18,000 yuan per dan.

### Reasons for High Gold Prices - Loose Money Supply, High Prices in Other Cities - Central Bank's Selling Is Relatively Passive

[Report from this newspaper] The market price of gold continued to reach new highs. The reporter interviewed a certain expert yesterday to ask about the reasons. It is said that the rise in gold prices has three internal factors: (1) Recently, the money supply in Shanghai has been loose. Because the silver and money industry is approaching the end of the year, the remaining funds are no longer released, and most of the recovered funds are used to purchase gold, resulting in an increase in real demand and soaring prices. (2) Gold prices are high in other cities, such as Tianjin, which is already more than 3 million higher, causing the gold price in this city to rise accordingly. (3) The central bank's recent sale of gold bars is not as active as in the past, which is also related to the rise in gold prices without falling.

### Opening Up Import of Foreign Cotton - Transportation Management Committee Meeting Discussion

[Report from this newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Transportation Management Committee held a full executive committee meeting at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon, starting at 4:00 PM. The attendees included Chairman Zu Yi, Executive Committee members Zhang Fuyun, Li Gan, Chen Changtong, Lin Weiying, etc. The meeting adjourned at around 8:00 PM. It is reported that the main topic of discussion was the opening up of foreign cotton imports.

### Inverted Prices Between This and Other Cities - Both Yarn and Cloth Markets Are Weak

Yesterday, the yarn market was still lifeless. Because the reserve price was already high, the purchasing power of the countryside was weak, and the guest merchants handled spot transactions sluggishly. Furthermore, major factories in Shanghai shipped in large quantities to Tianjin, Wuhan, and other places to sell at reduced prices. Because the reduced sales prices in other cities were still higher than the official prices in Shanghai, yarn prices in other cities were lowered. Trading within the market was limited to price limits as usual. The asking price outside the market was slightly lower by 20,000 to 30,000. For example, 42-count Blue Phoenix was 5 million, 32-count Blue Phoenix was 3.15 million, Silver Moon was 3.11 million, 20-count Double Horse was 2.35 million, Golden City was 2.33 million yuan, Red Kui was 2.34 million, Cai Kui was 2.3 million, Golden Pagoda was 2.29 million, and Golden Star was 2.28 million yuan.

The Tianjin and Wuhan merchants' appetite for cotton cloth was still heard to be dispersed. It was heard that there was an inverted price phenomenon in other cities. The market in this city continued to decline. New buyers were active on the market, and there were frequent sell-offs. The old Four Gentlemen Serge fell to within 110,000 yuan. Various fine cloths also fell by a small amount of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. There was little change in colored cloths, etc.

### Cotton Stock Registration - Not Yet Fully Reported

[Report from this newspaper] The Textile Control Commission handled the registration of cotton flower numbers and foreign firm cotton stocks throughout the city. Yesterday was the deadline. It was heard that yarn factories have reported the numbers, but the Textile Control Commission said that it has not received them yet. The flower number side will not be able to report the numbers until next Monday. Seven foreign firms have already reported the numbers, but most of them are orders.

### Handkerchief Industry Lacks Raw Materials

The handkerchief industry in this city is facing serious difficulties due to raw material problems. According to industry insiders, the industry received an allocation of cotton yarn last month. Because the Textile Control Commission based its allocation on the China Textile Report, it discounted it by 60%, resulting in a total allocation of only 91 pieces for the four allocations. However, there are more than 80 factories in the industry, with 1,550 looms, and the current number of operating looms is 1,298. In terms of day work alone, the monthly demand for 40-count and 60-count single yarn is more than 386 pieces. If night work is added, the number must be doubled. However, the industry received an allocation of 91 pieces of cotton yarn last month, which is only enough to supply the industry for seven days of day work. The allocation this month is even far less than this. Black market cotton yarn cannot be obtained, which not only increases costs but also violates the law. There were still cotton stocks to make up for it last month, but the current cotton stocks are running out, and there is a possibility of work stoppage at any time.

### Many Rumors in the Stock Market - Fourth-Period Delivery Debuts - Bearish Forces Still Strong

The fourth-period delivery of Chinese stocks debuted yesterday. Bearish forces implemented suppression, but there were many struggles along the way. Low prices appeared in the afternoon. Bearish forces made up for it. At the close, the market was still firm. Spot stocks opened expensive in the morning, but with the debut of the delivery, bearish forces implemented suppression, pushing the delivery of Yong Yarn down to the same price as the spot price. The financial community sighed and could not profit. Nos. 199, 91, and 218 were sold and turned from stable to weak. No. 229 was also sold and started downstream. Nos. 176 and 198 were bought on dips. After 10:00 AM, long and short sides swapped positions, and the market hesitated. Nos. 185, 190, and 73, etc., covered shorts. Although No. 215 was sold, Nos. 185 and 99 were repeatedly bought. Before 11:00 AM, the market had risen to a high price. Soon after, Nos. 199, 12, 152, 89, and 99 were sold again. It was also rumored that the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory had losses of 2.6 billion yuan, and people were panicked. Near noon, it retreated to a low price. Compared with the previous close, Yong Yarn fell slightly, and Xinhuo, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by more than 50%. Meiya fell by a staggering 10% weak. Cold stock Xinya fell by 20%, Lian fell by 10%, underwear Yonggong Rong Factory rose slightly, and the rest fell slightly. The rise and fall of delivery before the noon closing price on the previous day varied. Panic was even worse in the afternoon. A selling frenzy broke out, and there were many declines. However, after the low price, the bearish forces profited and covered. Nos. 215 and 102, etc., were bought. In addition, the evening newspaper reported that the National Assembly had been postponed for ten days and that political disputes would resume negotiations, and people's hearts gradually settled. In the end, there was a slight pull-up. Compared with the previous close, Yong Yarn and Huajian fell by a small amount. Xinhuo and Xinguang fell by a little more than 50%. Meiya, Jingfu, and Qinxing each fell by about 10%. Cold stock Xinya fell by 20%, Lian fell by 10%, Shanhua Datong was flat, Rong Yuan rose slightly, and the rest fell slightly.

### Anthracite Stands Out - Bituminous Coal Market Slightly Recovered

In the coal market, after the Fuel Management Committee sent a letter to the association to investigate the coal stocks of its members, the general willingness to import slackened. Because the market price was too high, actual sales were not as smooth as before, and the market has slightly recovered by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to the past. Anthracite is selling well in a timely manner, and the market is still standing out. Because bituminous coal prices have risen, the local coking cost of coke is insufficient, and the prices in the producing areas have also risen. All goods have generally risen by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan.

### British Merchants Purchase - Chen Te Qimen

In the foreign merchant tea market, it was learned that the batch of black and green tea samples sent abroad by the British firm Tongfu Yangxing in this city a month ago have now been received one after another in the destination countries. Chen Te Qimen is the most popular, and they have been instructed to ship them in bulk. Yesterday, the company expanded its purchasing appetite in the market and purchased 800 boxes from Longtaichang Teashop, at a price of 180,000 yuan per dan. The market remained firm. As for high-grade Chen Qimen from 1945, which has been stored for a long time, buyers continued to demand it, but there were few transactions, and the situation was ultimately popular. As for green teas such as Chouzhen and Zhenmei, most cargo owners were still very willing to sell, but it was extremely difficult to sell low-grade goods. Buyers were doing their best to suppress the prices of higher-quality teas, so the number of transactions decreased again, and the process was unremarkable. The domestic sales of black and green tea were becoming increasingly weak for both local and guest merchants, and it was difficult to reassure people.

### Chinese Silk Shipped to India - Totaling 75 Packages

### Farmers Bank of China - Offers Silkworm Cocoon Loans - 900,000 Yuan Per Picul

The Farmers Bank of China is offering silkworm cocoon loans to alleviate the current difficulties of silk manufacturers, as autumn silk is currently being processed. According to the bank's estimate, the processing cost of autumn silk is at most 900,000 yuan per picul, so it is stipulated that the loan amount is 900,000 yuan per picul. However, the actual processing cost of silk manufacturers is at least 1.4 million yuan per picul or more, and they have requested an increase. Yesterday, representatives were sent to the Farmers Bank to negotiate. It is learned that the autumn silk is still purchased by the government, and the price is also determined by the government. The Farmers Bank is not in a position to increase the processing loan. It is reported that the silk industry representatives will visit Governor Bei of the Central Bank for instructions and decision.

### Hong Kong Smuggling of Gold to South China - Exceeds 3,000 Taels Per Day - Mostly Carried Privately by Travelers Between Hong Kong and Guangdong

According to a person in charge of the Central Bank, Hong Kong can be said to be the hub for capital smuggling. Because the official price of Mexican gold is more than 50% different from the market price in Hong Kong, and the official price of Indian gold is also more than 30% different from Hong Kong, the source of Hong Kong's large-scale smuggling of gold is supplied by Mexico and India. Hong Kong and Guangzhou are only separated by a small area, and the large amount of smuggling into South China is a natural trend. It is estimated that more than 3,000 taels of gold are smuggled into South China every day. Although the Kowloon Customs has strengthened its anti-smuggling efforts, the total number of passengers traveling between Hong Kong and Guangdong every day is about 50,000 or more. It is indeed difficult to check them one by one. Regarding the issue of capital fleeing to Hong Kong, it is said that this is caused by the unstable domestic situation and the continuous depreciation of legal tender. At the same time, people with capital generally regard Hong Kong as a paradise, so eradicating capital fleeing to Hong Kong has a very close relationship with the recovery of Hong Kong. In addition to taking passive preventive measures from the aspect of restricting exchange, the government is currently drafting plans by relevant parties to enable floating capital to flow into the production sector domestically and prevent it from fleeing again.

### Candle and Soap Sales Turn Active - Kerosene is Scarce and Expensive

### 108th Anniversary of Wu Xun's Birth Celebrated Yesterday; Confucius Hsiang-hsi and Others Gave Speeches of Praise

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday (the 4th) was the 108th anniversary of the birth of Wu Xun, the beggar-educator. The Shandong Fellow Association and Wu Xun School of this city specially held a memorial meeting at 2:30 pm yesterday at the Shandong Fellow Association headquarters on Ximen Road. Chairman Li Qiaozhao, after reporting on Wu Xun's life and deeds, Chairman Kong Xiangxi of the Wu Xun School delivered a speech, saying that Wu Xun, as a beggar, deeply felt the suffering of being uneducated, so he founded schools to help others. His spirit of extending his own feelings to others is praised by everyone, and its impact is enough to move the world, and he is indeed a good model for us.

Then, Ms. Wang Liming, wife of Liu Zhanen, expressed two thoughts: (1) All people in the world, whether they are flaunting their power, rich and powerful, or freezing and starving, without money and power, cannot escape one word - "death." (2) The true difference between people lies in the fact that some people still exist after death, while others are dead even though they are alive. The former includes Wu Xun, Sun Yat-sen, etc. The latter is common in today's society, and even in today's meeting place, there are those who have "no sense of right and wrong, no sense of good and evil, no sense of compassion." Corrupt officials should be spurned. Only Wu Xun's spirit of service will last forever.

Dr. Shao Shuangqiu, a professor at Great China University, said that the most admirable thing about Wu Xun's spirit is that after receiving praise from the emperor, he still worked hard, which is very different from modern people who start to corrupt after achieving success in their careers, which is worthy of our vigilance and emulation.

Finally, poet Zang Kejia spoke. Zang summarized "people" into three categories: (1) altruism, (2) egoism, (3) selfishness. Those who are "selfish" specialize in exploiting the common people and enriching themselves by eating the blood of others. Only the first type of people, such as Wu Xun who are "altruistic," are praised by people for generations. Yesterday's memorial meeting was quite enthusiastic, and finally, famous Peking Opera performers added to the fun, and it ended at dusk.

### Hunan Army Volleyball Friendly Match; Fudan Defeats Law School

[Our Newspaper] At 2:00 pm yesterday, the Xiang Army team, volleyball champion of Fudan Chongqing campus, was challenged by the Xiang Army team, a strong volleyball team from Shanghai Law School, to compete at the Fudan court. The blue velvet clothes and trousers of the Law Xiang team contrasted interestingly with the scattered and disorganized clothing of the Fudan Xiang team. The Fudan Xiang team, which had won the championship of the Fudan University and Beijing University leagues in Chongqing, naturally worked harder for its first battle after arriving in Shanghai. In the first two games, both sides played calmly, without much brilliant performance, and the Fudan Xiang team took the lead, resulting in a score of 2-0. From the third game, the Law Xiang team started a desperate fight, cheering on the whole team. However, their offense was limited to not very fierce spikes on the left of the second row, and occasional connected pressure balls in the middle and left of the front row. The Fudan Xiang team responded easily, and the difficult situation was easily overcome. The Fudan Xiang team defeated the Law Xiang team 3-0. According to reports, the Fudan Xiang Army volleyball team has lacked practice recently, resulting in a lack of brilliant performances. If they can intensify their training, it will not be difficult for them to become a strong volleyball team in Shanghai, and Fudan can also revive its former glory.

Therefore, there are three Group B games today, with the following order:

Chen You Yellow - First (Group B) 6:00 pm

Jianle - New Federation (Chen You Group B) 6:45 pm

Youai Blue - Youai Green (Youai Group B) 7:30 pm

### Record of the Fallen Sheng Zufeng, a Southern Anhui Scholar's Descendant and Jinan Beauty

— November 26th Airmail Report, Special Jinan Correspondent He Bingru

Recently, a legendary case has caused a sensation in all corners of Jinan City. The content of this matter can truly be described as romantic and poignant, providing a timely warning to young ladies regarding the choice of a lifelong companion!

Peerless Beauty, Cast-Off Wife

This story, from its beginning to the present, spans more than twenty years. It originated in Jinan and ended in Chongqing. The planting of causes and reaping of results, joys and sorrows, and partings and reunions are rich in the structure of a legendary novel, and at the same time, it is a reflection of modern society. The protagonist of this story is Miss Sheng Zufeng, a peerless beauty who was once famous in Jinan. During the revolutionary tide of 1928, she abandoned her lover who had shown her kindness as high as a mountain. More than ten years later, during the Anti-Japanese War, she was unfortunately abandoned by her husband, whom she had faithfully served, resulting in her wandering the streets of Chongqing and becoming a cast-off wife. Recently, a returnee from Chongqing revealed a past event in Jinan, arousing general feelings of regret and sorrow, and at the same time, recalling Miss Sheng's "innate beauty" as an embellishment to the scenery of the lakes and mountains! Miss Sheng, being a descendant of a scholar from southern Anhui and a beauty of Jinan, leaves an indelible impression in people's minds!

Past Events Like Smoke, Futile Recollections

Around 1925 or 1926, there was a top student named Sheng Zufeng at Jinan Girls' Middle School. She was from a prominent Anhui family, residing in Jinan. This Miss Sheng was indeed a peerless beauty. To use the words from old novels to describe her, she possessed the beauty to "sink fish and fell birds, put the moon to shame and the flowers to blush." Miss Sheng truly deserved such praise. As for Miss Sheng's figure, her fullness was "more slender than Flying Swallow, yet not too thin; more plump than Yang Guifei, yet not too fat." She possessed just the right balance. Furthermore, regarding her talent and learning, although she could not compare to Xie Daoyun, her writing was excellent. Among her peers, she truly stood out like a crane among chickens, an invaluable standard woman of the era. Her former residence was located west of the Shandong Provincial Assembly in Jinan, inside a large gate on the north side of the road. Next to the gate were inscribed the four large characters "Southern Anhui Sheng Residence." Now, after so many changes, one cannot help but feel the sense of "human face and peach blossoms." Her father, Sheng Yibaimin, was a learned scholar with a wealth of knowledge, and also a romantic celebrity who did not care about his appearance. This Miss Sheng inherited her father's legacy, and through the influence of her family, became a famous "modern" Miss of the time.

Sun Lang's Good Fortune, Scorn for the Literary Circle

In that era, there were naturally many people who admired Miss Sheng's talent and beauty and sought to marry her. They were truly as numerous as carps crossing the river, carried by the cart and measured by the bushel, too many to count. However, Miss Sheng did not accept any of them. Only one young man from her hometown, Sun Jianhong, gained Miss Sheng's favor and became her only lover. At that time, Sun Jianhong was also from a prominent Anhui family and served as the secretary of the Shandong Provincial Finance Department. With his youthful and handsome appearance, he not only matched Miss Sheng in age and looks but also excelled in both modern and classical literature. His works were constantly published in various publications and widely recited. At that time, between Daming Lake and Thousand-Buddha Mountain, this pair of lovers was often seen strolling amidst the beautiful scenery of the lake and mountains, their shadows following each other, adding a beautiful embellishment to the landscape. The people of Jinan all envied Sun Lang's immense good fortune, and Sun Lang also looked down on the literary circle for exclusively possessing such a beauty. At this time, Miss Sheng's family was in poor condition, and Sun Jianhong did his best to provide assistance. This was also a responsibility that Sun Jianhong should fulfill. But there was also another matter that drove their love even further, that was, Miss Sheng's father Sheng Baimin, through Sun Jianhong's introduction, went to Qingdao to work as a tax official, and somehow embezzled public funds. Sheng Baimin was detained in court. For the sake of love, for the sake of being a son-in-law, Sun Jianhong did not hesitate to ruin his family to alleviate the disaster. He sold all his property, went to Qingdao in person, and rescued his father-in-law from the court. In fact, Sun Jianhong was both Miss Sheng's lover and Miss Sheng's benefactor. Therefore, everyone predicted that this happy couple would surely be able to stay together forever.

Seeking a New Partner, Strangers Pass By

Who would have thought that good things are often fraught with setbacks, and fate makes fools of people. In 1928, the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army and the Jinan Massacre - the May 3rd Massacre, forced the postponement of this couple's wedding. Before long, the Shandong Provincial Government was established in Tai'an, and Sun followed the Finance Department to Tai'an. Sheng Zufeng also went to Tai'an to participate in the Shandong Provincial Party Affairs Training Class. Her father Sheng Baimin served as the editor of the Chenguang Daily. Logically speaking, their wedding was very likely to be held in Tai'an. Unexpectedly, after Sheng arrived in Tai'an, she was baptized by the tide of revolution and became a progressive member of the women's circle. Everyone praised her as the flower of the Party Affairs Training Class. The people who came and went with Miss Sheng every day were all dignitaries in the Party and government at that time. A great change took place in her mind, causing her to forget the thousands of favors that Sun Jianhong had shown her. She felt that she was a proud child of the revolution, a darling of the times. With Sun Jianhong as just a Finance Department clerk, his position was small and his head was young. How could he be Miss Sheng's lifelong companion? She wholeheartedly wanted to seek a new ideal partner, or marry a member of the Provincial Party Department, or a Ph.D. who had studied abroad, which would be in line with her logic. Thus, the previous love for Sun Jianhong gradually faded away. "Sun Lang is now a stranger," no longer able to be Miss Sheng's attendant.

Wielding the Sword of Wisdom, Severing the Threads of烦恼

Sheng Zufeng further forced Sun Jianhong, demanding that he dissolve their engagement, and told him: "Unless you can immediately become a county magistrate, or have assets of more than several tens of thousands of yuan, there is still room for discussion. Otherwise, give up your heart and don't even think about being Miss Sheng's husband." Sun Jianhong suffered this major blow, truly like a bolt from the blue, falling off a cliff. All day long he was crazy and didn't drink or eat. He repeatedly thought of suicide. Fortunately, his colleagues and friends persuaded him and no accident occurred. After a considerable period of time, Sun Jianhong made the determination that "a true man need not worry about having no wife." He cut off his hair, severed the threads of love, and got rid of all烦恼. He immediately changed his name to Sun Gengsheng, indicating that the past Sun Jianhong was dead, and the current Sun Gengsheng was a new man, determined to improve. Before long, he truly became a county magistrate, fighting for a breath of air for poor clerks, and married and had children, establishing a family. His family life was very happy, and he warmed and repaired the scars in his heart.

New People Laughing, Old People Crying

But seeing new people laughing, who hears old people crying? When Sun Jianhong was seeking death and extremely distressed, it was precisely the time when Sheng Zufeng was displaying her social skills and making a big splash. She was in the limelight and invincible. Although a certain member of the Provincial Party Department was once considered a friend by Miss Sheng, his proposal was never successful. Later, a Ph.D. who studied in the United States, Mr. Zhang Hongji, uniquely obtained the favor of the peacock screen and became Miss Sheng's husband. They were very affectionate. Later, they went to Qingdao together, and their feelings were still very good. The love tragedy that was once circulated in Shandong society gradually came to an end and was no longer mentioned by anyone.

Beauty Aging, Love Unreliable

On July 7, 1937, the sound of gunfire at Lugou Bridge ignited the flames of war everywhere. Chinese people were defending their motherland and resisting Japan. Before long, the war clouds spread to Shandong. Zhang Hongji also took his beloved wife and fled to the rear, Chongqing, working at the Beibei Compilation Museum. However, the couple's feelings suddenly deteriorated. Was it the waning of color and love? Or were there other reasons? Outsiders did not know the inside story. But before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Zhang Hongji suddenly abandoned Sheng Zufeng, saying that Sheng Zufeng had a mental illness. After divorcing, he left Beibei and went to Chengdu to become a professor at a certain university. At this point, Sheng Zufeng became a cast-off wife.

The Body of Catkins, Difficult to Chase Yanghua

After Sheng Zufeng was abandoned, she truly became half-crazy. At first, she still lived in Beibei, calling out for her husband everywhere, and saying that her husband was coming to pick her up soon. Someone asked if she was divorced? She was at a loss. Later, she was evicted from the Beibei hotel. She carried her only wicker basket and a quilt, left Beibei, and took a boat all the way to Chongqing. At Chaotianmen Wharf, she took a sedan chair, bumping around for a long time, but never found her husband. The sedan chair bearer also saw that her nerves were abnormal and pushed her off the sedan chair. She herself walked into a new hotel on Zhongzheng Road in Chaotianmen, broke into a room that already had a man living in it, saying it was her husband and she must live inside. People drove her out again. She turned to a high slope across the street, a place called "Chaotian Hua." Because of the fire lanes, there were some bricks piled up next to the doors of the houses on both sides, and there was also a tile on the roof. Regardless of the wind and rain, she was all cramped in this place, actually making it Miss Sheng's temporary boudoir. I don't know whether Miss Sheng, in the scenery of spring days, winter nights, summer openings, and autumn palace locusts, had ever recalled her past, and whether she felt that she had become沾泥The pants were not long enough to devote herself to the social occasions, and compete with a group of flying杨花Up and down!

Sun Lang Affectionate, Miss Thin Fate

Miss Sheng also wrote very beautiful characters on the walls and the ground in her place of residence, looking for her lost husband, thus causing a sensation in the nearby neighborhood. Seeing this highly educated woman fallen to this state, everyone felt pity and sympathy. Every day, several charitable women would bring her food to eat. Before long, a Shandong lady passed by this place and turned the matter over to the Shandong folks. There were many people who gave her money and clothes, and also reported to the leaders of the Shandong women's circle to find ways to help her. Soon, her teacher picked her up at a hotel in "Lianglukou," while the Shandong folks donated a part of the money to her, and wrote a letter to her husband in Chengdu, but the reply said, "They have already divorced and cannot intervene." At the same time, several wealthy friends she made in Tai'an were also in Chongqing, but all refused to admit that they knew her. Only one lover who was abandoned by her, Sun Jianhong, who changed his name to Sun Gengsheng, was deeply affectionate and did not remember the old grudges. Standing in a compassionate position, he sent her a lot of money. But this miss's fate was too thin. Before long, this crazy miss was evicted from the hotel by the owner and wandered the streets of Chongqing. At first, she was still seen begging along the street, but later she gradually disappeared. When everyone saw her on the street, who could have thought that she was the beauty that thousands of people were pursuing twenty years ago?

### Quiet Baoshan City

— Baoshan, 2nd Dispatch Zhong Ying

Baoshan has no mountains, but is an ancient, desolate, and desolate small county town. It squats quietly every day at the end of the Yangtze River, where the water and the sky are the same color. Its shape is square, like a piece of dried tofu. That kind of humble and embarrassing situation is very pathetic. You see, the city gates are old and broken, the city walls are thin and low, the battlements have collapsed, and the whole body is full of bullet marks. Indeed, it is a patient who has been through thick and thin and is covered with scars. It has been subjected to the tyranny of artillery fire, it has been subjected to the abuse of massacre, it has climbed out of the tiger's mouth, and it has jumped out of the devil's clutches.

Victory Park, Martyrs' Shrine Stele

If you walk into the city, you will definitely be startled, because the city is full of rubble, broken walls and ruins, which are all eye-catching. We can very well use the words "wild smoke and weeds fly together, courtyard mice and wild rabbits gallop" to describe him. This is not my excessive description, nor is it my good at publicity. You only need to look at the Baoshan County Martyrs' Tongbei Record written by Mr. Yuan Xiluo in Victory Park in Baoshan City, and you can be convinced of it. The most alarming part of the inscription is the following passage of fact:

"...On January 28, 1932, the Japanese sent troops to invade my Baoshan, Shanghai. The officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army stationed in Shanghai, motivated by righteous indignation, rose up to resist the enemy, and fought a bloody battle with the Japanese for a month and five days. 30,000 brave men were killed and wounded more than 20,000, with lack of equipment and no assistance, they retreated to Liuhuo, and the entire county fell for three months. The houses in the county seat and Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhabei, and the city that were destroyed by artillery fire were five or six out of ten. Tens of thousands of people were killed and injured..." This was the first great catastrophe of Baoshan, but soon the "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War broke out again in 1937. This war was even more fierce than the last one. Now let us continue to read the inscription.

"...On August 13 (according to 1937), the Japanese attacked my Wusong and Shanghai with land, sea, and air forces. Our army fought a bloody battle with the enemy for three months. There were not enough weapons and ammunition, and 300,000 people were killed and wounded. The entire county fell again, and Shanghai fell..." This was the second great catastrophe of Baoshan. It can be said that the war was shocking to the world and weeping to the gods. The loss was huge and difficult to calculate. Therefore, Baoshan, a small county town, not only became famous throughout the country, but also reached the world and knew its great name. Baomen can very well imagine and foresee that its desolation and desolation are indeed inevitable.

Difficult Transportation, Insufficient Rice Supply

Baoshan borders the river, half surrounded by the river, and is tightly surrounded by the river, so the east gate is the river, and the north gate is also the river. Only the south gate can lead to Wusong, and the west gate can lead to towns such as Yuepu and Luodian. The transportation is not very convenient, especially after the previous great catastrophes, the roads were completely destroyed. Because of the financial difficulties, they have not been repaired yet. There are no business or government-run cars running on the road. What you see is only the bicycles that are flying like arrows and flowing endlessly. Originally, bicycles were very popular in Baoshan. Whether it is an old man or a little girl, they can ride. They not only ride bicycles back and forth between Wusong, Yuepu, Luodian and other places, but also go to Shanghai, which is very far away, in the morning and return in the evening, which is common. Therefore, in the case of difficult transportation, bicycles have become their only tool.

The soil of Baoshan is completely sandy and is not suitable for planting rice, but can only grow cotton, so it is a cotton-producing area. There is a great shortage of rice, and most of it relies on supply from other ports. Therefore, the price of rice is more expensive than in any other place. At this time when the price of rice is as expensive as pearls and the price of firewood is as expensive as cinnamon, and everything is rising, how can the poor people think of a way to survive? According to the survey, very few people in this place eat white rice. Most of them eat wheat rice cooked with wheat and brown rice. The yellow and coarse rice makes us want to vomit, but they swallow it regardless of everything.

### Today's View of Cancer

— Sun Zengyi

The term "cancer," which is not new but extremely terrible, is probably widely noticed. Indeed, it is a killer that does not blink an eye and is full of terrifying terminal illnesses. According to a report from the National Cancer Institute in the United States, on average, one person dies from this terrible disease every three minutes. Although there are no reliable records in our country, I think it will not be less than this number. From this, we can know that it is a huge loss to national production and national economy.

Although this disease existed in the "prehistoric period," it was only in recent centuries that its universality has been recognized by medical professionals. In our daily consultation and other experiences, the chance of encountering cancer every day seems to be increasing. However, this does not mean that there were absolutely few cancer patients in the past: this is the credit of many pathologists and clinical researchers, so that the symptoms of this disease can be recognized early and correctly, so as not to be ignored. Now, not to mention doctors, even ordinary people with a relatively high level of health and medical knowledge can suspect the possibility of cancer. However, there are not many people who know the general idea of its causes, characteristics, and no hope of cure. I will elaborate on these points here.

In a broad sense, cancer is a type of tumor, that is, what is commonly known as a malignant tumor. It is the abnormal growth of certain body cells, the loss of control, so that it erodes and damages the growth or function of normal cells or neighboring tissues, eventually leading to the consumption of human nutrition and even death. The speed of its growth, the distance of its migration, and the size of its spread are all beyond human control. Even if this tumor is completely removed, it cannot permanently prevent its speed from migrating in any case. For example, although rectal cancer has been surgically removed, it may still migrate to unrelated organs such as the liver. According to this view, this is purely caused by abnormal cells. If we want to study its treatment plan, we must first thoroughly investigate its causes and roots, why cells become abnormal, and the difference between normal cells and cancer cells. Then, the symptomatic treatment of cancer may be possible.

Not a Contagious Disease

Many people still think that cancer is contagious, but so far there is no precedent for doctors, nurses or family members of patients being infected with the same disease due to contact. Some people even inoculated the tissue of patients diagnosed as cancer by biopsy under the skin, but there was no cancer phenomenon after decades. In the past 100 years, Dutch guinea pigs and rabbits have been used as experimental animals, and there is no evidence of contagion. At present, the cause of cancer is non-contagious. It is caused by the congenital or acquired increase in the sensitivity of human cells to cancer, or by the erosion of carcinogens (Car inogan) in its suitable environment. The influence of heredity is also a major inducement. There are often families in which several generations suffer from cancer (the location and nature may be different). The reason can be explained by the specific or particularly sensitive receptivity of cells. Twins who are completely identical in embryology have many opportunities to develop similar cancers at the same time. From this, it can be known that if the genetic influence is similar, the sensitivity of cells to cancer is also the same. If the genetic influence is different in different families, the cell sensitivity is also different. Even the sensitivity of the same person to various cancers changes from time to time in his life, with no rules to follow.

Alarming Mortality Rate

What is even more unspeakable is that ordinary people often think that cancer is a disease that is easy to suffer from after middle age. However, according to statistics from the American Cancer Research Institute, in 1942, more children under the age of five died from cancer than from acute nephritis or infantile paralysis. In the same year, among children aged 5 to 9 and 10 to 14, the cancer mortality rate was higher than that of dysentery, pertussis, diphtheria, or measles. Therefore, although cancer is more common in middle-aged and elderly patients because of more opportunities to contact carcinogens, its harm to infants, even if not much, is truly unheard of.

The progress of medical science in recent years is not insignificant. Taking the four major diseases of human beings as an example, inflammation has both sulfonamide preparations and penicillin. Although it cannot be said to be effective in all cases, at least it should be more than 70% sure. As for tuberculosis, which is no less harmful than cancer, there are also antibiotics such as Streptothnicin. Although it has not been successful in clinical practice, at least there is already a glimmer of hope. And the tuberculosis treatment invented in Taiwan recently is also booming with unlimited prospects. Only the effective treatment of cancer, which is the most harmful and serious, is still lacking. Everyone is very concerned about its success, and medical scientists and scientists in various countries are sparing no effort to research it. Is there any hope of success? I will also briefly explain it here.

No Effective Drug

To study the treatment of cancer, some people think that we must first find an animal that has absolutely no cancer tendency or very little cancer, and then analyze it to study the differences between this kind of animal and animals that are particularly susceptible to cancer, or to find out the difference in their resistance and sensitivity to carcinogenic substances, and then have a way to improve or correct it. Unfortunately, cancer is prevalent in various domestic animals, animals, frogs, fish, chickens and mice. Even in plants, there is a disease similar to cancer. So the effort in this area has failed so far.

Secondly, some people began to pay attention to the time factor required from the time when they were eroded by carcinogens to the time when cancer first appeared. According to someone's statistics, one person changed to another industry after working for different periods of time (especially aniline dyes), and the water did not contact this carcinogen, but he or she may develop bladder cancer after one to seventeen years. X-ray doctors, nurses, or technicians may develop skin cancer one to eleven years after the last contact. Cancer can appear at the affected area one month to two years after a single burn. Therefore, the occurrence of cancer can be divided into long-distance and shortcuts. Sometimes, a primary cancer can produce a large group of secondary cancers in other places, while sometimes it does not. Some grow rapidly, while others grow very slowly. There may be a recessive period of slow growth in the middle, followed by rapid migration or spread. Some will enter the recessive period forever, and a very small number can enter the stationary period and disappear completely. Therefore, there must be some mysterious substances in our body that accelerate, slow down or resist the occurrence of cancer, or there must be favorable or unfavorable environments that affect its growth. If this mystery can be broken, the treatment of cancer will enter a new era.

Research on Carcinogens

The third is the research on carcinogens. We already know that even the most ordinary sunlight, ultraviolet light, X-rays, and other radioactive substances, as well as several coal tar dyes, especially aniline, are well-known exogenous carcinogens. Genetic factors or special sensitivity to carcinogens are all endogenous carcinogens. Even if the endogenous ones cannot be removed, the exogenous ones can be avoided as much as possible, so that the possibility of cancer will be reduced.

In short, cancer is by no means an incurable disease. If the spirit, material resources, and manpower of the atomic bomb research can be used properly, then with the rapid development of medical science, the early effective treatment of cancer is hoped for. However, at present, we should do our best to avoid suffering from this terrible disease. If you have this disease, you should ask a scientific doctor for early diagnosis and reasonable treatment as soon as possible, so that at least life can be extended and pain can be reduced. Do not delay the opportunity for treatment and cause yourself trouble. There are often patients who neglect to delay the early operable gastric cancer for a long time, until it migrates to the liver, peritoneum, etc., and produces jaundice ascites before seeking medical treatment, then the time for timely surgical treatment has passed, and the treatment results are naturally not the same as those who had early diagnosis and reasonable treatment. If this is the case, the treatment of cancer depends on the mutual cooperation between the patient and the doctor, and it will be successful. If one party neglects, the efforts will be in vain.

### An Open Letter to All Fellow Tuberculosis Patients

— Wu Shaoqing

For the past few months, I have received inquiries from patients in various regions regarding their opinions on the various new tuberculosis drugs that have appeared on the market recently. Fearing that I cannot answer each one individually, I am taking this opportunity to provide a more detailed explanation in this column, offering sincere advice and hoping for your careful consideration!

Over the past century, countries around the world have spared no effort in exploring new drugs for treating tuberculosis. Almost every year, new drugs have been introduced. To date, there are countless varieties, ranging from chemical drugs and metallic preparations to bacterial vaccines and antitoxic bacterial solutions. More recently, we have seen Diason, Promin, Promizole, Stepharanthin, and Streptomycin, among others. The sheer number and variety are overwhelming. Each time a new drug is launched, manufacturers worldwide compete to promote it, and patients generally place great hope in it, believing that an effective medicine has finally been invented, allowing them to be cured and escape their suffering! However, before long, they find themselves wasting money and regretting their decision, as such cases are all too common.

Regarding any tuberculosis drug, there are three aspects worth researching before it is used on humans, which I will elaborate on below:

(1) Toxicity of the Drug: Before any drug is used, it should first be tested on animals to determine its toxicity, pharmacological effects, and dosage, including the effective dose, maximum dose, toxic dose, and lethal dose. Only after it has been proven effective and non-toxic should it be tested on humans.

(2) The Bactericidal Power of the Drug Against Tuberculosis Bacteria: This must be studied and explored by bacteriologists to be reliable. Often, a drug may effectively control or kill tuberculosis bacteria cultured in a test tube. However, it may prove ineffective when tested on animals. Furthermore, some drugs may kill tuberculosis bacteria cultured in a test tube and show promising results in animal experiments, such as improving symptoms, inhibiting the disease, and reducing mortality rates. However, when used on humans, they may ultimately fail in clinical practice. For example, the newly developed Streptomycin and Diason in the United States were studied by American specialists, and the results showed that they could control the reproduction of tuberculosis bacteria cultured in test tubes. Subsequent animal experiments also proved that they had relatively good results. However, even after their use on patients, there is no universally recognized effective function to this day. On the contrary, this hope is gradually fading, but research and improvement are ongoing. This is because the human body's cellular tissues, its internal resistance mechanisms, and its natural immune factors are very different from those of experimental animals. What works in animals may not necessarily work in humans. Therefore, to determine whether a drug is effective, one must carefully observe its performance in test tubes, after animal experiments, and in clinical applications on patients. One cannot take things out of context and generalize.

(3) The Efficacy of the Drug on Tuberculosis: After a patient takes a new tuberculosis drug, it is essential to study whether the tuberculous lesions in their body are gradually improving, whether there is any progress after repeated X-ray examinations, whether the patient's general health condition has improved significantly after taking the drug, and whether the tuberculosis bacteria in the sputum have decreased. All of these are standards for measuring the efficacy of tuberculosis treatment.

In conclusion, before a new tuberculosis drug is launched, it should be carefully examined and thoroughly researched in the three aspects mentioned above. I dare not introduce it lightly. If patients purchase and take drugs on their own without being able to detect signs of poisoning, and rely on luck, the risk is even greater. In short, these so-called miracle drugs are still in the experimental stage and have not yet moved beyond animal and clinical trials. In today's age of scientific advancement, the methods we generally recognize for treating tuberculosis are still aimed at increasing the human body's resistance, stabilizing the affected area of the lungs, and performing various surgeries aimed at compressing the lungs. The methods vary, but the key is to choose wisely. If the disease has progressed to a late stage, the affected area is extensive, and the patient's general resistance is declining, even the best methods may be ineffective! I hope that patients will pay attention, avoid easily believing manufacturers' advertising, and being misled by them. Losing money is a small matter, but damaging one's health is something to regret.

### A Brief Discussion on Leprosy

— Qin Qixian

Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The most severely affected tissues are the skin and nerves. The symptoms vary widely, including local numbness, rashes, nodules, ulcers, and disabilities. Leprosy is widespread throughout the world, and is most easily propagated in tropical, temperate, and humid regions. In China, it is more common in Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Jiangsu, and less common in the north, except for Shandong. The methods of transmission are theoretically inconsistent, but most are due to contact with patients, coupled with other contributing factors such as poor nutrition, poverty, hunger and cold, humid living conditions, and large populations. People between the ages of ten and forty are more susceptible to the disease, and men are more likely to contract it than women. The incubation period of leprosy is quite long, ranging from a few months to several decades, with an average of about two to four years. In 1931, Mr. Wu Deyi of the West divided leprosy into the following three categories:

A. Neural Leprosy: This category includes all cases where the nerves have suffered damage from leprosy, such as sensory abnormalities, changes in pigmentation and circulation, nutritional disturbances, paralysis, atrophy, and ulcers.

B. Cutaneous Leprosy: This category includes all cases where the skin has suffered damage from leprosy. It can be divided into three types according to the severity of the damage.

C. Mixed Leprosy: A combination of both types.

Symptoms of Leprosy

A. Initial Symptoms: Leprosy is not easily recognized in its early stages. Sometimes, it begins with fever, headache, back pain, poor digestion, and lethargy. Occasionally, rashes appear on the skin at the same time, or a particular part of the body may be especially painful and sweat less. After a month and a half, the symptoms of leprosy become fully apparent, and one finally realizes what it is.

B. Cutaneous Leprosy: In the early stages, small patches of skin exhibit rash-like spots that are not easily noticed. One does not seek medical attention until many areas of the face and limbs appear. These rashes are congestive, initially appearing purplish-red and then coffee-colored, with a slightly wrinkled, scaly surface that is thick and slightly raised at the edges. They gradually merge, resembling ring-shaped or lobed patterns. Subsequently, the skin gradually becomes rough, and nodules may form, taking several months to several years. Eventually, the face becomes covered with nodules, making it difficult to recognize, resembling a lion's face. If the nasal mucosa or skin is examined, Mycobacterium leprae can be seen in 80-90% of cases.

C. Neural Leprosy: It also begins with rashes, but they are larger than those of cutaneous leprosy. Pigmentation changes occur early. The center of the rash gradually loses color, becoming pale and numb, while the edges expand. At this time, the nerves experience tingling, pain, itching, and reduced sweating. Over time, nutrition is impaired, the muscles in the affected area atrophy, and sensory abnormalities occur. The cervical nerves become noticeably thickened. Eventually, ulcers form, and even the hands and feet may fall off. Patients may experience pain day and night, and various complications such as keratitis, laryngitis, and pneumonia may arise spontaneously.

Prevention of Leprosy

The method of prevention is aimed at preventing the invasion of bacteria and inhibiting their development. Apart from what humans can do, such as preventing natural disasters, the steps for prevention are divided into individual and public:

A. Individual Prevention:

First, emphasize cleanliness: Mycobacterium leprae mainly invades through the skin, so keeping the skin clean is essential.

Second, be mindful of nutrition: Poor nutrition easily causes disease, and leprosy is no exception.

Third, do not overdo it: Whether it is work, play, or diet, do not overdo it to avoid reducing the body's resistance.

Fourth, avoid contact: Skin rashes and nodules in the early stages of leprosy are highly contagious, accounting for more than 90% of cases.

B. Public Prevention:

It depends on everyone's cooperation to improve people's lives, instill health knowledge, establish specialized institutions to educate talent to study the development, treatment, and prevention of the disease, investigate leprosy areas, examine suspected patients, and treat and isolate those diagnosed with the disease.

As for the treatment of leprosy, preparations of chaulmoogra oil are commonly administered by intramuscular injection for several months or years. Whether the disease improves depends entirely on the severity of the symptoms and the patient's ability to patiently receive treatment.

New Medical Insights

### Another New Antimalarial Drug

— Ming

During the war, the United States engaged in antimalarial drug research with government support. Under the direction of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), the Board for Coordination of Malarial Studies was organized, uniting national public and private research institutions to engage in this research. Over the years, a total of more than seven million U.S. dollars has been spent on the research of tens of thousands of drugs. The last issue of this publication already reported on Chloroquine (or Chloroquinol), referred to as SN7618 in the order of research. On October 12, Dr. R.F. Loed, chairman of the Board, also reported a new antimalarial drug, referred to as SN13,276 in order, named Pentaguine, representing another major advance in antimalarial drug research. It is said that tertian malaria is not easily cured. After treatment with quinine or Atabrine, more than 60% of patients relapse, and some as high as 90%. When combined with these two drugs, Paludrine can indeed reduce the relapse rate, but many patients still relapse, and its toxicity is very high. Improper use can easily lead to malaria. The antimalarial efficacy of Pentaguine in chicken malaria experiments is 80 times that of quinine and 8 times that of Paludrine, but its toxicity to mice is only one-third that of Paludrine. Therefore, its efficacy and safety are better than Paludrine. According to clinical experiments, if Pentaguine is used at 60 mg per day (equivalent to 80 mg of its phosphate) and quinine at 2 grams per day, once every four hours, for 14 consecutive days, it can cure severe tertian malaria and prevent its recurrence. However, the daily dose of this drug should not exceed 60 mg and should be used under the supervision of a doctor, as its clinical application has not yet moved beyond the experimental stage.

### New Case of Cured Tuberculous Meningitis

— Shao

Tuberculous meningitis is a serious disease, with a mortality rate of almost 100%. Although the literature contains reports of approximately 60 recovery cases, the diagnosis in many of these cases is questionable. Cooke et al. first reported earlier this year that tuberculous meningitis in a one-year-old infant was cured with streptomycin. In September, Keefer et al. reported four cases of this disease cured with streptomycin. However, the various neurological sequelae left after the cure of each case mean that the ultimate prognosis cannot be considered good.

Recently, Krefchik of New Jersey reported in the October 19 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association a case that was completely cured after streptomycin treatment, with no residual symptoms, which is particularly noteworthy. The patient was a 15-month-old boy, diagnosed with tuberculous meningitis, who began streptomycin treatment two weeks after contracting the disease. The treatment lasted a total of 57 days, with a total streptomycin dose of 24 million units by intramuscular injection and 2.8 million units by intrathecal injection (65 spinal taps).

### Soviet Russia Values Lysozyme

— Shao

Lysozyme was discovered by British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming in 1921, before he discovered penicillin. This element has a very strong and rapid bacteriolytic effect, but its effect on common pathogenic bacteria is weak. Therefore, Fleming quickly abandoned it and did not continue to study it. Few scholars have paid attention to it since. However, just as scholars at Oxford were re-examining Fleming's discovery of penicillin, Soviet scholars became interested in lysozyme, and its use was not limited to medicine but also used in industry.

The lysozyme used in the Soviet Union is mainly made from chicken egg white, and sometimes from red or white grapes. It is said to be able to kill streptococci and staphylococci, and to inhibit the reproduction of dysentery bacilli, typhoid bacilli, and cholera vibrios.

Clinically, it is mainly used for infectious wounds, especially for the prevention and treatment of corneal wound infections, and also for preparation before skin grafting. According to Voronova's report, this element is also very effective for childhood diarrhea.

In industry, its crude products are used in the manufacture of caviar. Fish eggs washed with its solution can be kept fresh for up to a year, and the solution is also used to soak hemp, making the fibers easier to separate.

Spring and Autumn

### Chen Shuren, the Immortal in Painting

— Xu Zhongnian

From December 5th to 11th, 1946, Mr. Chen Shuren, a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, held an exhibition at the Cultural Hall in Xiangpu Camp, Nanjing, displaying his works from before and after the War of Resistance, including portraits, landscapes, birds, animals, fish, insects, and sketches of the Pearl River, the Yangtze River, and famous scenic spots in Sichuan. It was truly a grand spectacle! Unfortunately, I am still detained in Shanghai, and I may not be able to participate in this grand event. Perhaps the Central University will officially start classes within these six days, and I will be able to go to Nanjing to see Chen Shuren and his works again.

I say "see again" for a reason. Back in 1935 and 1936, in order to prepare "Chen Shuren's Recent Works" (The Commercial Press), which was included in the "Sino-French Cultural Undertakings," I met with Chen Shuren almost every day to discuss the contents of the collection: selecting paintings, making plates, explaining, and writing the preface. Chen Shuren is a very free and easy person, and I myself don't understand social niceties. To put it bluntly, we became kindred spirits despite the age difference! At that time, the weather was very cold, and Chen Shuren often took his whole family and me to small restaurants to eat hot pot or Mongolian hot pot. Since the War of Resistance, Chen Shuren's demeanor has remained the same, but the author's hair has turned white, and he has lost the leisurely mood of those years! This "Chen Shuren's Recent Works" was originally prepared for Chinese and foreign audiences, so it has a rather long Chinese preface and a French preface, as well as a French explanation added before each painting. The printing was the best of all the color prints of The Commercial Press. Mr. Wang Yunwu certainly knows this very well. This collection received unanimous praise from critics at home and abroad, which also reflects the high quality of Chen Shuren's paintings. Next, I prepared "Zhang Shuyi's Recent Works" and contacted "Xu Beihong's Recent Works." After Zhang Shuyi's paintings were selected, they were reviewed by Mr. Wang Yunwu, and the paintings were stored in The Commercial Press. The "August 13 Incident" broke out, and everything became a bubble! However, what is gratifying is that in recent years, Zhang Shuyi's paintings have made rapid progress. At the Chinese Academy of Art in Panxi, opposite the Jialing River in Chongqing, Xu Beihong personally agreed to me participating in the set of books. In addition, I also planned to prepare "Qi Baishi's Recent Works," "Zhang Daqian's Recent Works," "Wang Yachen's Recent Works," etc. I sincerely hope that Mr. Zhu Jingnong, who succeeded Mr. Wang Yunwu as the head of The Commercial Press, will fulfill this scholar's grand wish to serve the country as soon as the economic situation improves!

I am most afraid of seeing high officials, because they are somewhat abnormal physically and psychologically: their eyes are higher than those of ordinary people, and their skeletons are also larger than ours (but they suffer from severe rickets). They speak in a bureaucratic tone, and the vocabulary they use is different from ours. They are somewhat like the smiling ghosts described in anecdotal novels! Chen Shuren was once a high official, an important person; but today, he is still a high official who does not hold the power of life and death. He is always smiling, but he is not a ghost! He is like a crane, he is like a plum blossom, he is like a lotus flower that grows out of mud without being stained. He is noble, natural, kind, and approachable, without any hint of worldliness, and even less the behavior of an artistic nouveau riche. Anyone who has been close to Chen Shuren will agree with my statement.

Words are the voice of the heart, and paintings are the shadow of the heart. Chen Shuren's paintings resemble Chen Shuren's personality. No matter what painting material Chen Shuren takes, what his paintings show is a piece of serenity. Even if he paints a ferocious beast, the picture will never be tense. This sentence, at first hearing, seems to be a subtle criticism; but after careful study, it is not. Let us put aside painting for the time being and talk about the reality of nature: if you face the head of a lion (this is the head of an African lion, but a specimen) and look at it for a moment, you will find that its expression is very serene: the lion is the king of beasts, and it is enough to resist all violent attacks, so why be nervous? Therefore, great wisdom seems foolish, and great courage seems cowardly, but it is not true foolishness or true cowardice. The serenity of Chen Shuren's paintings is not lifeless. Chen Shuren mostly uses bright colors; "bright" color is not necessarily a "warm" color. Those who love to use bright colors are often people with broad minds and no ink hindrance: Chen Shuren is like this. Sometimes, the colors Chen Shuren uses are extremely bright, but he can avoid vulgarity and give people a sense of spiritual sunshine.

Chen Shuren wants to build a house on the banks of West Lake and spend the rest of his life painting. When will this beautiful dream be realized? I will follow him around, strolling on the Su and Bai embankments, and exhale the worldliness accumulated in my chest.

### Four Poems on Reading History

— Cheng Tixuan

I

Boyi was ashamed of the millet of Zhou, Ziqing held the Han festival. Singing in the Western Mountains to pick Wei, eating snow in the cold North Sea. The square inch is in my control, and the mouth and stomach do not feed people. Raising the righteous energy in a magnificent way, not humiliating the body in the discussion. Poverty and meanness cannot be moved, and power cannot be yielded. Therefore, the gentleman, cherishes chastity in keeping his body.

II

In the Later Han Dynasty there was Liu Xun, and in the Five Dynasties there was Feng Dao. One was the Duke of Anle, and the other was called the Old Man of Changle. Surrendering and overthrowing the country, and protecting the heavens for the second time. The axe and Yue were strict in execution, and the historical pen was still clear. Wealth is like floating clouds, and life is like morning dew. Be careful, the seven-foot body, do not leave ten thousand years of odor.

III

Yan Ying assisted King Qi, wearing the same coat for thirty years. Tao Kan supervised Jingzhou, and carried hundreds of bricks every morning and evening. Practice hard work to defend the country, and frugality to love the people. Extravagance really corrupts virtue, and ease and pleasure lead to death. The book says that farming is difficult, and the Book of Changes says that the sky is healthy. What should I learn in my life, what I learn is diligence and thrift.

IV

Clothed in cloth, living in Nanyang, farming as if forgetting the world. I admire Zhuge Liang, with a simple and clear ambition. Xiucai is a good minister, worrying about the people first and enjoying pleasure later. I admire Fan Xiwu, whose achievements shine on the nine borders. In poverty, he does good for himself, and in success, he does good for the world. Unable to be an official or a hermit, what is the point of being restless?

### A Casual Talk on Female Writers

— Tan Yi

Zhao Qingge, a "Remarkable Woman"

In the current literary scene, in terms of provinces and regions, there are too few female writers from Henan. Apart from Feng Yuanjun from Tanghe, Zhao Qingge from Xinyang should be considered unique in the literary world. In terms of the number of works, although Feng is older than Zhao, Zhao's plays, novels, and essays to date, except for "Shuang Su Shuang Fei" serialized in Shen Bao which has not yet been published, have no less than twenty single editions.

Speaking of Zhao Qingge's works, of course, plays are the best. Among the plays, "Tao Li Chunfeng," which won the Ministry of Education's award and was selected as one of the four excellent plays, co-authored with Lao She, is the most valued. But in my personal opinion, "Tao Li Chunfeng" is not as rich in literary meaning as "Sheng Si Lian." "Sheng Si Lian" depicts a female actor who, for the sake of justice, uses her intelligence and beauty to play with important members of the puppet organization while protecting patriotic underground workers, eventually sacrificing her life for her country and love. She writes the heroine just right. It neither falls into the nest of anti-Japanese stereotypes, nor does Zhu write her as a knight in a detective novel who appears and disappears mysteriously. And the plot is tense and lively, tortuous and interesting. In the end, it is allowed to move people to tears.

According to her self-introduction in "Sheng Si Lian," the script has been revised three times and revised four times. After its publication, various places in the rear scrambled to stage it. Since then, she has continued to write several plays with anti-Japanese, educational, and love themes. In her plays, they are full of the beautiful, gentle, and delicate warmth of girls. Of course, with her background and personality, the articles she writes will never have those arrogant, fiery things. And people who do not know her, only read her works, always think that she has been tumbling in the love field, and has tasted the honey or bitter water of love in order to appreciate the taste of it. In fact, she is a typical northern lady. Not only does she not have a lover, but she is also very measured in social situations. Although she has many friends in the literary world, whether young, old, colorful, or colorless, she interacts with them. But, she can maintain her purity, maintain her own position, and will never be influenced by anyone or any objective environment. It is precisely because of this reason that she can be loved in all aspects.

Although she is from Henan, she left Henan very early. When she was in her teens, she took a pen from Kaifeng to Shanghai, reading and writing articles, and supporting herself with her own labor until now. Because she does not rely on any political forces, nor does she need anyone's economic assistance, her life was very bitter during the War of Resistance, but her spirit was very happy. After receiving royalties and royalties, she bought a bottle of fine wine and invited a few literary friends, no matter whether they were men or women, and drank to their heart's content. She has never realized that she is a girl, especially when she is with old people, when she drinks a few more cups, she becomes more excited and unrestrained.

In addition to drinking, she also loves to eat good tea and good cigarettes. This may be related to her writing life, without cigarettes, tea and wine, she is simply like losing her life. Therefore, almost 60% of her royalty income is consumed on these three things.

Tian Han once gave a poem to her when he was in Beibei, Sichuan. It is still hanging in her Shanghai writing office. The poem says:

"Since ancient times, there have been many strange men in the Zhao family, and Qingge is as graceful as a strong man. She wears a hat without makeup, and can talk about armaments while drinking. How can she know the warmth and coldness of the spring water, and not know the bitterness and sweetness of camellia. Dare to seek painting materials in Jialing, and play cotton like rain in the big Henan."

Can be used as a portrait of Qingge. At that time, she was editing "Dan Hua Wenyi" and had a great liking for men's clothing.

Recently, she adapted "Dream of the Red Chamber" into four plays. Three of them have been published, and the fourth is serialized in Wen Chao Monthly. According to her, she will change her style and engage in long novels from now on.

Judging from the few long creations she has published, such as "Feng" and "Yue Shang Liu Shao Tou," I believe her achievements are always greater than plays.

Recently, she became a teacher of Qi Baishi. A newspaper said that she would give up writing and engage in painting. In fact, the word "learning" is quite inappropriate, because she can paint, and the style is very high, but she is not willing to write easily. Few people have seen her works except for one or two close friends.

In addition, she can sing Peking Opera, has written Pingju scripts, and has served as the director of the Central Youth Pingju Troupe. She has composed songs for Tianyi Film Company. Fewer people know about these things.

Finally, there is a joke. A reader, because he admired her works, specially wrote a letter to her to pay tribute, the opening sentence was "My beloved Qing Weng Lao Fuzi" It turned out that this person looked at her name and mistakenly thought that she was an "old" gentleman with high morals and respect, but in fact she is still in her prime, and in terms of talent and appearance, I am afraid that few contemporary female writers can compare with her.

### Record of Hu Puan

— Tianxing

When I was studying at China Public Institute in Shanghai, the most unforgettable person for me was Mr. Hu Puan. He was from Jing County, Anhui Province, and is now over seventy years old. He has a full face of beard and whiskers, loves to drink heartily, and is not only a national studies expert but also proficient in Tai Chi.

Although he had held high-ranking positions for several years, such as a specialized member of the Examination Yuan and the Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, he is now still penniless and continues to live by writing and teaching.

This teacher Hu is a nationally renowned scholar, but his background is not what people usually imagine: not from a family of scholars with a long tradition of learning, but in reality, he was an apprentice. He told me this:

"In my childhood, I was an apprentice in a shop because my family was very poor. At that time, I was only a teenager. Besides doing my duties in the shop, I stole time to read. Although I had no teachers or friends to guide me, I always felt that reading was beneficial. Regardless of whether I understood it or not, I just read diligently. Eventually, I was able to read a little. At this time, I clearly understood that if I wanted to develop in the future, the first step was to seek knowledge, so I read very diligently. I was even scolded by my boss for reading at night and became seriously ill several times. An opportunity came when a relative introduced me to work as a proofreader in a bookstore. I was so happy then. Of course, proofreading was a very hard job, but I always endured the hardship and continued to work. I gained a lot of knowledge from this proofreading job and read a lot of books. At this time, I felt that I had some formal access to learning. In my spare time, I also wrote poems and essays and submitted them for publication. Some were published, so I worked even harder at writing, and I have been doing so continuously for decades. Later, I often worked as an editor in a bookstore, as a primary school teacher, a middle school teacher, and a university teacher. I also served as the administrative head of a province. After that, I decided not to be an official anymore because being an official requires betraying one's conscience, so I continued to write articles and teach, which was more in line with my nature."

If we carefully think about the above words, we can see that this teacher Hu struggled out of poverty, and that kind of hard-working spirit is worthy of admiration!

In summary, Teacher Hu is currently serving as the lead writer for the "Min Guo Daily." He works from eight in the morning until eight in the evening every day. What do young people think of this spirit of being vigorous in old age?

### An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood 114

— Ye Jingfeng

Turning past the screen, two heavily made-up young women raised an exquisite bamboo curtain. Tsurumi stepped up two steps. As soon as he entered the door, he saw another pair of gorgeously dressed young women inside, one on each side, already prostrate on the ground, seemingly unwilling to get up. Tsurumi now saw clearly what was meant by gorgeously dressed: it was actually two-thirds of a palace dress. Because Konoe had a bit of aristocratic blood, he liked to create a "royal" atmosphere. If it weren't already past noon and the location was close to the sea, with a very cool climate, asking these women to wear such long robes and short jackets, with such large bundles on their backs in such hot weather would be a sin.

This was a very spacious hall, only a little too low. The entire room, except for the electric lights and fans, was decorated in Japanese style. Right in the center, facing the front, was a huge round door. The upper and lower four corners were fitted with extremely beautiful carved lattices, with very elegant colors. In the center of the door lintel hung a plaque about three or four feet wide, somewhat like the hanging area of a Chinese doctor or the sign in the back of a shop. On the plaque, in large, powerful characters that were neither regular nor cursive, were the words "Eternal Military Fortune," written in a lively and vigorous style, only a little crude. On either side of the round flower door hung a couplet, the two most satisfying five-character lines of Ito Hirobumi, the chief culprit of the invasion of the mainland: "Drunk, pillow on a beauty's lap," "Awake, hold the power of the world!" Inside the round door, more than ten feet deep, was another six-panel screen depicting a sunrise landscape with figures.

Inside this door, in front of the screen, was an antique horizontal couch bed with short legs, and in front of the bed were some tea tables. On one of the tea tables near the couch was a set of wine utensils that looked like foreign children's toys. The wine pot was not a pot, but an antique vase-style thing, and the wine cup was so small that it was only enough for less than half a mouthful. To the left and right of the couch knelt another pair of young women, of course, painted red, white, and black - red was rouge, white was lead powder, and black was their thick eyebrows and high-up hairstyles. Two women, one strumming one playing a Wuqin,

On the bed, wearing a house robe and a very broad, very antiquated kimono, lay a man in his fifties. One hand held an ancient thread-bound book, a foot and a half long, and the other hand held the toy-like small wine cup. This was Konoe, the culprit who launched the invasion of the mainland. At this moment, he lay there, perfectly imitating the "refined and profound" and "romantic" appearance of a famous person in ancient paintings. It is said that his national plans were conceived in this state.

When Tsurumi entered this door, the person accompanying or escorting him lightly whispered a word or two to the two women outside the door and slipped away quietly. The two women crawling on the ground inside the room did not raise their heads until Tsurumi reached their sides. They stole a glance at Tsurumi, quickly kowtowed three or four times, then stood up, one on each side, sideways, crouching, and followed behind Tsurumi.

It was about twenty or thirty feet from the doorway to the round door. Tsurumi walked all the way without making any sound because his leather shoes had been taken off, leaving only his socks. The two women were wearing wooden-soled "Geta". Moreover, it was not like the tatami in ordinary people's shops. On top of the tatami was a mat woven from Taiwanese dragon grass, woven into one large sheet according to the size of the entire room, with various patterns and designs. In such hot weather, walking on it made his feet feel soft and cool, and it felt exceptionally comfortable. Of course, no footsteps were heard.

### Poetic Words

— Lin Feng

A good poem not only shows us the reality before our eyes but also shows us the distant views that our sight cannot reach.

Reading a poem is like eating an olive, the more you think about it, the more it has an aftertaste; or like listening to a piece of music, the melodious aftersound lingering in your ears.

If we compare prose to a heavily made-up young woman, then poetry should be a budding maiden.

Free Talk

### Choosing a Capital

— Shaofu

Before the victory of the War of Resistance, in Chongqing in the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the issue of the location of the national capital was once hotly debated. Experts, scholars, commentators, professors, and great speakers filled the newspapers and magazines with lengthy articles, and even publishing houses compiled the great works of various authors into a special collection on the national capital issue for publication.

Everyone's views differed. Jinan, Xi'an, Changchun, Nanjing, Beiping, Hankou, Changsha, and even Luoyang; each argument was reasonable and had its own merits, and in the end, no one recognized the correctness of others' arguments.

Today, less than two years later, this issue has been raised again at the National Assembly in Nanjing for heated discussion.

There should be a premise for this issue: if I am a native of a certain place and strive to have the capital located in that place for the benefit of that place, the motive is not very correct, and in any case, it cannot be used as information for our consideration. Because local interests and local concepts should not be mixed into the discussion of this issue.

Political (domestic and foreign) and economic significance will be the main factors in determining this issue. At the same time, factors such as transportation, population, climate, and culture must also be considered. As for explicitly stipulating it in the constitution, that is probably not necessary!

### Surplus Materials, Slowly Transported. The Reason Is Simple - Why Worry?

— Gezhi

The law of supply and demand in economics states: when supply is greater than demand, prices are low; conversely, when supply is less than demand, prices are high. Anyone who knows a little about business understands this principle.

Reports say that there are a large number of surplus military supplies in Okinawa, left to rot in warehouses. If these materials belonged to someone else, whose country was rich in goods and had already prepared to consume them in the war against the enemy, this small amount would not matter! Besides expressing admiration and regret, what else could we do? However, when I continued to read the news, I suddenly realized that 'these materials have been sold to the Chinese National Government,' and I suddenly realized that the ownership of these things had been transferred to our government through purchase and sale. The price was 500 million US dollars. Since the transaction, it has not yet been completely shipped.

Judging from the price and transportation, it is conceivable that the quantity of these materials is not 'rare.' If all of it could be moved back to strengthen market supply, it would certainly be a wonderful and meaningful deal.

Since these surplus items have been proven to belong to us, why are we allowing them to gradually rot on an island in the Pacific while the country is suffering from poverty and the economy is declining? As a result, some people are indignant and complain about the incompetence of the authorities. I dare say that those who hold this attitude certainly do not understand the secrets of doing business. A month ago, a pound of Klennings milk powder in this city rose to 10,000 yuan, but now it can be bought for 5,400 yuan. The reason for the high price in the past and the low price now is nothing more than the law of supply and demand at work! After careful consideration, our authorities generously took out this nine-figure US dollar sum to purchase this batch of goods. The main purpose was to resell them to curb inflation. To put it bluntly, the authorities hoped to make some money in the resale to help supplement the national treasury so that fewer banknotes could be printed. Of course, the more money earned, the better. As for how to exchange goods for money, how to exchange less for more, first, you must understand the principles of buying and selling; second, you must be good at observing market changes. Why wouldn't the authorities want to immediately send dozens or even hundreds of ships to break the waves and bring back all these things belonging to our country scattered on Pacific islands? Why wouldn't they want to sell it all in one go to circulate the capital? What if the sales are poor? Why wouldn't they want to hoard them in warehouses to wait for a good price? But this is just a hope! Is this the reason why we are complaining and criticizing the authorities? Indeed, it is a loss for the materials to rot. But are we disappointed because there is a risk of loss in this transaction? I say: not necessarily! Not necessarily! What is lost is the quantity of materials. There is no impact on the cost. Why do I say that? In February of this year, a medium-sized shirt was worth only five or six thousand yuan, but now the same item cannot be obtained for less than 10,000 yuan. That is to say, one item today is worth two items in the past. Suppose the quantity of materials purchased by our country this time is a total of 10 million pieces, and at the same time, the number of losses that cannot be prevented by human efforts is 5 million pieces. Then the actual amount received is only half of the 5 million pieces. According to the thinking of people who are not familiar with buying and selling, there are 10 million items, and the cost is 500 million. If half of them are lost, it seems that there will be a real loss of 250 million! However, according to the shirt example mentioned above, after half a year or several months, there will be a shortage of goods on the market. Find the right opportunity, and one item can be sold for two items. Wouldn't it be easy to get back the capital? Maybe you can even make some profit! The authorities in charge of this transaction must understand the law of supply and demand better than we do. Even if some of these materials rot and some are brought back less, what does it matter! We only need to show faith in the authorities. In fact, there is no need to worry unnecessarily and have unwarranted pessimism! If you don't believe it, wait and see in the future, and you will know that my words are not unexpected. The reporter who reported this news also said: So far, only one ship of goods has been transported to China. The reporter may not be an expert in buying and selling!

People always tend to think in the worst way. Some people think that what our country has ordered is not just from Okinawa Island. Whether the situation in other places is the same as in Okinawa is not known. I also think this concern is unnecessary. To put it more emphatically, even if everything rots away, as long as one piece remains, it will be more than enough. This one remaining item, after being naturally eliminated from 10 million items, will naturally become a rare item! The authorities may as well treasure it and, after an appropriate period of time, then distribute it to us. At this time, this absolutely unique and rare treasure will be scrambled for by all 450 million compatriots, causing a sensation. Who can guarantee that there will be no enthusiastic people who will generously offer 500 million US dollars to snatch it back? The 500 million US dollars at that time is also today's 500 million US dollars. The number has not decreased, so what's the harm? Moreover, the authorities only need to send a plane and a senior official to escort it. The matter is simple, and the cost is minimal. Saving on shipping costs is also the highest principle of making a profit in buying and selling. Why should we be anxious and worried about the transportation of surplus materials?

### Frugality Cultivates Integrity

— W.W

A public school principal's wife buys vegetables, dipping into her husband's funds. Over time, she accumulates enough to buy a pair of cotton shoes. When the principal learns of this, he considers it embezzlement of military rations and severely rebukes her. The wife says, "This is frugality. Frugality cultivates integrity."

### Underground Work

— Zhan Weng

Underground work is the most fashionable term after the victory. When Tan Fuying performed "The Eight Great Hammers" at the Tianchan Theater, in the storytelling scene, when Lu Wenlong learned that Jin Wuzhu was his enemy, Fuying said in a humorous tone, "My underground work can be considered a success!"

The calligrapher Zhu Kongchang has recently been busy planning the Qiantang Cemetery. Someone asked him why he was so busy? He laughed, "I'm doing underground work!"

### Poverty and Wealth

— Shusun Ruying

From Marx onwards, all the cadres in the liberated areas today have this concept: the poor are poor because they are exploited, and the rich are rich because they exploit others. This concept naturally has its theory and logic, but at least in China, the causes of poverty and wealth are not so simple.

Let me quote three common proverbs:

One generation rich, hands and feet never stop;

Two generations rich, chest puffed out, big belly;

Three generations rich, tear down the house and sell the beams and pillars. This is the language of the people, and it is definitely not a creation that bourgeois writers can produce. This proverb suggests the phenomenon of the cycle of poverty and wealth and the causes of changes in poverty and wealth, which can deeply prompt people to reflect.

Founders are all from the working class. Only because they are poor can they be inspired to work hard and produce diligently to reach a state of wealth. Those who enjoy the blessings of inheritance, although there are some who can safely maintain their wealth, most of the sons and daughters of the wealthy are extravagant and wasteful, and eventually become bankrupt and fall into the ranks of beggars.

Hartung and Luo Jialing were originally proletarians, but they eventually acquired countless properties and became very wealthy. Their wealth was due to the prosperity of Shanghai, but their diligence and frugality cannot be denied. Look at their successors, what else can they do besides suing each other for the family property? Moreover, how long can these people who enjoy the blessings of their predecessors enjoy their blessings?

The rich are not always rich, and the poor are not always poor. Endure a bit of hardship, and you will get a bit of enjoyment. In any world - whether it is a capitalist or socialist world - the difference in principle is very limited.

In an extreme capitalist world, of course, the poor will become poorer and the rich will become richer, but in China, it is really just big poverty and small poverty; and now everyone can't survive. Our problem is only: peace, unity, and getting everything back on track. Like the way it was twenty-six years ago, in the first two years, there is great hope. Struggle, etc., is the "skill" of speculators!

### Blood Has Status

— Shigu

Everyone knows that blood is precious. No wonder the beauties are fighting for plasma. However, only the blood of us Chinese people does not seem very precious. Look: blood flows east, blood flows west, the more it flows, the cheaper it seems. Pig blood and sheep blood can be sold for money, but our blood is worthless.

### Just This Set

— [Liang Yushu Z] Mr. ×××, who is usually known as the "general in cloth clothes," has now bought a foreign house and a car in San Francisco. Everything in the world is just this set. Distance Makes A Difference and a Frog in a Well A reporter said, "Generally, the farther away people are from the 'liberated area,' the more they sympathize with the Communist Party, and the closer they are, the opposite is true. There is a big difference between Kunming and Tianjin." Just thinking about this a little, you will feel that it contains some truth. The Organizational Setup of Shanghai's Cross-Section Beggars Huang Jiamo Joyful events are a general term that includes weddings, marrying off daughters, birthdays, and full-moon banquets. The beggar leader has already found out the type of joyful event and determined where the banquet will be held on a certain day. The uncles and elders must bathe and change their clothes in advance, prepare the joyous banners and red candles, and go to see the treasurer of the joyous family, congratulating them repeatedly. Seeing that it is the beggar leader in his jurisdiction, the treasurer will give a reward and send him away without making things difficult. The amount of the reward money is given according to the situation. Before the war, it was usually between one and five silver dollars. After the war, it ranged from 5,000 to tens of thousands of yuan. As for the gifts sent by the beggars, they are usually returned and not accepted, which is the equivalent of a "sincere refusal of generous gifts." Anyway, both sides know what's up. The beggar gang's gifts are kept as rewards for later use. However, the gifts given for birthdays and full-moon banquets are often more generous than those given for weddings, because weddings are something that every family has to do. Birthdays and full-moon banquets are extravagant displays of wealthy families. The former are necessities, while the latter are luxuries. Moreover, because filial sons and grandsons celebrate the birthdays of their elders, they do not want beggars to come to the door and shout out inauspicious words to ruin the surrounding festive atmosphere. The beggars have studied all these things thoroughly, so they can choose the fattest prey to devour. After receiving the reward and saying thank you, the beggar leader will stick a red paper strip on the door, with the words: "Noble family's joyful event, no disturbance from the brothers!" This "no taboo" strip of paper is just like Jiang Taigong's talisman. All the beggars will avoid it. If the reward is not given, then the beggars will come to the door one after another, which will be very annoying. Funerals Funerals are divided into three types: first, setting up the mourning hall; second, the funeral procession; and third, holding the anniversary of death. Most Chinese households use Buddhist rituals and cannot avoid doing Buddhist rituals and chanting scriptures. The family especially likes to be extravagant. The beggar leader will wear plain clothes and prepare incense and candles to come to see the treasurer, putting on a mourning appearance and blessing the deceased to ascend to heaven early. The treasurer of the mourning family must still give money to send them away, but the amount is less than for joyful events. Recently, funeral parlors in Shanghai are booming, and it is quite inconvenient for beggars to come to the door because funeral parlors have always had guards, and there are many obstacles in between. The beggars cannot enter the door and often turn to the family's residence to beg bitterly. However, if the death of the family is due to an unfortunate accidental death, such as suicide or being killed, the beggars will also have to consider the situation and no longer come to the door to ask for money. For example, recently, when a major traitor was executed and a mourning hall was set up, the beggar leader in that area actually disdained to take a look. This is the clever part of the old beggar gang. In the past, the beggars would also prepare three animals as sacrificial offerings to mourn the rich, in order to ask for more considerable rewards. The family of the deceased would certainly not accept the sacrificial offerings because the beggars rented them from the butcher shop for use. This has become an open secret. Sanmao Zhang Leping
