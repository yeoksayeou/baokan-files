Government and American Personnel Did Not Comment on the CCP Statement

[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper, 27th] After the Communist Party's statement was issued yesterday, neither the government nor American personnel here have made any comments. Current political activities in the capital depend on Marshal Ma's return to Beijing with Chairman Chiang's opinions before any decisions are made. Furthermore, evening newspapers reported that the Communist Party would issue another statement after Marshal Ma's return to Beijing. However, according to a CCP spokesperson, there are no such plans.

[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper, 27th] According to a relevant source: Zhou Enlai's claims at yesterday's press conference that the Communist Party had accepted the idea of reorganizing the government first, then ceasing hostilities, only if they received guarantees and the government did not raise the five demands again, are a distortion of the truth. Reorganizing the government was a resolution of the Political Consultative Conference and should be faithfully implemented. As for the so-called five demands, these are old, unresolved cases from the past, not new topics. The current situation depends on Marshal Ma's return to Beijing before anything becomes clear.

### The Northeast Nine Provinces and Regions Plan, The Headquarters Denies Changes

The central government has always sought stability in local administration. Since the provinces and regions have already been demarcated, it seems difficult to change them easily.

### The Government Representatives of the Military Mediation Department Submitted a Memorandum to the Communist Party, Protesting the Dispute Over Witnesses in Anping

[Dispatch from Beiping by Our Newspaper, 27th] Due to ineffective mediation and the escalating war, the Military Mediation Department has completely lost its spirit of mutual tolerance and understanding and has become a superficial mutual attack.

[Dispatch from Beiping by Our Newspaper, 27th] The investigation of the Anping incident is still at a standstill. Deputy Member Daberman of the American side of the Executive Headquarters and Colonel Martin, the representative of the 25th Group, exchanged views with Ye Jianying yesterday, and decided to put aside the trivial issues that occurred during the previous investigation in Anping and immediately resume the investigation. At 9 a.m. on the 27th, Martin convened a meeting of the representatives of the government and the Communist Party. At the meeting, Zhang Shuheng, the representative of the government, said: During the previous investigation in Anping, Representative Huang of the Communist Party first stated that the military and political situation in Anping Town had changed, and all witnesses, evidence, and testimony were not credible. Secondly, he said that if the interrogation was not completed in Anping that day, the witnesses there would have the opportunity to change their testimony, and he doubted that the government could be responsible for the witnesses in Anping. If Representative Huang's views were not changed, there would be no need to go to Anping for investigation again. At this point, Zhang asked Huang Yifeng if he had changed the above views. Huang Yifeng did not answer, so the chairman declared the meeting adjourned. It is understood that the government has followed the United States in sending a memorandum to the Communist Party to protest the attitude of the Communist Party representative who had a dispute over witnesses in Anping. Roughly, the government will resume the meeting after the Communist Party gives a satisfactory answer. As for the statement made by Wang Ting, a member of the Anping Township Association, that the Communist Army had captured two American soldiers, the American side remained silent. The Communist Party's Xinhua News Agency manuscript on the 27th also mentioned the testimony about this matter, but did not make any criticism. How the matter will progress is highly speculative.

[Dispatch from Beiping by Our Newspaper, 27th] The spokesperson for the Communist Party in the Military Mediation Department issued a written statement on the 27th, stating: "On August 1, the Beiping World Daily wrote that recently, personnel from a certain party had infiltrated Beiping to carry out robbery, assassination, and espionage activities. On August 10, Cai Wenzhi, the Chief of Staff of the Executive Headquarters, used this as a basis to submit a memorandum to the American side of the Executive Headquarters, stating: I (Cai) have learned that all Communist Party members of the Executive Team, in addition to performing their duties of peaceful work, have been engaged in espionage activities. It continued: I believe that when a Communist Party member of the Executive Team is found to be a spy, he loses the privileges of being a member of the Executive Team and should be subject to legal sanctions. On August 11, another memorandum was sent to the American side, using the aforementioned news from the World Daily as a basis to prove that 'the Communist Party has sent its personnel to Ping to create chaos,' stating that 'the government authorities have done everything possible to maintain local security and social order in Beiping.' On August 23, the Xinmin Daily published a speech by Tang Yongxian, the director of the Ping City Public Security Bureau, stating: One of the reasons for the banditry in Ping City is that the tea party has organized assassination and robbery, and has special identities to cover them up. On the 24th, the Xinsheng Daily openly stated that the Communist Army instructed bandits to disrupt the security of Ping City, and these bandits were led by a certain important member of the Executive Headquarters. The spokesperson believes that this is a 'organized and planned conspiracy' to 'attempt to frame and arrest Communist Party members and destroy the existence of the Executive Headquarters.' It continued: The Communist Party has issued warnings to the Kuomintang authorities in Nanjing and Beiping, stating: 'Communist Party members came to the government area at the invitation of the American and Chinese sides and in accordance with the tripartite agreement to undertake mediation tasks, so in addition to requesting the removal of Cai Wenzhi and Tang Yongxian, if Communist Party members are harmed, go missing, or otherwise infringed upon in the government area, the Communist Party will not tolerate it.'"

### Another Assassination Case in Kunming, Liu Zhihuan and Sun Duolan Were Shot and Seriously Injured, Rumors Say the Cause Was a Family Dispute

[Dispatch from Kunming by Our Newspaper, 26th] An assassination case occurred easily in Kunming yesterday. The injured were two people, the man was Liu Zhihuan, who had served as a cadre and secretary of the Yunnan branch of the Youth League, and the woman was Sun Duolan, who was the wife of Liu Yaoyang (also known as Liu Shangshi), the former Chief of Staff of the Kunming Headquarters. At around 12 o'clock last night, after the two watched the new play "Chen Yuanyuan" at the Provincial Party Headquarters, they took a car back to Sun's residence in Shangyuan on Daguan Road from the entrance of the Provincial Party Headquarters. The car suddenly stopped in the middle of the road, and the driver Li Heng falsely claimed that the oil was exhausted, and immediately got out of the car and opened fire with a man lying in ambush beside the road, sniping at Liu and Sun. At that time, Liu was shot twice, and his tongue was broken. Sun was shot twice, both in the head, and her injuries were quite serious. After being sniped, Liu chased the murderer for more than ten steps before collapsing. He was then sent to Kunhua Hospital for treatment by nearby residents. Both are no longer in life-threatening condition. The murderer Li Heng is an active-duty soldier, a lieutenant adjutant of a certain unit, and was arrested by the police at the train station on the Sichuan-Yunnan Road at around 6 o'clock this morning. A left-handed pistol used in the murder was also seized and has been handed over to the security authorities for interrogation.

### Sakai Takao is Sentenced to Death, The Crime of Indiscriminate Slaughter, Rape, and Robbery is Extremely Heinous

[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper, 27th] The Japanese war criminal Sakai Takao was publicly sentenced to death by Shi Meiyu, the President of the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense, at the Lizi Society in the capital at 3 p.m. on the 27th. The main text of the judgment is as follows: "Sakai Takao participated in the war of aggression, indiscriminately slaughtered prisoners of war, wounded soldiers, and non-combatants, and raped and robbed civilians, abused torture, and destroyed property, and is sentenced to death." When the defendant Sakai Takao was escorted to the court, he was still wearing a Tibetan-colored suit, black leather boots, and holding documents in his hand, and his attitude was still very calm. When the President of the court announced the verdict, the defendant immediately applied for permission to make a further defense after the announcement. Then, in accordance with the law, the President of the court read the judgment, and the translator translated it into Japanese. The defendant took notes while listening and often sneered with an arrogant attitude. Only when the sentence of death was announced did his face show a look of dismay and his body trembled slightly, but he still tried to remain calm. At that time, the President of the court announced, "The defendant is remanded into custody." The defendant strongly requested to make another defense, trying to make a final rescue. The President of the court said: "The judgment must be approved by the Supreme Commander before it can be executed. If you have any comments, you can submit them in writing." The defendant was remanded into custody with a helpless expression.

### Second Important Statement from the U.S. Regarding China: Sale of Surplus Goods Contains No Military Supplies; Negotiations on Civil Aviation Agreement Are Unrelated

[Special Dispatch from the U.S. Information Service in this City] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Peterson and Special Assistant to the Secretary of State for Foreign Liquidation Affairs, McCabe, issued a statement today through the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai, the contents of which are as follows:

We have noticed reports in the newspapers stating that we are "secretly" negotiating with the Chinese government to sell a large quantity of surplus military supplies, weapons, and other purely military goods to China, and that in order to induce the United States to consider selling these goods, China must grant valuable civil aviation rights to the United States. Such reports are completely unfounded.

What is currently under negotiation is the sale of certain surplus goods to China. These goods are currently stored in the Western Pacific and have an original value of $500 million.

There are absolutely no munitions, weapons, aircraft, or any other purely military goods included in the goods that will be sold to China. All of these surplus goods are civilian-type or purely for civilian use. We believe that China's purchase of these goods will definitely benefit China's reconstruction and its peaceful economic development.

The issue of China's civil aviation rights has never been and will not be involved in the negotiations for the sale of surplus goods. The negotiations regarding the civil aviation agreement are being conducted by Powell, a representative of the State Department. Although Powell came to China on the same plane as us, he is definitely not a member of the surplus goods delegation. Powell's negotiations have absolutely no connection with the surplus goods negotiations.

Powell stated that what he is discussing with the Chinese government is a mutual and reciprocal civil aviation agreement, and that the nature of this agreement is the same as those that the United States has signed with eighteen countries around the world. Powell also stated that once the civil aviation agreement is finalized, its terms will be made public by the State Department.

Peterson and McCabe reiterated that if the sale of surplus goods to China can be successfully completed, it will definitely not be a secret agreement. A comprehensive statement will be issued or a press conference will be held to announce it.

### Illegal Sale of Supplies in China: U.S. Authorities to Begin Investigation

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] Regarding the discovery of the illegal sale of U.S. surplus supplies in China, the U.S. State Department declined to comment. It is only known that the U.S. authorities will begin an investigation soon. The most serious illegal activity is the unauthorized sale of military equipment to the Chinese government, including seven intact bombers.

[United Press, this city] It is reported that the Shanghai office of the U.S. Foreign Surplus Property Disposal Committee transferred ten intact, flyable U.S. B-25 Mitchell bombers to the Central Air Transport Corporation, which appears to be a direct violation of federal regulations that state "combat equipment cannot be sold as surplus property unless specifically authorized by the State Department or the Joint Chiefs of Staff." These bombers were handed over to the Central Air Transport Corporation several months ago and have been submitted by the company to the Ministry of Communications for transfer to the Chinese Air Force.

When asked about the source of the Mitchell bombers, the Central Air Transport Corporation's flight crew informed United Press that they were purchased from the Shanghai office of the U.S. Property Disposal Committee, with a total of about 150 aircraft.

Chen Wen-kuan, director of the Central Air Transport Corporation's flight crew, stated in a meeting with a correspondent from a certain country that some of the B-25 aircraft purchased from the Property Disposal Committee had flight times of less than 700 hours. Chen explained that these aircraft must fly at least 3,000 hours to be considered old. It is reported that the aircraft included B-25D models manufactured in the later stages of the war (referring to the newest model).

Responsible parties emphasized that the transfer of these military aircraft to the Central Air Transport Corporation was not approved by the State Department or the Joint Chiefs of Staff beforehand. Although they could not speak on behalf of Peterson, they expressed deep doubts about the Chinese Communist Party's claim that $500 million of surplus military supplies would be sold to China. It was pointed out that the Property Disposal Committee had agreed to sell a large batch of surplus supplies in the Pacific region, but this would be done in accordance with established regulations and would not involve useful military equipment.

Meanwhile, a document previously published by Chen Wen-kuan, director of the Central Air Transport Corporation, confirmed United Press's previous report that the Central Air Transport Corporation had purchased aircraft at low prices. According to employees of the Central Air Transport Corporation, the 150 aircraft purchased by the company under contract included ten B-25s, ninety C-46s, two C-87s (these are Liberator bombers converted for cargo use), and more than forty C-47s, with a total value of approximately $500,000. Thus, the average cost per aircraft was only over $30 USD, slightly higher than the selling price of a commercial jeep in Shanghai.

McCabe, chairman of the U.S. Foreign Property Committee, stated: "There is a 'universal standard price' for aircraft of this type, which is approximately $20,000 each."

### Landing Craft "Wanquan" Burns in Fire in Hankou

### CCP Shanghai Office Hosts Chinese and Foreign Journalists, Reports on Views on Handling U.S. Surplus Supplies

[Report from this newspaper] At 3:00 PM yesterday, the CCP Shanghai Office hosted the city's press at 107 Route Massenet, with over 70 Chinese and foreign reporters attending. Only Chen Jiakang spoke on behalf of the CCP. Chen reported the CCP's views on the handling of U.S. surplus supplies, stating that the CCP intends to express a serious protest to the U.S. government and demand an immediate halt. Subsequently, reporters from various newspapers raised questions, and the meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:

Question: It is reported that Chen Jiemin, the government representative of the Military Mediation Office's Executive Headquarters, sent a memorandum to Ye Jianying, the CCP representative, stating that if the CCP attacked Datong, government troops would attack Yan'an, Chengde, and Zhangjiakou. Is it true that Ye Jianying has accepted this?

Answer: The CCP has not yet received a report on the response to the memorandum here. However, in principle, if the National Army does not take the offensive, the Communist Army will not attack. Furthermore, CCP documents have never stated an intention to take Datong.

Question: What is the latest situation regarding the CCP's negotiations with the U.S. on the Anping Incident?

Answer: I am unable to comment due to restrictions from the investigation team before there is a formal report.

Question: It was recently reported that the area of dispute between the government and the CCP will be temporarily managed by the United States. The government has denied this. What is the CCP's criticism of this?

Answer: The CCP absolutely opposes this move, as it violates nationalism and national independence.

Question: Recently, there was an article in Yan'an's Liberation Daily attacking Marshal [George] Marshall personally. Is the CCP deeply dissatisfied with the U.S. mediation policy?

Answer: (1) Until now, the CCP still welcomes Marshal Marshall's mediation and hopes that it can be successful based on the Moscow Conference's decision. (2) The CCP has always hoped that the U.S. government will end military aid to China.

Question: It has been reported that the murderers in the Zhang Xinfu case were acting on CCP orders. How does the CCP explain this?

Answer: The truth of the matter is still awaiting publication from Yan'an. What is reported in the newspapers is probably one-sided.

Question: How will the CCP deal with the political prisoners detained in Yan'an?

Answer: The CCP has never had political prisoners. Those currently detained are prisoners of war during combat and will be considered for exchange with the government.

Question: Victory has been one year, and the Ryukyu Islands have not yet been returned to China. What is the CCP's opinion?

Answer: The Ryukyu Islands were not assigned to China at the Potsdam Conference.

Question: Nanjing newspapers reported news from the CCP side. What are the details of the Sino-U.S. negotiations on commercial aviation?

Answer: All I know is the news from the Central News Agency in the newspapers here.

Question: What is the CCP's opinion on this aviation negotiation?

Answer: Any matter concerning China's sovereignty should be discussed by the coalition government. Before the coalition government is established, we do not recognize any treaty related to sovereignty signed by any government.

Question: Why is commercial aviation related to sovereignty?

Answer: The past case of inland waterway navigation rights can make this clear. Furthermore, the negotiations are being conducted secretly, making it difficult to know the details, and it is very likely to involve sovereignty.

Question: What is the CCP's opinion on the Li Wen case? What is the CCP's opinion on the Democratic League's request for a trial in Nanjing?

Answer: The Democratic League's request is correct.

Question: Since the murderers in the Li Wen case have already been executed, why are you still dissatisfied with the case?

Answer: It is questionable whether the executed murderers were the real murderers. Who were the murderers in the Li Wen case?

Question: What is the current situation of the war in northern Jiangsu?

Answer: It has been reported that government troops are attacking Shaobo, which shows that the government is taking the offensive in northern Jiangsu.

Question: It was reported today that the Communist Army intends to attack Taixing and Taizhou?

Answer: I do not know the details. In short, the CCP is not gaining an advantage in northern Jiangsu.

Question: It is reported that Marshall has proposed a new peace negotiation plan. What is the CCP's attitude?

Answer: The CCP's attitude has been clearly stated in the newspapers, that is, it does not reject the suggestion of restructuring before a ceasefire, but there are two conditions, namely: (1) Will there be an unconditional ceasefire after the restructuring of the government is agreed upon? (2) Will the government abandon the CCP's five demands, including the withdrawal from northern Jiangsu?

Question: What is the CCP's opinion on the "Coalition Government"?

Answer: The Coalition Government includes all parties, and the opinions of the CCP and the Kuomintang alone cannot represent everything.

### UNRRA Relief Supplies Stopped in Communist Areas of Hebei and Jehol

Staff Safety Not Guaranteed

[Report from this newspaper in Beiping, 27th] UNRRA's Hebei-Jehol-Beiping-Tianjin Sub-office has stopped relief efforts in the Communist-controlled areas of Hebei and Jehol because the office's work has consistently been under Communist control. All relief supplies could not be distributed personally by UNRRA staff, and UNRRA's regulations, transportation, and staff safety were not guaranteed. Therefore, the office decided to temporarily suspend the transport of relief supplies to the Communist areas and requested the UNRRA to negotiate with Zhou Enlai. The ban will only be lifted after a satisfactory response is received. The office's staff stationed in Chengde has been withdrawn. Previously, the office transported approximately 2,000 tons of relief supplies to the Communist-controlled areas of Hebei and Jehol. Furthermore, the office's future work will shift from relief to post-disaster assistance, such as improving agricultural production and assisting industrial recovery. It is also planned to open ten thousand wells. For the industries left by the Japanese in Beiping and Tianjin that have been stolen, sold, and destroyed by the Chinese, UNRRA's assistance cannot be expected because UNRRA opposes it. The office also plans to establish a hospital and relief center in each county of Hebei and Jehol within one year.

### "Shandong Disaster" Serious; Relief Plan Has Been Prepared; Minister Gu to Present It to the Chairman Immediately

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Ding Weifen, chairman of the Shandong Refugee Relief Association, and others hosted a banquet at 12 Cibei Society this afternoon for Gu Zhenggang, the Minister of Social Affairs, who had just returned from an inspection of Shandong, to express their appreciation. According to Gu, the visit to inspect the Shandong disaster lasted eight days, only two days in Jinan, which felt very rushed. However, the impression was very deep, and the "Shandong disaster" is indeed serious and in urgent need of relief. In the areas currently under government control, there are over a million refugees who cannot survive without additional relief. The over 60,000 unemployed workers in the Zibo mining area are in urgent need of relief. In addition, there are many young students who must be accommodated and allowed to attend school. All the refugees escaped in single layers of clothing. As autumn cools, clothing has become a problem. Although the UNRRA Shandong-Qingdao Relief Sub-office and the Shandong Provincial Government have found ways to increase relief supplies and are actively providing relief, the central government must also increase relief supplies and funds for timely relief. Gu stated that he has prepared a plan for relieving the Shandong refugees and will visit the chairman in Guling to present it in a few days.

### Central Government Commemorates Confucius' Birthday Yesterday; Chairman Zhang Ji Explains Significance of Commemoration

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Yesterday was Confucius' birthday. The central government held a commemoration meeting at the National Government Auditorium at 9:00 AM, chaired by Zhang Ji, who also explained the significance of the commemoration, saying: "Today we commemorate Confucius' birthday for the first time after the eight-year victory of the War of Resistance and the return to the capital, so we feel especially gratified. During this War of Resistance, the Chinese people suffered great losses in lives and property, but they were able to achieve victory in the end, which was due to spiritual strength. What is spiritual strength? It is recalling the great achievements of ancient sages and the glorious history of 5,000 years." Zhang continued: "As the saying goes, after a great war, there will inevitably be a famine. But this year, there is a harvest in various parts of our country. The phenomenon of a great harvest this year in places such as Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi has not been seen in 20 years, so the future of the country is very promising. But unfortunately, there are some people who want to destroy their own country and launch a civil war, and they call it factional disputes. Confucius said, 'The first thing to do is to correct the names.'" Zhang then recounted the evolution of the Confucian orthodoxy from Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, and Confucius, and emphasized the achievements of Emperor Wu of Han for the Chinese nation's history, continuing that our Premier [Sun Yat-sen] inherited this orthodoxy and passed it on to the President [Chiang Kai-shek], which is also passed on to our party, so we should urgently promote the way of the sages and not disgrace ourselves, so as not to invite disgrace, and especially should follow the clear teachings of "being fond of learning is close to wisdom, striving to act is close to benevolence, and knowing shame is close to courage," to hone ourselves. Zhang finally suggested that Confucius temples in various places should be preserved and that Confucianism should be regularly preached. The report lasted for 40 minutes. (There are more commemoration messages from Shanghai and other places, please see page six.)

### Banditry in Siming Mountain, Eastern Zhejiang; Provincial Government Sets Three-Month Deadline to Suppress It; Pacification Command Established in Mid-September

[Report from this newspaper in Hangzhou, 27th] Siming Mountain has always been restless, especially after the war. Recently, in order to eradicate the banditry in this area, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has passed a resolution at the provincial government meeting to establish a Siming Mountain Pacification Organization. On the 25th and 26th of this month, a pacification meeting was held in Yuyao. Attendees included the commissioners of the Second and Third Districts, the Deputy Commander of the Peace Preservation Forces, the county magistrates of Shangyu, Yuyao, Cixi, Xinchang, Fenghua, Ningbo, and other counties, and the commander of the Peace Preservation First Regiment. After two days of discussion, the following was decided: (1) Divide the pacification area. (2) Determine the organization of the pacification agency, dividing it into three sections: military affairs, party and government affairs, and general affairs, as well as two offices: accounting and military law, and a party and government work group will be established separately. (3) The pacification agency's own expenses will be allocated by the provincial government, and the personnel transferred will be borne by their original units. (4) The assigned forces will be under the unified command of the pacification headquarters. (5) Reduce the burden on the people in the bandit area. (6) Adjust the personnel in the township, town, and Baojia system in the bandit area. (7) Strengthen the self-defense organizations in the townships and towns. (8) Actively manage personnel who have received local autonomy training. When Zhejiang Governor Shen Honglie returned to Hangzhou on the 26th, he made a special trip to Yuyao to personally preside over the pacification meeting. It has been decided to establish the Siming Mountain Pacification Command, with Zheng Shaoyin, the commissioner of the Third District, concurrently serving as the commander, and Huang Shi-han, the commander of the Peace Preservation First Regiment, concurrently serving as the deputy commander. It will be officially established on September 15th, with a three-month deadline to complete the pacification work.

### Naughty Children Remove Rail Spikes; Jinghu Train Nearly Derails

### Price of Sichuan Tung Oil Rises Sharply

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Sichuan tung oil is a major export commodity of our country. The selling price in Chongqing has been hovering around 38,000 to 39,000 yuan for the past month. Since the adjustment of foreign exchange rates and the elimination of export taxes, the price of oil has gradually increased. Last weekend, it was 42,500 yuan. In the past two days, there have been rumors that American merchants will purchase and transport it in large quantities. The price in Shanghai has reached 120,000 yuan per dan.

### Former Responsible Person of the Sixth War Zone Discusses Distribution of Supplies; Makes Statements Regarding Accusations by the Investigation Team

[Report from this newspaper in Hankou, 27th] The former responsible person of the Sixth War Zone Headquarters recently issued a statement regarding the Investigation Team's accusations that the headquarters distributed received supplies to officers and soldiers as spoils of victory. He made a frank statement on the actual circumstances of the authority's expedient handling of the matter. The content first acknowledged that the fact that the headquarters issued the supplies before reporting them was not proper in terms of procedure, but stated that the process was indeed different from what was rumored. (1) Most of the non-military supplies among the received supplies have been submitted and recorded. The portion distributed by the headquarters was only a small part, and the distribution of this small part of supplies was based on the special needs of the environment at the time. For example, candles were distributed temporarily because the lights in Wuhan had not been restored at that time, and the surrender matters were busy, so all agencies had to work all night. Other items such as bicycles, cement, stationery, and paper were used for transportation of official documents, office work, or for repairing barracks, so they had to be distributed temporarily. Other food items such as cigarettes, biscuits, and soy sauce not only would not last long, but some had already become moldy, so they had to be disposed of early to avoid total waste. The responsible person told reporters that given the urgency and distress of the situation at that time, and the depression of the market (difficulty in purchasing), the use of these few received supplies was reasonable and justifiable, and could not be considered excessive behavior. (2) The Investigation Team estimated that the total value of the distributed supplies was approximately 4 billion yuan, which was estimated according to the current market price. The distribution of supplies took place in November of last year. According to the Wuhan District Executive Yuan Special Envoy's Office, the value of the supplies was only 1.8 billion yuan. If estimated at last year's prices, and then subtracting the depreciation, the value would be even less. In addition to the headquarters, the garrison headquarters, and the General Logistics Department, the units that received the spoils of victory included the 11th Regiment of the Constitution, the 3rd Signals Regiment, the 6th Engineer Regiment, the 18th Army, the City Police Bureau, the 8th Motorized Transport Regiment, the Hubei Business School, and more than 40 large units, with a total of at least 25,000 officers and soldiers, not just over 2,000 people. Considering the distribution of this small part of supplies among so many people, it was not too much. (3) The Sixth War Zone was known for its strict military discipline. Although the officers and soldiers' lives were very difficult during the eight years of the War of Resistance, they were able to abide by the law. Since being ordered to come to Hankou to accept the surrender, they had warned their subordinates to strictly observe discipline and strive for quick and accurate acceptance work. In the end, they were able to successfully complete the task. The recently issued "Records of Surrender" by the Army Headquarters stated that the amount of supplies received in this war zone was the highest in the country. The facts are clear and can be used as reference. All distribution situations were reported in person last November when Minister Chen of the Ministry of Military Affairs, Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and Minister Chen of the Organization Department came to Hankou. We believe that it was very open and frank. Finally, the responsible person said that this case has already been estimated by the Executive Yuan that the total value of the supplies is 1.8 billion yuan, and the order has been given to deduct the price and deposit it in the treasury, which should be followed. However, since the headquarters has ended and most of the receiving units have been reorganized, merged, and the personnel have been scattered, it is impossible to recover the price. A request has been submitted to the central government for exemption from deduction. I believe that the central government will consider the difficulties of the officers and soldiers and will give a reasonable solution.

### Wuhan to Build a Large Railway Bridge

Editorial

### Elected by the People? Or Totalitarian?

During World War II, the research and application of camouflage techniques reached an unprecedented level of sophistication. The true appearance of things was almost entirely concealed by the use of camouflage, making it nearly impossible to discern the real form from high altitudes or at a distance. This easily achieved a deceptive effect. While such camouflage might fool the enemy, it could never deceive oneself. This is similar to the popularity and development of makeup: it can certainly enhance the beauty of those already blessed with natural charm, but for those who are inherently ugly, no amount of cosmetic enhancement can ultimately hide their ugliness. This is the tragedy of makeup.

Similar situations are found in other fields as well. For example, when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) representative Zhou Enlai hosted reporters recently, he stated, "I believe that Chairman Chiang's proclamation 'not only fails to change the situation but also worsens it.' This is because the ceasefire conditions he proposed require the CCP troops to withdraw from many areas and abolish the locally elected governments, which would then be taken over by the Kuomintang's (KMT) one-party government." He also claimed that "after the ceasefire agreement announced in January, the government side consistently failed to implement the ceasefire in the Northeast and did not accept General Marshall's proposal..." Reading this speech, doesn't one feel a sense of the ridiculous, as if someone is trying to hide ugliness with makeup?

"Elected government," what a beautiful phrase! But can there be an elected government in the so-called "liberated" areas under totalitarianism? "Elected" is a type of modern makeup, yet it cannot conceal the traces of totalitarianism, just as powder and lipstick cannot hide ugliness. Even if we take a step back and assume that the CCP troops withdraw but the political system they created remains in place, the people's fear of totalitarianism will not be extinguished. How can the hundreds of thousands of refugees living in exile return to their homes and live in peace? Transportation will still be obstructed, so the problem remains unsolved. As for the claim that the areas would be "taken over by the Kuomintang's one-party government," we need not even point out that the current National Government includes non-partisan and independent figures.

Regarding the Northeast, we see them saying, "...the government side consistently failed to implement the ceasefire in the Northeast and did not accept General Marshall's proposal." What has actually happened these past eight months? Who has been rejecting General Marshall's proposal? The educational level of the Chinese people is relatively low, but they cannot be easily deceived. Wasn't the capture of Changchun and Harbin initiated by the CCP? All of this cannot be concealed by camouflage or makeup. "Elected"? Or totalitarian? The Chinese people understand. No matter how refined the art of makeup, ugliness will ultimately be revealed.

### The English-Soviet Relationship Seen Through the Greek-Albanian Issue

The United Nations Security Council is meeting in New York today to discuss the applications of several non-member states to join the UN. It will also address the Ukrainian representative Mr. Manuilsky's accusations against Greece, placing the border conflict between Greece and Albania as one of the most important international issues currently.

On the 24th of this month, Mr. Manuilsky, the Ukrainian representative, suddenly sent a telegram to the UN General Assembly Secretary-General Mr. Lie, requesting that the Security Council include the border conflict between Greece and Albania on the agenda for the next meeting. His reasons were fourfold: (1) Greece repeatedly provoked Albania, leading to border conflicts that could endanger peace in the Balkans; (2) Speeches by Greek representatives at the Paris Peace Conference intensified the relations between Greece and Albania; (3) Greece mistreated ethnic minorities within its borders; (4) Greece used propaganda to attempt to redraw Balkan borders. Finally, Manuilsky also condemned the continued presence of British troops in Greece as interference in Greek domestic affairs. Thus, it is clear that the Ukrainian representative's complaint is not a simple matter involving only Greece and Albania; rather, it has a complex and subtle international background, making it extremely difficult for the Security Council to handle this matter.

Firstly, Manuilsky's accusation against Greece to the Security Council is clearly a kind of "diplomatic counter-offensive" by the Soviet Union in Europe. Since the opening of the Paris Peace Conference at the Luxembourg Palace, the Soviet Union has repeatedly suffered setbacks in verbal battles due to being "outnumbered and outgunned." Not only has the Soviet Union lost face, but it has also been quite demoralized. Therefore, it sought to launch an offensive outside the Paris Peace Conference to boost Soviet morale. The Soviet Union's sudden notification to Turkey, demanding that the two countries conduct negotiations to revise the Montreux Convention and further change the legal status of the Dardanelles Strait, also stemmed from this motive. However, Turkey's attitude remained calm and unyielding to any threat, and the opinions of Britain and the United States were completely aligned. It is expected that the Soviet Union will hardly achieve the results it desires, so Manuilsky launched a diplomatic counter-offensive in another area.

Secondly, today's Greece has become the target of criticism in the Balkan Peninsula, especially since the current Greek government has requested that British troops remain stationed in the country, which has provoked the Soviet Union's antipathy. Therefore, at the Paris Peace Conference, Greece and the countries belonging to the Soviet bloc, namely the Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, have been diametrically opposed to each other everywhere. Whenever a problem is raised for discussion, it leads to a pointless verbal battle. Overall, the focal points of conflict between the two sides also include the following three items: (1) Greece is unwilling for the Albanian representative to present opinions at the conference; however, the Soviet bloc is supporting Albania behind the scenes; (2) Bulgaria demands access to the Aegean Sea directly through Greek Thrace; (3) Greece has territorial demands on Albania, attempting to obtain the Epirus region of Albania. Judging from these three points, one can also know the complexity and subtlety of this Balkan issue.

Thirdly, regarding the British military's stay in Greece, the Ukrainian representative pointed out to the United Nations General Assembly in January of this year that this matter could endanger world peace. Britain immediately replied that the British military's stay in Greece was at the request of the Greek government, which left the Ukrainian representative with no words to counter, so he automatically abandoned the issue. This time, Manuilsky rehashed the old story, bringing up all the new and old grudges between Britain and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the dispute between Greece and Albania is only directly related to the two countries on the surface, but in reality, it is a blatant manifestation of the conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union. After this event occurred, people generally worried about the future of the peace conference. In fact, what is affected is not just the Paris Peace Conference. Whether the UN Security Council can overcome difficulties and become an effective organization for maintaining world peace has also encountered a major test.

Looking at the current world situation, international contradictions are intensifying, and the opposition between the two major blocs is becoming increasingly apparent. Countries have different views on any issue, even sticking to their own arguments and arguing until they are red in the face, refusing to concede. Therefore, international disputes are arising one after another, and a true peace has not yet come to the world one year after the end of the war. Now everyone is looking forward to the success of the Paris Peace Conference to clarify European politics as soon as possible, but the Paris Peace Conference has been going on for "a full month" since it opened, and all that has been heard is the noise of representatives from various countries arguing, but no results have been seen. If this situation is not remedied, the Paris Peace Conference will fall into a state of semi-dormancy, and even by the end of this year, it may still not be able to "conclude successfully." Now London, Paris, Washington and other places are spreading the possibility that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference will be reconvened. This may not be a bad idea, but we are already accustomed to international conferences, especially in the year since the end of the war, with one UN conference after another, one foreign ministers' conference after another, and no concrete and effective solution has been negotiated, merely shifting our attention from one place to another. If international conferences are to succeed, it is necessary to restore the spirit of working together to defeat the enemy during the war. Only when the United Nations uses the spirit of striving for victory to create peace can world peace be realized.

### Minister Peng Holds Reception in Nanjing to Welcome American Writer Corwin; Corwin States the Whole World Yearns for Peace

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Minister Peng Xuepei of the Central Propaganda Department held a reception at the International Club at 5:30 PM today to welcome American writer Corwin, who arrived in Nanjing yesterday. Guests included Mr. and Mrs. Sun Ke, Kong Xiangxi, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Gan Naiguang, Hong Lanyou, and over a hundred Chinese and foreign reporters. Corwin is the first recipient of the "One World" award, and coincidentally, today is the birthday of Confucius, the advocate of "all men are brothers," which adds profound significance to the occasion.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Corwin attended the reception hosted by Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department at 5:30 PM on the 27th and delivered an impromptu speech, saying: "After coming to China, I finally understood why Willkie spoke so highly of China in his book 'One World.' The United States is a nation that emphasizes fairness and reason, and is also somewhat 'sensitive.' Fortunately, it is also the wealthiest country in the world, so it is extremely concerned about the world, hoping that the world can be safe and peaceful. This is why it pays so much attention to China. The world today is very different from the past. 'One World' has become a 'necessity,' a 'military' necessity, because in this atomic age, we cannot afford to have five or six worlds. Therefore, President Roosevelt deeply abhorred war. In fact, everyone hates war. We need to unite with each other. This is true for Europe, and I hope it will be true for other places (including here). I am terrified of anything that is contrary to peace. The United States is gradually concerned about China's situation and problems. In fact, our own homes are also full of problems. The occurrence of various problems within a country is no different from quarrels within a family. The important thing is to be able to reconcile them."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] President Sun Ke attended the Corwin reception on the 27th and delivered a brief speech, believing that the issue today is how to realize Confucius's ideal of "all men are brothers." Sun believes that the government and the Kuomintang are sincere about peace, and he also believes that the Communist Party has this sincerity. After eight years of war, everyone yearns for peace. The goals of both sides are the same, the only difference is the means used to achieve these goals. He hopes that on the same platform, they can reach an agreement on general issues and hopes that Corwin's visit will inspire them to make new efforts for peaceful unification.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] American radio writer Corwin, the first recipient of the "One World" award, had a brief conversation with reporters on the 27th, saying that he had many feelings on this trip to China, but needed some time to "digest" them. After arriving in Nanjing, he visited many places and was most impressed by the lotus root and lotus seeds. The sweetness and tenderness of the lotus seeds were something he had never tasted before. When reporters asked about his views on the atomic bomb, he said that people all over the world yearn for peace. He hopes that this atomic energy can be diverted to construction projects to serve the peace and well-being of mankind.

Wuxi: Hastening the Creation of Registration Records to Impose Land Tax

The county's entire county district clerks have four hundred and sixteen drawings, with each drawing having more than a thousand households, a total of five hundred and thirty-six thousand households. This year's land tax collection is imminent. The creation of registration records is extremely urgent. The provincial government stipulates that an appropriation of six yuan per household and eight thousand yuan per district clerk will be allocated. It is not allowed to collect registration record rice and wheat. The district clerks are ordered to rush the creation, but the various district clerks believe that serving as agents for grain households to supply corvée labor, the government should never issue funding. Rice and wheat (registration record payments) have always been provided by grain households to maintain their livelihoods. Now the interim parliamentary meeting has resolved to abolish it, cutting off their livelihoods. Now the provincial government is still ordering the rushing of the creation of registration records, unifying the deadline for completion before September 15, and stipulates that the creation record funding is 30 million yuan, with each drawing having a standard of 70,000 yuan, but afterwards, it is not allowed to collect registration record rice and wheat. Violators will be punished.

Hefei: Price Fluctuations, Rice Prices Plunge

Since the announcement of the increase in the foreign exchange rate in the city, prices have once again fluctuated greatly. The price of gold has risen from 240,000 yuan per tael to 260,000 yuan, with no market at the price. The prices of yarn and foreign goods have suddenly risen by an average of 20% to 30%, cigarettes by 30% to 40%, and kerosene has risen from 400 yuan per jin to 480 yuan. Not only are many goods hoarded and not sold, but there are also those who take the opportunity to buy them up to monopolize and speculate. As a result, commodity prices are becoming increasingly firm. The authorities are strictly investigating and preventing this. However, the new grain has entered the market and is gradually becoming crowded. Three days ago, the price of new rice was 40,000 yuan per picul, and today (23rd) it has fallen to 24,000 to 25,000 yuan. In the countryside, it has fallen to 20,000 yuan. The livelihoods of public education personnel and common people are slightly easier.

Huzhou: Forcing a Widower to Death, Provoking Public Outrage

In Nanpu Town, under the county's jurisdiction, there is a Xie Arong, over sixty years old, who has been working as a barber and renting a house from the Liu family for many years. Liu has lost his eyesight and usually relies entirely on the assistance of neighbors and relatives to prolong his life. Recently, he owed rent and was unable to pay. Ling Futang, the Liu family's rent collector, told Xie that the house was being taken back for self-use and set a deadline for him to move out. After Xie pleaded in vain, the homeowner's rent collector actually had workers remove the roof tiles, doors, and windows of the house, leaving Xie Arong with nowhere to live and no means of support. He hanged himself in the middle of the night on the 23rd. The next day, neighbors discovered that he had already died. The matter became known to all the residents of the Bao, provoking public outrage, believing that forcing a lonely widower to death was a violation of humanity. The neighbors jointly submitted a petition to the Wuxing Court to report the matter and request legal action to redress the grievances of the deceased.

Yixing: Captured and Escorted Traitor to Suzhou

In Guanlin Town, Yixing Fourth District, there is a Miao Xiaorong. During the enemy's puppet regime, he served as a spy for the enemy army and also served as the captain of the puppet security team. Relying on the enemy's puppet power, he oppressed the people, and more than a hundred people were poisoned by him. Since the victory, Miao fled in fear of punishment. In December of last year, he was once arrested by County Magistrate Wang, but unexpectedly, the traitor was extremely cunning and escaped under the cover of night. By May of this year, all the township chiefs of the district jointly reported him, and he was captured by the county government. It is reported that he has been escorted to the Suzhou High Court for interrogation.

Hangzhou: Issuing Bad Checks and Fleeing with Funds

Zhang Fenggang, from Bazibridge in Tangqi Town, made a living selling silk with his father before the war. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he specialized in being a broker. After the victory, he changed to running Shen Su, which was quite active, so he gained the trust of all parties. On August 13th of this year, he was hired by a merchant shop in Panxi City, not knowing self-love. After a few days, he issued bad checks to easily obtain huge sums of money and goods from various shops and residents, totaling about 30 million yuan, claiming to be going to the Wuxi area, but never returned. Yesterday, the creditors held a creditors' meeting at the Louxi Entertainment Club, recommending Fan Huoyan, Lu Chutang, and Shao Fuchang as the organizers, reporting to the competent authority, applying for provisional execution, and publishing rewards in newspapers. It is said that the largest creditor is Feng Jiasheng, and Yao Yuandeng, the owner of Yao Dasheng Cloth Store, also has one million yuan owed.

### London Conference Convened on September 9 to Discuss Palestine Issue; Britain Has Sent Invitations to Arab and Jewish Nationalities

[Combined News Report from Our Newspaper] The British government has announced that it will hold a conference with Arab and Jewish representatives in London on September 9 to discuss the Palestine issue. According to a United Press report from London, the British Foreign Office announced on the 26th that it has sent invitations to the governments of Arab countries, the Jewish Agency for Palestine, and the Arab Higher Committee of Palestine. Although Colonial Secretary Hall has discussed the conference issue with Jewish Agency leaders, this is the first time that a formal invitation has been issued to the Agency. The Jewish Agency Executive Committee announced in Paris last week that if the conference is based on the partition plan for Palestine drafted by British and American experts, the Jewish Agency does not intend to attend. The British Foreign Office's announcement did not specify whether the scope of the conference would exceed the plan that Britain has accepted as a basis for negotiation but the United States has not yet agreed to. It is likely that they will first talk to Jewish and Arab representatives separately and then make a decision.

Arab Participation in the Conference Proposed Four Conditions

On the same day that Britain issued the invitations, the Arab Higher Committee of Palestine also issued a memorandum, declaring its four principles for participating in the London Conference: (1) Opposition to any form of partition plan, (2) Palestine should enjoy the political rights of an independent sovereign state in accordance with the promise given to King Hussein by President Wilson's Fourteen Points and the Atlantic Charter of the United Nations Charter, (3) Negotiations should be based on complete independence and not on the Balfour Declaration or the League of Nations' mandate, (4) The delegation does not intend to make specific decisions without obtaining the opinions of the Palestinian Arabs. The memorandum also stated that although the London Conference has no real hope, the Committee has decided to send a delegation to London to attend for the sake of the interests of the Palestinian Arab people. As for the preconditions previously put forward, namely that the Chairman of the Committee, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Hussein, should be one of the representatives, are still valid. However, according to a United Press report, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem colluded with Hitler during the war, which was abhorrent to Britain. British officials had previously publicly stated that they did not want to invite him to participate.

### Disturbances in Tunisia; Pan-Arab Movement Activists Arrested

[News Report from Our Newspaper] Paris, 27th Emergency Broadcast: Since the arrest of several figures in Changdi, a strike movement is spreading in the city of Tunisia, and the situation is very turbulent.

The party is called the "Taidal" party, which is quite powerful in Tunisia. The French government ordered its dissolution on April 9, 1946.

### Su'ao Representative Engages in a New Fierce Debate at the Peace Conference Yesterday; Australia Opposes Arbitrary Changes to European Territory; Accuses the Four Powers of Making Bargain-Style Decisions

[Comprehensive News from This Newspaper] According to Paris Radio: During the meeting of the Economic Committee on Italy on the 27th to discuss reparations, the Australian representative proposed an amendment, believing that this issue must be handled fairly and that the economic situation of the former enemy countries should also be taken into consideration, and they should not be reduced to economic vassals of other countries. During the meeting of the Political and Territorial Committee on Romania, the Australian representative again proposed an amendment, and as a result, the proposal for fair treatment of some parts was passed, while the part concerning the rights of ethnic minorities was opposed by the Soviet representative.

According to a United Press dispatch, another new fierce debate unfolded at the Peace Conference on the 27th, because the Australian representative advocated the establishment of a special investigation committee to investigate the true basis of the various territorial changes decided by the Big Four of the Five-Power Conference. The Australian representative stated that he opposed any territorial changes unless all the behind-the-scenes facts of such changes were known beforehand, and condemned such bargain-style territorial change decisions in the Four-Power Conference. During the meeting of the Italian Political Committee on the 27th, when studying the territorial clauses of the treaty with Italy, the Big Four proposed that Italy should cede four small border areas to France, which immediately aroused fierce debate. Australian representative Hodgson stated that Australia was unwilling to blindly endorse the bargain-style territorial change decisions of the Big Four and suggested that a committee should be formed to study the decision and the reasons behind it, and then submit recommendations to the General Assembly. The Big Four indicated that they would strongly oppose this Australian proposal. Hodgson said: "Australia does not want to be criticized by posterity for blindly accepting the resolutions of the Big Four without understanding the facts. The Atlantic Charter places two obligations on us (including the Big Four): (1) There should be no territorial changes unless it is the wish of the residents; (2) Respect the right of the people to choose their government. I would like to ask whether the Big Four have considered this."

Soviet representative Vyshinsky vehemently criticized Australia's territorial proposal in his reply, accusing Australia of attempting to delay the conference and referring to Hodgson as a "village boy who has just entered the city, hastily writing history, while ignoring the situation before his arrival in the city." Vyshinsky said that Australia's plan would destroy all the work accomplished by the Four Powers' foreign ministers in drafting the peace treaty over several months. Vyshinsky warned that if Australia's proposal were accepted, it would delay the Peace Conference by four to six months. Vyshinsky said: "This proposal reminds me of an opera in which the soldiers sing 'Forward, forward,' but in fact, they are standing in place. Australia's proposal has an air of procrastination." Hodgson replied that the Soviet delegation was trying to shove its fist down the throat of those who questioned the decisions of the Big Four, and then accused the Soviet delegation of delaying the conference. Hodgson then put forward a resolution, proposing that the review of territorial changes be limited to disputed areas. Later, another Australian representative, Peaceley, launched a fierce attack on the Soviet Union; he said, "We refuse to be intimidated by any great power, but the Soviet delegation is delaying the work of the conference. This point should be repeatedly explained so that world opinion knows the suffering we have endured for a month." British Chairman Leefe tried to stop him but was unsuccessful. Peaceley punched the table and pointed his finger directly at Vyshinsky.

According to London Radio, the Economic Committee on Italy and the Political and Territorial Committee on Romania met at 3:00 PM on the 27th. The meeting was adjourned at 6:00 PM. The Political and Territorial Committee on Finland was also scheduled to meet on the 27th, but it was canceled at the last minute. According to Agence France-Presse: During the meeting of the Political and Territorial Committee on Bulgaria on the afternoon of the 26th, the Byelorussian representative proposed an amendment, advocating that Bulgaria be recognized as a common co-belligerent, and that the country had already fought against Germany even before signing the armistice agreement with China. When the proposal was put to a vote, only Byelorussia, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia voted in favor. The remaining countries, including the Soviet Union, opposed it. The Soviet Union insisted that the draft prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers should remain unchanged.

### We Submit Another Amendment to the Treaty of Peace with Italy

According to Agence France-Presse: The Chinese delegation submitted another important amendment to the Peace Conference on the 26th. First, regarding the fate of Italian colonies, there were three key points: (1) The final disposition of Italian colonies by the Peace Conference should establish a basic principle, which should be consistent with the trusteeship system stipulated in the United Nations Charter. (2) The Peace Conference should declare to the world that any decision should regard the interests and wishes of the residents of the Italian colonies as the paramount factor. (3) The de jure status of the former colonies should be determined separately according to the political development of each colony. Accordingly, regarding Libya, the treaty should stipulate that it should be granted immediate independence or be placed under United Nations trusteeship for a number of years. Second, regarding the amendment of Sections 18, 19, and 20 of Section 4, "Special Interests for Italy," of the draft treaty of peace with Italy to make it consistent with the current situation, the most important amendment was "Italy agrees to return all property and archives of the former Italian concession in Tianjin to the Chinese government." According to the original text of the draft, "Italy agrees to return all related documents in the archives of the former concession to the Chinese government."

### General de Gaulle Expresses His Opinion on the Draft Constitution

[News from This Newspaper] Paris, 27th, Urgent Radio: When General de Gaulle expressed his opinion on the draft constitution currently being discussed in the Constituent Assembly, he said, "Giving me the qualification of a layman without any official position, I express my opinion." He briefly stated that the constitution should give the government the greatest possible independence and unity, which is a prerequisite; otherwise, it would only be an untrustworthy institution. Regarding the issue of the French Federation, de Gaulle believed that a joint institution should be created, composed of various regions of the mainland and overseas: a federal president, a federal council, and ministers responsible for various activities within the federation. "These ministers should be jointly responsible." In fact, everything is directed by the president, and if we have several ministers, there is a danger of having several governments.

### Hitler Ordered Goering to Prepare for Germ Warfare

Confession by Captured German Scientist

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 26th] Captured German scientist Schreiber confessed: Hitler ordered General Goering to prepare for germ warfare. The Germ Warfare Research Institute was established in Poznan, Poland. However, due to the continuous advance of the Red Army, the research work could not proceed. Himmler deeply desired to continue this work, but General Blome, who was in charge of the research, believed that the war was approaching the German border, and if there were no special protective measures, the German military and civilians would inevitably suffer at the same time.

### Anti-Soviet White Russian Immigrants for Over 25 Years on Trial Yesterday at the Moscow Military Tribunal; Main Defendant Had Close Ties with the Japanese Military; Conspiring to Seize Siberia to Strike at Soviet Power in Europe

[United Press, Moscow, 27th] The Supreme Military Tribunal here today began the trial of Semyonov, the leader of the anti-revolutionary Cossacks, and seven accomplices, revealing a major conspiracy by anti-Bolshevik White Russian immigrants in the East, with the assistance of the Japanese, to seize Soviet power, which has been going on for over 25 years. The details are not yet known, but according to White Russian political leaders exiled in New York, the main defendant must undoubtedly be Semyonov, who led a White Russian army in Siberia from 1918 to 1922 and had close ties with the Japanese General Staff. During the interrogation in Moscow, Semyonov confessed that the Japanese once offered to provide 20 million Japanese yen to help him lead anti-revolutionary activities in Siberia, but he refused because he thought the amount was too small. Semyonov and his accomplices were accused of armed resistance, espionage, subversion, and terrorist activities against the Soviet Union. The defendants included Prince Ukhtomsky of the Tsarist era (who was captured by the Red Army in the Northeast), who pleaded guilty to all charges. Most of the defendants were over 70 years old and had served as junior officers in the Tsarist army. Semyonov confessed that after 1920, he and other White Russians working for the Japanese formulated a plan to seize Siberia as a base to defeat Soviet power in Europe. He also established espionage networks in various parts of the East, which ceased operations until Japan surrendered last August.

### American Aircraft Unable to Obtain Landing Rights in Eastern Europe

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] State Department aviation officials announced: The U.S. government has not yet been able to obtain landing rights for American commercial aircraft in most countries within the Soviet sphere of influence in Eastern Europe.

Poland, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria intend to develop their own aviation with Soviet assistance, so it is very difficult for American aircraft to obtain landing rights there.

### France Withdraws Proposal to Settle Territorial Dispute with Siam in The Hague; Also Opposes Siam's Admission to the United Nations

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The government officially announced today: The French government has decided to withdraw its proposal for compromise with Siam and demand that Siam return a portion of the Vietnamese and Cambodian provinces occupied in 1941. This decision by France was due to the Siamese government's involvement in the Sirepul village massacre (Sirepul village belongs to Cambodian province, close to Siam, and recently suffered an attack, resulting in several deaths and injuries), and it has informed the US government of this intention. At the same time, the French government is unable to agree to Siam's application to join the United Nations.

It should be noted that the outside world's attention to the French-Siamese dispute began when the Siamese government reported in May that French troops had invaded Siam and bombed villages in the Mekong River area. In July, the Siamese government requested the United Nations to submit the matter to the Security Council, but the US State Department subsequently announced that France had asked the US to find a way to have Siam submit the case to the Hague Tribunal for a ruling.

### American Fleet Cruising the Mediterranean; Arrives in the Port of Naples; Britain Denies Establishing Military Bases in Turkey

### Internal Strife Continues Unabated; Indian Crisis Lurks; Jinnah States He Still Has No Intention to Cooperate; British Commissioner to India Being Selected

[Comprehensive News from This Newspaper] Since the establishment of the Indian Interim Government, Governor-General Wavell made a broadcast speech appealing to the Muslim League for cooperation, but the response from the Muslim League has not been very good, but the door to negotiations has not been completely closed. According to a Reuters dispatch from Bombay, Muslim League Chairman Jinnah issued a statement on the night of the 26th, stating that Governor-General Wavell's move to organize the Indian Interim Government was the most unwise action and not the attitude a politician should have, and it is likely to cause dangerous and serious consequences. I feel that the Governor-General's broadcast is a major blow to the Muslim League and Muslim India, but I hope that Muslims will accept this blow with the spirit of patience and struggle and learn a lesson from our failure to obtain a reasonable position in the Interim Government and the Constituent Assembly. Looking at the candidates for the new government, the three Muslim members appointed by the Governor-General are not respected and trusted by Indian Muslims, which is an insult. We have repeatedly stated that the partition of India is the only way to solve the Indian problem. The Governor-General said in his broadcast that "the door to suggestions is still open," and I don't know what this means, but I am pleased that the Governor-General, on behalf of the Congress Party, stated that a coalition government in which both major parties are represented is still needed and that the Muslim League should continue to be involved.

On the Congress Party side, since Chairman Nehru has taken office as the head of the Indian Interim Government, a new chairman will be elected at the Executive Committee meeting on the 27th. Former Congress Party Chairman Acharya Kripalani and recently retired Congress Party Secretary-General Kripalani seem to be the most likely to be elected.

After the Interim Government is established and formally exercises its powers, the "Custodian Government" led by the Governor-General will immediately be declared over, and the rule of the Governor-General representing the British King will also be terminated at the same time. According to Agence France-Presse, London, 26th, Downing Street No. 10, the Prime Minister's residence, announced that Britain intends to establish a High Commission in India and is actively preparing for it. All staff are expected to travel to India in mid-September with Acting High Commissioner Simons. As for the candidate for High Commissioner, the Foreign Office will appoint him and will announce the appointment soon, and he is expected to take office in November.

According to a United Press dispatch, the current situation in India, although seemingly calm on the surface, is in fact, the internal crisis is becoming increasingly significant. This is not only an internal dispute between Indians and Muslims, but also includes the entire difficult problem of the relationship between the Indian people and the British rulers. The future development of this matter may be so serious that the so-called problems of Palestine and others will pale in comparison. The Interim Government has been established, the Congress Party has an overwhelming majority, and their slogan has always been "British rulers withdraw from India." Congress Party leader and Interim Government Chairman Nehru has publicly stated that once the Interim Government is established, if the Governor-General appointed by Britain still wants to exercise any power, "he will conflict with us." The Congress Party's attitude towards demanding "British withdrawal from India" has not changed at all. Observers generally believe that a full-scale conflict between India and Britain is not far off. In fact, if the Indian and Muslim parties want to seek unity and achieve true independence for India, they must shift their goal and fight against Britain.

### Our Country's Baojia System Spreads to India

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 27th] Riots continue unabated in various parts of India, and public security is worrying. Interim Government Chairman Nehru has launched the promotion of a system similar to China's Baojia system to prevent disturbances from occurring. All residents are incorporated into mutual security groups, and mutual security chiefs are established. These mutual security chiefs form a defense organization responsible for protecting public security.

### Japanese Parliament Extended

(5) Don't know 6.3

### The United States Formally Announces Acceptance of the Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice - A First in American History

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] President Truman sent a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Lie, declaring that the United States formally accepts the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. This measure is a first in American history. Johnson, the U.S. representative to the United Nations, also attached a letter stating, "My action today proves that my government is determined to do everything in its power to enable the United Nations to complete its mission. We believe that the development of international law has reached a stage that is sufficient to guide and form the basis of international relations. We further believe that in order to guarantee the continued development of international law and enable it to complete its mission, all disputes that are subject to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice should be submitted to a responsible tribunal for adjudication. It is believed that after the widespread acceptance of the responsibilities of this court, the status of law in international relations will be greatly advanced." Johnson's letter also stated that the International Court of Justice will only hear legal disputes limited to the following four circumstances: (1) Interpretation of treaties, (2) Implementation of international law, (3) Decisions on events that constitute violations of international law, (4) Determining the nature and importance of compensation when violating international obligations. However, it will not apply in the following three situations: (1) If a dispute arises and both parties agree to submit the event to another court, (2) If the dispute is within the judicial scope of the United States, (3) If the dispute is related to multilateral treaty provisions. For the last situation, if all signatory countries and both parties to the dispute are willing to submit to the International Court of Justice, the United States will also agree to submit to the International Court of Justice. The validity period of this agreement is set at five years, and the United States may issue a memorandum within six months after the expiry date to determine whether it remains effective.

The Japan National Go Association will award Wu and Hashimoto 5,000 yen each to promote the competition, regardless of who wins. If Wu wins, other Go players who have reached the 8-dan level may honor him as a (9-dan) Go player. It is noted that Japan has not had anyone achieve this highest honor since the death of a certain national player seven years ago.

### Defendant's Defense Lawyers Cross-Examine Exhaustively: Puyi's Testimony Ends Yesterday: Puppet Emperor Denies Colluding with Japan to Plot Restoration: Judges Allow Him to Leave Tokyo After Deliberation

[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 27th] Today was the eighth day of the puppet Emperor Puyi's testimony at the Far East International Military Tribunal. For the past eight days, the defense lawyers have repeatedly questioned Puyi, trying to prove that he colluded with the Japanese and voluntarily became a puppet. Puyi, on the other hand, has insisted that he was forced by the Kwantung Army to take the puppet position, that he had not dreamed of restoration beforehand, and that he had even tried to recover lost territory for China afterward, but his heart was willing, but his strength was insufficient. Today, the defense lawyer Okamoto first asked: "Did the witness seek help from the Japanese government to become the Emperor of China again and recover the Forbidden City? Was the witness dissatisfied because his request was rejected by the Japanese?" Puyi replied: "This matter is completely fabricated." The defense lawyer Fujii asked: "When the witness approved decrees, was there a 'Minister of State' to explain them?" Puyi replied, "The explanation was very simple, and I could not express any opposition. Everything was decided by the Kwantung Army." Puyi then testified that the defendant Hoshino, from December 1936 to July 1940, when he served as the "Chief of General Affairs" of Manchukuo, a part of the bureau chiefs of the puppet regime were from the Northeast, and the backbone cadres at the section chief level of the puppet regime also mostly employed people from the Northeast, but

they were all puppets

only. Sakai then asked Puyi who were the Northeastern officials he trusted? At this time, the presiding judge suddenly declared: "This kind of questioning is of no help to the court. What we want to know is whether the witness was a puppet or not. No matter how you cross-examine him, this witness will never overturn his position that he was under Japanese pressure at the time. But whether we believe this witness or not is another matter." Fujii then asked Puyi to give concrete examples to prove that he was under pressure from the Kwantung Army. Puyi replied: "Every move was restricted, how can I list them one by one?" The defense lawyer Fujii also asked Puyi whether he had contacted China to realize the goal of recovering lost territory. Puyi replied: "Because I was under

strict Japanese surveillance

I was unable to make contact." He asked about the organization and funding of the guards who trained the witnesses. Puyi replied: "The guards were composed of Chinese and Mongolians, with slightly more Chinese. The funding was raised by me." Fujii wanted to ask about the freedom of income and expenditure of funds, but the presiding judge rejected it as "irrelevant." Fujii then turned to the opium issue. Puyi testified: "In 1932, a ban on opium was announced in order to reduce smoking, but on the other hand, the planting of opium was encouraged, and the planting volume increased year by year, and laborers and students were forced to engage in planting work. Those who were poisoned were issued permits by the government, so the number increased year by year." Then the defense lawyer Matthias asked: "On November 3, 1931, the witness met with the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Kuwashima. Kuwashima told him that

the Emperor of Japan hoped he would restore

and become emperor in Manchuria. Did the witness express hope for restoration at that time, ask Kuwashima how to restore, what assistance the Japanese government would provide, and how to escape from Tianjin?" Puyi replied: "This matter is entirely fabricated by the Japanese. There is no such fact at all." Matthias then asked: "On November 13, 1931, did the witness not say to Consul-General Kuwashima: "The time for restoration is not yet ripe?" Puyi replied: "There is no such thing." Matthias wanted to continue cross-examining, but was opposed by the chief prosecutor Keenan, so he ended the cross-examination. Puyi testified for eight days and then left the court amidst the clicking of cameras. Then the judges present deliberated and decided to allow Puyi to leave Tokyo.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 27th] When the International Military Tribunal opened today, the defense lawyers continued to cross-examine Puyi, trying to prove that Puyi eagerly pursued the throne of the puppet Manchukuo and fully colluded with Japan. Puyi vehemently argued that his appointment as the puppet emperor was forced by the Japanese army. The presiding judge

Webb expressed impatience

and immediately declared: This kind of testimony has clearly indicated that Puyi was under pressure. The court may end the cross-examination of Puyi. This does not mean that we believe the testimony, because continuing the cross-examination is absolutely useless. The defendant's defense lawyer today wanted to prove that Puyi received an annual salary of 3 million yen from the puppet Manchukuo government, of which 800,000 yen was used as "pocket money." The puppet government also issued 5 million yen in public bonds, and Puyi could receive 150,000 yen in interest annually. The presiding judge Webb stopped him, saying that the question was only whether Puyi was a puppet, and his salary had nothing to do with it.

### Court Plans to Invite Experts to Identify Puyi's Handwriting

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th, United Press] The defense lawyers' sharp pressure on Puyi at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal has prompted the court to consider hiring handwriting experts to prove whether the important documents of "Manchukuo" were written by Puyi, because Puyi claimed that the documents were all fabricated. The defense lawyers confirmed Puyi's handwriting from a fan. Puyi had given this fan to his English teacher Reginald Johnston, who wrote the book "Twilight in the Forbidden City," which describes Puyi's dangerous life. A photo of this fan is printed in the book. The defense lawyers explained that they wanted to prove that the documents of "Manchukuo" were written by Puyi, so the court approved their request. Presiding Judge Webb told the defense lawyers that when the court begins to prove whether Puyi is lying by handwriting, it will need the assistance of handwriting experts. The Japanese defense lawyers today also mentioned another mysterious murder case in the cruel history of "Manchukuo" to the court. Puyi had previously stated that the Japanese had murdered an unfriendly Chinese provincial governor, but he could not provide further proof other than vague evidence. Tojo's defense lawyer, Kiyose Ichiro, said that the Chinese provincial governor was convicted and executed after legal trial procedures. Puyi immediately retorted: Many people died as a result of the atrocities of the Japanese, but the "Manchukuo" trials were only a formality to eliminate the enemies of the Kwantung Army.

### Sun Tianchang's Crimes Established: Decision to Send to Court for Detention and Interrogation: Embezzlement by China Textile Company Staff: Thorough Investigation Based on Secret Reports: Investigation Team to Discuss the Issue of the Working Period

The original working period for the Clearing and Investigation Team for the Reception Work in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas was set at fifty days. Now, the first group of the team has been stationed in Shanghai for more than a month, and several important cases have not yet come to a conclusion. Currently, Committee Member Wu Wangji is traveling to Nanjing to report on the progress of the reception work clearing in Shanghai to Secretary-General Shao Lizi and Deputy Secretary-General Zhen of the Joint Office of the National Clearing and Investigation Teams for Reception Work. He has requested instructions on whether the working period can be extended. It has been learned that Secretary-General Shao replied: The teams in Shanghai and Hangzhou are the busiest and most complicated. There are many enemy and puppet materials in Shanghai, and there are many disputes, so the work is difficult, which is expected. The 50-day deadline is a general rule. If the facts cannot be completed, it is proposed to request careful extension again. It is also a remedial measure to transfer the unfinished cases to the local Supervisory Envoy's Office for continued handling. It is heard that Director Zhang and the committee members will discuss and decide on whether to extend the deadline in the next few days. Regarding the Sun Tianchang case, after review and investigation by the team, it is believed that the crime of aiding the enemy has been formally established. It has now been decided to transfer the case to the court for trial, and the defendant has been handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office for detention. Regarding the warehouse section, Director Zhang will today accompany Committee Members Wu and Zhang to inspect the warehouses received by the Ministry of Military Administration, and will continue to conduct spot checks. Regarding the secret report举报 on the Fourth Municipal Hospital's secret sale of received materials, the investigators of the team stated that there is no factual basis and are currently reviewing the face-to-face investigation report. In addition, there have been three or four secret reports举报 to the team about the internal organization of the China Textile Construction Company of the Ministry of Economic Affairs being unsound and staff members engaging in private embezzlement. It is heard that the team is thoroughly investigating the case in order to obtain the truth. In addition, disputes over real estate and land of educational institutions and schools will be handled by Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen in conjunction with the Land Administration Bureau. Zhang has served in the education sector for more than ten years and attaches great importance to such cases. Zhang said that if anyone has encroached on school property, he will resolutely investigate and return it. Also, at 12:00 noon yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and the Youth League Headquarters held a banquet at the New Life Club on Weihaiwei Road, inviting the Director and all members of the Clearing and Investigation Team. During the banquet, they extensively exchanged views on general clearing work.

### The Guisheng Wheel Wanted to Depart but Stopped Again: Canceled after Customs Clearance: Notice to Retrieve the Loaded Goods: Customs Admits All Losses

[Report from this newspaper] The British Jardine Matheson Shipping Department's Guisheng Wheel, which was loaded with relief supplies from Hong Kong to Qingjin via Shanghai, was canceled after customs clearance on the 26th because it loaded goods and passengers in Shanghai, hindering China's shipping rights, after objections from the Shipowners' Association. The shipping department of the company announced to the customs brokers at 11:30 a.m. yesterday that it would stop loading goods, and those that had already been loaded into the cabin would also have to be retrieved. According to the person in charge of the company, the Guisheng Wheel should have transported relief supplies entrusted by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to Qingjin. The loading of passengers and goods was approved by the customs authorities in advance, so the customs brokers' signing and declaration were approved. When the cargo trucks arrived at the pier, they were also inspected and loaded onto the ship by customs officers, and some of the goods had already been loaded into the cabin. Later, it was heard that there were objections from all parties. For the sake of caution, on Saturday, the authorities were asked for instructions again, and it was specially facilitated, allowing the last shipment. Therefore, before 3:00 p.m. on the 26th, the export procedures for customs clearance and the consulate were completed. Unexpectedly, at around 5:00 p.m., the customs suddenly called and ordered the return of the customs clearance form, and declared that the error of allowing the Guisheng Wheel to load passengers and goods was admitted, and all losses were admitted. The representatives of the customs brokers were greatly surprised when they heard the news. A senior official announced the method: if the goods on the ship and the wharf are not transported away, they can be piled into the Huangpu River, and the stack rent of the Dalian Steamship Warehouses will be recognized by the line. All losses should be described in letters, so that they can be collected and negotiated with the customs. As for the declared customs form, it is not necessary to report for customs refund again, and the form will be changed when loading on other ships, which has also been allowed by the customs. The customs brokers who loaded the Guisheng Wheel held a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the matter, and the result is unknown. The ship was originally scheduled to sail north this afternoon, but due to the need to unload cargo and re-clear customs, etc., it may not be able to leave the mooring today. Although the passenger tickets have been registered, fortunately they have not been sold, so there is no need to handle ticket refunds. As for the relief supplies loaded in Hong Kong, they still need to be transported to Qingjin for unloading.

### Our Occupation Army Stationed in Japan Will Cross the Sea Next Month

The first and second regiments of the 67th Division of our occupation army stationed in Japan arrived in Shanghai from Haiphong on the 5th and 16th of this month, respectively. Division Commander Dai Jian arrived in Shanghai on the 16th of this month. After arriving in Shanghai, Dai went to the division headquarters in Jiangwan that evening to handle important matters. Because the division has decided to go to Japan next month, its directly subordinate units and the second regiment have been ordered to leave Shanghai on the Jiangxing Wheel at 5:00 p.m. yesterday, led by Deputy Division Commander Liu Shenghe, to go to a certain place for training. Once the date for going to Japan is set, they will come to Shanghai to wait for the wheel. The first regiment of the division has been dispatched to Suzhou for garrison duty a few days ago and is now also ordered to assemble for training.

Wang Dazhi of the First Independent Branch of the Garrison Station has been dispatched to Japan at the beginning of next month to be responsible for handling all supply matters for the division in the occupied area.

### Tea Industry Association Hosts Journalists, Reports on the Truth about Tea Loans: Rumors of Misconduct Are Groundless: Hopes That the Government Will Continue to Offer Loans

[Report from this newspaper] The China Tea Industry Association hosted the local press at the Hong Kong Road Bank Association yesterday. Chairman Mai Jingwei reported on the details of the tea loans, saying: After a long period of resistance against Japan, the tea industry in our country has been suspended for a long time. After the victory, farmers and businesses lacked funds to engage in production or manufacturing. Therefore, various tea industry groups in the city applied to the Executive Yuan and the Four Joint Offices for loans of 20 billion yuan. Subsequently, the Four Joint Offices approved tea loans of 7 billion yuan for Zhejiang and Anhui provinces. The allocation amount: 1.8 billion yuan for the Qihong area, 1.5 billion yuan for the Tunlu area, 2.2 billion yuan for the Pinglu area, 500 million yuan for Wenzhou, 500 million yuan for Longjing, and 500 million yuan for other areas. The loan targets are limited to tea factories in the producing areas. The method is: (1) The member companies and firms of the Shanghai Tea Export Association list self-operated, joint-operated and specially-contracted tea factories, and fill in the number of tea boxes manufactured, the amount of funds and the amount of loans required, and send them to the China Agricultural Bank for approval. (2) The tea factories applying for loans need to be guaranteed by members of the Shanghai Tea Export Association for repayment, and the tea money will be directly lent to the tea factories by the local branches of the China Agricultural Bank, and a loan contract will be signed. Three parties are required to provide joint guarantees, and the guarantor must stamp the contract to prove it. The procedures are very detailed and strict. Recent reports in a certain newspaper that tea loans have been embezzled are unfounded and have no basis. The China Agricultural Bank will also issue a statement on this matter. It is also stated that although the tea loan was approved for 7 billion yuan, only 5.27 billion yuan was actually lent. If the cost of purchasing rough tea in various regions this year is calculated, an average of 140,000 to 150,000 yuan is required per dan. Therefore, the tea loan funds are only enough to purchase more than 30,000 dan of rough tea. In fact, the amount of rough tea purchased by various factories, Pinglu and Tunlu areas has been about 30,000 to 40,000 dan each, and a part of it has been refined into boxes. The Qihong area has refined more than 20,000 boxes, and the cost per box is more than 200,000 yuan. Therefore, the total amount of rough tea cheated in various regions has exceeded the amount of tea loans by several times. This can also prove that the saying that tea loans are embezzled is impossible. Tea merchants Wang Zenghuan and Tang Jisan also talked about the tea industry's crisis, which is still very serious. Because after the exchange rate increased, the price of American tea is still only 1,400 to 1,500 yuan per pound, while the domestic cost is more than 3,000 yuan per pound. Therefore, new tea has not been exported yet. We urgently hope that the government will quickly handle export subsidies to strive for the international market, and continue to allocate refining loans and second tea loans. Finally, Chairman Shou proposed to request the government to exempt or reduce the 10% general tax revenue. Wang Zhenshi also proposed to increase domestic sales, relying on the assistance of transportation and the improvement of manufacturing. He hoped that the industry could learn from Taiwan's roasting methods to strive for export status. The meeting adjourned at 4:30.

### China Agricultural Bank Announces the Process of Handling Tea Loans

The China Agricultural Bank also announced the process of handling tea loans, saying: "Recently, there have been news reports in the newspapers about the bank's spring tea loans that are not consistent with the facts. In order to make the public understand the truth, the bank specially publishes the details of the tea loan process as follows: According to this year's spring tea loans in the southeastern region, the government approved the plan and handed it over to the bank for handling. The handling situation: (1) The loan targets are tea farms or tea factories in various producing areas (a total of more than 200), with Shanghai tea merchants as repayment guarantors. The Southeastern Regional Farm and Factory Federation and the Tea Export Association jointly conduct preliminary review and introduction, and then the bank approves the loan amount according to the production situation in each region, and signs an agreement with the tea merchants in Shanghai who guarantee repayment. (2) All loans are signed with local farms and factories in various producing areas such as Tunxi, Shaoxing, and Wenzhou according to the agreement, and loans are made locally. (3) The government approved a total of 7 billion yuan in tea loans. The bank approved a total of 6.1 billion yuan in tea loans based on the production situation of various farms and factories. Except for the fact that local farms and factories have automatically given up due to poor exports and operating difficulties, the total amount actually lent is 5.2 billion yuan. (4) Farms and factories that receive loans should store the purchased tea leaves as collateral. According to reports from various branches in Shanghai, the amount of rough tea purchased by manufacturers in various regions exceeds the amount of loans. During this spring's mission, the transportation in various producing areas was extremely difficult, but in order to adapt to the situation and help tea farmers, the bank, with the assistance of the Central Bank, disregarded all difficulties and tried its best to transfer cash to prepare for the purchase of tea leaves by factories in various places. At the same time, the local branches in the producing areas reviewed the situation of local farms and factories according to the agreement, made loans separately, and sent auditors to patrol and supervise at any time. Looking at the tea purchase process of various farms and factories that obtained loans, it has benefited the tea farmers' economy a lot. Now the loans have gradually matured. Because the overseas tea market is sluggish, the bank is trying its best to assist its exports.

### Siren Will Sound Tonight: Citizens Don't Panic

The sirens in various places in the Huangpu District have been installed and will be officially taken over and controlled by the Huangpu Police Department at 8:00 p.m. today, and a test will be held.

It is also learned that the Lujiazui and Changshu districts will also be installed within the month, and all districts in the city will be fully installed by the end of the year.

### Mountain Lord Becomes a Canary: Tiger Acts as a Living Advertisement

[Report from this newspaper] "Are there any tigers in Shanghai now?" After hearing this sentence, you must think of the zoos in the two parks, right? However, after the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the birds and beasts in the zoo have all suffered disasters. Even the only tiger in Fuxing Park died of lung disease. After passing Fuxing Road on a moonlit night, I have not heard the low roar of a tiger from the trees for a long time!

However, there is still one surviving tiger in Shanghai. When he first came to Shanghai, he was only four months old and weighed only twenty pounds. Now he is fourteen years old and weighs more than two hundred pounds. If he were still in the deep mountains and old forests, he would have learned to eat people! However, his current environment makes him very docile and the owner also takes good care of him. He is given nine pounds of beef and fifteen eggs every day! Because he is well raised, his fur is very shiny. The once roaring "Mountain Lord" has become a "Canary" that pleases people. His owner also gave him a beautiful name, "Flower". When he hears someone call "Flower", he will gently raise his head. However, if mischievous people hit the edge of the cage with iron bars, he will still roar - but he cannot rush out, because there is no need for a door

there. If you also want to see him, I can tell you his address. He is in the Simingtang Pharmacy downstairs in the Zhongnan Hotel on Zhongzheng Middle Road (formerly Aiduya Road). His owner is Lao Yi, the owner of Simingtang. Now, Flower is the living trademark of Simingtang. In the future, Flower's remains will probably be used to make tiger bone papaya wine.

### Yu Xiang Is Under Strict Interrogation: Request for Bail Is Rejected

[Report from this newspaper] In the 120 million yuan embezzlement case of the Materials Office of the Two Roads Bureau, the case has become very clear since the heroine, Yu Xiang, the wife of Zhang Hongtu, the director of the Materials Office, was brought to justice for investigation. The prosecution will be filed in the near future. The night before last, when Yu was being interrogated, she requested bail from the court. The prosecutor reprimanded her for not surrendering to the court after coming to Shanghai. This time, the Two Roads Bureau has an official document to transfer her to the District Prosecutor's Office. Yu's application was rejected. The director's wife is now being held in the women's prison on Masinan Road.

### Milk Powder Trademark Changed: Two People Released After Interrogation

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the case of the U.S.-produced "Ronnip" brand milk powder with altered trademarks, it is now based on a letter from the company's representative bank: it is declared that the factory originally cabled: "Now ask your bank (referring to Tiancheng) to re-label the up brand milk powder and change it to the brand required by your bank". The facts do not violate criminal law. As for Lin Songnian and Wang Zongkang, who were arrested, they were released after the police station clarified the above situation.

### Eight Rong Case Kidnappers Executed; Two Accomplices Sentenced to Eight Years; Zhan Rongpei and Others Declared Innocent

[Report from Our Newspaper] The judgment of the Rong Desheng kidnapping case has been fully approved by the Ministry of National Defense via telegram the night before last. The principal offenders Luo Wenqing, Yuan Zhongshu, Wu Zhigang, Zheng Liantang, Huang Shaoyin, Zhao Shaozong, Zhu Chansheng, and Liu Ruibiao, eight in total, were sentenced to death with permanent deprivation of civil rights. They were escorted to Song Park execution grounds and executed by firing squad at 7:00 AM yesterday. Accomplices Luo Weiquan and Zhu Liansheng were sentenced to seven years of imprisonment with seven years of deprivation of civil rights, and are currently detained in the Tilanqiao Prison. Zhan Rongpei, Wu Jiyun, Gu Chushi, Chen Zhihe, and Chen Luo Shi, five in total, were declared innocent. However, they must still undergo formal approval procedures from the military law authorities, and therefore must post bail before they can be released.

To prevent any unexpected incidents during the execution of Luo Wenqing and the other eight convicts, the Garrison Headquarters exerted utmost effort to maintain secrecy beforehand. The chief examiner of the case, Section Chief Zhu, rose at 6:00 AM yesterday morning and brought forth the eight convicts from the detention center. He informed them that they were being executed by order and asked if they had any last words. Yuan Zhongshu said, "There is nothing else. It's just that my son is also currently imprisoned, and the younger one is only ten years old. I request that they be released to collect my body." Luo Wenqing similarly requested the release of his son Luo Binggen. Wu Zhigang remained silent, and the others also appeared dazed. Around 7:00 AM, nurses injected them with anesthesia, and then they were transported in two prison vans to Song Park execution grounds and executed by firing squad. According to the execution supervisor, who spoke to reporters afterwards, Luo Wenqing was already staggering and unable to walk when he arrived at the execution grounds.

The reasons for acquitting Zhan Rongpei and others in the judgment are as follows:

The crime of kidnapping for ransom, if one negotiates the ransom during the kidnapping process, although it can be considered as aiding and abetting the crime, it requires the intention to assist in the crime. If there is no intention to commit the principal offense and no contact with the kidnappers, merely acting as a family member of the kidnapped person to negotiate the ransom with the bandits, it is still difficult to consider it as aiding and abetting the crime of extortion. There is a precedent in the Supreme Court's ruling No. 1092 (Shang Zi) of the 22nd year of the Republic. Zhan Rongpei is the manager of Shenxin Factories No. 2 and No. 5 and has a very deep friendship with Rong Erren, the son of Rong Desheng. Rong's son entrusted Zhan Rongpei to negotiate the ransom in order to rescue his father, and Wu Zhigang took advantage of his relationship with Zhan, with whom he co-operated on the Hua Da Enterprise Company, to proceed with the negotiation. He had no intention of contacting the bandits, which Yuan Zhongshu and Wu Zhigang have admitted. The fact that he was entrusted by the family of the kidnapped person to negotiate the ransom has also been repeatedly stated and confirmed by Rong Desheng's son, Rong Erren, in his statements and evidence. Since there is no criminal act, an acquittal should be pronounced.

Although Gu Chushi is related to Yuan Zhongshu through marriage (daughter-in-law) and is Yuan's landlord, he had no intention of participating in the crime nor did he receive any share of the stolen money. Yuan Zhongshu has already confessed this. As for the 300,000 legal tender lent to Yuan, it has been verified that it was a loan before the Rong case kidnapping, and it has nothing to do with this case. The 500 US dollars and 300,000 legal tender found in his house were secretly hidden by Yuan's apprentice, Zhao Gaofu, which Yuan Zhongshu has confessed in his statement. Zhao Gaofu is still being pursued but has not yet been apprehended.

Wu Jiyun's younger sister, Wu Yuesheng, was kidnapped by Huang Ashi and made a concubine during the period of enemy occupation. Wu Jiyun runs a sailing business and resides in Shanghai. Although he had dealings with Huang, there is no factual evidence of his participation in the conspiracy.

Chen Luo Shi is Luo Wenqing's younger sister, and Chen Zhihe has lived with Chen Luo Shi for many years. Luo Wenqing deposited 3,000 US dollars of his share of the loot in his sister Chen Luo Shi's home. After the case occurred, these two were implicated and arrested.

### Wujin Fellow Townsmen Association Public Memorial for Qian Mingshan

Mr. Qian Mingshan of Wujin, a famous scholar of the late Qing Dynasty, submitted memorials criticizing the government, retired to the countryside, and devoted himself to disaster relief and rescue of the people. Mr. Qian was a Confucian master of his generation. His poetry, lyrics, and calligraphy were all admired by his contemporaries. People south of the Yangtze River are universally familiar with the name "Ge You Lao Ren." When the enemy army invaded, Mr. Qian hid in Shanghai, his integrity surpassing worldly concerns. Sadly, he passed away in September the year before last due to deep concern for the times, unable to witness the celebration of the unification of China. The Wujin Fellow Townsmen Association and the Jigui Alumni Association, commemorating the second anniversary of Mr. Qian's passing after the victory, have specially initiated a public memorial to be held tomorrow (the 29th) from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM at No. 6, Lane 102, Tongfu Road (between Weihaiwei Road and Fuxu Road) to commemorate him.

### Postal Truck Causes Major Accident; Two Dead, Four Injured

[Report from Our Newspaper] A parcel delivery truck (license plate number 1766) from the Sichuan Road Post Office Headquarters, as usual, was driven by the driver Wan A Si to various post offices at 6:00 AM every morning to load parcels. Yesterday morning, the truck was returning from the 27th Post Office in Wujiaochang to the Headquarters when, upon reaching Fanhua Du Road and Kaina Road, the steel plate broke, and the Weirpan failed. At the same time, the brakes were damaged, making it impossible for the driver to control the vehicle. The truck went straight ahead, first overturning a pedicab, injuring both the passenger and the driver. Then it ran onto the sidewalk and knocked over a bread stall. It continued to drive to No. 94 Fanhua Du Road, near the donation office of the Bureau of Finance, killing two pedestrians and seriously injuring two others. After the Jiangning Sub-bureau sent police to investigate, it was learned that one of the deceased was named Zhang Chiliang, and the other's surname and given name are unknown. Three people were seriously injured and one person was slightly injured in the incident. The driver, Wan A Si, who caused the accident, along with witness Chen Wenbin (who ran a soda stall at the intersection of Kaina Road), were taken to the bureau for interrogation and reported to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### Egerton's Remarks: UNRRA Relief Plan to Be Completed as Soon as Possible; Expected Not to Be Completed by the End of March Next Year; Embargoed Materials Have in Fact Been Lifted Item by Item

[Report from Our Newspaper] The new Director of the UNRRA Office in China, Lieutenant General Egerton, hosted a reception for reporters at the Capital Hotel yesterday morning, which was also attended by the Acting Director, Mr. Lai. Mr. Egerton stated that he had recently arrived in China and had limited knowledge of the work of the UNRRA Office in China and the situation in China. UNRRA's mission is arduous, and the scope of relief needed in China is so vast that difficulties are inevitable. He had heard about these difficulties in Washington. He expressed his satisfaction with the efforts of UNRRA staff under these circumstances. In the future, within the limits of what the situation permits, he will complete UNRRA's post-war relief plan as soon as possible.

Based on general observations, he expected that the termination could be postponed. Regarding the cancellation of the embargo, Mr. Egerton stated that the situation is gradually improving, and the various materials under embargo have in fact been lifted item by item.

### Robbery of Shantytowns in Pudong; Three Thieves Arrested and Confess

[Report from Our Newspaper] In the area around Yinxianggang Maqiao on Xinshi Street, Yangshupu, Pudong, robberies by bandits have been occurring frequently, victimizing the residents of shantytowns. Wang Xinheng, the head of the Yangshupu Police Sub-bureau, specifically ordered Xu Shibin, the head of the Second Unit, to investigate. On the morning of the 25th, detectives Zhang Yunsheng and Ji Bingquan learned that firearms were buried in the wasteland along the Huangpu River near Guangxin Pier on Guangxin Road within their jurisdiction. The police officers went to excavate and found five homemade Mauser bullets. With this clue, they predicted that bandits would come. Therefore, they dispatched disguised police to stay and wait. As expected, at dusk that day, one person arrived and lingered for a long time before trying to leave. They were immediately apprehended and strictly interrogated. He confessed that he was Xiong Jinglin from Anhui and that he had accomplices, including Chen Jiabao, who lived in a bungalow on Longjiang Road. They then rushed to that address and arrested Chen. Chen then confessed that Gao Yongman was hiding in a bungalow at the junction of that road. They continued to arrest Gao. Under preliminary interrogation, they admitted to robbing Fei Huamin's home at No. 5 Ma Yushan Road, as well as four or five other shantytowns one after another in the Zhao Jiazhai area of Huangxing Road. They also admitted that they had a small Mauser rifle that they brought from Anhui, which had been sold by Li Guoshan, who lives in Yiren Lane on Yangshupu Road. Therefore, the sub-bureau is continuing its investigation.

### Whether Horse Racing at the Racecourse Can Resume; Must Be Submitted to the Municipal Council for Discussion

[Report from Our Newspaper] There has been much discussion about the proposal to resume horse racing at the racecourse in this city. According to the person in charge of studying the plan, it is believed that in the current situation of the city government's economic constraints, resuming horse racing may not be a way to increase revenue. And given the rampant speculation in the city, horse racing may not be a legitimate form of entertainment. In the long term, if the city government's finances are once abundant, the racecourse can be bought and developed as a park for the entertainment of all citizens, which would be even more ideal. Although the above opinions have been repeatedly considered, they still need to be approved by the upcoming City Council before they can be realized.

### Lawsuit Involving Failure to Deliver on Fixed Order

Hua Ying Company States Its Case

[Report from Our Newspaper] This newspaper has reported twice on a lawsuit involving a dispute between the Hua Ying Enterprise Company of this city and the Lian Ying Company regarding a fixed order for goods. According to Chiang Lu-tang, the general manager of Hua Ying Company, who told reporters yesterday, the company had signed a contract with Qin Sibao, the manager of Lian Ying Company, on January 14 of this year to order 1,000 rolls of Pabco roofing felt from the United States for a price of US$5,502.27, agreeing to deliver the goods before the end of March of this year. If the goods could not be shipped and delivered by then, the entire loan should be refunded at that time. A deposit of US$825 was paid at the time of signing the contract. On February 18, the Central Bank remitted US$4,677.27 to the United States, and the entire payment was cleared at that time. However, Qin Sibao claimed that the payment was delayed, and the delivery of the goods would also have to be delayed by five weeks. Hua Ying had no objection. Later, Qin Sibao claimed that the goods had been shipped from the United States on the Sea Belenng and showed a telegram. Unexpectedly, months passed without any news. On July 13, Qin Sibao again said that the goods could be shipped on August 17, but when asked what the name of the ship was, he evaded answering. Hua Ying made an appointment to meet with him, but he avoided meeting altogether. On July 22, they filed a complaint with the Huangpu Sub-bureau, requesting his arrest to prevent him from escaping. An immediate settlement was reached at the police station, and Qin Sibao promised to refund the payment. Qin immediately issued a check No. A378423 from the American Da Li Bank dated August 22 with a face value of 2,085,000 legal tender, and stated in the mediation that he "will never notify the bank to stop payment of the check." However, when Hua Ying Company went to pay on time, the check was dishonored. They then filed another complaint accusing Qin Sibao of setting up a false business and fraudulently obtaining property. The general manager stated that this spring, the market price of roofing felt in Shanghai was 70,000 per roll. If this shipment of 1,000 rolls could be delivered on time, the value would be 70 million. By only demanding the refund of the payment of 2,085,000 from Qin Sibao, the company has already suffered a huge loss. In addition to this batch of roofing felt, Hua Ying Company also ordered 65 barrels of "roofing felt asphalt," 200 tons of cement, and 1,200 raincoats from Qin Sibao, and the payments were all made several months ago. Qin Sibao has not delivered any goods.

### Beware of Pickpockets; Fourteen Types of Pickpocketing Techniques; "Technical" Grand Performance; Quick-Eyed and Nimble-Handed, Better Than Shi Qian

[Report from Our Newspaper] In Shanghai, whether you are sitting on a tram or walking on the street, there is one very important thing you must never forget. That sentence is: "Pay attention to your clothes and belongings!"

There are more than four million people in Shanghai. These many people have all sorts of different occupations. Logically, it is naturally easier for those with quick eyes and nimble hands to find a job. However, quite a few people rely on their "quick eyes and nimble hands" to do "business without capital." They follow in the footsteps of Shi Qian, the Drum on the Water from the Water Margin, and learn to be thieves!

In the busiest Lao Zha District, the police station has to catch dozens of "pickpocket gangs" every week. After they are caught, their heads are shaved so that others can easily recognize them. But pickpocketing is not a major crime, so the punishment is often very light. Usually, they are only detained for a week or ten days, and then they are released. After they come out, they often lack the means to make a living, so many of them continue in their old profession.

The Lao Zha Sub-bureau has recently caught 52 thieves in the past week, including two girls, one 16-year-old named Wang Meidi and one 18-year-old named Chen Aizhen. Among these people, the oldest is 57 years old, named Lu Yulin, and the youngest is Bi Hongbin, who is only 14 years old this year!

Yesterday, in order to promote public awareness, the police station held a grand performance of pickpocketing techniques in the open space of the bureau. Four "players" selected from these 52 people demonstrated. It turned out that there are more than a dozen ways to pickpocket. They are now listed one by one below: (1) "Pushing the Rickshaw": Two people work together. One person blocks the rickshaw in front, and when the rickshaw stops, the person in the back tries to snatch things from the rickshaw. (2) "Chasing the Vegetable Buyers": Specifically stealing vegetable money or even fish and meat from the baskets of people buying vegetables. (3) "Running on Flat Ground": Three or four people work together. One sells socks and shirts on a street stall, attracting villagers to watch and taking the opportunity to pickpocket. (4) "Breaking In": Under the pretext of asking for directions, breaking into people's homes and stealing odds and ends of clothing. (5) "Surrounding the Tram": Pickpocketing when tram passengers are crowded, especially when getting on and off. Sometimes shouting "Watch out for your money" on the tram, causing passengers to unconsciously press on the pockets where they hide their money, allowing them to pinpoint the location and take action at any time. (6) "Tossing the Hat": Also known as "Catching the Turtle," i.e., snatching hats. (7) "Picking Up Trash": Seeing someone with money bulging out of their pocket, one person bumps into them from the front, and another person takes action. (8) "Cutting the Bag": Specifically stealing things carried on the back of bicycles. (9) "Ground Pickpocketing": Pedestrians carrying items, when tired, place their belongings on the ground to rest briefly. The pickpocket takes advantage of their unpreparedness to quietly steal them. (10) "Dropping the Bag": A pickpocket throws a fake gold ornament on the ground. After a greedy villager picks it up, another person immediately catches up and negotiates with them, insisting on getting back a little money before giving up. (11) "Switching the Package": Selling fabrics and other items on the street at low prices, taking advantage of the haggling to replace the real items with cotton wadding or straw. (12) "Quick Drawing": Stealing pens with quick movements. (13) "Steady Wind": Picking pockets when pedestrians are watching a lively event. (14) "Moving Wind": Taking action when pedestrians are walking and not paying attention.

There are many well-dressed individuals among the pickpocket gangs. These people have another name, called "Generals." There are many such "Generals" in Shanghai, leading their subordinates and roaming freely in the bizarre and colorful metropolis of Shanghai!

### Our Newspaper Hosts Feast for Advertising Agents; Expiration Date of August Grand Giveaway; Selected Impartially and Sealed, to Be Revealed at the End of the Month

Our newspaper's President Pan and General Manager Chen hosted a banquet at the Shanghai Restaurant on Gordon Road last night for advertising agents, with over 40 people in attendance. During the banquet, President Pan gave a speech: "I hope that all agents will continue to cooperate with our newspaper in the spirit of the past, and work together for the cause of journalism in the New China." At the same time, because the second joint grand giveaway organized by major factories and shops in August will soon expire, the special imprint date should be impartially selected immediately, so that it can be revealed at the end of the month. Therefore, following the precedent of July, 31 cards with different dates were prepared in advance, each card representing one day, as well as 31 blank envelopes. The cards were sealed into the envelopes one by one in public. Five guests each selected one envelope, and then Mr. Liu Jingchuan picked one envelope from the five. The date contained in that envelope would be the winning date.

Mr. Liu Jingchuan, Mr. Lu Dongsheng, and our newspaper each kept a key. The mouth of the box was sealed and signed, and it will be unsealed together at 4:00 PM on the 31st of this month, revealed the next day, to show impartiality.

### Repaying Kindness with Enmity: Jiangxi Woman Meets the Wrong Person

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yu Naijin, a local man, 25 years old, raised funds and went to Shangrao, Jiangxi to trade tobacco leaves last February. Unfortunately, he encountered thieves midway and was robbed clean, leaving him stranded in a foreign land. Cheng Fusheng, who runs a rice store there, took pity on his loneliness and helplessness, and because of his talent, he took him in. Yu was also quite self-aware and soon became the store's accountant. Unexpectedly, a month later, Cheng fell ill and died, and on his deathbed, he entrusted his wife, son, and daughter to Yu's care. By February of this year, Cheng's wife was also seriously ill. Knowing that she would not recover, she summoned Yu and her biological daughter, Suqing (23 years old), to her bedside and explained that her son was adopted. Therefore, she intended to marry her daughter to Yu. By this time, the two of them were already in love. Soon after, Cheng's wife passed away, and Yu took care of the funeral arrangements, fulfilling his duties well. Cheng's adopted son knew that he was not Cheng's biological son, so the siblings often quarreled. In April, Yu and the daughter were officially engaged. In order to show his goodwill to his older brother, he decided to hand over the operation of the rice store to him. He immediately instructed the daughter to pack all her private savings, five taels of gold jewelry, 1.8 million legal tender, 300 silver dollars, and valuable fur clothes into four large boxes and leave Shangrao for Shanghai. She arrived at the North Station yesterday morning. Who knew that Yu, with his human face and beast's heart, suddenly had a bad idea. He pretended to go to a friend's place at No. 147 on Fourth Malu Road to arrange accommodation, but he carried away the suitcases and never returned. The woman waited until 6:00 PM without seeing him. She hired a rickshaw to inquire at No. 147 on Fourth Malu Road, only to be told that there was no such person. She couldn't help but feel sad and burst into tears. Later, she was accompanied to the Huangpu Sub-bureau to report the incident and request an investigation.

### Xu Longhu Demands Wife to Leave Rickshaw; Gets Angry and Commits Assault

[Report from Our Newspaper] Rickshaw puller Xu Longhu, residing in a shack on Huiwen Road, Zhabei, took a fancy to a young woman, Tang Jinmei (30+ years old), last December and brought two children. They used to live peacefully, but recently, due to the hot weather and sluggish rickshaw business, life became difficult. At about 2:00 AM yesterday, Xu suggested to Tang to unconditionally stop pulling the rickshaw. Tang refused, insisting on a certain amount of subsidy. Xu retorted, and an argument ensued. Then, out of anger, Xu took a fruit knife and stabbed Tang twice in the left face and three times in the throat. Blood flowed profusely, and she collapsed. Seeing the great disaster he had caused, Xu fled without a trace. Later, neighbors heard the cries and arrived, reporting to the North Station Sub-bureau, which dispatched police to rush to the scene. However, the murderer had already disappeared. Tang was then taken to Hongren Hospital for treatment, and it is said that her life is in danger.

### Boiled Water Turns Out to Be a Magical Medicine; Wu Zhihui Gradually Recovers Health

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the news of Mr. Wu Zhihui's indisposition was released a few days ago, many people expressed their concern. Now, people who care about Mr. Wu's health can rest assured because Zhi Lao's fever has subsided and he can sit up and write. The reason for Zhi Lao's illness this time was that he gave a speech at Jiaotong University on a day when the weather was over 100 degrees. Although it was a "scorching sun", Zhi Lao's interest was very high, and he spoke a lot. He went in the morning and didn't return home until four or five in the afternoon. Zhi Lao has always been a vegetarian and once said that his only "nutrition" is to take a nap after lunch every day. That day, because he returned home a little late, he didn't get to take a nap - so he felt dizzy and had some heatstroke symptoms, and his fever also rose.

However, he still insisted on his consistent style, not seeking medical advice, not taking medicine, and not even agreeing to his nephews and nieces' request that he take some pills. During his illness, he only slept a lot and drank some boiled water. One day, his condition was very serious, but "good people are hard to kill," and boiled water turned out to be a magical medicine, and he gradually recovered.

Now Zhi Lao's fever has subsided, but his body still feels weak. He has started sitting up and writing again in the past few days, because he receives a lot of mail, so he often writes seven or eight pieces in a row. Others see that he is mentally exhausted and his wrist strength is not as good as before, and ask him to rest for a few days before writing again, but Zhi Lao still wields his brush with illness - the reason is for livelihood issues!

### Interesting Interlude at U.S. Military Tribunal: Japanese Lawyer Uses Gestures to Instruct Witness, Prosecutor's Accusation Sparks Side Debate

[Our Dispatch] The trial of U.S. pilot Major Holcomb, who was murdered by the Japanese army in Hong Kong, continued yesterday morning, with the defendant, Lieutenant Colonel Kubo, still providing testimony. An interesting interlude occurred in court when Chief Prosecutor Dewey accused Japanese defense attorney M. Kumoshiro of using gestures to instruct the witness, sparking a side debate between the two parties that brought the case to a standstill. The reason for this was that when Dewey was questioning the witness, his standing position conveniently blocked the view between the defense table and the witness stand. After the defense brought this to the court's attention, Dewey declared that his position was intended to prevent Kumoshiro from instructing the witness with nods and hand gestures. Kumoshiro stood up to deny the accusation, claiming that his small movements were due to the inaccuracy of the interpreter's translations, causing him to express agitation, and requested that Dewey's accusation be removed from the record, fearing it might prejudice the defendant during future court reviews. Another defense attorney, Major Bohr, made the same request and asked the court to limit the prosecutor's questions. After deliberation, the judges rejected the defense's request but declared that they would ensure the prosecutor's questions remained relevant to the topic. The trial continued, but with the defense still expressing strong dissatisfaction, Dewey voluntarily moved to a more distant location. In summary, Kubo testified very little yesterday. The prosecutor asked whether the sinking of Holcomb's plane, shot down by anti-aircraft fire and crashed into a sunken ship, would also constitute a crime, but Kubo's answer was evasive and indecisive.

Over ten thousand people attended the solemn ceremony. All agencies, groups, and schools took a day off, and the city flew county flags.

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday was Confucius' Birthday and Teachers' Day. All sectors of the city flew national flags to celebrate and took a day off in commemoration. In addition, various educational organizations, under the leadership of the mayor, held solemn Confucius worship ceremonies and Teachers' Day celebrations at the Confucius Temple in the South City and the City Gymnasium. At exactly 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Mayor Wu Kuo-chen arrived punctually at the Confucius Temple in the South City, proclaiming: "This is the first temple visit after the war. Two years before the war, when I served as Mayor of Hankou, I visited the Confucius Temple once. However, the two occasions are vastly different. Shanghai's Confucius Temple has been ravaged by the war and is in ruins. I fear Hankou cannot be an exception."

At 9:30, the ritual began. Mayor Wu, over his suit, put on a blue robe and black jacket and slowly stepped into the Hall of Great Achievement, standing in the position of the chief officiant. Ancient music filled the hall, played by the National Music Research Association, led by Sun Yude, performing the "Confucius Worship Song." The assistant officiants included Wang Rucang, chief secretary of the Education Bureau; Xu Zexiang, director of the Public Education Center; and Shao Xinshi, director of the Fourth District, standing on both sides. Chen Nian was in charge of ceremony. After Mayor Wu offered incense three times, Zheng Yufeng, director of the Public Education Center, respectfully read the ritual text, which stated: "Great is Confucius! The sage of timeliness. Virtue comparable to heaven and earth, doctrine surpassing ancient and modern times, enduring like mountains and rivers, ever-bright like the sun and moon, traveling among the states, compiling and editing the Six Classics, setting the standard, establishing this model, saving the world and bringing it to governance, ascending to Great Harmony to celebrate peace. Great is Confucius! The teacher of myriad ages, the sacrifices are forever fragrant, with steaming and offerings, may he come and descend, I humbly entreat." After reading, the entire assembly bowed three times to Confucius' spirit tablet. Accompanied by the "March" played by the orphanage band, the entire assembly retreated into the Hall of Great Achievement.

After leaving the Confucius Temple, Mayor Wu rushed to the City Gymnasium on Avenue Albert to preside over the Teachers' Day celebration. Participants included Chen Dongyuan, special inspector of the Ministry of Education; Wang Rucang, chief secretary of the Education Bureau; Zhou Feicheng, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters; Cao Jun, secretary-general of the Youth Corps; and over a thousand representatives from primary and secondary schools. The platform was set up in the center of the gymnasium, with the slogan "Silently remember, learn without satiety, teach without weariness, what is there in this for me?" pasted on the wall. After performing the rituals, Chairman Wu, the Mayor, delivered a speech, roughly stating: "Teachers are the most effective force in the nation-building process. Whether a country is on the right track depends entirely on its teachers. Why is Confucius' birthday designated as Teachers' Day? Because Confucius is the greatest teacher in the world. Confucius' greatness lies in: (1) He has the ideal of reforming society, (2) He has a spirit of uncompromisingness in everything, (3) He upholds the doctrine of the mean throughout his life." Mayor Wu also said: "Teachers must learn Confucius' virtues, lead by example, demand of oneself before demanding of others, and be uncompromising oneself before asking others to be uncompromising. If everyone has this determination, I firmly believe that the Republic of China will be able to get on the right track." Next, Inspector Chen Dongyuan expressed three reflections: "(1) To celebrate Teachers' Day, we must first remember the great teacher Confucius, because Confucius is not only a model for the Chinese people but is also admired by people all over the world, (2) Learn Confucius' spirit of 'knowing that it cannot be done and yet doing it' and 'not knowing that old age is coming,' express ideals, and never give up, (3) Be as full of ideals as Confucius. The greatest merit of a teacher is to influence students with one's own ideals." Inspector Chen also said: "Confucius was born in 551 BC, 2497 years ago, so the year after next will be the 2500th anniversary of Confucius' great birth. When Hu Shih and others were in the United States, they were already preparing a grand commemorative event... at that time, there will be a great celebration. In these three years, we should double our efforts for education." Chief Secretary Wang Ru of the Education Bureau, Zhu Junyang, director of the National Education Department, Xie Enhao, acting director of the Secondary Education Department, and others followed, with many words of encouragement. The meeting adjourned after 12 noon.

### Japan Adopts New Textbooks. New Geography Textbook Also Published

[Kaikosha, Tokyo, 27th] According to an announcement by General MacArthur's headquarters on the 22nd, the new textbooks for Japanese national and secondary schools have been almost entirely completed and have begun printing and distribution for use starting in the new semester in September. Looking at the new geography textbook, the paper is crude, the binding is in the style of a small booklet, there are no maps or illustrations, and the appearance is simple and crude. The content is quite progressive, emphasizing scientific thought and methods, allowing students to understand the relationship between local customs and history when studying geography, while also emphasizing the spirit of peace. The first lesson of the old geography textbook for the fifth grade, "Look at the map of Japan, no matter how you look at it, its shape is always extraordinary," had a strong subjective tone. The new textbook says, "Our country is an island nation in the eastern Pacific Ocean on the Asian continent, made up of large and small islands," which is far more objective than the former. It is said that this new textbook is still of a temporary nature, and the Ministry of Education is continuing to conduct research on fundamental revisions.

### Questions and Answers Regarding Doubts About Household Registration Laws (Continued)

(44) Question: Article 8 of the Household Registration Law stipulates that household registration shall be compiled with one family as one household. Although it is one family, those who live separately shall each be a separate household. However, Article 1122 of the Civil Law stipulates that cohabitation is the main condition for forming a family. If they do not live together, they are not one family. Then 1) how should the "family" in "although it is one family" be interpreted? 2) Does the so-called living separately include separation of property and residence? 3) If it refers specifically to residence, and the residences are far apart and privately owned by the residents, it seems that each can be compiled as a separate household. If the residences are also jointly owned and very close, such as living in two courtyards, should each also be compiled as a separate household?

Answer: Living separately as stated in Article 8 of the Household Registration Law should include separation of property or residence. Before the large family system is completely abolished, there are occasional cases where people live separately without dividing the property, and they are naturally each a separate household.

(45) Question: For the convenience of statistics during the first household registration, can a standard date be stipulated?

Answer: A standard date can be stipulated.

### Eliminating the Black Market for Cotton Yarn: Government and Businesses Work Together, Mills Allocate Yarn on Schedule for Joint Distribution, Ministry of Economic Affairs Discusses Organizing a Coordinating Agency

(Special Telegram) Regarding the black market for yarn and cloth, it is heard that Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is determined to find ways to suppress it. Responsible persons from private yarn mills have expressed their willingness to assist government orders and stabilize prices. According to well-informed sources, the rise in black market prices in recent weeks has caused concern among private yarn mills. Whether their products should be subject to unified distribution by the Textile Construction (纺建) has been discussed by industry insiders for many days. After a meeting convened by the Textile Construction the day before yesterday, the atmosphere became more intense. Yesterday, because of this, meetings were held for a long time, and it was decided to allocate tens of thousands of pieces of yarn on schedule to be combined with the Textile Construction for flat-price, public distribution. A committee has been formed to discuss this. Once this measure is implemented, it will undoubtedly ease the atmosphere in the market. Because in the past, the Textile Construction repeatedly raised prices, always using the market as an excuse to raise prices. There is no obligation for state-run enterprises to allow private enterprises to obtain excessive profits. Cotton yarn and cotton cloth vendors are also reportedly planning to rigorously rectify member businesses to avoid disturbances in the black market. However, in general, the public associations cannot clearly understand the actual situation of the Textile Construction opening its goods, and control is difficult. In addition, some small factories and various itinerant traders must have licensed sales firms to provide intermediary assistance. If the Textile Construction does not open its goods universally and evenly, these small factories and itinerant traders will experience difficulties. According to sources in the cotton product replication industry, if the black market for cotton yarn is not eliminated, various factories will inevitably suspend production. It is also claimed that the recent rise in the black market for cotton yarn has made it impossible for legitimate businesses to obtain goods. In the yarn and cloth market, it is common to sell Textile Construction transaction orders at inflated prices. The person in charge of the industry is extremely worried about this. According to his statement, in the future, if the Textile Construction can invite the public association to the site to contribute opinions when opening goods, this matter can be greatly reduced. Observers with status say that in the future, the production and sales of yarn and cloth may increase the significance of control. The government will never let it go again, in order to destroy its foothold in stabilizing prices. It is also said that the Textile Construction is renting large buildings to expand its business organization.

(Report from our Nanjing office on the 26th) Pan Xulun, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 26th. According to his statement, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to make the market price of yarn and cloth tend to be reasonable, will strengthen the Cotton Textile Control Committee and plans to invite principals of private textile industries to participate. The unified distribution of yarn produced by state-owned and private yarn mills and the price will also be evaluated by the committee. As for the reason why the market price of cotton yarn in Shanghai differs significantly from the black market, it is caused by speculators in the yarn industry raising prices. The ministry is trying to find ways to stop it.

### Coal Allocation to Factories: Fuel Committee Does Not Raise Prices

(Report from this newspaper) Since the change in foreign exchange rates, imported goods such as diesel and gasoline have inevitably risen in price, but the coal market is still relatively stable, thanks to the Fuel Committee's maintenance of the allocated price. The committee has recently allocated a large amount of coal for factory use. Factories, due to the poor quality of the previous allocation, are mostly waiting and watching. However, according to the person in charge of the committee, improvements have been made in this regard. The allocated prices are listed below (unit: ton, delivered at Pudong Wharf): No. 2 Kaishan coal or Keelung coal: 140,000 yuan

No. 1 Kaishan coal: 150,000 yuan

Special Kaishan coal: 175,000 yuan

No. 2 block coal: 170,000 yuan

Train block coal: 180,000 yuan

No. 2 screened block coal: 190,000 yuan

Train screened block coal: 200,000 yuan

### Increasing Overseas Remittances: Progressing on All Fronts

(Report from our Nanjing office on the 26th) One of the main purposes of this exchange rate adjustment is to induce overseas Chinese to remit money back to the country. The authorities concerned are now paying attention to this matter. For overseas Chinese remittances and goods from the Dutch East Indies, new measures will be adopted to benefit overseas Chinese. The restrictions on remittances from overseas Chinese in Malaya are also being planned for alternative methods to increase the amount of remittances.

### Tung Oil Production Prices Soar

Since the exchange rate adjustment, the prices of export native products have risen in response to the situation. The price of tung oil has been affected by the bidding in Shanghai, and the rise is unstoppable. Therefore, the export of tung oil will be difficult due to the daily rising prices in the production areas. Looking at the past week, the price of tung oil in Hankou has risen by 66.4 percent, Hangzhou has risen by 72.38 percent, and the Jin-Qu-Lan area has risen by 76.5 percent. In terms of market prices, there is a severe shortage of spot goods in Hangzhou, and the selling price is 95,000 to 100,000 yuan per shi dan. In the Jinhua, Qu County, and Lanxi areas, the on-site delivery price is 90,000 yuan per shi dan. There is a shortage of goods and chaotic prices, and normal transactions are not taking place.

### High Prices, Weak Substance

Since the foreign exchange adjustment, the prices of all goods have risen. The import cost of wool fabric has indeed increased significantly. Therefore, the asking prices of various stores have risen accordingly. For example, American Melton cloth rose by another 3,000 yuan per yard the day before yesterday. However, looking at the substance, it has a strong exterior but a weak interior: (1) Even before the price increase, business was fundamentally slow. Now that prices have risen again, buyers want to buy but postpone the purchase. (2) More than half of the businesses in Qipan Street are burdened with high-interest loans. Now they are taking advantage of the opportunity to sell their goods and repay their debts. (3) The source of goods is constant, and most of the September and October drafts have already been purchased. People's hearts are still weak. Therefore, based on everyone's moonlight forecast, this price increase is like giving a strong stimulant to a seriously ill person.

### 234 Securities Exchange Brokers Approved

(Report from this newspaper) According to reliable sources, the final number of brokers approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the first batch is 234. The Securities Exchange will arrange positions in the market based on this number. In addition, since the Securities Exchange Preparatory Committee held its 13th preparatory meeting a few days ago, various printed materials, venue equipment, office arrangements, and personnel reviews for internal use by the Securities Exchange have entered the final stages. It is decided that the opening will be on schedule on September 9. It is heard that the general manager of the Securities Exchange will be Wang Zhixin, and the assistant manager will be Guan Shanchang.

### US Loans at Low Prices: Not Necessarily Unfavorable to Us

(Nanjing Telegram) After the price adjustment in the United States, the announcement to correct the pricing of US export goods aims to prevent the sale price of US goods in foreign markets from rising. The price of goods sold by the United States to foreign countries will be based on the domestic limited price, plus a reasonable profit, handling fee, and insurance cost. Business circles believe that this move will make US goods more popular in our country and affect the sales of domestic goods. A reporter visited important personnel of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to inquire about their thoughts on this matter. According to their statement, general consumer goods may become popular because of this, and our country will benefit from the necessary materials being transported. The price of automobiles in Shanghai is significantly higher than in the United States, and the reason is that the profits of importers are too high. The US government restricts the interests of merchants, so the price of cars can be reduced, which will help the development of our transportation. Other necessary materials are expected to be reduced accordingly.

### Rumors of Import Restrictions: Central Government Thoroughly Investigates the Source

(Report from our Nanjing office on the 26th) It is rumored that our country will ban the import of foreign cotton yarn and hardware, and it is said that this news was issued by the China News Agency of the Central Propaganda Department. The reporter visited the director of the International Propaganda Office, Zeng Baibai, about this matter. According to his statement, Nanjing has not issued this news. In order to clarify the facts, he has telegraphed the New York office for inquiries. According to the United Press, the Customs Administration and the Director-General of Customs have denied this.

### France Plans to Order 20,000 Dan of Tea

France recently plans to order 20,000 dan of tea from our country, and the relevant parties are discussing it. After the price agreement is reached, the transaction can be completed.

According to Reuters, Egypt is currently in need of a large amount of tea imports and is reportedly considering exempting import taxes.

### Anhui Tea Center Market

China-US Agricultural Technology Cooperation Tea Group Goes to Su (Jiangsu) to Investigate the Tea Market

The China-US Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group regards Wuhu in Anhui as the distribution center for Anhui tea. It has sent three tea group technicians to inspect the tea market on-site. It is reported that the Anhui Provincial Government originally intended to promote Wuhu into a tea center market. Now that it has received attention from the China-US Agricultural Technology Cooperation, it is even more seeking its rapid completion, so Wuhu, in addition to being a rice and grain center market in the Yangtze River basin, is also the source for Anhui tea.

### Edible Oil Prices Rise Sharply: Social Affairs Bureau Discusses Countermeasures, Warehouse Receipts Limited to Five Days for Pickup, Otherwise Considered Hoarding, Manufacturers Request Adjustment of Allocation Prices to Avoid Bearing Losses Alone

Edible oil prices have recently risen sharply, (26th) rising to 79,000 yuan, almost reaching the 80,000 yuan mark. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is discussing effective countermeasures with relevant parties and oil manufacturers. Emergency measures have been taken to strictly prohibit the sale of edible oil warehouse receipts externally and limit the pickup of goods within five days. Otherwise, it will be considered hoarding, and in addition to invalidating the warehouse receipts, they will also be punished according to law. According to people in the industry, the reason for this price increase is that the price of rapeseed, the raw material for oil production, has risen due to the stimulation of foreign exchange adjustments. When raw materials rise, finished products also rise. Manufacturers ask the Social Affairs Bureau to consider the actual situation and adjust allocation prices to avoid manufacturers bearing losses alone and reduce unreasonable phenomena. The decision is that due to power relations, the current factories cannot produce as ideally. Shunyu, Dayouyu, Dachangxin, Changde, and Dadexin and other five factories, the daily output is less than 500 dan. China Vegetable Oil Factory is also unable to increase production due to power relations. Manufacturers are very hoping that the power problem can be properly resolved. However, the current edible oil reserves in the city are still very abundant. China Food Oil Company alone has more than 11,000 dan of goods in stock, so people in the industry hope that the company can release a large amount at this time.

### Foreign Loans Dominate: Domestic Clocks Cannot Compete, Clock Factories Request Government Assistance

With the influx of foreign goods, all industries are affected. The Chinese clock manufacturing industry has recently issued an emergency appeal. The details are recorded below:

Overview of China's Clock Manufacturing Industry

Before the war, there were four clock manufacturing factories in our country, namely Deshunxing, Yongye, Yongkang, and Dean in Yantai, and four in Shanghai, namely Zhonghua, Changming, Zhonghua Electric Clock, and Shanghai. They could produce and sell more than 170,000 clocks annually. During the Anti-Japanese War, four more factories were established in Shanghai, namely China, Zhongming, Jinsheng, and Far East. They could also produce and sell more than 200,000 clocks annually. This is in terms of actual production and sales figures. If there were no imports, the production figures would be even higher. The market is not only for domestic sales but also for transportation to the South Pacific islands. After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, transportation and sales stagnated, and the finished products have been piling up until now, with no sales market.

Turning Victory into Defeat: Extremely Dangerous

However, the current domestic clock factories are being defeated by foreign goods. The price of a medium-sized American clock is about US$1.50 to US$2.00. Calculated at an exchange rate of 3,350, it is equivalent to 5,020 to 6,700 yuan in national currency. Adding transportation costs and tariffs of 47.7%, it is still only between 7,400 and 9,800 yuan in national currency. However, for domestic manufacturers, the raw material cost alone is more than 15,000 yuan per clock, plus labor costs and factory expenses of more than 15,000 yuan, the total cost of a medium-sized clock is more than 30,000 yuan, which is more than three times the price of an American clock.

All Clock Factories Issue Appeals

All clock factories in this city have recently taken concerted action and requested the China National Industrial Association to immediately telegraph the Executive Yuan and relevant ministries and commissions to request: (1) Revise import tariffs, increase the tax on clocks, or include them in item A, paragraph 1, to restrict the quantity of imports. (2) Reduce or exempt tariffs on clock materials such as clockwork for wooden clocks, enameled wire for electric clocks, and new equipment to encourage imports. The above two points concern the survival of the industry and require the government to implement them immediately.

### "Timely" Clock Company Maintains Original Prices

In order to support national policy, the "Timely" Clock Company announced that all its branches across the country will sell various clocks, watches and parts at the original prices before the 19th.

### Various Industries Declare Profits Tax: Undeclared Businesses Limited to Reporting by September 5, Overdue Businesses Will Have Taxes Assessed and Ordered to Pay Directly by the Bureau

(Report from this newspaper) The Direct Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to the collection of profits tax in this city for the 34th year and has sent a special inspection director to Shanghai to supervise and urge. The tax and business committees of the city's chamber of commerce recently had detailed discussions on issues such as assessment, general investigation, and tax amount. According to the Direct Taxation Bureau, the collection of profits tax must not be delayed any longer, so it is hoped that the tax committee will expedite the sorting of the declared industries, speed up the compilation of statistics, and for those who have not declared, the Direct Taxation Bureau will send personnel to conduct on-site audits to estimate the tax amount and order them to report and pay. The tax amount reported by various industries should be thoroughly audited and accurately reported to meet expectations. The Tax Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that before August of the 34th year, the area was still under occupation. Industries such as food, cloth, and shipping were all subject to enemy and puppet control and could not operate. Business was suspended. After the victory, due to the conversion of puppet currency and the obstruction and lack of transportation and raw materials, various industries had little surplus. Post-disaster commerce is indeed unable to bear the burden, so it is feared that the tax amount will be difficult to reach the expected figures. As for the industries that have not declared, they will be urged to declare as soon as possible. As a result of the discussions between the two sides, the industries that have not declared their profits tax for the 34th year are limited to submitting them to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce before September 5. Those who fail to report within the time limit will have their taxes assessed and ordered to pay directly by the Direct Taxation Bureau in order to start the collection on schedule. The reporter learned that more than 120 units have already declared, and excerpts are listed below:

Sugar industry, sauce and wine industry, auto freight industry, auto parts industry, engraving industry, towel and blanket industry, leather goods industry, banking industry, material bottle industry

### Alas, the Hunan Disaster!

Hunan Province, which suffered the most during the war, has once again suffered natural disasters in peacetime, and the disaster situation is the most tragic. In the counties near Hengyang, people who have starved to death and are awaiting assistance are everywhere. It is deeply hoped that compatriots in other provinces who have not suffered disasters, after seeing these photos, will shed tears of sympathy and do their best to rescue these Hunan compatriots who have contributed to the war of resistance and are now facing adversity.

### On the Banks of the Huai

— Special Dispatch from Huainan by Our Correspondent Shao Shenzhi, dated the 23rd

"Between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, it is where five directions converge, where all goods gather. The advantages of fertile fields and the riches of mountains, rivers, and marshes are unmatched by those far and near." — Gu Zuyu, on the Huainan Road

From Bengbu to western Anhui, one can either travel upstream along the Huai River or take the Shuijiahu-Bengbu branch line of the Huainan Railway. Currently, the Huainan Railway is operating combined water-land transport from Bengbu to Zhengyangguan, making this route the only thoroughfare to the west.

The fertile alluvial plain of the Huai River, known for "nine out of ten years of famine," is unimaginable. However, the current vast expanse of water is a reality. Throughout history, the north and south have contended, turning the areas along the Huai River into a buffer zone, and frequently a battlefield, its survival impacting the gains and losses of the entire country. In an ununified China, this land has been tossed back and forth by warlords. The impression the people have of officials and bandits is indistinguishable. Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty rose from Jiangnan, Huan Wen used the armor of the Jianghuai region, balancing the Central Plains. Zhu Wen and Liu Futong rose up, their voices echoing along the Huai River. Historians use this to argue that the people of the Huai River region are tough and stubborn, but in reality, it is a manifestation of the people seeking a way out for themselves. History is by no means predestined. If China can achieve stability, the Huai River region is where first-rate politicians can display their talents.

Now, taking a train from Bengbu to Shuijiahu, one does not see a single even slightly well-organized village. The entire plain is filled with a complicated mix of crops, lacking the neat rice cultivation of the Taihu Lake region, thus highlighting the fragmentation of the land. Flax, rice, sorghum, millet, sesame, sweet potatoes, soybeans, tobacco, and hemp – these nine crops are commonly found on this land. It is difficult to discern which is the main crop. There is also a small amount of cotton and sunflowers. In reality, tobacco accounts for a large proportion, its green flourishing, and its reddish-white flowers blooming strongly in the autumn wind. Sorghum ears have already turned deep red, some having been harvested, leaving only the stalks, standing or fallen, awaiting dryness. The height of the various crops varies, the shades of green are uneven, and the sorghum is particularly sparse and thin, indicating that the fertilization and cultivation lack the necessary depth. The land is good land, but years of unregulated use have made the soil infertile. What does this tell us? The farmers invest nothing more than simple and weak labor into the land. Now, these uneven shades of green also indicate that these exhausted farmers are still clinging to this place. If they become overgrown with weeds, they will no longer be farmers.

They have always been subjected to man-made forces, and now it is clear that they are even less able to fight against man-made natural disasters. Arriving at Wudian station, the water that has overflowed from Huanggu began to reveal itself. At a bridge east of the station, the bridge pier has been loosened by the water. The train stopped, and a railway police officer came to each carriage to inform the passengers to disembark and walk, allowing the empty carriage to slowly enter Wudian station, then re-boarding the train to continue southwest. However, at Bridge No. 3, located at the 52-kilometer mark, one end of the bridge pier had completely collapsed. It is said that this is the third time, and it may not be repaired within ten days. The train can only connect transportation at both ends of the bridge, unloading passengers and goods, taking nearly two hours. This route originally had two passenger trains per day, but now it has been reduced to one, making the train particularly crowded. There are not enough passenger cars, so high-sided wagons are used instead. Passengers are baked in the hot sun all the way, and their suffering is imaginable. They also have to climb up and down to grab seats, sweating profusely. From Wudian all the way north to Shuijiahu, the land on both sides of the road is a vast expanse of water, leaving only a narrow roadbed. In many places, there is no soil beneath the end of the rail ties, and the water is still eroding below. The speed is only 15 kilometers to ensure safety. Sitting in the car and looking out, one suspects that one is sitting on a boat. Therefore, when the train stopped there for too long, everyone became annoyed, hungry, and thirsty. Almost every carriage was arguing, and the sounds of yelling and cursing were chaotic. The conductor was extremely busy, running back and forth, his brow furrowed. An old woman covered in patches hurried from three or four miles away, across the water, carrying a pot in her hand, explaining that it was cold water. "Look how clear it is!" It could be sold for ten or fifty yuan a bowl. She sold pot after pot, because this was not roadside mud.

After passing Beizha station in Shuijiahu, the speed increased. It takes eight or nine hours to travel more than 80 kilometers from Bengbu to Tianjiagang. The magnitude of the water has dealt a severe blow to this traffic line that has just been repaired.

Bunkers and Mines

A month ago, over two thousand men from Li Xiannian's army broke out of southern Henan, crossed the Huainan Railway between Luoji and Xiatang, and crossed the Jinpu Railway to northern Jiangsu. The situation in central Anhui became very tense. Now it is slightly more stable, but bunkers are everywhere, and the military atmosphere is very strong. From Tianjia'an to the Huainan Mine, within a short 10 kilometers, there are more than 100 concrete and steel-reinforced bunkers, equipped with lighting. Factories and mines are heavily guarded by electric fences, all left behind by the Japanese. The ten thousand employees of the Huainan Railway Bureau have a belief that this strengthens their safety.

Before the war, the Huainan Railway ran from Tianjia'an on the south bank of Huaiyuan to Yuxikou, a distance of 214 kilometers, and included a coal mine at the foot of Jiulonggang Shungeng Mountain. This private enterprise only officially operated for less than two years. It opened to traffic in January of the 25th year and was ordered to be destroyed in October of the 26th year. The entire line fell into enemy hands in June of the 27th year. The Huainan Mine produced more than 2,000 tons of coal per day. Another private enterprise, Datong Coal Mine, produced 2,000 tons per month, relying entirely on this line for transportation and export. By the time it was taken over last year, the railway and mine were in ruins. The 188-kilometer section from Shuijiahu to Yuxikou had been dismantled by the puppet Central China Railway Bureau in the 33rd year, and another Shuibeng branch line, which is now open to traffic, was built to connect Jinpu and transport coal by land.

From a commercial point of view, the Huainan Mine must seek its own export and develop new transportation and sales routes. Only by not relying on other transportation institutions can it be easier to operate. The Japanese believed that there was a shortage of transport ships and that they were easily bombed. Transport by river was no longer necessary, and the Jinpu line was forced to implement a segmented coal supply plan to meet military needs. It was an easy matter to build the short 61 kilometers from Shuijiahu. However, this line had no other use other than transporting coal. Moreover, the area was adjacent to our army's front line at Zhengyangguan, making it a military front. Therefore, the route was chosen hastily, and the construction was extremely crude. After the Japanese surrendered, the Communist army's destructive offensive did not let up. The Japanese military sent personnel to the Datong and Huainan mines to urge coal production. For several years, these two private enterprise units had been integrated. Now it is difficult to separate them. The Japanese military ordered how many tons to be produced, and they had to try their best to mine them. There was a shortage of equipment, especially wood, so mining was not done in the usual way, resulting in a mess. The places where mining was done were full of danger.

Director Wu Jingqing said: "We came to take over a chaotic pile. The Japanese technicians' performance here was a complete mess." There were also those few troops who wanted to find some jewels in the black coal. He told me that the only bathtub in the dormitory was still one that he had found in the field and carried back. "They moved it to feed the horses." Countless stories of lawlessness made one's hair stand on end and caused great astonishment.

On June 1st, the branch line was repaired and finally opened to traffic, transporting the coal out. After half a year of hard work since the takeover, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. But now that the road is broken, the coal can only be piled up. When it is finally transported, it will require an extra labor cost for loading, which will increase the cost considerably. The roadbed from Shuijiahu to Yuxikou still exists and is passable by automobiles. The Anhui Provincial Highway Bureau collects road maintenance fees here, but the name is misleading, as it is actually a kind of automobile traffic tax. The Railway Bureau is repairing bridges and roads, still hoping to restore the rails, but the material is a problem. The Canadian side has a strong interest in investing, but the mode of cooperation has not yet been decided. However, an enterprise surrounded by bunkers is a strong ironic commentary on China's construction.

A Close-Up View of Restoring Train Service

The prospect of the enterprise is entirely dependent on peace and stability.

Director Wu Jingqing studied mechanical engineering in the United States and electrical engineering in Germany. He returned to China with a Siemens engineering qualification and built the famous Qishuyan Power Plant. "Today, it seems like an insignificant power plant." During Minister Zeng Yangfu's time, he was the director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau and the director of the Materials Department of the Ministry of Communications. Now, he has been hired by the Huainan Railway Company's board of directors to serve as the director of the bureau. He is one of the people in charge of the enterprise in this bunker formation. The official acceptance was completed on December 16th of last year. According to statistics, the total loss of the entire line was seven-eighths. They received three dilapidated stations, 30 miles of railway, more than 300 usable and unusable carriages, and 16 locomotives, only three of which could move. Before the war, there were 700 carriages and 56 locomotives. The Shuibeng branch line was built by the enemy and puppets. Although the materials were taken from Huainan, it belongs to the government. The Ministry of Communications said: "The bridge belongs to the bridge, the road belongs to the road. This is the enemy and puppet's property. As for the original Huainan losses, they will be compensated one day." Now the Shuibeng section is leased from the government, with a monthly rent of several million yuan, which is about one-sixth of the total passenger ticket revenue. Under this kind of property relationship, in normal circumstances, the strengthening of this branch line will inevitably be limited. It is good to have smooth traffic, and the lessee will definitely not electrify it on their own. Various objective conditions determine China's stagnation.

The near-term prospect of restoring train service to Tianyu exists, and several billion in capital has already been invested. The locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars that could be repaired have been repaired, and those that have been scrapped are also being repaired. I visited the Huainan Bureau's locomotive factory, which is converting iron gondolas into third-class carriages, adding springs, glass windows, and seats, ventilation, and heat protection. A new car can be produced, which is not easy. It is clear that they are working hard in simple equipment. Currently, the only first-class passenger car running on the road was just an empty shell when it was taken over. After three months of assembly, it was completely applied before the opening of traffic on June 1st. In addition, a 50-meter-long steel bridge beam was built, one of the major engineering projects in bridge and road repair, one of the bitter engineering projects. There are many young workers in this factory, aged fifteen or sixteen. The factory director, Liu Xinmin, is only in his thirties. They all believe that as long as there are track materials, train service can be restored in six months. But they can't afford to buy them, and they can't be allocated. The fate of the state-owned railway is still unknown.

The Railway and Mining Bureaus

This Railway Bureau includes the Railway and Mining Bureaus, which are respectively managed by Deputy Directors Hu Weizhong and Ning Shufan. Datong Mine has been merged into the Huainan Bureau because the Japanese had already connected them. If they didn't merge, they would have had to merge anyway. The Datong and Huainan mines currently produce 1,500 tons of coal per day, supplying 9,000 tons to the Jinpu Railway at 35,000 yuan per ton and 30,000 tons to the Coal and Coke Management Office at 60,000 yuan per ton. This Management Office is like a national trading company, earning a profit when distributing it. Coal for industrial use can be sold for 120,000 yuan, and other allocated coal is even more expensive. "They earned several billion yuan. If this money was in our hands, we could buy goods from abroad with cash and restore train service immediately," Wu Jingqing said with emotion.

The two mines operate in shifts day and night. The winding machine turns non-stop for 24 hours a day, one after another, hoisting coal from the well. The coal seam is inclined at 70 degrees, making mining very labor-intensive. Originally, it was 100 meters deep, but it has been mined so dangerously over the years that it is no longer possible to enter. We had no choice but to dig deeper downwards and mine according to the normal method. One well needs to be dug as deep as 350 meters, and it takes two minutes for the coal car to be hoisted to the bottom. This will take ten months to complete. Datong Mine has better equipment, and its output can reach half of its pre-war output, but by this time next year, it will probably exceed its pre-war output. Both mines are appraising new wells, and it is estimated that they will be able to produce coal in two or three years. At that time, it will gradually reach 5,000 tons.

The bureau has more than 10,000 employees, each receiving three and a half catties of white flour per day. Wages are graded, ranging from 230,000 to 100,000 yuan or so. The bureau said that it cannot make ends meet and loses money every month.

The Japanese built a power plant in Tianjia'an, but unfortunately, it is just an empty house. A 30,000-kilowatt machine had just been shipped to Datong when the Japanese surrendered. It can be seen that the Japanese still wanted to mine more coal here. If all the current generators are turned on, they can produce more than 5,000 kilowatts, but not that much is needed yet.

Restoring train service to Tianyu is a near-term prospect, increasing mine production is a near-term prospect, and there is also power equipment. As long as the machines are installed, some electricity can be used for agricultural reclamation. Although they are all in sight, the development of the enterprise still requires political rationalization, peace and stability, and liberation from the bunkers!

The Flood at Shungeng

Walking two or three kilometers west from Jiulonggang, where the Huainan Railway Bureau is located, you reach Shungeng Mountain.

Historical legend says that Shun once farmed here. Shun is just a figure from the era of historical legends, but this may prove that before the Zhou Dynasty, the Central Plains people had already moved east along the river and developed agriculture in this area, reaching its peak in the Qin and Han dynasties. "Shun" became a general term for this nation and era. Before "Shun," wasn't there the legend of "Yu the Great" controlling the floods? Yu traveled the Nine Provinces (also according to legend), water conservancy flourished, and agriculture followed. This is all explainable. In any case, it is undeniable that this period of history existed. Now, Shungeng Mountain rises up in the middle of a marsh, truly a misfortune of history!

I traveled along the banks of the Huai River and saw the floods causing disasters, with the common people hiding in the trees. At this time, I ran to the foot of Shungeng Mountain, a place named by the Chinese to commemorate historical achievements, and saw many farmers cultivating the fields in the setting sun, rising and falling among the tobacco bushes. Shungeng Mountain meanders east and west, but it is actually just a strip of earth. They seem to have forgotten the glorious ancient times and resigned themselves to a painful fate. They certainly do not have this kind of historical knowledge, as Bacon said, because without knowledge, one loses rights. However, although they do not sigh and commemorate the rule of the Three Dynasties, they draw the most practical knowledge from their real lives. Bacon's theory of knowledge is just utilitarianism.

My conversation with a group of farmers led to a very surprising conclusion. They rely entirely on their hands, without using any tools, and are picking off the flower spikes of the tobacco plants, as well as the small leaves next to the stalks, getting their hands covered in mucus.

"Sir," a middle-aged farmer said to me, "these flowers are useless. Picking them off allows the tobacco oil to go into the leaves, making the leaves thicker and able to bear a share of the harvest. This year's harvest is not good. Look, half of that land has been ruined by the water. Leaves that small are unusable." He used his palm to support a heavy, dark eight-inch-wide leaf, and continued, "It has to be this big to be able to sell for money."

I asked them how many leaves they could harvest per acre and how much money they could sell them for. They said that this year, this field can only yield a little over two loads. In previous years, it would always be a little over three loads. As for how much money they can sell it for, it's hard to say. It has been sold for more than 100,000, but as soon as the new leaves come out, the price has already fallen to 60,000 or so. This year, charcoal is also expensive, and it also takes labor to bake the leaves. It's hard to calculate.

"Sir, you know, now that foreign cigarettes are coming, it's hard for our tobacco leaves to get a good price." Another farmer came out of the leaves, picked up a piece of dry, loose mud from the field, and rubbed it in his palm, because his hands were already covered in mucus from the tobacco. I was stunned to hear him say this in a remote rural area. He was in his late fifties, with a wrinkled face, reddish-black skin, a healthy and strong body, wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat, and a pipe in his mouth, revealing a set of even yellow teeth, making me think of a Californian American. I thought he must be the boss. But he said:

"No, the boss is at home. We're all working for someone else."

There were five of them in total, belonging to two different bosses. Two were locals, and three were from Taixian and Yingshang. The way they said it clearly indicated that they were all hired laborers. One boss cultivated ten acres of land, and the other cultivated only five acres. Even such small landlords have hired laborers. Each of them manages about three acres. They don't all grow tobacco; they also grow a little sorghum and rice. One acre of sorghum yields four loads, and the current market price is 2,500 yuan per dou. They only grow some of it to eat themselves; it is the tobacco that is sold for money.

The boss provides them with food and pays them more than 100,000 yuan a year. This is their entire compensation.

"Is that enough? We're considered to be doing well. Other families only pay 80,000 yuan a year," said the one wearing the wide-brimmed straw hat.

Their one-year employment contract runs from the tenth month of the lunar calendar last year to the tenth month of this year. Last October, they agreed on only 40,000 yuan, but prices soared tenfold in one spring. In the sixth month of the lunar calendar, they told the boss that the money was not enough to use and that they had to increase it. This was increased to more than 100,000, but there was no definite figure. They will not be able to receive the full amount until October. It's not easy being a boss either.

"Want to try our tobacco? It just doesn't have any flavoring, so you might not be used to smoking it," said the middle-aged man.

Naturally, I was very happy to. We all sat down on the edge of the field. He tore off a fresh yellow leaf from the tobacco stalk, rolled the smoked dark ochre-colored tobacco crumbs inside, like a cigar, and put it in my pipe. At first, it felt very mellow, but then it became spicier and spicier, and finally, I couldn't smoke it anymore.

The setting sun sank behind Shungeng Mountain, and it was time to rest. The middle-aged man asked me: "Sir, are you here to buy leaves? Come sit at our boss's place."

I said, "No."

"Then are you from the mine over there? The hardest thing is farming. Being a laborer at your place would be great!"

The Railway Bureau's farmland is really like a plantation, with many hired workers from all over growing crops. They have three and a half catties of flour per day, and their wages are 20,000 yuan per month.

These hired laborers have no land and live by selling their labor. They worry about what will happen when they get old and envy the treatment of the laborers at the Railway Bureau. Our conversation forgot about the setting sun that had already sunk in the west. (Sent from Jiulonggang)

### Manila: City of Jeeps

—航訊 July 26th Air Mail — Central News Agency Reporter Xing Guangzu

The entire city of Manila is like a city of Jeeps. The sheer number of Jeeps is rarely seen in any other city. These brown, motorized reptiles are constantly moving, leaving no second of idleness on the streets of Manila. Many of these Jeeps are still military-grade, while some have been converted for civilian use. The majority are modified into buses, soliciting passengers in all areas. And these "buses" are painted in various bizarre colors and plastered with eye-catching advertisements.

Daily Thefts Number Several Cases

As you stroll or stand on any street, you can hear these profit-seeking motorized reptiles honking their horns, calling out, "Quiapo go, or not?" "Pasay go, or not?" "San Juan go, or not?" If you climb into its shell, you'll see the swarthy, tousle-haired drivers fiddling with the controls. They constantly whistle or hum folk songs, in rhythm with the jolting of the vehicle. Sometimes, with curious glances, they ask in Spanish-accented English: "You Chinese?" "Where you from, Shanghai?" "You come to do business?"

As the car passes a row of shops owned by overseas Chinese, they will tell you: "These are all Chinese stores, they are all very rich!"

Every morning at eight o'clock and afternoon at two o'clock are the busiest and most crowded times in Manila. Six or seven rows of vehicles line up at the crossroads, sometimes unable to move for thirty minutes. When the traffic police issue a whistle, the many motorized bugs waiting for the final sprint rush off with a collective roar, like a group of crazy prisoners released from prison, running straight in one direction. However, at many smaller intersections where there are no police to maintain order, the situation is different. Most of the vehicles squeeze together, trying to find an opportunity to move east, all like unbridled wild horses, entrusting the lives of the entire car to the driver's reason and alertness. Sometimes, when driving to the center and encountering a vehicle coming from the side, they have to brake hard, with a "wa" sound, like an animal shrieking when its tail is burned.

The traffic here often gives people a sense of chaos. There are so many vehicles, but there are very few police officers maintaining traffic at each intersection. Cars compete for space, unable to be controlled, which only causes traffic jams and delays. In addition, the Jeeps converted into small buses do not have fixed stations, and the starting and ending points are uncertain. In particular, they can solicit passengers at any location, sometimes squeezing from dense rows of vehicles to the roadside, leaving the cars behind them at a loss.

Because there are many vehicles, car theft is rampant. Almost every day, several car theft cases occur, but very few are solved. It is said that most of the stolen vehicles are driven to more distant cities to be sold (vehicle licenses are not limited to regions), so it is impossible to investigate. Many car owners, even if they can drive themselves, often hire drivers because someone must be able to guard the vehicle when they are in the office or handling affairs. Otherwise, there is a possibility of theft at any time. At the same time, the construction of car garages is much stronger than that of residences. Even if the car doors and car itself are locked, one must still be careful to be on guard at night. Recently, a ridiculous car theft incident occurred in the city center. A car parked on the side of the road and guarded by a driver was suddenly jumped into by several robbers, who took out guns and forced the driver to drive to the suburbs. When they reached a deserted place, they ordered the driver to get out of the car, then drove away, leaving the driver watching the dust fly, unable to do anything.

Currently, the most thorny problem for this young island nation is how to establish an independent economy, because financial support is thin and the economy is broken, causing many social unrests. The most obvious is theft. Opening the newspaper every day, there is hardly a day without theft. According to police reports: there are an average of thirty cases per day. We know that the most basic task of a government is to maintain social order so that people can live and work in peace. However, Manila, the capital of the Republic of the Philippines, is rampant with thieves.

Kidnappings and Missing Girls

These are daily occurrences, and kidnapping and missing girls are comparable in number to these theft cases. According to a report released by Manila's Juvenile Delinquent Investigation Bureau (Tuvemile Bureau), since January of this year, the bureau has handled over three thousand cases. There were 744 cases in January, 683 cases in February, 784 cases in March, and 649 cases in April. These are the figures submitted to the prosecutor's office for handling; the rest, which were not accepted due to insufficient evidence, are not included. At the same time, flipping through the classified advertisement columns of the daily newspapers, one can always see bizarre advertisements such as "missing," "searching," and "saving for later." The police station receives an average of thirty such missing person cases per week, and most of the missing persons are young girls.

According to police statistics, missing girls account for 80% of the total number of missing person cases, aged between fifteen and twenty, and the time of disappearance is from 8:00 AM to noon, almost several cases every day. In the police station, there are always elderly parents reporting their daughter's disappearance with tears in their eyes: "She is eighteen years old, has a black mole on her upper lip, she was wearing a pink shirt and skirt that day, her hair is not long, but curly and parted on both sides." The police sometimes dismiss it because most of these cases are related to elopement. Many young girls who are just beginning to experience love may be attracted to an American soldier or a classmate, but their families are very stubborn, which can easily lead to elopement. Recently, a university beauty refused a male classmate's love proposal. One day, the classmate took her in a car to the deserted suburbs, claiming that he ran out of gasoline, and had to stay outside all night, finally getting his wish. So, police officers often say to the reporting parents: "Let this little girl stay outside for a few days, and when she comes back, there may be good news!" So, another moving photo of a young woman is added to the search list.

Poverty is the main cause of social unrest, and greed is the cause of the demise of national morality. What is currently pervading the Philippine Islands is this terrible phenomenon of poverty and greed. Therefore, those collaborators who help the wicked, those murderers and robbers, and even gangster bandits, can have the meaning of a legal vocabulary slightly distorted, or even without explanation, and can be released on bail. Such as the postponement of the trial of Laurel, the president of the puppet government, the release of Osias, the pseudo-Minister of Education, with a fine of 50,000 yuan, and many cases that are resolved without announcement, make people suspect the mischief of money. In addition, extortion at checkpoints, the processing of immigration certificates, and the installation of telephones require tips, and opening a restaurant requires bribing bureau officials, which can show all kinds of shortcomings in Philippine civil administration.

Overseas Chinese in Manila City

The total number of overseas Chinese in the Philippines is estimated to be about 130,000 people. In Manila city alone, the number is over 70,000. Overseas Chinese came to the Philippines as early as 539 years before Magellan discovered the Philippines. At that time, China and the Philippines had already established trade relations. Since the Song and Yuan dynasties, up to the Republic of China, countless Chinese people admired the scenery of the Philippine Islands and crossed the sea to come here. For more than a thousand years, the Philippine Islands have been deeply influenced by our culture. Because of the hard work of our overseas Chinese, the Philippines has become a prosperous region in the Pacific. Since 992 BC, China and the Philippines have been intermarrying and have blood relations. Geographically, Manila is 631 nautical miles from Hong Kong, 675 nautical miles from Xiamen, and only 1,163 nautical miles from Shanghai, which is closer than any other major commercial port in the world. China and the Philippines have a long history of relationship, close cultural and blood exchanges, and interconnected geographical borders. It is no wonder that overseas Chinese generally regard the Philippine Islands as their second hometown and call China and the Philippines brothers.

Because of their objective position and their own characteristics, overseas Chinese in the Philippines cannot reform society, nor can they develop industry, so doing business has become an essential element of the lives of overseas Chinese. Although they did not receive legal protection due to the turbulent political situation before the war, overseas Chinese still held the lead in the Philippine business community due to the long history of trade between China and the Philippines. Before the war, the total investment of overseas Chinese in the Philippines accounted for about 80% of the total in the Philippines before 1941. By the time the Pacific War broke out and the Japanese invaders entered the Philippine Islands, due to the impact of the war, the sharp decline in import trade, and the competition from local Filipino merchants, it had fallen to 60%, but it was still able to influence the Philippine economy. Overseas Chinese are mainly engaged in import and export merchants and retailers.

Before the war, the main investments of import and export merchants among overseas Chinese were the trade of tobacco, rice, hemp, copra, timber, and various local products. However, after this war, the local products of the Philippine Islands have all gone bankrupt. During the Japanese occupation, most of the materials were plundered and destroyed. Currently, the Philippine Islands are in extreme panic of materials, and people's lives depend on import trade. Therefore, imported goods are still in short supply. The total investment of large and medium-sized merchants among overseas Chinese in import trade is more than 200 million yuan, which is more than double that before the war in terms of currency. Therefore, we can say that import trade has become the central hub of the business of overseas Chinese after the restoration. The second is retailers, because they require less capital and are easier to operate. A large number of overseas Chinese are engaged in retail, which has become the main component of the commercial society of overseas Chinese. However, because of the excessive number of people, they are often directly oppressed by the Philippines. For example, the retail Filipinization and vegetable market Filipinization bills proposed in the Philippine Congress will have a great impact on the livelihoods of overseas Chinese and have already created an inevitable crisis. It is hoped that our government authorities can work hard to promote Sino-Philippine relations, conclude commercial treaties, and give legal and proper protection to the general overseas Chinese merchants.

At present, there are about twenty schools established by overseas Chinese in Manila city. Among them, there are three secondary schools, with Philippine and Chiang Kai Shek College (Principal is Mr. Bao Shitian) being the most large-scale. Overseas Chinese education is currently encountering many difficulties. Although the Japanese invaders ruled the Philippine Islands for three years, the damage they caused to culture and education was very serious. Most of the original primary and secondary school buildings were burned down, and school equipment, books, instruments, and desks were completely lost. To rebuild, there is no funding. In addition, there are also problems such as a shortage of teachers and excessively low salaries for primary school teachers, which also need to be resolved and improved.

### Answering Readers Medical and Health

(1) Eye Twitching and Headache

Zhang Qingquan asks: My daughter is twenty-five years old and healthy. Four years ago, the upper corner of her right eye suddenly started twitching, but the number of times per day was still small, and the twitching time was also short, but it has not healed for a long time, and the degree of twitching has increased day by day. After an examination by a doctor, it was said that it was caused by the seventh nerve, and two decayed molars had to be extracted. An X-ray examination was performed beforehand, but the result was not effective. Later, injections of Aitamine B1 and oral potassium iodide liquid were also ineffective. Finally, a doctor of internal medicine at the Red Cross Hospital introduced her to the Shanghai Electrotherapy Institute for electrotherapy. After a long time, it seemed to be slightly better at first, but the result was still aggravated, and the duration sometimes continued to twitch for more than half an hour, and she felt very uncomfortable with a headache and small eyes. Please indicate the treatment method.

[Medical Doctor Tang Renjin answers] It is a neurological orbicularis oculi muscle spasm. Treatment methods: It is advisable to take Belladonna preparations and Valerian tincture, etc. It is also necessary to divert her attention. There is probably no hope of a complete recovery, but there is no risk of blindness for her eyesight.

(2) Soft Bones and Weakness

Lu asks: I have several medical questions, please answer: (1) I am seventeen years old this year. I suffered from typhoid fever last autumn and was bedridden for two months.

I asked a Chinese medicine doctor for treatment, applying medicine and taking medicine, but it was not effective. I then asked a Western doctor for diagnosis and treatment, who said that the medicine applied by the Chinese medicine doctor contained mercury, and now the mercury has entered the kidneys, so it has become kidney disease. Eating lightly for several months, I saw improvement. Still unable to walk, can only say simple words, but understands everything she hears. It is also said that it was caused by carelessness during childbirth, and water dripped into the brain, and surgery is required to cure it.

(B) Is this type of disease rickets? Are there any treatments? (C) In addition to surgery, are there any other treatments? (D) Can you recommend a specialist doctor? (E) If I don't see a doctor, will it heal on its own? Is there a direct relationship between being weak, timid, and not being good at speaking? If she can walk later, will this condition disappear? (4) Some people say that tea leaves contain tannic acid, and drinking too much is harmful, while others say that it is beneficial and harmless. Which is right and which is wrong?

[Medical Doctor Tang Renjin answers] (1) It may be caused by nerve paralysis. You can try using diathermy and vitamin B injections. (2) It is feared to be pharyngitis. You can ask an ENT doctor for treatment. It has nothing to do with the lungs. (3) According to the letter, it is feared to be rickets. You can ask a pediatrician for diagnosis and treatment.

(3) Rhinitis and Dizziness

Gao Jie asks: I have rhinitis, and turbid nasal discharge flows out from time to time. At first, I didn't think it was strange, but now it has suddenly turned severe. I often feel a fishy smell overflowing, and my head is dizzy and swollen. Chinese medicine doctors say it is pneumococcal sinusitis, and Western medicine doctors say it is rhinitis or Nasal Catarrh. The names are different, and it is difficult to determine. Please indicate the treatment method.

[Medical Doctor Tang Renjin answers] It is feared to be maxillary sinusitis, which requires surgical treatment by a nasal specialist.

### Eliminating Latent Tuberculosis and Popularizing Examinations

— 本報 readers can get preferential opportunities See today's advertisement for details

According to a survey conducted by British Father Allen on July 18th, the incidence of tuberculosis among students in China has increased sharply to 15% after the war. Recently, the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts held an examination for new students and found that two out of 62 people were ill. At the Hudong Labor Hospital, one in every 20 workers was found to be ill, and most of the patients were young people around the age of 24. Therefore, most of the victims of tuberculosis belong to the most useful people in society. Now the cost of living is rising, day by day, which can be called a serious problem. The symptoms of tuberculosis are initially weight loss, fever, cough, insomnia, night sweats, and sometimes fatigue. At the beginning, it may be hidden or obvious, occurring and healing from time to time, making it unpredictable and most difficult to diagnose. Modern medicine uses X-ray examination, which is the easiest and most accurate. If we want to cope with the environment and solve everything, we must first maintain our health, and X-rays are the most impartial judge of lung health.

In big cities, tuberculosis transmission is the most widespread, affecting the public deeply and greatly. The Hongqiao Sanatorium in this city has always spared no effort in promoting anti-tuberculosis work. Now, in order to popularize prevention, this newspaper today publishes discount coupons for readers to undergo examination, in order to eliminate latent tuberculosis, achieve early treatment, save medicine, and stabilize society. Tuberculosis is the most widespread infectious disease, causing all kinds of poverty and miserable results, countless. I hope that all sectors will promote and implement examinations as much as possible. The more universal the examination, the safer the society will be.

### Tianjin's Pillboxes, July 10 Tianjin Airmail

— Jiegong

Tianjin is the largest commercial port in North China, with seventy-two gullies converging into five major rivers to enter the Bohai Sea, reaching Liaoshen in the east and the old capital in the west, serving as the throat for the northern provinces to enter the sea, and standing as an important town. Since the July 7th Incident, Tianjin was the first to be occupied, and the Japanese invaders used this place as a base for military stations in North China, with warehouses standing and factories scattered. In addition, they built a new port in Tanggu, with a huge project that took three years to complete, which shows the depth of the Japanese invaders' intentions. The various military defense buildings inside and outside the city are also more numerous than in other places. Therefore, before the Japanese surrendered last year, the general residents here thought that if the US military landed in Qinhuangdao or Dagu Port in North China, the Japanese invaders would definitely defend Tianjin to the death, and the place would be devastated, which was unimaginable, so everyone was in danger.

Tianjin's Suburban Security is Becoming Increasingly Serious

Last year on August 15th, the Japanese invaders surrendered, and the Allied and National Armies successively stationed in the city. The prosperity of the city suddenly returned to its former appearance before the incident, and all military defense buildings were gradually dismantled. Since the government opened up foreign exchange, the market has become more prosperous. The general public thought that they could live and work in peace from now on, and the people from all over the country who were traveling in Tianjin could return to their hometowns one after another. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party launched a destructive strategy in various parts of North China this spring. At first, they demolished railways and bombed bridges, and then they attacked cities and seized land, burning, killing, and plundering. In a few months, the flames of war spread everywhere and spread to Central China. After the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, from Shandong Dezhou, fell, the Communist army actively advanced north, and Cangxian, Qingxian, and Machang were besieged several times, but were repelled. There are even more Communist troops lurking on both sides of the section of the Beining Railway between Beiping and Tangshan. Communist troops also appear in various parts of Tianjin's suburbs from time to time, so Tianjin's security is becoming increasingly serious. The recent situation in various aspects is recorded on the left:

The 94th Army is Concentrated and Stationed

Since peace, the local security of Tianjin has been the responsibility of the 94th Army of the National Army. Recently, due to the tight local defense, the 94th Army has sent workers to build ambush pillboxes and pillboxes at various important intersections and bridges in the city, especially the ambush pillboxes at the old concession intersections. The pillboxes are two or three stories high, forming a battlefield. The general public cannot help but be alarmed, and prices are also fluctuating and rising as a result.

The Blockade of Tianjin Causes Suffering for Peddlers

According to general peddlers who enter the city from the surrounding villages, the Communist army has adopted its consistent economic blockade policy against Tianjin. Various peddlers, if they are unfortunate enough to meet them, will have their goods and legal currency confiscated. If they argue, some are even stabbed to death on the spot, so currently, vegetables and fruits are feeling a shortage of sources, and prices are rising as a result.

The People's Self-Defense Force is Strengthening

Due to the situation, the local authorities here have begun citizen training in all ten districts of the city in order to strengthen the people's self-defense force. The organization adopts a one-three system, that is, one brigade is divided into three companies, each company is divided into three platoons, and each platoon is divided into three squads, with fifteen people in each squad. The brigade commander is the head of each police branch, and the company commander is the head of each police station or the group leader of the branch. Since it started last month, the results have been good.

Merchants and People Raise Funds to Comfort the National Army

Because the 94th Army has been stationed here to maintain the local area and rely on it for peace, and now when the defense is tight, and it is also during the summer holidays, the garrison is very hard, the various circles here have initiated a joint federation of various industries and local groups in various districts to raise 30 million yuan in donations and send them to the headquarters of the 94th Army to show their condolences.

US Troops Jointly Deploy at Night

In addition to the 94th Army being responsible for maintaining the security of Tianjin, the US troops stationed in Tianjin have repeatedly been infringed upon by the Communist army in various places recently. Therefore, after 10:00 pm every night, the US military headquarters sends armed soldiers to set up sentry posts at various important intersections in the suburbs of Tianjin, and adds tanks to defend important areas. They only withdraw after 5:00 am every morning. Pedestrians are prohibited from traveling after 12:00 every night, and the garrison area in Hebei is prohibited from traffic after 10:00 pm and will be lifted at 5:00 am the next morning.

### A Literary Giant: H.G. Wells, A Most Inspiring Figure

— Mo Qu

H.G. Wells, the renowned British writer of science, politics, history, novels, and other works, has produced an immense body of work, including over twenty novels, nineteen works of fantasy, four massive collections of short stories, twelve books of essays on social, religious, and political issues, and numerous smaller pamphlets. His works are popular worldwide (with several translations in China as well) and have had a significant impact on intellectual circles. A great many men and women in Europe, America, and beyond have increased their knowledge through reading his works, and even social customs have changed to some extent due to his ideals. In British literature, he is comparable to Kipling and Bernard Shaw. He passed away on the 13th of this month at his home in London, at the age of seventy-nine. This is a loss for the world, especially the British literary world, which has lost one of its most attention-grabbing and inspiring figures. "The World's Great Men" edited by the British Hamerton contains a brief biography of him, and this biography is based on its key points, supplemented by recent newspaper reports about Wells.

Humble Origins

Herbert George Wells was born on September 21, 1866, in Bromley, Kent, of humble origins. His father was a professional cricketer who ran a grocery store in the town, and his mother was the daughter of an innkeeper. The couple never experienced joyful enjoyment during their lives. After the grocery store failed and closed, his mother was forced to work as a servant in a wealthy household. Due to the family's poverty, Wells left school at the age of thirteen and became an assistant to a chemist. Soon after, he switched to working in a clothing store. This was entirely against his will, so he studied hard in his spare time. As a result, in 1882, he obtained a position as an assistant teacher at Midhurst Grammar School. Later, through hard work, he obtained a scholarship and entered the University of London. In 1884, he graduated with honors from the Department of Zoology.

For the next few years, he worked as a teaching assistant and lecturer in biology at the university, but his interest in writing grew stronger. In 1893, encouraged by Henley [British writer], he resolutely entered the newspaper industry and began his writing career. Two years later, his first book, "Select Conversations with an Uncle," was published.

From that time on, Wells's life can be described as a full and rich development of his intellectual powers, which were revealed in his publications. The famous French writer Anatole France admired him greatly, calling him "the greatest intellectual force in the English-speaking world." His first successful novel, "The Time Machine" (published in 1895), showed him to be a man with scientific ideas and keen imagination. However, as an enthusiastic young socialist, he felt a sense of disgust for the world at that time, which can be clearly seen in his depiction of the bleak situation of the Morlocks and Eloi in the distant future.

Astonishment of Friends and Foes

Wells tells us in his autobiography that he was drawn to socialism by Plato and Henry George [American economist]. When he was studying in South Kensington, he paid close attention to the activities of the Fabian Society, but his impatience grew. Therefore, in a short period of time, he disagreed with the orthodox revolutionary doctrines, feeling that Marx was like a nightmare in the world of socialism because he denied the adaptability of intelligence in a didactic tone, which Wells regarded as his most precious treasure. Therefore, in the early stages of his career, he decided to take an independent revolutionary approach, an independence he maintained into old age. His intellectual vitality drove him to repeatedly improve his position. Like a kaleidoscope, he often changed his opinions.

Wells's changeable nature astonished both friends and foes, but behind this nature lay a vast, unchanging philosophy. Wells was a man with a clear mission and inspiration. He pursued the former with the force and fervor of a Crusader and propagated the latter. He did not rely on momentary emotional impulses but sincerely believed in the ultimate rationality of mankind, so he himself often respected reason. He expressed his hatred and love with ardent enthusiasm, but everything ultimately led to reason. This attitude may have been the greatest mistake of his life. He could not tolerate the stupidity that was particularly evident in the daily lives of human beings, and he despised it, which made him greatly ignorant of the naive reality of mankind.

Literary Concept

Therefore, Wells's literary career began with a focus on propaganda and continued without end. If he had wanted to, he could have become the most illustrious and greatest novelist of his time, but the theory of "art for art's sake" was a curse in his mind. He once replied to Henry James (British-American novelist) with a surprising protest: "Literature is an end in itself for you, like painting; for me, literature is a means, like architecture, and it is useful."

From this literary concept came several novels that are among the most outstanding achievements of modern literature. Following "The Time Machine," he wrote several works of fantasy and science fiction, such as "The Invisible Man" (published in 1897, adapted into a popular film in 1934). "The War of the Worlds," "The First Men in the Moon" (published in 1901), "The Food of the Gods" (published in 1904), "The War in the Air" (published in 1908, predicting the situation of the Great War), and "The World Set Free" (published in 1914). Each of these is characterized by speculating on the possibilities of scientific development, narrated in a vivid style, and full of pungent satire. His massive works "The Stolen Bacillus" (published in 1895) and "The Plattner Story" (published in 1897) reveal him to be a writer with a humorous genius and skilled in short stories. His "Love and Mr. Lewisham" (published in 1900) and "Kipps" (published in 1905) are considered by many to be literary masterpieces. After the publication of "Ann Veronica" (1909) and "The History of Mr. Polly" (1910), his reputation was consolidated, and he became a great novelist and a profound critic of contemporary social life. He also revealed his thoughts in the two books "Anticipations" (1901) and "First and Last Things" (1908). (According to recent newspaper reports, he also has three books: "Tono-Bungay," "The Country of the Blind," and "The Man Who Could Work Miracles," all of which are carefully crafted and belong to the category of novels.)

War Writings

Wells's writings on war include "The War That Will End War" (1914), "The Peace of the World," "Bealby" (a wonderful fantasy), "The Research Magnificent" (all three published in 1915), "Mr. Britling Sees It Through" (published in 1916, a moving account of the spirit of a country during wartime), "The Soul of a Bishop" (1917), "In the Fourth Year" (published in 1918, a critique of the League of Nations), and "Joan and Peter" (1918). The conclusions he made and what he intended readers to get from these writings were often different, but he had the courage to admit his mistakes. In the decade after the end of the European War, he felt that the world had the opportunity to get rid of disaster. Although he was temporarily encouraged and excited, embracing new ideals and new hopes for transforming the world, and was recognized as a leader of intellectual movements, he soon relapsed into old ways and gradually abandoned their new efforts, feeling great pain in his heart. He also foresaw that the League of Nations would only discuss and not have the real power to act, not only failing to achieve peace but also risking the intensification of nationalism. Therefore, the ideals he had in the past gradually disappeared in his writings. However, in the first few years, he still held a compassionate heart and did his best to express the ability of idealism in the two books "The Salvaging of Civilization" (1921) and "Men Like Gods," which were considered by many admirers to be the most lovely dreams of the paradise that mankind could imagine. His subsequent writings, however, returned to the severe reprimands he had made to society in his early years, such as "The Dream" (1924), "Christina Alberta's Father" (1925), "Democracy Under Revision" (1927), "The Sorbonne Lectures," "Meanwhile" (1927), "Mr. Blettsworthy on Rampole Island," "The Way the World is Going" (1928), "The Autocracy of Mr. Parham" (1930), "After Democracy" (1932), and "The Bulpington of Blup" (1933). These all prove that although this enthusiastic reformer and idealist did not lose his true colors as Wells in general, his faith in humanity had been shaken. But his genius was not damaged by this, and his perseverance was not weakened by it. He had an early ambition to write about the great history of mankind. He was not afraid of the difficulty of the task and finally completed his plan with a trilogy after the war. The first part is a broad narrative of the actions of people in the past, which is "The Outline of History" (published in 1920, this book sold 1.5 million copies, making Wells rich). Followed by "The Science of Life" (published in 1929, this book was co-authored with G.P. Wells and Julian Huxley), which details the evolution of life; the final great achievement is "The Work, Wealth & Happiness of Mankind" (1932), which is an outline of social science.

Wells's philosophy, first seen in the book "Anticipations," after years of changes, is again in "The World of William Clissold" (published in 1926, three volumes). "The Open Conspiracy" (published in 1928, Wells called this the blueprint for world revolution, dedicated to the future of transforming the world). And his autobiography "Experiment in Autobiography" (published in 1934, although it is an autobiography, it is not specifically about himself, Wells called this an autobiography experiment - the discovery and conclusions of an ordinary person's brain after 1866.) make a more thorough exposure.

Lightning Intelligence

The reason why Wells was admired by his contemporaries was entirely due to his exciting and attention-grabbing thoughts. Few writers could write about so many issues like him, and even fewer could stir readers like him. He also had a nearly unmatched ability to make people feel that what he said was not only worth saying but should be said. Although he lacked true doubt about things, his ability to criticize was surprisingly great. She can also use lightning-like intelligence to illuminate the darkest things. He is rich in judgment, does not overstate any element, and does not underestimate its value. He uses a great and bold style to move people's hearts, or to make them expect, or to make them fear, or to make them rise up, or to make them be discouraged. He uses the ability of a great craftsman to make them fit the universe. He let many people in the world know that he hated their stupidity, and at the same time, he could convey his love for the world. This is probably Wells's greatest success.

Wells was an internationalist. He felt that the trivial disputes that occurred in the superficial countries in terms of economics and politics were the main reason for the desolation in the ancient world and might ruin the world's civilization in the future. He devoted his life to the creation of the World Federation and advocated that countries should sacrifice a part of their sovereignty, but he did not agree with the use of the theory of democratic politics to achieve this goal. His socialism is scientific and biological, not economic and political. His political thought has been consistent from the beginning. He firmly believes that the reforms he wants should be led and implemented by an enlightened minority, and its success can easily come from the intelligence of the masses or the sound planning of the masses. Therefore, he believes in the heads of great business organizations and scientists and technicians. He feels that these people contain the cells of the world revolution he advocates. They only need to follow the procedure, do their conscience, and use everything they have already grasped to obtain power. The Wells Society (H.G. Wells Society) established in 1929 was established based on this basis. He believes that all nations in the world must unite and cooperate in order to ensure human safety in the scientific age.

Unlike many fantasy writers, Wells is equally active in social and spiritual life. In 1934, he went to the United States to meet with President Roosevelt, and then went to Moscow to meet with Marshal Stalin. He was disappointed to see that Russia's socialism had turned into a dictatorship. The outbreak of this world war shattered his beautiful dreams of world peace and progress, and his mood deteriorated day by day. He saw that the power of science was not given to visionary people to increase human wisdom, but was held in the hands of powerful people to make destructive weapons such as atomic bombs. This was already predicted in his book "The World Set Free" published in 1914, and it unexpectedly became a reality. Therefore, he wrote "Mind at the End of Its Tether" last year, writing off many of the optimism he had previously held, and declaring the doom of mankind when mankind needed hope and courage. This is the most depressing of all his writings.

In short, the scope of his vision, the extent of his erudition, his intelligence, infinite flexibility, his diligence, tireless, his arguments, incisive, Wells relied on these to create his greatness. Few people can maintain their innovation tendency and their common sense in their old age, and even fewer can always embrace "humanitarianism" like Wells.

A Glimpse of Praise

Wells has been praised by many celebrities during his lifetime. Now I will record several kinds as follows:

Brown: "Wells thinks extremely fast, so he often cannot stand still to consolidate the position he has won. Therefore, although his socialism continues to promote and often shines brightly, it is also often disconnected."

Brooks: "Wells is an intellectual, not an artist. This means that he naturally grasps and explains life in terms of ideals, not in terms of experience."

McCarthy: "Wells has freed young men and women in narrow environments from the terrible shackles of inherited old etiquette and replaced them with greater wishes and another kind of respect. His efforts are greater than anyone else."

Shaw's comments after Wells's death are of course even more accurate. He said: "Wells is not a gentleman. He cannot and does not want to have this status. He is the son of a gardener and a doorkeeper, so there is no class. His behavior is never like a gentleman, or a shop assistant, or a school teacher, but he has spent these lives. He is unique and never imitates others. How admirable he is! He is mild-mannered. Although he glared at all of us, none of us resented him. I remember about fifty years ago, Wells and I had a dispute over the policies implemented by the left-wing Fabian Society. I easily made him completely defeated, but the members of the society, although not giving him a vote, blamed me for not being so reckless and expressed their sympathy to him. If he had always been a very alert and self-controlled person, he would not be as loved and respected as he is today."

### A Visit to Ai Sha, Member of the Xinjiang Provincial Committee, on the Prohibition of Marriage Between Hui and Han

— Lanzhou Airmail Dispatch, 16th, Zhang Shihao

In this unstable situation, who is not concerned about the problem of Xinjiang, especially in Gansu, which is related to it like lips and teeth, in people's minds. The day before yesterday evening, at the fourth Municipal Joint Friendship Meeting of all circles in Lanzhou, hosted by the Gansu Branch of the Youth League in the Anti-Japanese Construction Hall in this city, the reporter discovered eight or nine burly men in the official seats, wearing flat-topped, eight-cornered embroidered caps. The leading general was an old friend whom I hadn't seen for almost a year—Mr. Ai Sha. This joy was truly extraordinary.

### Entering the Central Government and Contributing Greatly

Although Mr. Ai Sha is a genuine compatriot, he speaks very fluent Mandarin. During the War of Resistance, he and Mr. Maswood always entered the central government and were stationed in Chongqing, acting as a bridge between Xinjiang and the central government, running around for the Hui people, and serving the country. His achievements are well-known and worthy of our admiration and praise.

Accompanying Mr. Ai Sha, in addition to his son, were five representatives of the Xinjiang Youth League and two gentlemen who were investigating education and drama. The group of nine flew to Lanzhou the day before yesterday and will attend the second National Congress of the Youth League in Lushan. They had just gotten off the plane and rested in the Northwest Building before rushing to participate in the friendship evening, as honored guests of the meeting. Chief Secretary Song delivered a special welcome speech to introduce them to the guests, and Secretary Kou personally came forward to serve as the host. The guests were enjoying the art, and the reporter did not want to disturb them too much. After a brief greeting, they agreed to have a pleasant chat at the Northwest Building at eight o'clock the next morning.

### Abuse of Power and Forced Marriage

The time to visit Mr. Ai Sha arrived. Ai Sha had just gotten up and was washing his face, so the reporter chatted with Little Ai Sha. He is not yet fifteen years old and has been studying in Chongqing all along. He came home to play for a few days this time and is now going back to school. He is very innocent, just like Ai Sha. Mr. Ai Sha came in less than five minutes, and the reporter began to talk to this talkative veteran. The reporter first inquired about the inside story of the recent shocking event at home and abroad of prohibiting marriage between Hui and Han. He told the reporter very frankly that the marriage problem between Hui and Han was not very serious, but in recent years, the situation has deteriorated day by day. New military, civilians, and officials from the mainland mostly used their power to oppress Xinjiang women and force them to marry, which aroused the resentment of the Xinjiang people. No matter what, the people of Xinjiang would rather die than have their sisters marry mainlanders. The problem was so serious that the people of the whole province resolutely asked the central government to prohibit marriage between Hui and Han. A few days ago, they automatically launched a universal movement. All Xinjiang women who had married mainlanders since the 32nd year of the Republic of China were dragged out of the mainlanders' homes and locked in mosques to await religious disposal.

### Enterprise Company Hoarding Agency

Secondly, talking about the dissolution of the Xinjiang Enterprise Company, he believed that the Enterprise Company was completely an organization that hoarded goods, monopolized the market, and destroyed private business. Therefore, the people of Xinjiang unanimously opposed its existence.

As for the Yining Incident, fortunately, Chairman Zhang's far-sighted policy resolved it, and the order and security of various places have now returned to normal, but the people's lives are much more difficult than during the War of Resistance. Prices are soaring step by step, which is terrifying. Private businesses are mostly on the verge of bankruptcy. This has almost become a common phenomenon in the country, but Xinjiang is even more serious. Speaking of military discipline, he believes that it is really necessary to strengthen it.

Mr. Ai Sha stood up excitedly when he talked about the wishes of the people of Xinjiang. He believes that what the people of the mainland need, the people of Xinjiang also need; what the people of the United States need, the people of Xinjiang also need. The people of Xinjiang are willing to live in a new Xinjiang; to be honest, they do not hope that the Xinjiang of Sheng Shicai's era will reappear. Xinjiang needs scientific construction projects, universal education, a stable life for the people, a army that protects the country and defends the people, officials who love the people like their own children, and good people from the mainland who are as close as flesh and blood. Under such circumstances, he dares to guarantee that the people of Xinjiang are willing to join the embrace of the motherland.

### Striving for Construction Instead of Propaganda

As for Chairman Zhang Zhizhong, the people of Xinjiang have a very good impression of him, and at the same time, they place endless hope on him as if he were a savior. Although their ideal demands have not yet been realized, they also know that Chairman Zhang has not been in charge for a long time, and whether his cadres can cooperate with his work cannot be fully confirmed, but no matter what, Chairman Zhang is a good chairman and a true representative of Chairman Chiang. The people of Xinjiang always believe that Chairman Zhang will be able to do well and realize their wishes. Finally, Mr. Ai Sha talked about the independence of Outer Mongolia and the strong neighbors surrounding it. The border issues should be closely watched. The government should not only pay attention to the tangible national defense construction but also strengthen the construction of intangible national defense, replacing propaganda with construction. Xinjiang's natural conditions are very sufficient. No matter what, all construction projects must be accelerated, otherwise, the centripetal force of the people of Xinjiang may have problems in the future.

The talking time was long, and Mr. Ai Sha wanted to have an early meal, so the reporter took this opportunity to say goodbye.

### Miscellaneous Notes from Taiwan Province

— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun, Taipei Air Dispatch, 15th

There used to be 200,000 Japanese in Taiwan. More than 100,000 of them have been repatriated to their country, and some technical personnel are staying here, preparing to be repatriated in four batches before December. After these people leave, the number of mainlanders who come to replace them will be at most 30,000. Normally, there shouldn't be a housing panic. However, in reality, most of the people from the mainland cannot find housing, and Taiwan is also experiencing a housing shortage. This seems like a joke, but it is a fact. Chief Chen explained that the inconvenience of housing gives them a bad impression. He said, "Instead of sending people to other provinces to promote Taiwan, it is better to make things easier for visitors, so they can become voluntary promoters when they return!" Solving the housing problem for mainlanders is indeed a problem.

Ammonium Sulfate Like Pepper

The rice and sugarcane in this province both need fertilizer. The Japanese call it "sulfate of ammonia," also known as ammonium sulfate, especially for rice. There is a very strong habit of fertilizing rice and sugarcane with ammonium sulfate. The Relief Administration transported 3,000 tons from Canada. According to Director Qian, if this were to be supplied to the entire province, it would be like sprinkling pepper. After the experts decided, this time it will be sold at a low price of eight yuan per pound to farmers in areas south of Chiayi, with a standard of 125 pounds (56 kilograms) per hectare, which can be distributed to 44,534.2 hectares, potentially increasing rice production by 20,000 tons. However, Director Qian said: when it will come again and how much will come are both problems. The Japanese colonial economic policy was to supply Taiwan with ammonium sulfate, but the factories were in Kumamoto and Osaka. Taiwan does not have any. According to his report, it is impossible to consider distributing it to sugarcane farmers in addition to rice.

According to agricultural experts, due to the lack of fertilizer, the first crop of this year's food production in this province has decreased to one-third to two-fifths of the normal yield. In the past, the annual rice yield was about 200 "ying hu" per hectare, and wheat was 75 "ying hu." Now, at most, it can only harvest 66 "ying hu" of rice and 50 "ying hu" of wheat. A clear example is that rice stalks used to be three feet five inches long, but now they are shortened to two feet five inches, and eight-inch rice panicles have shrunk to five inches.

Using Cars to Go to School

Chief Chen said: Using public cars to send children to school is not love but rather a way to spoil children. Therefore, the police bureau began to crack down on officials using cars to pick up and drop off children at school.

Because Beitou, a hot spring area, is a good place to go, it is common to use office cars to take wives and children to play. The chief said this needs to be done carefully because Japanese officials were frowned upon for doing so in the past.

The Situation of the Taiwan Medical Association

The Taiwan Medical Association, which has a history of 46 years, held a general meeting last month and decided to reorganize into a group of private medical and pharmaceutical workers. It will be the province's leading medical research institution, recruiting more than 300 of the province's most outstanding doctors and medical professionals. It was decided to hold a regular meeting once a month and a general meeting once a year to give academic lectures and report on research results. The association has 25 directors, and Dr. Du Tingming was publicly elected as the chairman. According to Dr. Du, the association is the only national organization in the country that studies tropical medicine and publishes a magazine with a total of 44 volumes. Recently, in addition to continuing publication, it also hosted a plague research conference on the 20th of this month, with Dr. Horiuchi and Dr. Maruyama lecturing on immune pathology, Professor Morishita lecturing on wind seeds, and Professor Aoki lecturing on rat tales, etc. The association hopes that domestic medical experts will exchange research and discuss with each other. The address of the association is located in the College of Medicine of National Taiwan University.

Wishing to Reward Those with Integrity and Loyalty

Editor: Victory has been a year now! In this past year, some traitors have been punished, but some are still at large. This is partly because most Chinese people hold the traditional view of "sweeping the snow in front of one's own door"; on the other hand, because prosecuting traitors requires evidence, no one wants to bother if it doesn't concern them.

As for rewarding integrity, I haven't heard of it until now. I am now proposing that "punishing traitors" and "rewarding integrity" are two sides of the same coin. It is also an urgent matter to correct the decadent atmosphere. Therefore, I offer my humble opinion, hoping to attract the attention of the public opinion and the society's worthy people and the authorities.

I believe that traitors, regardless of their size, should be handed over to the judiciary. Law enforcers should weigh the facts and make a judgment. A murderer should be put to death! Those who trample on human rights or extort and make a fortune during national crises should have all their property confiscated in addition to being sentenced. The confiscated illegal property should be used to compensate the victims' losses, and the remainder should be used for national economic recovery or relief funds; at the same time, a portion should be provided to help impoverished people with integrity and loyalty or their surviving families.

I believe that people with integrity and loyalty are the essence of cosmic righteousness and the soul of the nation. Leaders advocated integrity before the War of Resistance. I hope that the government authorities will implement the rewarding of integrity at the same time as punishing traitors. A special investigation committee should be organized to investigate on the one hand and order governments at all levels and people in society to recommend or self-recommend on the other hand. Those who are confirmed to have integrity and loyalty should be comforted by high officials and given honorary awards, so that they will be honored in life and mourned in death, and their surviving families will be taken care of. This may be the legacy of King Yan's buying of horse bones and building a platform to attract Guo Wei!

Originally, a person should be good, and should not be bad. Goodness should not be rewarded; badness should be punished. However, in this present society where ethics are lax and morality is lost, there are fewer righteous people with integrity and loyalty. In order to promote inherent morality, it should be greatly emphasized. (Liu Tong)

Appealing for Overseas Chinese from Fujian Province

Editor: The Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Office began registering and applying for passports in early February, and it has been more than six months, but the repatriation has not yet begun. During the outbreak of the Pacific War, we were unwilling to be obedient citizens of the enemy, so we abandoned our property and escaped from under the enemy's iron hoof. Along the way, we were grateful for the government's relief and were able to arrive safely in our hometown. Currently, the cost of living in Fujian Province is high, and it is difficult to make a living. In five years, our capital has been exhausted, and our lives are extremely difficult. We don't know where we can settle down? With sincere opinions, we appeal to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Overseas Department and the responsible officials of various institutions such as the Executive Yuan's Relief Administration to quickly send ships for free repatriation, so that tens of thousands of overseas Chinese can return to their original places of residence to revitalize their old businesses. If we don't urgently find a way to send ships for repatriation, what prospects can we imagine! (Respectfully submitted by Ye Guoquan)

Measures for Handling Damaged Small Denomination Notes

Approved on August 15th, General Reading No. 175 letter, in accordance with your newspaper reader Mr. Yu Kexin's letter, which has something to say about the recovery of damaged small denomination notes. A copy of the original letter is attached for your reference. We have already understood and are deeply grateful. The explanation is as follows: (1) Small denomination notes in various places have already been collected as much as possible. After being exchanged, they will no longer be issued. (2) Damaged banknotes, in addition to entrusting provincial banks in various places to exchange them, we have also signed a contract with the Postal Remittance Bureau to entrust postal bureaus across the country to exchange them. Corresponding reply, please check and understand. Sincerely, The Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank

The Fragrance of Bread Fills the Air, Endangering the Lives of Lodgers

We are a group of lodgers living upstairs in the second section of buildings above the Qishilin Bakery near the Racecourse. Within this small space, more than 20 people live, and in this hot weather, we already have the feeling of "not being able to breathe."

Who knew that the Qishilin Bakery downstairs only cares about making money and doesn't care about the lives of others? They have set up industrial stoves downstairs to make bread and produce various kinds of pasta. The stoves are burning all day long, and the room is filled with coal ash! Conversely, the lives of a group of people living upstairs are in a furnace in hot weather that is already around 100 degrees, like a group of dying lives.

We have a sense of doubt. If the stove fire is accidentally negligent, these 20 or so people will be sacrificed for them. We are also worried about one thing, that is, fortunately, there is no fire, so as to avoid heatstroke or illness.

This is a cry for the attention of the fire department. If we can get safety, we will be sincerely grateful. (Er Liang)

Why is There a Horse Trap Pit Here?

Editor: At about 8 o'clock at night, I finished visiting a friend at Fuyou Road, Danfeng Road, South City, and planned to return north via Minguo Road. Unexpectedly, when I was about to reach the eastern section of Fuyou Road, my feet suddenly stepped into the air and fell into a large hole in the road, which was half a body deep. I really fell in a strange way! With broken skin and blood flowing, I supported myself and endured the pain, and especially drafted this article to ask: (1) Since there is such a large deep pit in the road, why didn't the shops and residents on both sides report to the competent authorities? Even if not for the sake of passing pedestrians, shouldn't they be for their own safety? (2) Such a large deep pit, haven't the police officers who maintain law and order seen it? (3) The authorities directly responsible for road administration, if they are carrying out construction for building ditches, why not block it with wooden frames to warn of the danger? Of course, red lights should be lit in the evening, but now none of them have been seen. I can't help but wonder, "What is the purpose of digging this horse trap pit in the road!" (Fang Chunlei)

### If World War III Occurs, North America Will Become the Battlefield. Canadian General Discusses the Importance of U.S.-Canada Joint Defense

— Translated by Chun from Saturday Evening Post

In this atomic age, defending North America requires establishing completely new concepts and skills for national defense.

Whose business is this?

It is not the sole business of Canada or the United States. Defending North America requires not only coordinating the national defense policies of the U.S. and Canada, but also a complete coordination of the two countries' military forces, weapons, supplies, deployments, and so on.

The existing U.S.-Canada joint defense relationship was created in 1939, when both sides agreed to provide mutual assistance in times of emergency. Under this principle, a permanent joint defense council was created. However, its task is entirely consultative in nature, without any defensive power. If such a joint defense mechanism continues, it can only create a false sense of "false security" and will not help in reality. If someone invades North America today, it will not be resisted by a united military force, but by two independent military units that cannot coordinate or exchange weapons.

During the recently concluded war, the U.S. and Canada hastily did some work to defend North America. Canada built many airfields. The United States also rushed to build a 1,671-mile Alaska Highway in the Canadian tundra to protect Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. The United States also built pipelines to refine oil for Canada. However, today, no one uses that highway, and the pipeline is also rusted. Last fall, the bases near the oil wells were piled high with various U.S. military equipment because the shipping costs were too high.

However, these hasty experiments at least had some effect. As a result, the Japanese army was defeated, and the transportation of troops and supplies was smooth. To this day, many generals still talk about the Aleutian campaign with fear. However, due to military censorship, the general public thought it was just an unimportant episode. In fact, if it weren't for good luck, North America might have become a bloody battlefield, and the enemy might have been able to invade, set up air bases, and plan to bomb U.S. industrial centers. Or the enemy might even bomb Great Bear Lake in Canada, destroying the only domestic source of uranium, which would be serious!

The Aleutian campaign also left other lessons for the U.S.-Canada joint defense officers to consider. Because the equipment of both sides was different and the calibers of the weapons were different, all supply systems had to be duplicated. At the same time, the two sides could not use some important materials interchangeably. Sometimes, due to transportation reasons, there would be a phenomenon that one side was under-equipped and unable to fight, while the other side had a surplus.

Many generals unanimously believe that if World War III occurs within 50 years, North America will be the battlefield. The opinion expressed by Admiral Jones, Chief of Staff of the Canadian Navy, shortly before his death, can represent the general opinion of generals. He said:

"The Allied victory in World War II relied on the extraordinary production quantity and speed of U.S. industry. Otherwise, the landing in Europe and the expulsion of German troops from Russia would not have been possible. Therefore, in another major war, the aggressor will definitely attack U.S. industrial centers such as Pittsburgh, Detroit, etc. first. And the enemy will most likely use air strikes. In this case, the situation of Canada can be self-evident."

The Key to U.S.-Canada Joint Defense

The key to the U.S.-Canada joint defense issue, from the Canadian perspective, lies in public opinion. Whether this plan can be realized depends on how the people view it.

Canadians who are generally considered "imperialists" oppose joint defense, calling it a bad policy of selling out the country. The old men left over from World War I also disagree. They think, is Canada still Canada with this? Even if they are told that this is how it has been in the past and still is now, learning from Great Britain and acting as her wing, they may reluctantly agree, but they will always feel that working for the Americans is another matter.

But I have discussed joint defense with all kinds of people in the United League, and their ideas are very realistic. Every veteran of World War II unhesitatingly supports the closest U.S.-Canada military integration. Only the residents of south-central Ontario (where loyalists immigrated during the American Revolution, and the residents still maintain a pro-British attitude) fiercely oppose joint defense.

Canada has 3.5 million French-speaking citizens. In both World Wars, they opposed participating in the war and opposed their young people dying for England. Speaking of U.S.-Canada joint defense, a bank manager can represent the general opinion of the residents: "We know that we cannot defend our country alone. Many of us do not recognize that fighting the European war is the best way to protect the country. But we all feel that joint defense with the United States is a matter of course. This powerful neighbor has the same purpose as us, which is to defend."

To re-establish Canada's national defense policy, it is not enough to simply reorganize the army. The relationship between Canadian industry and the United States is inseparable. About factories such as Ford, General Motors, Westinghouse, and General Electric are all affiliated with U.S. headquarters. The employed administrative and technical personnel are also trained and sent by the headquarters. As it is now, if Britain participates in the war, these factories will have to switch to wartime production and manufacture British-style weapons.

Less than a year into World War II, we saw very clearly that it was impossible to implement military coordination across 3,000 miles of ocean controlled by the enemy. When the British army retreated from Dunkirk, some naval warplanes were recalled on their way to Canada. As a result, Canada had training bases and airframes, but no engines. For example, in the Atlantic fleet, there were warships launched in Canadian shipyards without armed escorts because Canada did not have cannons at the time, and the sizes built by the United States were not suitable. In 1939, the United States borrowed Canadian long-range cannons for coastal defense. To find targets, shells also had to be sent because the caliber of the Canadian factory was not suitable. There were so many things like this in 1940 and 1941 that it is impossible to list them all.

Difficult to Implement the Plan

When the war was about to end, Canadian factories were still rushing to build British-style machinery. When peace came, these factories immediately began to switch to the American mass production method to manufacture American products. If there is another war, they will have to change the production methods again, and the loss in terms of efficiency will be too great.

The Chief of Staff of the Canadian Navy, Army, and Air Force are all very clear about the future of national defense issues; they know that the traditional old methods are not enough to meet the new needs. At the same time, the Canadian army is also trying to meet the U.S. standards, waiting for the U.S. and Canadian governments to have a further understanding and a definite policy.

Currently, the Canadian Navy already has plans for joint exercises with the U.S. Navy. The air forces of both sides are also preparing for joint exercises. The two countries also exchange instructors, hoping to learn more from each other as a result.

However, British-made aircraft will continue to be the mainstay of the Canadian Air Force. The caliber of the bullets is still not standardized. The Canadian army still has to follow the British way of doing things.

Lieutenant General Fergus, Chief of Staff of the Canadian Army, said it best: "If we want to do it well, the most important issue is to seek coordination. If both sides have every weapon, its caliber must be exactly the same. The names used must also be exactly the same. For example, the word "division," in terms of the number of people and combat power, both sides must have a completely same understanding."

If the war had ended later, the U.S. and Canada, as allies, might have already realized this joint defense plan. Now, it is much more difficult. The general public is tired of war, and it is difficult to be interested in future military issues. People who eat political food will certainly not loudly advocate for this issue.

From a military perspective, the most effective way to resist these new weapons, such as atomic bombs, is to use similar or even more complete new weapons. And if the enemy attacks large cities such as New York and Chicago, this side can immediately dispatch forces to bomb the aggressor's industrial centers into flat ground.

In this case, it is clear that to comprehensively plan the defense of North America, Canada's need for the United States and the United States' need for Canada are one and two, and two and one, absolutely inseparable.

Canadian national defense industry area The train is busy transporting, the work is tense.

### Flying Wing - Capabilities Exceeding Super Fortress

— Translated by Gang Ren from Popular Science Magazine

Carrying an amazing number of bombs, flying a quarter of the way around the globe, and being able to return without landing, this is the performance of the newly manufactured Flying Wing aircraft that enriches the U.S. Air Force.

The reason it is called a Flying Wing is because it has huge wings that are different from ordinary aircraft. The wingspan is 172 feet, and it weighs 104.5 tons when fully loaded. Compared with the B-29 Super Fortress, which weighs 65 tons, the load capacity is about doubled.

The Flying Wing was designed and manufactured by Northrop Aircraft Factory. It uses four Pratt & Whitney engines, with a total horsepower of 1,200 horsepower. Each engine has a Hamilton-made "push-type" propeller. The propeller is also specially made, with two four-bladed propellers coaxial and with a reverse device, so that when the "Flying Wing" lands, the two propellers rotate in opposite directions to reduce the "taxiing distance" of the "Flying Wing" on the ground.

There are pressurized rooms in the wings that can accommodate 15 people. There are also nine positions for managers, communicators, etc., and three gunner seats. There are also variable "chair beds" in the small room.

When parked on the ground, it is 20 feet high and the whole body is carried on five wheels. The movement is controlled by a three-tooth gear with a diameter of five feet six inches and four feet eight inches. The middle section of the wings is thirty-seven and a half feet wide, gradually tapering towards the wingtips.

Just looking at this Flying Wing, we can see from its appearance that there has indeed been a great innovation in aircraft engineering.

The facts tell us that the people in charge of design and manufacturing studied it for 23 years and spent millions of hours doing various tests and experimental test flights, as well as engineering discussions. John Northrop's first formal experimental Flying Wing was held in 1923. He knew that it was worth working hard to study, so he made continuous tests and improvements. See the article "Flying Wing in Success" in the March 1942 issue (Popular Science). Now, this first test flight of the N-1-M Flying Wing is displayed in the Wright Field Museum for people to visit.

Northrop not only managed to solve the various problems of the huge wings but also eliminated the tail of ordinary aircraft, becoming this innovative Flying Wing. The elevator rudder and the direction rudder are combined into an "elevon." In terms of control, there are also strange "louvered holes" at the rear of the wings, which eliminate the smooth flow of air during slow-speed flight and obtain normal control, and can automatically open and close at high speeds. These are enough to increase its aviation efficiency.

Equipped with appropriate gun mounts, it has a powerful firepower net to protect safety. The following is a comparison table between it and the B-29, which makes us feel that the "Flying Wing" is obviously a further step in aviation!

### From the Perspective of Anglo-Soviet Relations: The Turkish Straits Issue is Not a Matter of Revising the Montreux Convention, But a Manifestation of the Anglo-Soviet Power Struggle

— Zhu Jingxin

The Soviet Union, disregarding the stipulations of the Montreux Convention regarding the Straits, suddenly notified the Turkish government, demanding that the two countries conduct separate negotiations to alter the legal status of the Dardanelles Strait. This immediately heightened tensions in the Near East. Demanding the revision of international treaties due to changes in the international situation is a very common and reasonable thing, not something to be alarmed about or excessively emphasized. However, the Soviet Union's long-standing demand for joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the Straits area, and its ambition to exclude British influence, are well-known facts. Therefore, the Soviet demand, once put forward, caused alarm in various countries, making everyone more convinced that the Straits issue is not a simple one, and that besides being directly related to the Soviet Union and Turkey, there are also extremely complex and subtle international undercurrents. Although Britain has handled this matter with caution and has not taken the initiative to make any claims, the Soviet move is aimed at Britain and will not be relaxed.

According to a Moscow dispatch from Agence France-Presse on the 25th, the Soviet radio station even broadcast the news that Britain had established military bases in the Straits area, and claimed that Britain had built "radar stations" there to closely monitor submarine activity. Whether this report is true or not, it is sufficient to prove that Anglo-Soviet antagonism in Turkey has reached a fever pitch. Therefore, the Straits issue is not merely a legal issue, but has become a diplomatic war for Anglo-Soviet supremacy in the Mediterranean.

The Lausanne Conference and the Montreux Convention

During the First World War, Turkey sided with Germany in the war. By the end of the war, Turkey had lost a large amount of territory. Constantinople was occupied by the armies of the Great Powers, and Greek troops invaded the coastal areas of Asia Minor. The Kuomintang leader Kemal seized the opportunity to rise, and the Ottoman Empire disintegrated. The newly emerged Turkish Republic was confined to a corner of Asia Minor. Fortunately, under Kemal's leadership, after several struggles, considerable achievements were made in domestic politics, economy, culture, and construction. At the same time, the Greek army was repelled, and İzmir was retaken, pushing the border to the Balkan Peninsula, and Turkey's international status was slightly increased.

After the Turkish-Greek War, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the Balkan countries signed the Treaty of Lausanne at the Lausanne Conference in July 1923, abolishing the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles and recognizing the restoration of Turkish territory. In 1936, Turkey notified the signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne, requesting revision of the clauses regarding the demilitarization and free passage of the Dardanelles Strait. As a result, Britain, France, Japan, Russia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey held a conference in Montreux, where Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü proposed a new draft convention. A new treaty was signed to replace the Lausanne Treaty of that day, and Turkey was able to rearm the Straits.

Turkey's Activities During World War II

When the Second World War began, of all the Allied countries that had sided with Germany in the First World War, only Turkey did not side with her again. In particular, the signing of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement brought great gains to the Allied Nations. The Foreign Minister at this time was the current President İnönü, whose policy was pro-British and American. After Kemal's death in 1938, he succeeded him as President and continued to maintain his consistent policy. In early 1941, the Nazis cut off Britain's oil supply in the Near East, blockaded the Suez Canal, and fostered a pro-Axis regime in Iraq. The Vichy government also directed French troops to fight in Syria, and the Dodecanese Islands were an Italian air base. At this time, Turkey was surrounded by Axis powers. The Nazis put forward the request to Turkey to transit to the Middle East, but Turkey did not yield and resolutely refused. They also mobilized the national army to prepare for any eventuality, and Germany could do nothing about it.

Soviet-Turkish Relations After World War II

Historically, Soviet-Turkish relations have been unfriendly. Although Turkey maintained neutrality for a considerable period during the Second World War, and declared war on Germany three months before Germany surrendered, from the Soviet Union's point of view, Turkey's relations with Germany were always too close. In March of last year, the Soviet Union notified Turkey of the termination of the Soviet-Turkish Treaty of Friendship signed in 1925.

After the end of the war, Turkey's diplomatic situation remained tense. From the Soviet Union's point of view, the termination of the Soviet-Turkish Treaty of Friendship was considered that in the current changing situation, this treaty needed to be revised. On the Turkish side, they also hoped to reconcile with the Soviet Union. The Soviet ambassador held a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in June of last year, and the Soviet government proposed three preconditions for signing a new treaty: (1) Kars and Ardahan, which were ceded to Turkey in 1921, should be returned to the Soviet Union. (2) The Soviet Union should be allowed to establish bases in the Black Sea Straits and participate in the defense of the Straits. (3) The Montreux Convention should be revised. Such negotiations were of course impossible to carry out. In December, the situation on the Soviet-Turkish border was once very tense, and the Turkish people also held demonstrations. However, the Turkish Foreign Minister stated that under the condition of "not seeking or giving," he was extremely willing to reconcile with the Soviet Union. In March of this year, the old matter was brought up again, and the Soviet Union notified Turkey that no alliance treaty could be signed until the issues of Kars and Ardahan and the Dardanelles Strait were resolved.

Turkey cannot easily agree to the Soviet demands. Territorial integrity must be maintained, and the Dardanelles Strait is not something that Turkey can decide alone. During the Second World War, German submarines in the Black Sea were very active, and the skies over Bulgaria and Romania were also full of airplanes, so that Soviet ships could not pass through the Straits. This was Turkey's reason for replying to the Soviet Union, and finally postponed the matter.

The Sudden Soviet Demand

On August 8, the Soviet Union submitted a memorandum to Turkey, requesting the revision of the Montreux Convention, believing that the administrative power of the Dardanelles Strait should be placed under the management of the Black Sea countries, and that the Soviet Union and Turkey should jointly be responsible for the defense of the Straits. The Soviet Foreign Ministry also announced that it had copied two documents from the German Foreign Ministry archives. The first was Germany's policy towards the Soviet Union from 1937 to 1943. The second was Germany's policy towards Turkey from 1941 to 1943. In the one about Turkey, it was discovered that Turkey was using the name of neutrality to help Germany and harbored ill intentions to be hostile to the Soviet Union. Fortunately, the Soviet Union was victorious and was able to eliminate Turkey's conspiracy, so the Soviet Union requested the revision of the Montreux Convention, using this as an excuse.

After Turkey received the Soviet note, political figures generally believed that it was unacceptable. All newspapers pointed out the seriousness of the situation, and the cabinet held an emergency meeting to deal with it, rejecting the request and insisting that the jurisdiction of the Dardanelles Strait should be decided by the Montreux Convention mechanism. The claim that Turkey violated the Convention during the war was also refuted, and it was stated that it could not sign a new agreement with a few countries to replace the 1936 Convention. The Turkish government will continue to abide by the Convention, considering it the only diplomatic document governing the Straits and not allowing it to be violated.

All Parties Pay Attention to the Attitude of the Great Powers

The issue of the Dardanelles Strait is by no means a matter between the Soviet Union and Turkey. All countries along the Black Sea coast are directly related to the Straits. The countries that signed the Montreux Convention will not stand idly by. If an international conference is convened due to the revision of the Montreux Convention, Japan, Romania, and Bulgaria may not have the opportunity to attend because they fought on the side of the Axis powers. The United States will inevitably participate. In this way, the Soviet Union will inevitably cause diplomatic conflicts with Western countries. Therefore, this matter cannot be negotiated by the Soviet Union and Turkey. The Soviet Union advocates that the countries along the Black Sea coast jointly solve the problem. The so-called countries along the Black Sea coast are: Romania and Bulgaria. However, Romania and Bulgaria are now little more than vassals of the Soviet Union. It is obvious that the intention is to exclude the Montreux Convention signatory countries that are not along the Black Sea coast, so that Turkey alone must deal with this issue.

Since receiving the Soviet demands, Turkey has consulted closely with Western countries. The British and American ambassadors to Turkey have been in frequent contact with the Turkish Foreign Minister, and the French ambassador to Turkey has also visited the Turkish Foreign Minister for consultations, which shows the attention of various countries to this matter. It is said that at the Potsdam Conference, an agreement was reached on the need to reconsider the Montreux Convention. However, Britain and the United States will never agree to the Soviet Union's current approach, so they issued statements on the 14th and 15th, stating that they could not accept it. They believe that the Soviet Union's demand to jointly defend this important waterway with Turkey is equivalent to demanding a military base in Turkey, and its actions seem to be restoring 19th-century diplomacy.

Britain supports Turkey in opposing the Soviet Union's demands on the Straits, but in view of the similar situation of the Suez Canal, it advocates a compromise to meet the Soviet Union's security requirements, that is, to include it in the United Nations committee controlling the Straits passage. US Secretary of State Byrnes declared that Soviet ships could pass through the Straits without restriction, but opposed obtaining a base in the Straits. An editorial in the Soviet newspaper Pravda stated that the Soviet Union's move was to protect the interests of the Black Sea countries, and non-Black Sea countries should stop interfering in the administration of the Straits. The Soviet Union has the longest coastline in the Black Sea, and of course has the greatest right of self-defense to prohibit the invasion of navies of non-Black Sea countries.

### South African Female Writer

— Liu Yisi Zhao Jingshen

The most famous female writer in South Africa is Schreiner. Ms. Zhang Jinfen of our country has translated her collection of short stories "Dreams." But there is also a female writer, Liu Yisi (Ethelreda Lewis), who has not been introduced to China. She is very famous in countries such as Britain and the United States. The newspaper reported that she died on August 2 in Port Alfred, South Africa.

She was born in 1876 and lived in South Africa all her life. She is famous for a novel "Trader Horn." Horn's real name is Alfred A. Smith. Liu Yisi's ancestral home is Clew County in England. She was originally a physical education teacher and married a South African civil servant. After giving birth to her first child, she wrote poetry.

She is not a realist, but belongs to the imaginative and poetic side. When her novel "The Harp" (1925) was published, she was already a middle-aged woman, and her son had grown up. "The Harp" can be said to be a poet's novel, loosely structured and emotionally intense. This book discusses racial issues, but it is the poet's idealism, not realism. The scenery of South Africa is written with lively and lovely imagination, and the cold cities in the north, such as the coast of New York and Scandinavia, are used to contrast with the hot South Africa.

After "The Harp," Liu Yisi wrote two more romances: "The Flying Emerald" (1925) and "Mantis" (1926). She called those two books potboilers, which indeed greatly disappointed the admirers of "The Harp."

When she was writing newspaper literature and short stories for South African newspapers, she met the vagrants Horn (Alfred Aloysius Horn) and Jack (Zambesi Jack) trekking to the small garden in Johannesburg to sell household ironware. Jack talked about the stories he knew. Liu Yisi took out her notebook and wrote them down, and wrote books such as "The Ivory Coast in the Earlies" and "The Waters of Africa." These books sold very well on both sides of the Atlantic.

She also wrote the famous "An Old Visitor, or The Life and Works of Aloysius Horn" (1927) based on Horn's words. The American edition was retitled "Trader Horn." In 1930, MGM produced a film called "Trader Horn."

She also wrote "The Young Vikings" (1928). Her novels are characterized by the exotic atmosphere of the wilderness.

### Emptiness (Novel)

— Zhong Yuan

The rain lessened a bit, but the wind was still blowing. The howling wind struck the windows, which rattled incessantly, grating on his nerves.

He himself found it strange. Why had he become so afraid of the wind lately? Perhaps it was old age, fearing the wind would damage his health. That would be a joke, he was still a robust 27-year-old; how could he be called old? Or was it the flimsiness of the house, fearing it would be blown down and crush him? That was even more laughable. He lived in the newly built faculty dormitory of the school. How could it collapse? Even if it did, he was certainly not a base fellow who valued money and feared death! So, was it perhaps sentimentality, the sight of the wind stirring up memories or sadness? This might be somewhat true, though he himself was unwilling to admit it.

He often told his students, "You must strive to pursue knowledge in reality. Reality! Only reality is valuable, great!" Indeed, he was an absolute pragmatist. He denied all ethereal fantasies, and he scorned empty inspirations and such things. When he was a student, he most loathed those classmates who sat by the rose-tinted windows reciting poems. As a teacher, he most hated the few literature teachers who considered themselves elegant, sighed and lamented, and drowned their sorrows in wine. "Literature is the most hypocritical, the most impractical!" He not only thought so, but sometimes even felt that science carried a touch of vagueness, because science was too profound, almost conjuring something from nothing, somewhat elusive. Of course, this was partly due to his natural inclination, but mainly it was his own choice. He chose history and geography. For years, he had poured all his energy into this most practical of subjects. He was constantly pursuing and investigating in reality, just as he encouraged his students.

Yet recently, he had encountered such a thing?

He had taught here for two semesters, and he was familiar with all the male and female colleagues. He was practical, and those he knew were also inclined toward practicality. If someone asked him what kind of person Principal Li was, he would immediately flash his eyes and answer, "Old Li? A pointed face, small eyes, yellowish skin, a slightly hoarse voice, always holding his five-year-old motherless daughter in his arms." Of course, his familiarity with Principal Li was not limited to these appearances; however, he disliked using invisible, intangible, impractical words to describe Old Li or anyone else. Similarly, he knew that Shen Changzi, the physical education teacher, had a striking telephone pole figure, and Miss Zha, who taught kindergarten, had two intensely red cheeks; Old Zhou, the music teacher, always had hair hanging over his forehead, and his mustache grew half an inch every day... In short, almost every colleague left him with a practical, concrete impression, as real and concrete as the photo of the first emperor of Austria that he saw in a world history book.

Only, one female colleague seemed to be a slight exception:

Naturally, he knew her name, a beautiful and practical name – Mei Ye. He was as familiar with her as with the other colleagues: an average build, slightly plump, a long face, small eyes, but not unpleasantly so, her hair was permed, with curls hanging on her forehead, her chest was very developed, and she always looked down when she walked, as if admiring her two prominent, slightly trembling breasts...

"Is she lovely?" A young male colleague had lightly asked him when he first saw her.

"Bah, no interest!" He turned his head away.

"Pah! Don't be a hypocrite! Don't tell me you'll never marry a woman?"

He smiled faintly, not answering, and walked away. How could he answer? He studied history and geography, and he had read about the failures of countless ancient heroes and great men, failures due to one thing—women! The loss of countless beautiful rivers and mountains, lost due to one thing—women—women are terrible, women have been a source of calamity since ancient times, he knew it deeply and guarded against it deeply. But that didn't mean he never wanted to marry a woman, it meant that he was unwilling to build many beautiful romance castles in the air like others, only to end up with nothing. He planned to wait another year or two, find a most suitable girl, and immediately marry her to be his wife, to manage the household, to bear sons and daughters, practically and honestly, never building castles in the sky. When he met a new female colleague, he would, at most, nod to her plainly when he saw her, and that was it. Mei Ye was no exception.

But there was one warm afternoon, the sunlight shone on the playground, hot and dry, baking the yellow sand on the ground until it became parched, and flew up with the wind, flying in the air, like a cloud of yellow smoke, drifting slowly... He lowered his head and walked quickly across this playground, carrying a very thick book under his arm (of course, a book on history and geography), his mind occupied with a question (of course, a question on history and geography). Therefore, he did not notice anyone walking towards him, nor did he notice a string of crisp laughter ringing out in front of him.

"Mr. Yu! Mr. Yu!"

Finally, he was awakened by a clear, laughing call. Looking up, he saw two female colleagues standing in front of him, one was Lu Peihua, the fifth-grade homeroom teacher, and the other was Mei Ye. He had heard people say that they were good friends.

"Uh... Miss Lu, Miss Mei..."

Nodding lightly, greeting them, he prepared to finish and leave as usual. But the two female colleagues stood in front of him, not moving, but looking at him with smiles, as if they had something to say.

"Mr. Yu, don't you recognize us? We recognize you, you were classmates with both of us!" Sure enough, Lu Peihua spoke.

He was stunned, "Oh, I forgot. Where were we classmates?"

"At the Third Middle School. We were freshmen then, and you were an older student. You've forgotten, but we remember it well. It seems you were already wearing glasses at that time and often wore a gray Zhongshan suit..." Lu Peihua said here, tilted her head, nudged Mei Ye, and asked with a smile, "Ah Mei, didn't you say you still remember Mr. Yu playing an old man in a New Year's Day party...?"

"..." Mei Ye did not answer, but raised her small eyes and glanced at him, then immediately lowered her head shyly.

They left, and he also left. The so-called "exception" began at this time.

Logically, this "exception" should have belonged to Lu Peihua, because she smiled at him, she spoke to him, and every time she saw him after that, she would talk to him endlessly. But no! Lu Peihua gave him a very plain, ordinary impression, no different from the impressions he had of other male and female colleagues. Only Mei Ye, although she didn't talk to him much, didn't smile at him, and only gave him a quick glance every time she saw him before lowering her head, but that "glance" was really too unusual, too different! He inexplicably felt that the impression that glance left him with was somewhat beyond reality, somewhat wonderful, and there was an indescribable flavor within it...

He had studied the history of various countries, both Chinese and foreign, but history lacked romantic stories, so he never dreamed that even more "exceptional" things would happen to him within the "exception". One day, Lu Peihua came to his office alone to find him, and said to him softly:

"Mr. Yu, Mei Ye loves you, she wants to be friends with you!"

"Don't joke, Miss Lu!" He laughed.

"Who's joking with you? Really! She asked me to tell you, asking: are you willing or not?"

Looking at Lu Peihua's serious face, he was no longer surprised, nor dared he laugh any more. He remembered that this was the new world of the twentieth century, and everything in the new world, of course, could not be compared with the situations in history. That's right, men and women are equal, men can court women, why can't women court men? Everything like "female dignity" and "virgin sanctity" should be broken and abolished!

Since this "exception" within an "exception" occurred, he had saved some time from studying history and geography to consider this question: He was practical, of course, his consideration was definitely not limited to an empty word "love". He had thought carefully: in terms of age, he could indeed start a family. However, he knew that he was not rich, and the wife he married must not be fond of vanity, be gentle and able to endure hardship, in order to have a happy and fulfilling family. Now that Mei Ye was interested, then he might as well befriend her first, observe her as well.

In the spring evening, although the school campus was small, it also had patches of tender green grass, blooming with a few red, white, and yellow small flowers. The sun had already set, and sparrows chirped on the ridge of the neighbor's house. Mei Ye and Lu Peihua walked side by side in front, he quietly followed behind, coming out of the faculty office, stepping onto the cement corridor next to the campus. There was no one around. Lu Peihua deliberately quickened her pace and hurried away first, leaving him and Mei Ye alone in the garden.

Night was gradually falling, the first small star of dusk appeared on the horizon, and the light from the street lamps outside also shone in. He stood quietly under a wintersweet tree, gazing at her: In the dim starlight and lamplight, her blood-red lips, curly hair, and prominent breasts seemed even more beautiful, mysterious, and alluring... He finally forgot the question he had considered again and again, forgot the purpose of befriending Mei Ye, he succumbed to some empty realities before him: watery eyes, red lips, slightly trembling breasts. He was as drunk as if he had drunk wine, he was dazed!...

It seemed that she was the first to notice someone coming from behind, and said to him, "Someone's coming, let's go, we'll talk again tomorrow."

He didn't answer, just stared at her in fascination, reluctantly seeing her to the school gate, gazing at her back disappearing into the thin night mist, and kept saying to himself: "She is lovely, I must have her! I must have her!"

The new world of the twentieth century had invented wireless telegraphy, and people's ears were as sharp as radios, the news quickly spread throughout the school, and everyone knew Lu Peihua's nickname, "Matchmaker".

"Hey, Old Yu, slow down, 'Matchmaker' has brought you a letter again!"

"Old Yu, why haven't you treated us to honey cakes yet? Quickly come with a special express train!"

The teasing and jokes of colleagues became almost commonplace. At first, he couldn't help but feel a little annoyed, but gradually, not only was he not annoyed, but he felt supreme joy, supreme glory. Every time people teased him, he would open his mouth and smile slightly – a smile from the bottom of his heart!

He admitted that he was completely subdued by her. He couldn't leave her for a moment, it would be good even to see her shadow reflected on the ground, he had no heart to consider anything else, as if it were a world-shaking event: the overall situation was settled? Just then, a natural science teacher in the school asked for a long vacation, and Principal Li asked each teacher if they could recommend a suitable substitute teacher. When he asked him, he suddenly remembered that a classmate had recently asked him to find a job. He thought of recommending that classmate to Principal Li.

The morning he introduced the substitute teacher Niu Changqing to every colleague, white clouds moved gently in the sky, and the sunlight shone softly from a row of long glass windows into the office, illuminating Niu Changqing's tall and imposing figure, his well-tailored suit, and his pair of lively and passionate big eyes.

He never thought that he, standing in front of Niu Changqing, suddenly seemed very old and dull, and he never thought that a woman's emotions could be more fragile and weak than willow branches in a strong wind. He introduced the other colleagues in his usual tone, walked to Mei Ye's side, and unusually smiled at Niu Changqing: "This Miss Mei Ye, you already know... no need to introduce her, right?..."

Mei Ye and Niu Changqing smiled at each other, he thought it was his unusual smile that infected people, so he didn't pay much attention. By the time he began to pay attention, things had progressed to an alarming extent.

In retrospect, perhaps one could laugh it off calmly! But at the time, it was indeed somewhat unbearable. He stared blankly at Lu Peihua's pointed oval face, without moving for two minutes! Not smiling, not even breathing, finally he opened his trembling lips with difficulty and asked:

"Is there no room for recovery?"

"I think there's no way to recover!" Lu Peihua looked at him coldly, with a hint of pity: "Since she told you to give up, then just give up! Anyway, in the beginning, you were just passive!"

Hearing this, he seemed to wake up from a confused dream. "Passive", that's right, she pursued him first, asked him for love first: now, seeing Niu Changqing, she threw him away again. Heh, this shameless woman! Vile woman! No interest, then break up!

He didn't look at Lu Peihua again (even seeing her made him disgusted), and straightened up and walked outside. That day was Sunday, the house was quiet, and it was also quiet outside. The bleak yellow sun hung in the gray sky, as if it was about to rain heavily. He turned a corner in the outside corridor, walked into the quiet library, and sat down in front of several tall bookshelves inside.

Holding up a thick, hard "Encyclopedia of History and Geography," he returned to his original self—a pursuer of knowledge and reality!

He read one word after another, writing one word after another carefully in his notebook; everything around was quiet, and his heart was also quiet. However, suddenly a shrill voice pierced his ears like a thorn, it was the coquettish laughter that Mei Ye often made.

"Well, let's go over there, it's better over there!"

"It's not reliable over there! Maybe that bookworm is in the library, what if he sees us?" It was Niu Changqing's suppressed voice.

"Bah! I'm not afraid even if he sees us, I insist on doing it for him to see, what can he do to us?"

He suspected that it had already rained outside, and the sky had suddenly darkened, and for a moment the words on the book became blurry. He desperately widened his eyes to continue writing down some outlines, but suddenly he realized that what he had written in his notebook were many words like "shameless," "woman," "calamity," and other messy words.

He seemed unable to sit down any longer, he threw down the pen in his hand and ran out of the library. It turned out that it was not raining outside, but a gust of howling wind was madly sweeping in the air. When he ran through the small campus with his eyes closed, Mei Ye's sharp laughter came again in the wind: "Hee hee hee! I insist on doing it for that bookworm to see in the future, what can he do?"

Just so, this thing happened two months ago, he was practical, he ended that thing with a calm "smile", forgetting that thing, but somehow from that time on, he suddenly became afraid of the wind.

Now the rain has stopped, but the wind is still blowing. The howling wind struck the windows, which rattled incessantly. He sat in the room, thinking gloomily, he didn't admit that the wind stirred up his memories, his sadness. But he was irritable, he couldn't read, he had no way to escape a kind of inexplicable annoyance...

Gradually he heard a burst of laughter downstairs, he knew it was several male colleagues chatting in the downstairs office, so he listlessly pulled up a piece of paper and wrote a line on it:

"The wind is so strong, I'm extremely irritable, who can use a few words to relieve my irritability, I will give a box of unopened 'Hardman' cigarettes as a gift!"

He called a tea boy to send the note downstairs. After a while, the tea boy returned with a smile, with three other notes in his hand. He took the notes and read them one by one.

"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form," was the handwriting of an old colleague who studied Buddhist scriptures.

"The Preacher says: vanity of vanities, vanity of vanities, all is vanity!" was written by a young colleague who believed in Christianity.

He shook his head, threw the two notes he had read into the wastebasket with force. When he unfolded the third large note, there were a few lines of neat ink characters on it. At a glance, he recognized it as the handwriting of Wang Yiping, the literature teacher he usually disliked the most.

"Friend! Are you afraid of the wind? But the wind is ethereal. You hear its voice, but you don't know where it comes from? Where it goes? You hate it, but you can never grasp it, you can never eliminate it! Good! This is like the various troubles of moldy life – invisible, unspeakable, never able to grasp, never able to eliminate!…

Friend! Do you hope to relieve some烦恼嗎？ I advise you to have a glass of liquor with me, sing a few lines of 'The Great River Flows Eastward:’…

Seeing this, he couldn't help but smile slightly, grabbed a box of "Hardman" on the table and handed it to the tea boy and said:

"Take it down to Mr. Wang, tell him I'll be there in a while!"

### An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 16

Climbing into the carriage, he pulled out a business card and handed it over:

"Now that you, the Special Commissioner, have returned to headquarters, please don't forget me. If I can be promoted in the future, I will definitely be grateful for your kindness."

After all this fuss, I finally understood what he was up to.

The car sped along quite quickly, though it also rattled intensely. Each time we passed a sentry post, thanks to this fellow, who explained his rank and identity, plus "urgent official business," we were allowed through.

Who knew that in less than thirty minutes, the two armies would formally engage each other, first with sparse rifle and light machine-gun fire, and then the artillery in the sky joined in. Although we weren't within the firing line, we weren't too far away either. Several times the car was stopped by sentries, but this fellow, invoking the name of my headquarters' business, forced our way forward, sometimes moving parallel to the firing line, sometimes at an angle.

"As long as we can move, that's good," I thought to myself.

Who knew that the further the car went, the denser the shooting became. Finally, we encountered many wounded-soldier trucks, and we were definitively blocked, absolutely forbidden from going any further. At this point, "Pig Teeth" used all his powers of persuasion, pleading, begging for mercy, threatening, and intimidating, but to no avail. From the patrol squad, we learned that we were only two or three kilometers from the racetrack, and that almost the entire line was open fire; or rather, several fronts were engaged.

Just as we were hesitating, a battlefield military police patrol team arrived. Artillery fire was flying overhead.

"You must immediately retreat to your original defense, or transfer to Fengtai!" The military police seemed to be ordering; "The lights inside and on the front of the car must not be turned off, to avoid accidents!"

"Let's retreat!" "Pig Teeth" sought my opinion, and I agreed.

The car turned around, and after less than a mile, I remembered it was the quietest place along the road, with a bit of sparse woods and earthen hills. I felt that even if we had no special mission, retreating was impossible; because the advance and retreat of the battlefield are constantly changing, and no one can predict what will happen in the next minute. So I ordered Pig Teeth in a commanding tone:

"Stop the car!"

This time, he was sitting next to the driver. We could see each other clearly under the overhead light.

The car stopped, but just at that moment, when the driver and that wine-sodden fellow were about to ask me the reason for stopping, they saw that my hand was on the pistol holster, and the way I was signaling to Little Tiger. Actually, this was superfluous. The moment I ordered the car to stop, Little Tiger had already understood everything.

The two fellows got out of the car at the same time, suspecting something. Under these special circumstances, friend and foe were just a matter of a glance. The two fellows were already on guard, but they still didn't dare to act recklessly.

"What are the Special Commissioner's orders?" Pig Teeth approached the car door and asked. I saw his two hateful gold teeth.

"We must get to the city quickly today, but the situation is so bad that we have to take risks," I expressed my determination.

### Heroic and Exquisite

— Gao Tianxin

Large seals (over one inch) should be engraved with a heroic spirit to have grandeur; small seals (two fen) must be exquisite to be intriguing. If a large seal is engraved without grandeur, it cannot be eye-catching and lacks spirit. If a small seal is not engraved with precision, it feels crude and tasteless. Using broad strokes to engrave a small seal is ultimately not as beautiful as carving it carefully with a small knife. Conversely, using a small knife to carve a large seal is also a major taboo. These two wonderful realms (engraving large seals and engraving small seals) are not easy tasks. Only those with similar temperaments can do it.

Objectively speaking, large seals can fully express the artistic interest of seal engraving, and can fully demonstrate the beauty of knife technique, brush technique, composition, and seal script. It is clear at a glance. Crystal clear on paper, it is especially pleasing to the eye and heart. Small seals, due to their small size, in addition to feeling delicate and exquisite, actually have a sense of the hero having no place to display his skills in terms of knife technique, brush technique, composition, and seal script.

### "To the Fields"

— Work by Jean-François Millet (1814-1875)

Stored in the Glasgow Art Gallery

Millet was born into a farming family and was poor from childhood. Between the ages of fourteen and eighteen, he worked in the fields, but he was born with a talent for painting. When he had time, he often picked up charcoal to draw on the walls. The villagers saw it and were amazed, so they raised money to send him to Paris to study painting. At first, he was not very famous, but after the age of thirty-five, he gradually began to show his talent. Millet's paintings mostly depict the lives of farmers, the simple and rustic scenes of the countryside, and each picture is filled with a kind of warm humanity.

### Military Vehicles

— Shao Fu

Please note from the military organs stationed in Shanghai:

Shanghai has many traffic accidents caused by military vehicles. In the statistical figures, perhaps the number accounted for by military vehicles is not very large, but due to military vehicles driving too fast due to mission requirements, or due to the special form of the vehicle body, or due to the unusual circumstances of the accident, military vehicles have become the biggest target in traffic accidents, for the military organs orders that special management should be given.

We know that there are many things that the person in charge does not understand beforehand, and even does not know after the fact.

Traffic order in the city needs the assistance of all parties to maintain and abide by. Public life should not have special classes that can be exempted. Here, we request that the US military authorities stationed in Shanghai can work with us to ensure that the driving skills and life management of drivers must be strict, and that the traffic regulations promulgated by the municipal authorities must be checked and strictly followed.

Shanghai is a city, not a war zone. On country roads, one can speed and rush around, but on roads in the city where pedestrians crowd, it is simply intentional murder!

### I'm Selling – National Loan Substitute Coupons

— By Zheng

A Female Student's Report

This time, to promote the National Loan Substitute Coupons, our high school division formed a group of five girls, with a quota of one million. Because my health isn't great, I usually prefer quiet and don't like being active, and I don't have the gift of gab, so my four classmates were kind enough to assign me only 100,000 yuan worth of coupons. But receiving these 100,000 yuan in coupons already weighed heavily on my mind.

Back home, I immediately discussed it with my father. My father said, "Tomorrow, I'll introduce you to some old friends. It'll be easier to sell them that way."

Just then, a Mr. Mao, who is the chief accountant at the ×× Electric Company, happened to be there. He volunteered, "You can come to our company tomorrow. You can sell at least 20,000 yuan."

My father said, "That's wonderful. First go to Mr. Mao's, then pass by ××× Road going east to Mr. Yang's place at the ×× Insurance Company on ×× Road. He's a young tycoon and an old friend of mine. You can sell at least 50,000 yuan there."

That was the conversation the evening before yesterday. Yesterday morning, although the weather was very hot and I wasn't feeling well, I walked from Haining Road to Mr. Mao's place on ××× Road. Mr. Mao was very polite. He picked out two 2,000 yuan coupons from my hand and gave me 4,000 yuan. I said, "Didn't you promise me 20,000 yuan yesterday?"

He said, "Take it easy. So many people are donating these days. If I gave you more, it would be embarrassing for me."

He was just an accountant; he couldn't be generous with public funds. I naturally didn't press him to fulfill his promise from the day before.

Walking east to Mr. Yang's place, I explained my purpose, but unexpectedly, his expression changed drastically. He said, "Why are you coming to me with this kind of thing?"

I said, "If I don't try to sell to people I know, it'll be even harder to sell to people I don't know!"

He reluctantly gave me 5,000 yuan, looking as if he was suffering from some terrible illness. I didn't say anything and gave him the 5,000 yuan worth of coupons. He looked at them, then tried to return them to me. I said, "Don't be polite. Goodbye!"

Back home, it was already 12:30 PM. I was angry, exhausted, and hot, but I didn't feel hungry.

In the evening, Mrs. Wei, our neighbor, came over for a chat. She said, "These past few days, I've bought a lot of stuff: glass wallets, glass shoes... etc."

I thought this was a good opportunity and immediately said, "Those are foreign goods. Would you mind buying some domestic goods as well?"

"Sure," she readily replied, "I lent out 2 million yuan last month at a two-cent interest rate, and I just received 500,000 yuan in interest yesterday."

So I explained the significance of promoting National Loan Substitute Coupons to her. She said, "Okay, I'll buy 50,000 yuan worth."

I was extremely happy. I thought that in this way, the gap would be narrowed. As she was leaving, I quickly placed the 50,000 yuan worth of coupons in her hand.

She said, "I'll send the 50,000 yuan over tomorrow morning." I said, "No need. I'll come to pick it up at nine o'clock tomorrow morning because I have to submit the payment in the afternoon." My mother quietly said to me, "Don't be too optimistic. People call that woman 'Thirteen O'Clock'!"

This morning, I went to her residence. She said, "Come back this afternoon. I'll have it ready for you after lunch." As she spoke, she was counting money, at least several hundred thousand yuan.

After lunch, I went back, and she suddenly said, "Doesn't this coupon only become valid on September 1st?"

"This won't work," she said, "then I'll lose four or five days of interest. It's not worth it."

I said, "That's not how it works. Didn't I explain the meaning of issuing National Loan Substitute Coupons to you?"

"I forgot. Then come back on the evening of August 31st to pick it up?"

"That's too late," I said impatiently.

"If it's too late, then take the coupons back. I don't think you'll be able to buy any outstanding domestic goods with them anyway." I picked up the coupons and returned home, almost crying.

### My New Clothes

— By Old Pu

Because prices keep rising, while salary increases crawl like snails, for years I've been spending more than I earn each month, and my finances are incredibly strained. Just getting enough to eat is a problem, so buying clothes is out of the question, which means my clothes are gradually becoming tattered. My wife, seeing my plight, can't help but feel sad, and she often urges me to make some new clothes. I know I can't put it off any longer, but where am I going to get the money for clothes?

Thankfully, there's always a way out. The higher-ups saw fit to add 40 yuan to my base salary, so now my monthly income can increase by 15,000 yuan. Isn't this a good opportunity to make some new clothes? I told my wife this good news, and she was very happy too.

Even though it wasn't even mid-month yet, I couldn't wait for the end of the month to get the money and make some new clothes. I finally managed to wait it out, and the end of the month finally arrived. When I went to the accounting office to collect my salary, even though it was just an increase of 15,000 yuan, my heart was filled with hope and happiness.

After collecting my salary, it was only 5 PM, so I decided to buy the fabric first and then go home.

Inside the fabric store, the silk fabrics in the glass cabinets were displayed in a dazzling array, and whole bolts of coarse cloth were piled in the corner, as tall as a person. Customers flowed in and out, and the shop assistants ran back and forth like shuttles. One shop assistant came up to me.

"Sir, what kind of material are you looking for?"

"Do you have uniform fabric?"

"Yes, we do."

He immediately brought over several bolts of fabric:

"Sir, this is flannel, most suitable for making uniforms, the price will be satisfactory to you; that kind is American wool, the color is very bright and generous."

"How much does this flannel cost?"

"5,000 yuan a yard, very cheap, *hee hee*, the American wool is only 7,000 yuan a yard, it will look even better on a gentleman like you in American wool."

I couldn't help but be stunned. 7,000, 5,000, I can't even make a pair of pants, let alone a uniform? The shop assistant saw that I was dazed and already understood most of it:

"There is also a blue khaki only at, black wool three thousand five to four thousand, the color is also very generous."

"Then how much does An'an Blue sell for?"

"Only sells for 3,000, the cheapest and most generous."

The cheapest, 3,000 yuan a yard, a set of uniform needs at least six yards, which is 18,000 yuan, plus 8,000 yuan for labor, oh my god! 26,000 yuan is such a huge amount! I can only sigh at the fabric.

I brazenly walked out of the first fabric store, but within a few minutes, I walked out of the fourth fabric store, my hands still empty. What to do? Poor civil servants are ultimately not destined to wear new clothes.

I staggered down the street, my heart filled with disappointment and sadness. The beautiful goods in the department store seemed to be mocking me, and the colorful silks in the fabric store were also flaunting their wealth. Why have I become so miserable after eight years?

Suddenly, a strong neon light shone over, and I looked up sharply. The four big characters "×× Thrift Shop" immediately caught my eye.

That's right, since I can't afford new clothes, buying a set of used ones is also good.

Stepping into the thrift shop, there were indeed quite a few uniforms hanging on the wall, but the prices were only 10-20% cheaper than new ones. Finally, in the corner, I saw a set of eight-year-old woolen uniforms, priced at 17,000.

After a long period of negotiation, spending a lot of saliva, I finally bought it for 15,000 yuan.

So, after not wearing a set of new clothes for many years, I finally have a set of new clothes today.

### Such an Examination

— By Dingjiang

The second examination of ×× University was held today; I was assigned to Xu Hui Middle School to supervise the afternoon civics exam. The questions were indeed a bit difficult. However, our ×× North classmates, taking the lead, withdrew from the examination hall in large numbers. I think such heroic and promising students' attitudes of walking away with their heads held high are indeed admirable. However, when I ventured out, I saw these people holding books, copying furiously. After copying, they went back in to submit their papers, even messing with the proctors. The proctors just let them go. This strange phenomenon struck a heavy blow to my perception of students' pure and flawless hearts.

Many of the current scum and traitors were the most enthusiastic participants in the May Fourth Movement. However, the molding of a deteriorating society turned them into shameless corrupt officials. Now that I think about it, if these so-called university students are already so despicable in their student days, then what will they be like if they ever hold political power?

I don't want to think about it, and I can't bear to think about it. In this period of national reconstruction where education is paramount, this strange situation just makes me feel heartbroken to speak of and brings tears to my eyes to think of!

### Students as Waiters

— By Zhongqi

Life Notes

I am a student.

I can't let the two months of summer vacation go to waste. Moreover, a student should be able to earn his own tuition, so as to avoid my aging father having to run around in the sweltering heat to arrange tuition for us children. That's practically treating my father like a beast of burden. How can we children live with that?

Therefore, this summer vacation, I went to work at a candy and soda shop. Although this position is the despised "Boy", and the salary is pitifully low, that's precisely why it's enough for me to understand what the lives of servants are like. At the same time, at least three meals a day can be solved, which can slightly reduce my father's burden.

Fortunately, it's not unprecedented for students to act as waiters. I remember a few years ago, the International Hotel publicly advertised for university students to work as waiters. At the time, the newspapers also engaged in a heated debate. Some people thought that such places were excessively luxurious and extravagant, a hotbed of vice, and not a place where pure and simple students should find themselves. Others thought that working part-time and studying was sacred labor, so why not let students who have never stepped into society enrich their life experience?

But now I believe that the phrase "labor is sacred" is ultimately an ideal, and the reality is not so. If you don't believe me, look at what kind of labor is considered sacred today? Generally speaking, our kind of work that exchanges labor for life is still considered lowly by most people. Often, many customers think very highly of themselves and put on airs of young masters or mistresses, wanting us to come at their beck and call, or complaining that we don't serve them well enough. For example, when a customer drinks soda, we give him a glass, but he insists on having a straw; if we give him a straw, he insists on having a glass. If we give him both, then the boss orders that we don't, isn't that making things difficult for us? At this time, we can only nod and say "yes, yes!" That's when they feel victorious. Regarding this arrogant attitude, we often have some rebellious emotions. However, in order to maintain commercial ethics, even if some things go against our wishes, we have to swallow our anger and not dwell on it.

But then again, good customers are not unheard of. They are very considerate of the difficulties of doing business and understand our plight. Of course, the ideal of "labor is sacred" will once again ripple in our minds, making us feel that the saying "practice is the mother of theory" is correct, and even if we are physically tired, we are temporarily filled with satisfaction.

Indeed, our work is quite busy and laborious. Starting at seven in the morning and continuing until twelve late at night, except for meal times, we work for almost ten hours without any rest. Although there are few cold drinks in the morning, the bread and sugar sauce business is extremely busy. After noon, the cold drinks come one after another. Until after closing, we still have to do a round of cleaning and tidying: washing tea sets, boiling face towels, wiping display windows, mopping floors, all such work falls on our shoulders. We can't fall asleep until almost one o'clock every day, so we only get five or six hours of rest a day. How can we still have the energy to deal with customers and do such heavy work during the day? Running back and forth all day long has already made our legs ache. As soon as we lie down on the bed, we truly "don't know when the east turns white!" This is our day's life.

It's also pitiful to say that for work like ours, we should get decent pay. But now our biggest income—tips—has become a problem. The reason is that sales tax needs to be added by another 20%, which increases costs invisibly, and the income from tips is naturally greatly affected.

After working as a waiter for just ten days, I casually looked in the mirror and found that I had lost a lot of weight. I remember when I was a child, I read Liu Banchen's "Apprentice's Misery," which described the life of an apprentice who was "born of my parents." How much different is it from our lives as waiters?

### Female Regimental Commander Escapes the Fiery Pit, Willing to Be a Servant

— By Youfu

Because it's difficult to find good servants in Shanghai, I asked a friend to find me a servant from Jiangbei. Coincidentally, the servant of the neighbor downstairs is an old woman who is almost 70 or 80 years old. She has a daughter-in-law who just escaped from northern Jiangsu to Shanghai and is looking for a place to stay. Therefore, I hired her daughter-in-law. She is a young woman of about twenty years old, with the beauty of a country girl, her body is sturdy and strong. She works quickly and diligently, and I am very satisfied.

But after half a month, she didn't seem to be as good as she was when she first came, not as conscientious in her work. She seemed to have the air of a soldier, the demeanor of an officer, and her attitude was gradually growing. Everything seemed very reluctant.

Recently, she has changed even more drastically, doing things nonsensically, ignoring me. I thought she didn't want to continue working, or that she thought the work was too hard or the pay was too little! So, I asked my wife to ask her what was wrong, why she wasn't happy and why she was so depressed? Her answer was: "My matter, Madam, cannot be resolved for me, so it's not convenient to say."

My wife thought it was even stranger, and her curiosity drove her to pay extra attention, still unwilling to give up, and insisted on getting an answer. After repeated questioning, I finally obtained a shocking, painful, tortuous, and bizarre piece of news:

She was originally not a servant, but a female regimental commander. After the Communist army entered Taixing, northern Jiangsu, she was forcibly conscripted for training. Because she was young and beautiful, and physically strong, it is said that there were many people pursuing her. Because of these many factors, she was also forced to preside over "Women's Training" and was honorably appointed to the position of "Regimental Commander." Every day, she had to lead five or six hundred female soldiers in drills. But even so, she spent the whole day washing her face with tears, living a very painful life. Their various despicable behaviors followed the slogans of democracy and liberation. Oppressed, she couldn't breathe. She couldn't survive any longer, she was in extreme pain, so she finally took a short leave of absence to Shanghai on the pretext of looking for her husband (and had a guarantor), escaped the liberated area, and escaped the sea of suffering.

But fate had destined her, and the god of misfortune still surrounded her. Now, her guarantor has been ordered to come to Shanghai to find her and take her back. If she doesn't go back, her land will be confiscated, her house burned down, her family property confiscated, and her guarantor shot. Therefore, she is in extreme anxiety.

However, she has already held an emergency family meeting with her family in Shanghai and decided not to go back. Because even if she goes back, things will be bad, and it will be even worse if she returns. According to the guarantor, "The Communist army believes that she is gone forever, that she is deceiving the higher-ups and surrendering to the old central government, and that she is a traitor." As a result, even the "guarantor" who came to Shanghai to find her (the guarantor when she asked for leave) did not go back. They cannot go back, and their family property in their hometown can only be left to fate!

She is willing to be a servant; she really can't do the "regimental commander" anymore.

### Litvinov, Who Stepped Down

— By Qian Fanfu

The Advocate of "Collective Security"

According to a Reuter dispatch from London on the 24th: Soviet "Vice Minister" Litvinov has been dismissed. This diplomat, who was once world-renowned, has thus announced his departure from the world political stage. Litvinov reached the age of seventy a month ago. Counting from when he was appointed as the Soviet Plenipotentiary Representative to the United Kingdom in 1917 to his recent dismissal, his career as a diplomat has lasted exactly thirty years. From the success of the Soviet revolution to its rise to the status of a strong power, Litvinov is well aware of the causes and consequences in between.

Mr. Litvinov was born in 1876. His father was a Jew named Belostrotsky, whose family was well-off. He was sent to a commercial school from an early age. After graduating at the age of seventeen, he served in the "Imperial Russian" army, but he was inspired by the then-popular socialist ideas, so he joined the "Russian Social Democratic Labour Party" in 1898 - the predecessor of the Soviet Communist Party.

After joining the party, he worked hard on revolutionary work. In 1901, he was arrested by the royal secret service, sentenced to six years of imprisonment, and exiled to Siberia. After spending a year and a half in a dark prison, he and eleven comrades escaped from prison and arrived in Switzerland, where he met Lenin. He lived a life of wandering overseas with them. In 1903, the party was reorganized, and Litvinov officially joined the "Communist Party". In 1905, he sneaked back to China and engaged in secret activities near Volar.

In 1917, the "October Revolution" occurred, and the Soviet government was established. He was appointed as the Plenipotentiary Representative to the United Kingdom. Soon after, he returned to China to serve as "Vice Minister". In 1930, he was promoted to People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. From 1918 to 1935, Litvinov continuously travelled internationally, while using this as a means of diplomatic negotiation. This period was the golden age of his political life.

In 1927, he represented the Soviet Union at the "Geneva Disarmament Conference" and proposed a bill advocating that all countries completely abolish their military equipment. This greatly amazed the world, and his reputation grew daily. His words and actions were always noticed by the world, and he was given the title of "Envoy of Peace."

During his tenure, Litvinov used his wit and skill to negotiate with the strong capitalist countries, consolidating the Soviet Union's international status. He signed mutual assistance treaties with European and American powers and resolved many international disputes, but he was therefore regarded as a Soviet diplomat who was pro-British and pro-American. Therefore, some people suspect that Litvinov's dismissal this time is nothing less than an extremely complex and serious explanation of international relations, which have reached a critical point.
