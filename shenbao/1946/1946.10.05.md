### The Peace Talk Situation Remains Dull; The Chinese Communists Have Not Yet Formally Replied; The US Embassy Denies Soviet Involvement in Mediation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Regarding the rumors that the Soviet Ambassador recently sent a letter to Ambassador Stuart regarding the Chinese situation, the US Embassy spokesman, Conner, solemnly stated on the afternoon of the 4th that it was absolutely untrue, and that Ambassador Stuart had never received a letter from the Soviet Ambassador, nor had Special Envoy Marshall had any correspondence with him. The rumor that the Soviet Ambassador would participate in mediation is purely a rumor.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The situation remains stagnant today. The representatives of the government in the Political Consultative Conference sent a reply to Zhou Enlai and others of the Chinese Communist Party, which has been sent to Shanghai by a special messenger. Although the letter explained the government's response to the memorandum submitted by Zhou Enlai and others, it was delivered by Marshall and Mr. Secretary. This morning, when Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan visited Marshcall and Mr. Secretary, they still inquired whether the government had responded to the CCP's memorandum, and asked whether the government's statement issued the previous day was the response. The meeting between Dong, Wang, Marshall and Secretary lasted a long time. In addition to inquiries, the Zhangjiakou ceasefire was still the theme of the conversation. It is reported that the two officials did not give a formal reply, and it is also reported that Marshall and Secretary are still willing to make a final effort to mediate, hoping that peace can be achieved soon. At 10:30 on the morning of the 4th, Pi Zonggan, Military Attache of the National Government, visited Ambassador Stuart, and then met with Special Envoy Marshall. In addition to receiving a certain person from the Executive Headquarters, Ambassador Stuart also hosted a banquet for church people in the evening, with no other activities. At present, what all parties are expecting is the Communist Party's final attitude. Chuan Jingbo, Ambassador Stuart's personal advisor, visited President Song at 5:00 p.m. According to reports, he indicated that the situation is expected to turn around in two or three days.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Xinhua News Agency's draft on the 4th reported from Yan'an on the 3rd, with the title "Chinese Communist Party Officials Claim that the Three-Man Conference Should Be Restored, the Ceasefire Order of January Has No Guarantee of Peace, and the Chinese Communist Party is Not Considering Participating in the Government and the National Assembly." The content is an informal response to the government's statement on the situation announced on the 2nd in a question-and-answer tone, summarized as follows: (1) It is said that the government still shows no signs of being prepared to cease fire, and that attacking Zhangjiakou is a clear indication of its determination to break the peace talks. The troop reorganization plan mentioned in the government's statement has been torn up, and can now be regarded as a unilateral excuse to restrain the CCP; (2) The first task of the Three-Man Conference is to unconditionally restore the validity of the January 10th ceasefire order. If this cannot be done, the CCP will fight to the end for the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; (3) Only after peace is guaranteed on the basis of the January 10th ceasefire order can the CCP consider its attitude towards participating in the government and the National Assembly.

[Local News] Chen Jiakang, spokesperson of the Chinese Communist Party, believes that the two "maximum concessions" mentioned in the government's statement on October 2 are not concessions, but another unreasonable demand to undermine the Political Consultative Conference.

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Chairman Chiang met with Zeng Qi, leader of the Youth Party, and Liu Dongyan, member of the Central Standing Committee of the party, at his official residence at 5:20 p.m. today. Zeng gave a detailed account of his observations during his travels in North and Northeast China. He also made some statements on how to promote democratic unity and peaceful unification. They left at 6:15 p.m.

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Zeng Qi, leader of the Youth Party, and Liu Dong, a member of the Central Standing Committee of the party, visited Ambassador Stuart at his official residence on the afternoon of the 3rd. Advisor Fu Jingbo was also present. Zeng first expressed his respect to the ambassador for his efforts for China's peaceful unification. The ambassador humbly said, "Laboring without success." Zeng said that the work of the ambassador and General Marshall would eventually have a great effect, because Marshall's visit to China had already promoted two things: (1) the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and (2) the troop reorganization plan. Although there have been twists and turns due to military conflicts, these two things are indeed supported by domestic and foreign public opinion, and will eventually be realized sooner or later. There will definitely be clues within the year. This is the last five minutes, and I hope that the ambassador and General Marshall will continue to make the last effort. The Chinese Youth Party will cooperate as a third party in the country to promote its success. The ambassador was delighted by this. They left around 5 o'clock.

### Luo Longji and Others Host Reporters, Elaborating on the Democratic League's Position; Maintaining a Neutral Attitude Towards the Situation

[Our Dispatch] The China Democratic League held a press conference at the Hongmian Restaurant on Zhongzheng East Road at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 60 reporters from various newspapers attended. Shen Junru, Luo Longji, Zhang Junmai, Huang Yanpei, and Zhang Bojun from the Democratic League were all present.

Luo Longji spoke first, stating that the purpose of today's reception was to express the Democratic League's attitude towards the recent development of the situation, in three points:

First, regarding the issue of war and peace, that is, the issue of unification or division, the Democratic League has clearly expressed its position in the telegram to Chairman Chiang regarding the National Assembly. We believe that the National Assembly on November 12 is not only the key to formulating a constitution and implementing constitutional government, but also the key to China's unification or division. We advocate ending party rule in advance and implementing constitutional government, so we will never oppose the convening of the National Assembly, and we will never refuse to participate without any reason. However, looking at the current situation, the period before November 12 is the most important key. The Democratic League is of course willing to participate in and support Mr. Chiang's leadership in anything that helps peaceful unification; if it is not conducive to peaceful unification, such as causing a long-term division or long-term civil war, the Democratic League will not only be unwilling to participate, but will also step forward in society to oppose it. We are not opposed to the National Assembly, nor are we opposed to ending party rule, but we are opposed to China still having a divided situation after eight years of war. Recently, both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have issued documents. The government has proposed two conditions: the number of seats on the National Government Committee and the areas where troops are stationed. It is not yet known how the Chinese Communist Party will respond. Today, the Democratic League is not responding on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, but because the issue of the number of seats involves the Democratic League and is related to the entire peaceful unification, it is specifically brought up to explain to society. The CCP requires that the National Government Committee have a total of 14 seats with the Democratic League. Some people therefore recognize the Democratic League as the tail of the CCP and have an agreement with the CCP. In fact, at the Political Consultative Conference at that time, the government's request was for a majority, and the CCP proposed a three-thirds system. Later, the government's majority of seats was passed by the Political Consultative Conference, and the CCP insisted on having a one-third veto power to protect the peaceful nation-building program. The Democratic League is unwilling to affect the unification and solidarity because of the issue of the number of seats, and feels that after 20 years of struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, suspicion between each other is inevitable. In order to seek cooperation between the two parties and make the two parties feel relieved to participate in the coalition government, although it is clear that it may cause misunderstandings from the outside world, after careful consideration, it was decided to help the CCP obtain one-third of the seats. Frankly speaking, Zhou Enlai had obtained the government's understanding at the Political Consultative Conference before it was closed, and the Democratic League had also expressed to the CCP that it would definitely assist and cooperate in exercising the veto power. Unexpectedly, to this day, this issue is still a point of contention between war and peace. The opinion of the Democratic League has been expressed by Mr. Liang Shuming. We believe that it is very inappropriate for the government to drag a seat from a non-party and non-faction to the CCP, because what the CCP requires is a veto power. The Democratic League cannot bear to affect the peace of the whole country because of one or two committee seats. Regarding the issue of troop deployment, the peaceful nation-building program formulated by the Political Consultative Conference already has a solution. The first article of the military matters stipulates that the reorganization of the army must separate the party from the army and the government from the army. If it can be implemented accordingly to achieve the nationalization of the army and the army does not interfere in politics, then what troop deployment issue is there to talk about? Therefore, the Democratic League emphasizes the implementation of the peaceful nation-building program and cooperates with the troop reorganization plan to seek a solution.

Second, regarding the attitude of the United States, the Democratic League neither opposes the United States nor opposes the Soviet Union, neither pulls the United States to oppose the Soviet Union nor pulls the Soviet Union to oppose the United States. We are willing to be friends with the United States and the Soviet Union, and we hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will cooperate. However, an independent and autonomous country can never tolerate a second country stationing troops in its territory, so we advocate the withdrawal of US troops and oppose any country stationing troops in China. We are grateful for the help that the United States has given us in the past, but we cannot lower our national status because of this. Moreover, we advocate that "US troops" withdraw from China, not that "the United States" withdraw from China. We do not oppose economic or other assistance. However, there is one condition, that is, it cannot be involved in civil war. Otherwise, if the civil war continues to expand and prolong, the United States should be held responsible.

Third, the Democratic League's attitude towards the Li Wen case and the entire democracy and freedom. The government seems to have ended the Li Wen case, but the Democratic League cannot be satisfied. We will continue to urge the government to pay attention to the murderers of the Li case and cannot be ambiguous. We must remind the government to realize the four promises and the respect for people's rights in the peaceful nation-building program.

Zhang Junmai then stood up and spoke, emphasizing that today, everyone must be calm and unanimously demand peace.

Huang Yanpei finally added the opinion that we cannot fight anymore.

After Huang finished speaking, reporters from various newspapers raised questions one after another, and Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun answered them separately. The content is summarized as follows:

(1) The Democratic League believes that the key to war and peace lies not in the number of seats on the National Government Committee, but in the battles in areas such as Subei, Chengde, Longhai Line, and Zhangjiakou. Although the Democratic League helped the CCP obtain one-third of the seats, it does not mean that it will always help the CCP, but it is based on right and wrong. If the Kuomintang and the Communist Party split up, the Democratic League will take an independent attitude. Because the Democratic League has no guns or soldiers, it cannot help either side. However, the Democratic League still opposes division and opposes civil war. As long as there is a day to speak, it will do its best to call for peace.

(2) The Democratic League advocates the withdrawal of US troops, but the Democratic League does not oppose the United States' charitable relief and investment in economic construction. Surplus materials and loans should be loaned after China's peaceful unification.

(3) The Democratic League opposes the May 5th Constitution Draft and believes that the constitution draft passed by the Political Consultative Conference should be reviewed by the Constitution Draft Review Committee and then recognized by various parties.

(4) The Democratic League has no bias towards the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, so it criticizes the Kuomintang more because it is the ruling party.

(5) The Democratic League believes that in the areas currently controlled by the government, there is still no freedom of parties. Otherwise, the number of members of the Democratic League must exceed the number of members of the Kuomintang or the Communist Party.

(6) Regarding the content of Liang Shuming's conversation with Petrov, Luo Longji said that he has not yet obtained detailed information, so he could not comment.

### Soviet Employees of the China Changchun Railway in Shenyang Suddenly Ordered to Retreat to Their Country; Handover Started on the 3rd

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] There will be international changes in the Northeast situation. According to various signs, it seems that this is possible. The most obvious is the retreat of Soviet employees of the China Changchun Railway Branch, including 193 people such as the Director of the Soviet Shenyang Branch, Bodekemin, and 170 White Russians. This order was brought by a secretary sent by the Soviet Embassy on the 1st. Zhang Jiaao, chairman of the China Changchun Railway, and Wang Zhuting, deputy director, tried to persuade them to stay, but Bo and others said that they were ordered and could no longer stay. Therefore, from the 3rd, Bo and others have begun to handle the handover. They can leave for Dalian around Double Ten Festival and return to their country by ship. It is reported that the small number of Soviet expatriates remaining in Shenyang will also be evacuated. When the Communist army in Changchun was about to withdraw, the Soviet expatriates were ordered to evacuate in advance. Also, at the closing ceremony of the Liaoning Administrative Conference, Chairman Xu repeatedly warned all participants that the second "September 18th Incident" was about to come.

### The Philippines Passes Anti-Chinese Bill; Signed by President Roxas; Overseas Chinese Greatly Threatened; Our Government Will Make a Serious Representation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] After the independence of the Philippines, President Roxas was elected with an exclusionary policy. Filipinos again mistakenly regarded exclusion as patriotism, and the anti-Chinese trend resurfaced. The "Manila Vegetable Market Municipal Act", the "Filipino Labor Act", the "Filipino Retailer Act" have been passed in Congress. Among them, the Filipino Labor Act stipulates that the total wages of foreign (except American) workers in any factory shall not exceed 40% of the total wages; the Filipino Retailer Act stipulates that in the total capital of any retail store, foreign shares (excluding the United States) shall not exceed 30%. These two bills are particularly unfavorable to our overseas Chinese in the Philippines, and the latter was signed and promulgated by President Roxas on the 1st of this month and has come into effect. Overseas Chinese are greatly threatened. Our government attaches great importance to this. In addition to having telegraphed Ambassador Chen Zhiping and Consul General Duan Mao to actively negotiate, it will also make a serious representation to the Philippines.

### Rumors of Exchange Rate Adjustment Are Not True; Authorities Crack Down on Black Market Trading of US Dollars; Buyers at High Prices Will Be Investigated

[Local News] The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Central Bank believe that the recent rise in the price of US dollars in the market is very high, and the situation is beyond the norm. It is obvious that illegal merchants are engaged in large-scale purchases, intending to make profits, which affects prices. It is urgent to find ways to stop it. The silver and money industry that has been approved by the Central Bank to buy and sell foreign currency is originally to facilitate the sporadic exchange of business travelers and obtain its legitimate profits, and should also rectify itself and assist in promoting the government's financial policy. After consultation with the Central Bank, the Municipal Government, in order to crack down on black market speculation in US dollars and stabilize the market, in addition to having the Silver and Money Exchange Industry Association notify the suspension of US dollar trading for three days, has also formulated three temporary measures for the purchase and sale of US dollars for compliance, which will be implemented from today:

(1) Those who are approved by the Central Bank to operate foreign currency companies shall not exceed 5% of the Central Bank's US dollar telegraphic transfer price for the purchase and sale of US dollars, and they shall not set up other names to collect fees.

(2) Old banknotes shall not be discriminated against, devalued, or rejected for the purchase and sale of US dollars.

(3) If there are large buyers who buy at high prices, the bank is allowed to secretly report to the municipal government for investigation.

The reporter recently learned from relevant sources that the Central Bank has recently been ordered to implement the purchase of foreign currency funds from various banks, and to purchase foreign currency deposit accounts, foreign currency margin accounts, and margins approved by the former Stabilization Fund Committee. For circulating US dollars, strict measures will be taken. In order to prevent the smuggling of US dollars, the authorities have reached an agreement with relevant countries on prevention and crackdown measures. It is expected that the price of US dollars on the black market will be reduced soon.

### Silver and Money Industry Association Resolves to Suspend Trading in US Dollars for Three Days

[Our Dispatch] The US dollar market situation two weeks ago was once rising in a straight line due to rumors affecting the exchange market. Although the authorities have repeatedly and resolutely denied it twice, the strong momentum of the black market US dollar has been established, and it has always been hovering around the 4,000 yuan mark. Yesterday, a certain newspaper in this city suddenly reported that the central government would make appropriate adjustments to the foreign exchange listing at any time. Various rumors in the market were rekindled, and the trend of buying US dollars became rampant. The price of US dollars soared and slammed a new high of 4,600 yuan, but the buying momentum has not slowed down. At about 10 o'clock, Wang Yuncheng, chairman of the Silver and Money Industry Association, convened an emergency board meeting to discuss emergency plans. It was decided to notify all colleagues to suspend trading in US dollars for three days from today (the 4th). In addition to sending letters for reference, it also published an announcement in the newspaper to inform the public.

The reporter then visited President Bei of the Central Bank. Bei was attending a meeting, and Secretary Lu Dingzhong received him on his behalf. He said: Bei did go to Beijing a few days ago for official business and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. He did not know the details of this trip. He said: Bei did not intend to issue any statements about the various rumors in the exchange market during the autumn of market fluctuations. According to him: The rumor that the exchange rate will be adjusted frequently may be due to the suggestions of economists, but it may not be the method formulated by the Central Committee. The person who is currently spreading this message has admitted that the source of his information is inaccurate. As for the decision of the Silver and Money Industry Association in this city to suspend the trading of US dollars for three days, it was purely the automatic decision of the association.

[Our Dispatch] Wang Yuncheng, chairman of the Silver and Money Industry Association, paid a visit to President Bei of the Central Bank at 5:30 p.m. yesterday to report on the suspension of US dollar trading.

### Import of Goods by Foreign Ships Affects the Entire Market

[Our Dispatch] It is reported that recently, due to the high price of US dollars in this city, the trend of smuggling US dollars has turned fierce. Occasionally, when ships from foreign countries carry goods, the black market US dollars fluctuate due to the settlement of purchases, which often affects the entire financial market. In order to stabilize the financial situation and take care of the people's livelihood, the authorities will definitely crack down on US dollar transactions. It is also reported that after the expiration of the suspension of US dollar trading by the Silver and Money Industry next Monday, the authorities will take a certain attitude towards US dollar transactions.

At the same time, all industrial equipment and necessities shipped to China are only to relieve China's disasters and revive China's industry and agriculture. The Chinese people are very grateful for this friendly and generous assistance that enhances China's economic and social welfare."

### Heavy Fighting Continues East of Huailai; Chen Jicheng Arrives in Nankou Yesterday; Railway Being Repaired Between Qinglongqiao and Kangzhuang

[Our Beijing Office, 4th] Due to the government's silence on the war situation on the Ping-Sui Railway, conflicting reports have been circulating for days. According to reliable sources, the National Army has not crossed Huailai. As of noon on the 4th, fierce fighting with the Communist army was still taking place in the Daziying and Maquanzi areas east of Huailai City. The Communist army has built very strong fortifications in this area, and every time they retreat from a position, they bury landmines everywhere. Mine clearing work also takes considerable time. In addition to Li Wen, Commander-in-Chief of the 34th Army Group, who is stationed in Nankou to direct the operations, Chen Gangcheng, Deputy Commander of the 11th War Zone, has also returned from eastern Hebei and arrived in Nankou on the afternoon of the 4th to take command.

### Using Over 200,000 Troops, Communist Army Launches All-Out Offensive in Shandong; Zouping Captured and Then Recaptured

[Our Jinan Office, 4th] The Communist army besieging Zouping County numbered over 40,000. The National Army defending the city consisted of only two battalions. They engaged in fierce battles with the Communist army from the evening of the 2nd. Due to being outnumbered, the city was captured by the Communist army on the evening of the 3rd. The National Army reinforced and counterattacked overnight, fighting with exceptional bravery, and recaptured Zouping on the morning of the 4th. The Communist army retreated to Jiukou northeast of Zouping, and the National Army is currently in pursuit.

[Our Jinan Office, 4th] The Communist army launched an all-out offensive on the Jiaoji Railway and on both the north and south sides, using over 200,000 troops. The National Army also reinforced and defended, inflicting heavy blows. The intensity of the fighting in the past three or four days is unprecedented in the Shandong theater. Starting on the 2nd, major battles also broke out north of the Jiaoji Railway, south of the Xiaoqing River, and near Zouping and Changshan. The main force of the Bohai Military Region, commanded by Xu Yunxiang, Commander of the 6th Military Sub-district, participated in the battle, mobilizing the main force of the concurrently held 7th Liberation Division, as well as other troops, totaling more than 27,000 men. They advanced towards Zouping City from three directions: Hanjiagzhuang north of Zouping County, Yanjiaji northwest of the city, Shangkouzhuang, and Shijiazhuang southeast of the city. The 5,000 troops in Shijiazhuang launched a fierce attack on Huangshan near the southeast of the city on the evening of the 2nd, engaging in bloody fighting with the National Army all night. On the morning of the 3rd, they reinforced and engaged in fierce battles with the National Army on the line of Lisanzhuang, Taiwangzhuang, and Yangbao. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, and fighting continued in close quarters until the afternoon. In addition, Zhao Jizhou's 7th Police Brigade of the Communist army and more than 17,000 troops from the Bohai Military Region advanced towards Changshan County from Fanchengzhuang north of Changshan County. A part of them joined the battle, but as of the afternoon of the 3rd, Zouping was still in the hands of the National Army. As for the two divisions of the Communist army that were repelled by the National Army south of Mingshui, Longshan, and Guodian stations, they were still occupying the area south and southwest of Wenzu Town, as well as Shangyouzhuang, Nanbeimingzhuang, Nanbeimiaozhuang, and Dongxicaishi on the 3rd, confronting the National Army. The Communist army's offensive has been thwarted, but they still have plans to attack the railway line again. The Communist armies of Zhangqiu and Boshan are also actively engaged. In the Jiaodong area, the Communist army launched over 40,000 troops, and fierce battles with the National Army continued in the vicinity of Jiaoxian County, with both sides suffering extremely heavy casualties.

The defending troops immediately fought back bravely, engaging in fierce battles in Feizhuang, Zaoyuan, Chenlou, and Daxiaowangzhuang, all located about five li (approximately 2.5 kilometers) east and west of Lincheng. Both sides suffered casualties, and the Communist army finally collapsed and retreated on the evening of the 2nd. Also, the Communist army in southern Shandong is currently conscripting grain on a large scale, forcibly requisitioning 10,000 jin (approximately 5,000 kilograms) of grain per village for military use.

[Our Jinan Office, 4th] The Jiaoji Railway traffic has been repeatedly damaged by the Communist army in recent days. On the 3rd, five sections were damaged in one day: Guodian to Longshan, Dalinchi to Wangcun, Mashang to Yazhuang, Yidu to Yangjiazhuang, and Yaogou to Tanjiafangzi. All were immediately repaired by the Railway Bureau. On the morning of the 4th, the Communist army again used landmines to destroy two sections of the roadbed between Mashang, Yazhuang, and Zhoucun, which were also repaired by the Railway Bureau, and traffic was restored as usual.

### Situation Improves in Northern Section of Ping-Han Railway; National Army Advances South from Songlindian; Railway Repair Work Progresses Alongside the Army

[Our Beijing Office, 4th] The situation in the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway is expected to improve rapidly. The elite troops of the National Army that arrived at Songlindian launched a counterattack starting at noon on the 4th, advancing south along both sides of the railway. By the evening, they had reached the vicinity of Dingxing Station and were engaged in fierce battles with the Communist army. Gaobeidian and Songlindian north of Dingxing have been relieved. A relevant authority stated that it is hoped that the lost territory can be quickly recovered and traffic can be restored. Repair work is progressing alongside the army. It was reported at noon on the 4th that Caohe, Xushui, and Gucheng were still in the hands of the Communist army.

[Our Baoding Office, 3rd] (Delayed) Baoding fully entered a state of war starting on the 3rd. Officials and civilians are being mobilized to build defensive fortifications in the streets and alleys. People are currently panicking, and grain prices have soared.

### Liu Bocheng Flees to Hua County

[Our Kaifeng Office, 3rd] Liu Ruming's Fourth Pacification Zone Headquarters has moved from here to western Shandong, and the threat to the Longhai Railway is gradually being lifted. Previously, the Communist army's Liu Bocheng Headquarters moved from Wu'an County and Juyanzhen to Heze, concentrating its main force to defend the Longhai Railway, while leaving militia in northern Henan. Local Red Spear Society and other militia groups rose up to resist, and towns and cities were being recovered daily.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 4th] According to information, the Communist leader Liu Bocheng, who was defeated in Heze and went missing for a time, lost contact with his main force because the Communist army headquarters was surrounded by the National Army at that time. Liu led only a few guards and broke through the encirclement, fleeing to Juancheng. On the 2nd, he reassembled more than 500 of his officers and soldiers in that county and gave them a speech, urging his subordinates to continue serving Yan'an. That day, he fled towards Hua County.

### National Army Enters Handan

A total of 1,030,000 Japanese nationals have been repatriated from the Northeast (including 45,370 from the Communist-controlled areas). According to statistics, there were approximately 2 million Japanese nationals in the Northeast in the past. There are still 350,000 people waiting to be repatriated in Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian, which is being negotiated with the Soviet Union. There are still 110,000 to 150,000 people in the Communist-controlled areas who have not been repatriated, and approximately 500,000 people are prisoners of war in a certain country.

It is reported that the total budget will reach over 530 billion, and the most important task will be to strengthen the major highways in the Jiangnan region to meet first-class standards. After completion, the speed of vehicles traveling on these highways can reach 60 kilometers per hour. This item alone will cost nearly 360 billion. In addition, the Highway Bureau is implementing a downsizing policy. The head office will cut 51 people, and local branch offices have also been ordered to reduce staff.

### Strange Phenomenon After Inter-Regional Remittances Between Inside and Outside the Passes: Only Remittances Out, No Remittances In; Imperfect Measures Create a Climate of Speculation

[Our Shenyang Office, 3rd] After inter-regional remittances between inside and outside the passes were implemented, several strange phenomena immediately occurred. First, tens of millions of circulation notes flowed into the passes, while not a single penny was remitted in. Second, several banks handling remittances were lined with seven or eight hundred speculators as early as four or five in the morning, resulting in civil servants being unable to remit their family expenses. The reason is that by remitting 1,000 yuan of circulation notes to inside the passes, one can receive 11,500 yuan of legal tender, which is 2,400-2,500 yuan more than buying on the black market in Shenyang. If one remits 10,000 yuan of legal tender from inside the passes to the Northeast through the bank, one can receive 800 yuan of circulation notes in Shenyang. It is even more profitable to buy gold in Beiping and bring it to the Northeast. The price of gold in Shenyang is 29,500 yuan per puppet Manchurian yuan, which can earn approximately 10,000 yuan of circulation notes. That is, bringing 10,000 yuan of legal tender to the Northeast can buy 1,100 yuan of circulation notes. This imperfect remittance measure must be urgently rectified, otherwise the climate of speculation will become increasingly intense.

### Government to Regulate Yarn Prices; Nine-Member Committee of the Legislative Yuan Discussed Yesterday; Each Piece to Be Maintained at 1.5 Million

[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] The nine-member committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting at 2:30 p.m. on the 4th, attended by Zhang Zhaoyuan, Zhu Qinglin, Sun Jiulu, and others, to discuss the issue of regulating yarn prices. Minister Wang Yunwu of the Ministry of Economic Affairs attended to report and studied the measures for a long time. Finally, Wang stated that it would be more appropriate to maintain the yarn price at 1.55 million per piece through distribution methods. If commercial yarn factories do not comply, the government will make a serious statement. The discussion lasted until 4 p.m. When the reporter interviewed Sun Jiulu, the original proposer, about the discussion, he said: The conditions of people's livelihood are nothing more than clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The importance of clothing is second only to food. Over 70% of our country is farmers. Farmers have always used rice as the standard for commodity prices, and the price of one shi (approximately 59 liters) of rice was higher than the price of one pi (bolt) of cloth before the Anti-Japanese War. Now, the price of one pi of cloth is more than four times higher than the price of one shi of rice. At present, we should still find ways to restore the previous price in order to maintain people's livelihood. Before June of this year, the price of each piece of 20-count yarn was approximately 1.2 million. Based on its cost, using three and a half dan (approximately 175 kilograms) of American cotton would cost approximately 350,000, and labor costs would be approximately 250,000, so each piece should not exceed 600,000. However, it sells for only half the price, and the American cotton used is purchased from the Xingzong, which is priced lower than the market price, and the cost can be reduced further. Xingzong has sold a total of 1.5 million dan of American cotton. In this way, not only has it failed to help the people, but it has also made the people wear expensive cloth and facilitated yarn merchants to obtain exorbitant profits. This phenomenon is truly incomprehensible. In recent days, the price of American cotton has been slightly higher, at approximately 220,000 per dan. After the Shanghai power supply measures were adjusted, the cost has also increased. The cost of each piece of 20-count yarn is estimated to be three and a half dan of American cotton, totaling 770,000, factory costs approximately 450,000, and depreciation 100,000, totaling no more than 1.32 million. However, the selling price on October 1, such as 20-count special double horse, reached 2.1 million, and although the profit is slightly less than in June, it is still around 60% with proper management. Based on the above reasons, yarn prices should be regulated according to the actual cost plus legitimate profits, which can directly affect farmers and prevent the continued rise in rice prices, and indirectly stabilize general commodity prices and wages. Therefore, yarn price regulation is absolutely necessary to decide immediately.

### Yarn Price Surge in Hankou Stabilizes

[Our Hankou Office, 4th] In order to strengthen business connections, the yarn factories here have initiated the establishment of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Yarn Weaving Industry Association with yarn factories in Jiujiang and Changsha. Also, the yarn price surge has now stabilized.

### Clean-Up Team's Beijing-Jiangsu Group in Suzhou; Reports Work Guidelines; Hopes All Sectors Will Provide More Input

[Our Suzhou Office, 4th] The Reception and Clean-Up Team's Beijing-Jiangsu Group held a symposium at 4 p.m. on the 4th at the Enemy Property Office of the Jiangsu Branch, attended by the county's party, government, and military leaders, local figures, the press, and related reception agencies, totaling over 40 units. First, chief He Mingzhong delivered an introductory speech, and then team leader Fan Yu stood up to report on future work guidelines, divided into seven points: (1) Collect original inventories; (2) Complete a property catalog to assist in the development of construction; (3) Return civilian properties that have already been improperly received from enemy and puppet industries as soon as possible to alleviate the suffering of the people of Suzhou; (4) Accurately determine the total amount of materials currently received and stored; (5) Investigate whether the division of military supplies and non-military supplies is in accordance with government regulations; (6) Investigate whether reception agencies have reported more than they received or engaged in concealment and other corrupt practices; (7) Investigate whether reception agencies have refused to hand over assets and whether there are illegal phenomena in the Disposal Bureau. It is hoped that all sectors will provide more input, and that the team will absolutely not harbor prejudices and will handle matters impartially. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m. It is learned that team leader Fan and his party are scheduled to inspect various reception warehouses and factories on the 5th, and will conduct a thorough investigation of the secretly controlled letters they have received.

### Mrs. Cripps Discusses Purpose of Coming to China; To Organize a Permanent Aid-China Institution

[British Information Services, London, 3rd] Mrs. Cripps, on the eve of her departure from England to China, told reporters that the policy of the United Aid to China Fund has no political or religious color. After arriving in China, she will inspect all the activities of the association and hopes to visit the Communist-controlled areas. The association has already laid a common foundation for cooperation with China, but the organizational form cannot remain as it is permanently. A permanent institution must be organized and established. Therefore, another important purpose of this trip is to discuss the organization of this permanent institution with Madame Chiang Kai-shek, which can further strengthen the friendship between China and Britain. Mrs. Cripps also stated that she hopes to stay in China for six weeks.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 4th] Our government will send a special plane to Hong Kong to welcome Mrs. Cripps to the capital. She will arrive in Hong Kong on the _____th.

### United States Relinquishes Privileges in China; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Publicizes Exchange of Cables

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today publicized the exchange of cables between Italian Prime Minister Gaspari and Minister Wang Shijie regarding the Italian government's relinquishment of extraterritorial rights and concessions in China and the reaffirmation of friendly relations between the two countries. The cables are recorded as follows:

Cable from Italian Prime Minister to Minister Wang: Minister, Your Excellency: As the Paris Peace Conference approves the draft treaty provisions relating to your country, I wish to make a special statement that Italy's relinquishment of its extraterritorial rights and concessions in China, although included in the treaty, is entirely voluntary on the part of the Italian government. My government has already notified your government of this intention, which I believe you have noted. I take this opportunity to reaffirm to you that our action is indeed in line with the policy pursued by democratic Italy, which aims to establish relations with your country on the basis of true friendship and mutual trust. Gaspari. Cable from Minister Wang in Reply to Italian Prime Minister: Prime Minister, Your Excellency: I am deeply grateful for your cable transmitted by your country's embassy in China on September 30th of this year. The Chinese government is fully aware of the fact that Italy intended to relinquish its extraterritorial rights and concessions in China even before the relevant clauses were introduced into the draft treaty. I take this opportunity to reaffirm to Your Excellency that China is also willing to establish friendly relations with democratic Italy on the basis of mutual understanding and trust. Wang Shijie, October 2, Year 35.

### The Truth About the CCP's Anti-Americanism Fully Exposed in Secret Documents

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 3rd] An agency here recently seized a secret document, "Instructions on Anti-American Work," issued by the Propaganda Department of the Peiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to party committees at all levels and all party members, based on the CCP Central Committee's "July 1st Decision." In this document, the CCP frankly stated that launching the anti-American movement was "for the benefit of the world proletariat," because the United States is essentially a capitalist country. Therefore, although the United States participated in World War II, "the United States is replacing fascism with fascism." Now, a new anti-fascist war is about to begin, and this arduous task falls on the Chinese Communist Party again. "Therefore, an anti-American movement must be launched extensively." It is evident that the CCP's anti-American movement has even greater ambitions. The original text is recorded as follows:

Instructions on Work Concerning the United States: Based on the current domestic and international situation, American imperialism has already taken off its mask. For the sake of countering all conspiracies of American imperialism and for the benefit of the Chinese people and the world proletariat, we must immediately address this situation, determine the direction of our struggle, actively strike at the United States, isolate the Kuomintang reactionaries, and unite the broad masses of the people around our party. The Peiping Municipal Committee, based on the wise "July 1st Decision" of our party's Central Committee, instructs party committees at all levels and all party members as follows:

(1) We must clearly recognize that the United States is essentially a capitalist country. This fundamental nature determines all its policies. No matter how loudly it shouts about democracy, it will never be able to shed its imperialist face. Although it was an organizer of the anti-fascist world war, there are very clear differences between it and its ally, the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union aims to eliminate fascism, establish world peace, and ultimately seek the liberation of all mankind. The United States aims to replace fascist forces with its own, grasp world hegemony. We only need to look at the various facts in the German occupied zones and in Japan under [U.S.] control, which show the maintenance of fascist remnants, turning them into a "future force" under American protection. This proves that the United States will inherit the mantle of fascism and inevitably become the leader threatening human peace in future wars. This is why the whole world is still trapped in the terror of a "Third World War." This is the threat to human peace posed by the reactionary American capitalists.

(2) The United States and the Kuomintang reactionaries have had inseparable blood ties from beginning to end. This is because of their common capitalist essence. In order to seize the vast and fertile land of Northeast China and occupy 70 percent of the industrial equipment in the Northeast, the United States does not hesitate to aid the Kuomintang army in attacking the Northeast. The "Military Aid to China Act" recently proposed by Byrnes to Congress, to train one million Kuomintang troops, indicates that the United States is directly helping the Kuomintang to wage a civil war. There is no contradiction between the United States openly helping the Kuomintang to wage a civil war and sending Marshall to mediate the civil war. Marshall's mediation is precisely helping the Kuomintang. Hurley did not understand this principle and wanted to openly launch a Chinese civil war. He was opposed by American progressives and the Chinese people and stepped down. Marshall then adopted a different approach, but he will never abandon the American position of launching a Chinese civil war. Strictly speaking, Hurley was rather frank, while Marshall is more cunning. We must clearly recognize that all mediation is empty talk. Our party and our army will never be deceived by Marshall's mediation. We should be more vigilant in the future and not numbly hope for American mediation.

(3) The current situation is very urgent. Our party and the people of the whole country are encountering a serious crisis. A large-scale civil war is sooner or later inevitable. For the survival of our party and our army and for the benefit of the proletariat, we must attack all reactionary forces at home and abroad. First, we should educate the people of the whole country about the conspiracies of American imperialists. The following are the guiding principles for anti-American imperialism propaganda: (1) Our cadres at all levels must first mobilize within the party to make all our party members ideologically aware of the current crisis, transform their previous mentality of treating the United States as an ally, and educate the masses and themselves to deeply recognize the reactionary face of American imperialism. Stop the erroneous mentality of trying to rely on Marshall's mediation for peace. Re-arm one's own mind and oppose the mentality of seeking temporary ease and good fortune. Further propagandize to the masses that the United States is already assisting China's civil war under a false mask. Let all mediation and delays go to hell. We can only mobilize the people to prepare for a new anti-fascist democratic war to defend the fruits of victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. This task of propaganda must first be done well within the party to educate ourselves in order to ensure the effectiveness of propaganda work among the masses. (2) Use all means to call on the people to oppose American imperialism's aggression against China and its conspiracy to fuel China's civil war. Fully expose all facts of American aggression and illegal acts. Tear down the "hypocritical mask" of the United States in front of the masses. Today, the people of Peiping have only recently been liberated from the iron hooves of the Japanese and have deep hatred for foreigners. Although the Japanese have left, they have been replaced by the Americans. We should also transplant the people of Peiping's hatred of the Japanese to the Americans, making the masses look at the Americans with the eyes of the Japanese, that is, replacing the Japanese with the Americans. All propaganda work, in addition to verbally or in writing propagandizing to all levels as much as possible, should pay special attention to the viewpoints and different interests of each social class and use them separately. In organs where party cells exist in various schools, try to establish individual connections with the Democratic League and launch democracy from the standpoint of a third party, which will be even more effective. Propaganda should also be linked to facts and should also be coordinated with propaganda work to launch direct anti-American actions by the masses: (A) Because of American assistance, civil war is bound to break out and the whole of China will fall into chaos. The general public is bound to experience the hardships of life, as they did for the past eight years, because of American aggression. The public should be called upon to immediately take action to stop the American conspiracy and to expose the atrocities of American "aid to China" to the people at any time. The facts of American troops oppressing compatriots, insulting Chinese women, military vehicles running rampant, and injuring citizens should be announced to the people at any time, and the masses should be gathered as much as possible in the streets, theaters, restaurants, and dance halls to stop the illegal acts of American troops, creating a demonstration of people's actions to raise anti-American sentiment. (B) Call on workers, national capitalists, merchants, educators, and students to point out the ambition of American economic aggression to strangle Chinese industry, which will bankrupt Chinese industrialists, cause workers to lose their jobs, education to decline, and students to drop out of school. The various classes of Peiping city should be mobilized to stop the American conspiracy through strikes, market closures, and school strikes. (C) Use all possible means to penetrate the Kuomintang army, carry out propaganda, and fully expose the conspiracy of American "military aid to China," pointing out that the United States is using Chinese people to fight a civil war, mobilizing them to put down their guns and oppose the civil war. (D) With regard to American military and civilians, point out the errors of the reactionary American policy, call for a movement of American soldiers to return home, and correct their positive view of the Kuomintang, so as to create contradictions between the Kuomintang and the American people and isolate the Kuomintang, and create contradictions among the American people themselves and isolate the warmongers. The application of this method is multifaceted. We must divide, strike at, win over, and strive to use them to make those Americans in Peiping who do not fully understand the Chinese national conditions waver and become unstable under our policies.

Comrades and cadres at all levels: Our anti-fascist war is about to begin. This arduous task falls on the Chinese Communist Party again. For the bright future of our party, we must extensively develop the current "oppose American imperialism" movement.

Editorial

### Removing Artificial Obstacles in the Economy

In the year since the victory, China's national economy has been in a state of upheaval due to the domestic political unrest. Recently, this economic crisis has become even more profound. As the center of the national economy, Shanghai, first had a petition delegation composed of industrial and commercial representatives petitioning in the capital, and then a petition delegation of the Shanghai Municipal Council representing the public opinion of Shanghai petitioning in the capital. We are paying attention to the economic crisis facing Shanghai and even the whole country, and we hope for government relief. Our government, from Chairman [Chiang] down, has been able to respect public opinion and agree to consider and implement the various points raised by the petition delegations. During the talks between President Soong and the petition delegations, Soong also pointed out that finance and economy are closely related. If there is no solution to finance, it is difficult to improve the economy. Conversely, the situation is the same. Soong also pointed out that the general public blames the government for only focusing on finance and neglecting the economy, but this is not entirely true. If the situation were clarified, the economy would have improved long ago. All this shows the current crux of the matter, that is, the deepening of the current economic difficulties is due to the failure to clarify the Chinese political situation. The government respects public opinion and widely adopts the situation. We firmly believe that it will be able to address both the root cause and the symptoms in order to solve the current economic difficulties, so that our national economic life will become more abundant and vibrant.

While we are working hard to solve the current economic difficulties, we see the following reports: (1) According to news reports, the Hong Kong government sent the Deputy Controller of the Industrial and Commercial Supplies Department to Japan to discuss the shipment of Japanese yarn and cloth to Hong Kong. He has now returned to Hong Kong and summoned the persons in charge of the Pito Trade Association to discuss the matter. He also brought back hundreds of types of cloth samples from Japan for the Pito merchants to choose and purchase. (2) The Guangzhou Yarn and Cloth Trade Union sent a telegram to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for sympathy and assistance regarding the Executive Yuan's passage of restrictions on the shipment of yarn and cloth to Fujian and Guangdong. They appealed to the government to withdraw the order so that materials can be exchanged and needs can be met. (3) Industrial and commercial floating capital fled to Hong Kong, reaching tens of billions of yuan in recent months. Recently, a Shandong man registered with the Hong Kong government to establish a business company with a capital of 800 million Hong Kong dollars. The above three news items may not be valued by the world in this time of domestic and international turmoil, but their inherent meaning can really make us think deeply.

Today, when the Japanese invaders have been defeated, our national textile industry should replace the original position of the Japanese textile industry. It is only because the government does not have a complete and comprehensive policy on how to develop the national economy that even if there are excellent plans or ideals, they are often like drawing a cake to satisfy hunger. This is mostly due to the failure to clarify the domestic situation, resulting in the failure to implement some plans that have been considered several times; but it seems unfair to attribute all responsibility to the failure to clarify the situation. Even under the current situation where the situation has not been clarified, the government should make every effort to make our immature and troubled national industry more vibrant. At present, my country's textile industry is showing a deformed prosperity due to the special circumstances, but from the perspective of the national economy, this may not necessarily be a healthy sign. According to the recent statement made by President Soong to the Shanghai Municipal Council's petition delegation, the situation in South China is better at present, while North China is affected by transportation obstruction and transportation cannot be smooth. We do not understand why there is another artificial obstacle in South China, where the situation is better, to make production and trade stagnate? Indeed, the difficulties currently placed on the Chinese national economy due to artificial obstacles may be even greater than the failure to clarify the situation. The prevalence of high interest rates, unfair tax burdens, and the construction of trade barriers are all artificial factors, and it seems impermissible to completely shift them to the political situation.

In order to make our national economy recover, we should first eliminate these artificial factors. Because of these artificial obstacles, we see the escape of funds and the shrinking of production and trade. Under such circumstances, it will be inevitable for Japanese industry to regain its pre-war market and position. If we lose this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, the future development of our national economy will be more severely hit. In order to preserve a bit of vitality for the country, we call on you: quickly remove these artificial obstacles!

### Control of Atomic Energy

The United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission continued its general assembly on the 2nd at Lake Success in New York. The chairman of the commission, Dr. Hsia Chin-lin, the representative of our country, reminded the representatives of various countries at the beginning of the discussion, saying: "No important achievements have been made in previous meetings, so in the future we must enter practical issues from general principles and achieve results." Then he put forward a suggestion that effective measures should be taken to resolve the differences of opinion between the countries. These words came from the mouth of Dr. Hsia Chin-lin, the representative of our country and also the chairman of the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission, which is enough to symbolize the lofty spirit of our country and should win the admiration of the general public.

Since the US military dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, mankind has entered a new era. The use of atomic energy can bring infinite happiness to mankind, and it can also destroy the entire human race and the civilization it has created. Regarding how to control the use of atomic energy, because Britain, the United States, and Canada jointly worked on the manufacture of atomic bombs during the war, while the Soviet Union did not participate, they hold different views. In fact, the use of atomic energy, like other scientific inventions, is originally the accumulation of research by scientists from various countries, and there is no secret here. Only in the manufacture of atomic bombs, there may be some technical problems that are not generally known to scientists. Because the Soviet Union did not participate in the manufacture of atomic bombs, and the use of atomic bombs will completely change future wars, the Soviet Union advocates prohibiting the manufacture and use of atomic energy weapons, and must destroy the existing atomic energy weapon materials within three months. The reasons for the proposal of this proposal are naturally obvious, and its failure to be accepted by Britain and the United States is naturally expected. In Britain and the United States, what they emphasize is control rather than abolition, which is fundamentally incompatible with the Soviet Union's views. Because of this difference of opinion, the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission has repeatedly convened meetings, and no agreement has been reached. Under this situation, we are happy to hear the instructions of Dr. Hsia Chin-lin, the representative of our country and the chairman of the conference. Our country did not actually participate in the manufacture of atomic bombs, and the situation is the same as that of the Soviet Union. Because there are different opinions on the control of atomic energy, with the transcendent position of our country, we sincerely hope to shorten the distance between the differences of opinion and be able to obtain valuable agreements on the control of atomic energy.

However, the reason why there are differences of opinion on the control of atomic energy is of course not in the atomic energy itself, but should be sought elsewhere. The control of atomic energy is only regarded as a ball for everyone to kick around. Prohibiting the use of atomic energy is like refusing to eat for fear of choking, which does not seem to be a good solution. Because the use of atomic energy can also bring infinite happiness to mankind. Therefore, we should control the use of atomic energy at this time, so that the use of atomic energy can be transformed from the aspect of destruction to the aspect of increasing human happiness, which is the true meaning of creation and the progress of mankind.

Therefore, on the 27th of last month, they held a cadre meeting in Xihua Township, the third district under Suzhou's jurisdiction, and decided on the following future policies: (1) The unit will be dispersed among the villages, hiding their targets from today onwards; (2) Intensify intelligence gathering; (3) The collected public grain will be distributed back to the residents in the mobile areas to gain public goodwill, obtain cooperation, and launch political maneuvers to adapt to the situation.

### New Atmosphere on the Streets of Suzhou; Military Discipline Rectified, Stragglers Disappear

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Recently, within and outside the city of Suzhou, there have been stragglers who openly wear military uniforms and use the names of military agencies or units to cause trouble. Some have seized civilian houses, some have brutally beaten peddlers, and some have even used their military status to swindle and deceive, doing everything they can. However, the local authorities have not taken measures to crack down on them, allowing these people to run rampant and recklessly, leaving the people with no way to complain, comparable to the greatest pain after victory. Since the Paratrooper Corps stationed in Suzhou, and after repeated calls from the media urging attention, the city defense headquarters recently convened a meeting of relevant local agencies and commanders of various garrison units to discuss countermeasures. It was decided that, starting from the 1st of this month, in addition to deploying patrol cars to patrol the busy thoroughfares and Hengtian and the city defense headquarters, combined inspection teams of military police would patrol the remote alleys at all times. At the same time, sentry posts of military police and paratroopers would be added at key passages to be responsible for inspecting passing soldiers.

Those with untidy uniforms, improper behavior, no badges or expired symbols, and those in plain clothes carrying firearms will be warned for the first three days. After three days, strict crackdowns will be carried out. Those who impersonate soldiers or cause incidents will be detained and punished according to the circumstances. Since the implementation of these measures in recent days, the stragglers who used to flood the streets have disappeared, and the atmosphere on the streets of Suzhou has been renewed.

### Changjiangbu Accepts Bribery; Petty Officers Are Audacious and Reckless

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 3rd] Miao Peicheng and He Hanwen, members of the Hunan-Hubei Suppression Corps, recently returned from Changjiangbu in Yingcheng after investigating the case. They told reporters about the investigation into the military's theft and sale of supplies: The corps had previously received a confidential report:

Worth 2 Billion Dollars

"Changjiangbu in Yingcheng County is an important town on the Hankou-Yichang Road. During the occupation, the enemy built barracks and stored a large amount of supplies there. After the enemy surrendered, the first to enter the town to take over were Sun Ziyan, the battalion commander, Jin Shixiang, the company commander, and Chen Dazhen, etc., of the Engineer Battalion of the 75th Army. According to local people, the supplies received were worth at least 2 billion dollars. The battalion has been stealing and selling these supplies for more than a year. Although the troops have long since departed, they have still set up a guard post to continue stealing and selling supplies. The people responsible for this are manager Zhao Yizhao and platoon leader Yu Lishan. Recently, as the supplies are about to be stolen and sold out, they have even demolished houses and sold the materials to local people." After receiving the news, the corps immediately sent members Miao Peicheng and He Hanwen to Changjiangbu on the 2nd of this month, along with Yao Chongxian, a prosecutor from the Military Law Department of the Executive Yuan, and military police, to conduct an on-site investigation. They returned to Hankou tonight after completing their work. The results of the investigation: (1) Regarding the concealment, theft, sale, and destruction of enemy supplies: (A) There are 15 motor wooden boats parked on the river surface on the outskirts of the town, and several of them have already been broken and sunk in the water. A closer inspection reveals that the markings on these ships are all enemy-made, but the battalion has abandoned them for a long time, allowing them to be destroyed, without reporting or repairing them. There is a serious suspicion that they intentionally abandoned the received supplies, and according to local people, these eleven motor wooden boats existed when the enemy was there, and the battalion is suspected of concealing the received enemy supplies and failing to report them. (B) There are many scattered supplies stored in the guard post of the Engineer Battalion. Among them, the more important ones that are obviously left by the enemy include five folding boats, three folding boat motors, one crane, and more than 30 barrels of various oils for vehicles and ships, stored in a total of eleven rooms.

### Private Sales Confirmed

(C) Regarding the theft, sale, and transportation of all received supplies, Yu Lishan claimed that they were transported to the warehouse of the Lianyutao Division in Wuchang for storage, but there is no clear record of how much has been transported. As for the continued private sale of daily necessities in the town, many local people confirmed that this was indeed the case. (2) Regarding the demolition of houses, according to the investigation, the barracks built by the enemy in Changjiangbu were originally intact, and the underground was paved with floors and Japanese tatami mats. Since the battalion was stationed there, they have been dismantling them one after another. By the time it was officially handed over to the Changjiangpu Township Office, not only were the floors and tatami mats all gone, but most of the houses were also badly damaged. As of the time of the inspection, there were still many disassembled timbers stored in one room. Based on the evidence, the guard post privately demolished the barracks and sold the materials for profit without a doubt. In addition, when members Miao and He arrived at the location for investigation, the place was in a mess and no one was in charge. After several attempts to find Yu Lishan, the platoon leader in charge of the post, for questioning, Yu Lishan was playing cards with his colleagues, saying that he could not come until he finished playing. It was determined that Yu Lishan and others not only disregarded the law, but also openly obstructed official duties. Therefore, Yao Chongxian, the prosecutor from the Military Law Department of the Executive Yuan, arrested them on the spot and sent them to the Military Law Department of the Executive Yuan for interrogation on the same day. It is reported that in addition to the gambling part of the case involving platoon leader Yu Lishan and three others, which has been investigated by the Military Law Department, Sun Ziyan, the battalion commander, Jin Shixiang, the company commander, Chen Dazhen, and Zhao Yizhao, the manager, of the 75th Engineer Battalion, all have their respective responsibilities. The entire case was submitted to the Wuhan Executive Yuan for approval yesterday.

### Two Members of the Investigation Corps Go to Dinghai for Investigation

Petrified Suburban Transportation

Although the public transportation situation in this city is not entirely satisfactory, the number of public vehicles in the central area has increased to a considerable number. However, public transportation in the suburbs and slightly remote areas has not yet developed. In particular, many residents live in areas such as the city center, which had many residents before the war and was once the hub of the New Shanghai Construction Plan. Many pre-war residents now hope to return to their original homes, but they dare not do so because of inconvenient transportation and insecure public security. Before the war, there were vehicles of the Huashang Public Automobile Company running, connecting the routes from Beizhan, Sheng Baoshan Road, Jiangwan Road, and Xiti Yu Hui Road with the central area (former concession), which was convenient for residents. People moved to the city center, resulting in the emerging scene before the war. Even during the Japanese occupation, there were public vehicles running, and there was even a so-called "Emerging Station" established. Unexpectedly, one year after the victory, not only has the transportation before the war not been restored, but even the scale that the Japanese had already established has disappeared, which is regrettable. A few days ago, it was heard that the Public Utilities Bureau ordered the British Public Automobile Company to resume operations immediately and respond before November, but they are tight-lipped about the resumption of operations of the Huashang Public Automobile Company. Several months ago, it was reported that Manager Wang of the company returned to China from the United States to plan the resumption of the company's operations, but there has been no follow-up, for some reason. At a time when there is a serious housing shortage in the city and the authorities are encouraging pre-war residents to return and rebuild their homes, it is not known whether any measures have been taken to establish the prerequisite of transportation.

Issue National Identity Cards Quickly!

We are a group of refugees from Huai'an in northern Jiangsu, living in Changzhou for more than a year. Last month, the National Army entered our hometown of Huai'an, and we were preparing to pack our bags and return home by a detour. We received a letter from a friend in Xuzhou, saying that there were no other accidents along the way under the protection of our National Army, but to take a car from Xuzhou, you must carry a national identity card to board the car, and the inspection is very strict. However, national identity cards are only issued in the three major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Zhenjiang, and the counties along the Beijing-Shanghai line have not yet started. The number of refugees in various counties is not small. Who does not miss their hometown? I hope that the administrative officials of the various counties will immediately process the certificates so that the fellow countrymen who have been displaced can return to their homes and reunite with their families as soon as possible.

A Good School, But No Place to Live!

I remember that more than two months ago, in order to take the entrance examination for Jiaotong University, I lived the most tense and hardest life of my life, preparing my lessons day and night for a whole month. Under the scorching heat, I endured many hardships along the way, and I was fortunate enough to be admitted to Industrial Management from Yixing. At that time, I was extremely excited because this was a small reward I had received from hard work!

But unfortunately, something else happened. On the enrollment advertisement of Jiaotong University, didn't it say "All admitted freshmen must live on campus"? In the past, I had imagined that the authorities of Jiaotong University might be able to find a way to make it easier, but now? It's just a pipe dream. How can I, who am so poor that I don't even have gold scraps, solve this accommodation problem that requires gold bars as a condition? Seeing the tall buildings, I am troubled by this difficult situation!

I think that of the 792 students admitted by Jiaotong University, except for a very small number of students living in Shanghai, all are anxious about this lack of residence. We don't want to be forced to abandon our studies because of this small difficulty of not having a place to live, so we hope that people from all walks of life who care about students can give us an appropriate solution. (Shi Zengyao, student from Yixing)

[News Agency] Paris, 4th (Broadcast): Molotov, the Soviet representative to the Paris Peace Conference, flew back to Moscow for the second time today to consult with Stalin. However, he is expected to return to Paris next week to chair the plenary session of the Peace Conference. This trip by Mr. Molotov has sparked speculation about a possible summit between Stalin, Attlee, and Truman in the near future.

[News Agency] London, 4th (Broadcast): Byrnes met with Bevin today to discuss the procedures for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held next month.

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The recent demands from unofficial sources in the United States and Britain to revise their policies towards the Soviet Union have led diplomats here to study two issues: whether Britain is brewing a revision of its relations with the United States and the Soviet Union, and whether Britain is about to act as an intermediary between the United States and the Soviet Union. Former British Foreign Secretary Eden once advocated repairing relations with the Soviet Union in a new spirit and with new approaches. The day after Eden's speech, Soviet Chairman Stalin expressed his welcome. Recently, some British newspapers have supported Eden's proposal, and many have severely criticized the United States for continuing to pursue a tough policy towards the Soviet Union, even saying that US Secretary of State Byrnes has gone too far. For example, the London or Times newspaper stated that Eden and Stalin's mutual responses are timely signals to restore the public's desire for stable relations. However, despite such calls in London, British officials in Washington firmly stated that the country's government does not intend to change its foreign policy, saying that the calls in London are just political maneuvers, and that even if Eden becomes Foreign Secretary again, it will not cause a major change in British foreign policy.

### Peace Conference Procedures: Four Foreign Ministers Have Decided; General Assembly to Convene Tomorrow to Review Committee Reports; Each Delegation's Speech Limited to Thirty Minutes

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 4th] The four foreign ministers held a meeting last night to discuss the final procedures for the peace conference's plenary session. Guo Fengqi, the deputy head of the Chinese delegation to the peace conference, originally intended to represent Foreign Minister Wang Shijie but did not attend at the request of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Molotov believed that the meeting was only to discuss procedural matters, so it was better to hold a meeting of the four foreign ministers instead of the originally scheduled meeting of the five foreign ministers. The Secretary-General of the Peace Conference, French representative Mr. Dubar, also attended the meeting as he was responsible for drafting the procedures. The meeting was chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, who mentioned a letter from the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak. Byrnes will consult with Spaak on the procedures for the peace conference. The four foreign ministers decided that the peace conference's plenary session should review the five-nation peace treaties in accordance with the procedures adopted at the previous Moscow Conference. The reports of the various committees of the peace conference shall be reviewed according to the following procedures: first, political reports; second, military reports; and third, economic reports. The four foreign ministers further decided, in accordance with Spaak's suggestion, not to review the original texts of the treaties with a clause-by-clause approach, but to conduct a comprehensive review. Amendments passed by the various specialized committees shall be reviewed according to the following procedures: first, amendments passed by a two-thirds or more majority; and second, amendments passed by a simple majority. No delegation may submit new amendments, and each delegation's speech is limited to thirty minutes. At the same time, the peace conference is scheduled to hold a plenary session at 4:00 PM on the 6th to discuss and approve the procedures drafted by Secretary-General Dubar. The review of the treaty with Italy will then begin and is expected to be completed within three days. It is hoped that the treaties with the remaining four countries can be reviewed and completed within four days. The peace conference may conclude its work before the deadline of the 15th of this month.

### Discussion on Compensation Issues: The Soviet Union Attacks the United States Again

[Reported by this newspaper] Paris, 4th broadcast: As the work of the peace conference committee comes to an end, the Soviet Union has once again launched a furious attack on the United States, accusing the United States of undermining the four-power agreement and attempting to obtain economic privileges from Italy. After Molotov flew to Moscow, Soviet representative Arutyunyan led the speech. When discussing the Australian proposal to organize a special compensation committee to handle Italian reparations, with the U.S. representative as chairman, Arutyunyan launched a major attack, stating that the United States' unilateral abandonment of seeking compensation from Italy would give the United States "special powers" if the United States served as chairman. When the committee passed the proposal by a vote of twelve to eight, Arutyunyan vigorously criticized the United States for violating the four-power agreement that the draft peace treaty could not be amended.

### Military Committee's All-Night Meeting: Final Report Passed

[Reported by this newspaper] Paris, 4th broadcast: The Peace Conference Military Committee held a meeting that lasted nine hours and fifty-five minutes, and this morning submitted its final report on the military aspects of the five-nation peace treaties.

The six dissenting votes were cast by the Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. The Soviet bloc most strongly opposed the recommendations for the complete demilitarization of Bulgaria along the Greek border in Thrace, and the prohibition of Bulgaria from possessing minesweepers.

### Soviet Union Proposes Issue of International Armed Forces

[United Press, Lake Success, USA, 4th] General Keane, head of the United States delegation to the Military Staff Committee of the United Nations, declared today that the Soviet representative had recently proposed the organization of international armed forces, breaking the stagnant situation of the committee since May. Keane's remarks were made after the Security Council of the United Nations submitted a report to the United Nations General Assembly. It is said that the Military Staff Committee has been at a standstill since the spring because the Soviet Union has failed to provide opinions jointly with the United States, Britain, France, China, and other countries. According to reports, the meetings of the Military Staff Committee have been extremely confidential since its meeting in March, and Keane's remarks today are the first to directly mention the situation. The Military Staff Committee was ordered by the Security Council to meet and discuss the plan to organize international armed forces. According to the report of the Security Council, the United States, Britain, China, and France submitted proposals separately before the deadline of April 3, but the Soviet Union stated that it was not yet prepared to submit any constructions until July 15. According to the final decision, countries around the world will not permanently hand over their military forces to the United Nations, but they can be lent to the United Nations for use, or be subject to the Security Council's dispatch.

### Japan's Adoption of the Southern Advance Policy Intended to Prevent German Ambitions

Contained in the Report of the Former German Ambassador to Siam

[United Press, Tokyo, 4th dispatch] The International Tribunal today read out the report of the former German Ambassador to Siam to his home country in July 1941, proving that Japan originally intended to attack the Soviet Union, but suddenly changed its plans and implemented the Southern Advance Policy. It is said that Japan initially planned to occupy the coastal provinces of Soviet Northern Sakhalin and other areas. As Japan had no hope of conquering China, the military authorities decided to cease operations, while controlling the coastal strongholds of China and the Kwantung Army implemented the Northern Advance Policy. If Japan attacked the Soviet Union, the United States would not join the war. However, ten days later, Japan changed its plans and notified its military attachés abroad, stating that it would stop Britain and the United States from hindering Japan's expansion of its power, and with the support of Germany and Italy, it would occupy Vietnam as a military springboard. The next step was to issue an ultimatum to the Dutch East Indies, and the Japanese Navy occupied Singapore, taking on an important mission. The above evidence was presented by the French prosecutor to prove that Japan was deeply concerned that Germany wanted to occupy the South Pacific markets, so before Germany could conquer Britain, it rushed to occupy Vietnam as a control point.

### Shanghai Circles Mourn Li and Wen; Speaker Pan Speaks at the Assembly; Elaborates on the True Meaning of Democracy; Strives to Achieve Peaceful Reunification of China; To Comfort the Deceased in the Afterlife

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, all circles in the city held a memorial service for Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo at the Tianchan Theater. The participants were extremely crowded, with more than 4,000 people. The venue was solemnly decorated. In the center of the stage was an altar, and on the wall were two large colored portraits of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen in square frames. Mourning couplets were hung all over the walls of the venue. Representatives from various parties and factions sat on the left and right sides of the stage as part of the presidium. Mayor Wu served as chairman, Shen Junru presided over the ceremony, and Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, Shi Liang, Deng Yingchao, Xu Jiquan, Guo Moruo, Zhang Junmai, Zhang Bojun, Chu Tunan, Zhang Naiqi, Ma Xulun, Cai Tingkai, Hong Shen, and others were attendants.

After Zhao Dan read the eulogy, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, saying: "Mr. Li and Mr. Wen were both my friends, especially Mr. Wen, who was my classmate at Tsinghua University. Today, as a friend and mayor, I mourn them, and I feel even more grieved." He explained two points: (1) Mr. Li and Mr. Wen died for democracy, and the foundation of democracy in Shanghai has already been laid. The United Kingdom and the United States have public opinion institutions, and the Shanghai Municipal Council has been established without much debate. This can be reported to the two gentlemen. (2) Democracy should have a spirit of abiding by the law. Mr. Li and Mr. Wen died at the hands of those who did not abide by the law, so we should promote the rule of law even more. Following this, Ms. Shi Liang reported on the life of Mr. Li Gongpu and the details of his murder. Professor Chu Tunan then described Mr. Wen Yiduo's life of poverty and hard work.

When Speaker Pan Gongzhan was invited to stand up and speak, the audience applauded thunderously. Pan said sadly: "Today, all circles in Shanghai are mourning Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo. I believe that not only those present express their grief, but also the citizens of Shanghai, when they heard the news of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen being sold out, were saddened and regretted the loss of talent to the country. I have had a 20-year friendship with Mr. Li, and although I have never met Mr. Wen, I have also been reading Mr. Wen's works for 20 years. The two gentlemen ran education and wrote articles. As a friend and a fellow professional, I feel particularly sad to attend this meeting. The two gentlemen sacrificed themselves for the pursuit of democracy, which is a loss to the country, and we should all cry together. However, we should remember that if we want to pursue democracy, we should know how to pursue it. As long as we can build China into a democratic, peaceful, unified, and strong country, then the two gentlemen can rest in peace in the afterlife (the audience applauded enthusiastically). We, the survivors, have no other way to comfort them, but to do everything possible to achieve this goal. But it is not easy to put China on the road to democracy. The Chinese nation has had thousands of years of history since the invention of writing. It is an old and outdated country. How difficult it will be to turn it over and transform it into a modern democratic country! Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, led the Kuomintang in 50 years of revolution, striving for the Three Principles of the People, to build a modern and democratic new China. (Loud applause) However, "democracy" and "democracy" have different interpretations in today's world. Americans say that American democracy is a typical democracy, and Soviets say that Soviet democracy is the newest democracy. Which system is correct? Mr. Zhao Dan said in his eulogy about "the bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union." That's right! China should be the bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union. Not only should we be the bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union in the international situation, but we should also be the bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union in the democratic system. The Three Principles of the People, which are the foundation of our country, are truly the bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union! (The whole venue applauded repeatedly and called for support). If we simply and blindly learn from the United States, or stubbornly follow the Soviet Union, we are not worthy of being the bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union. If China wants democracy, it can only sincerely and earnestly implement the Three Principles of the People. And most importantly, everyone should cultivate two kinds of demeanor: one is the demeanor of allowing people to speak freely, to criticize and discuss freely; and the other is the demeanor of those who speak and criticize having their own sense of propriety and being responsible for their own words. In today's China, any place where there is only one-sided speech and no other opinions are allowed to be expressed, where only one party is allowed to exist and no other parties are seen to be active, that place is not democratic. (Loud applause) The true model of democracy is probably in today's meeting place. Today, there are people from all parties and factions, and there are people who are non-partisan. Everyone speaks and respects each other, demonstrating true democracy. What Mr. Li and Mr. Wen sacrificed to seek was democracy. When we come to mourn them, we should work together in this spirit to achieve peaceful reunification of China and realize the Three Principles of the People, so that we can be worthy of the two gentlemen" (Loud applause).

Mr. Guo Moruo

then rose to speak, holding a manuscript and reciting it aloud, painfully describing the great spirit of Li and Wen, and said that foreigners criticize the Chinese for being selfish and self-interested. Passive selfishness is "self-preservation," and active selfishness is "I would rather betray others." Finally, he compared Mr. Li and Mr. Wen to Confucius and Jesus. Ms. Deng Yingchao represented Zhou Enlai and came to the venue to read a eulogy, which said: "Today, we are here to mourn Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo. The situation is extremely dangerous, and people's hearts are extremely sad and angry. But at this time and in this place, what else can we say? I would like to solemnly swear to the martyrs with the most sincere belief: our hearts will not die, our will will not be extinguished, peace can be expected, democracy is hopeful, and those who kill will eventually be destroyed!"

Mr. Luo Longji

said that he had been with Mr. Li and Mr. Wen for a long time and had a deep friendship with them, and expressed his pain, but he said, "Today we are not mourning here, but celebrating that the spirit of these two friends of ours is immortal. They had long been prepared to sacrifice for democracy." He also said: "The democracy we want is for the people to be able to live. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said in his legacy: 'Peace and democracy will save China.' There must be peace for there to be democracy."

Finally,

Mrs. Zhang Manyun, the wife of Li Gongpu, delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the families of Li and Wen, with tears in her eyes. She expressed her gratitude to the government leaders, friends, and guests for their enthusiastic participation and assistance in holding this meeting. She also said: "This makes me even more convinced that they are not dead. Their spirit will always be in everyone's heart and will not be forgotten." The memorial service began to disperse after playing funeral music at 11:00 AM.

### City Council and City Party Headquarters Host Taiwan Tribute Mission: Head of Delegation Lin et al. Express Deep Hope for Peaceful National Construction; Chen Xin States that Taiwan's Administration Should Be Further Reformed

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Taiwan Restoration Tribute Mission, represented by National Political Council members Lin Xiantang and Chen Yisong, mission advisor Qiu Nianxian, and other representatives Huang Chaoqing, Lin Shuhuan, Lin Weigong, Ye Rongzhong, Zhang Jifu, Mei Zhenxiang, Li Jianxing, Zhong Fan, as well as mission finance committee member Chen Xin, secretaries Chen Zaiheng, Li Desong, Lin Xian, and others, fifteen people in total, who came to Shanghai via Nanjing and other inland cities after visiting the capital, are scheduled to return to Taiwan today. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, City Council Speaker Pan hosted a reception for the delegates and members of the local press at the New Life Club.

Speaker Pan began by delivering a speech, stating roughly: Taiwan was separated from the motherland for fifty years. It was only after this war of resistance that it was able to return to the embrace of the motherland. The compatriots of the whole country not only rejoice for the people of Taiwan but also celebrate for themselves. It is believed that after the eight years of the war of resistance, the gentlemen present have a profound understanding of the motherland. Currently, Taiwan's administration, economy, and politics are in a transitional period. It is also believed that the compatriots in Taiwan hope that all systems can be the same as in other parts of the country. This point will certainly be achieved in the future, and it can show that China is a unified country. Then, Lin Xiantang, the head of the delegation, gave a speech, saying that Taiwan was fortunate to have relied on the struggle and resistance of the national military and people during the past eight years, and finally achieved restoration. In the past fifty years, the people of Taiwan suffered from the Japanese people's policy of enslavement, tasted the enemy's destruction and coercion, but we have always strived to unite and maintain our inherent culture. Today, Taiwan has returned to the embrace of the motherland, like a little brother, hoping that the elder brother will give more guidance and leadership and work together to build a new country. The domestic disputes should be resolved peacefully as soon as possible, so that the construction is hopeful, which is also the unanimous hope of the 6.3 million compatriots in Taiwan. Then, Qiu Nianxian, the advisor of the delegation, reported four points of observation: (1) Returning to the motherland this time, I feel close and enthusiastic, which makes us enjoy the warmth of the family. (2) In the past fifty years, the compatriots in Taiwan have been alienated due to the Japanese people's separation, resulting in a lot of estrangement, but now we understand. (3) We are very saddened to see brothers quarreling in the motherland. We have suffered the pain of subjugation for fifty years and deeply hope that the country will quickly embark on the road to a strong country. (4) I hope the country will seek peace as soon as possible and resume reconstruction. I also hope that the compatriots in the country will not discriminate against the compatriots in Taiwan. In fact, the 6.3 million compatriots in Taiwan are all purely Chinese.

Afterwards, Mr. Chen Qi replied to reporters' inquiries about the industrial and commercial situation in Taiwan, saying: Currently, industry and commerce are still in the process of being taken over. The reason for the delay in the handover is that in the past, industry and commerce were entirely in the hands of Japanese people. Once taken over, manpower and financial resources are insufficient. In the future, it should be developed in two stages: (1) Complete the takeover work and continue production, (2) Restore the pre-war state. (3) Improve and increase production.

Political Council member Chen Yisong replied regarding the opinions on Taiwan's administrative governor's office: (1) The people of Taiwan hope that the central government can abolish the system of the administrative governor's office and establish a provincial government system. (2) Governor Chen Yi has good morals and scholarship, but because he has too many ideals that are not practical, he only creates a bureaucratic system.

Finally, Speaker Pan, in the position of a member of the press, hopes that in the near future, reporters from Beijing and Shanghai can organize a Taiwan sightseeing group, and is willing to meet the representatives again in Taiwan.

In addition, yesterday, in order to welcome the representatives of the city's party members, the City Party Headquarters, led by Director Fang, issued invitations to all the representatives of the delegation to hold a tea party at 9:00 AM in the Dadong Auditorium on the third floor of Wing On Company.

### MGM's New Film to Be Shown at the Grand Theater: Mandarin Dubbed Explanation Attracts Audiences with Utmost Care

[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to win over Chinese audiences in the Far East market who do not understand English, American film producers have invented a new technology after adding Chinese explanations to the films. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has invented Mandarin explanations for the films.

### Zhejiang People Save Zhejiang, Zhejiang People Build Zhejiang: Shen Honglie's Purpose in Coming to Shanghai is to Raise an 800 Million Yuan Fund to Repair the Qianjiang Yidu and Xixing Wharf, Deeply Hoping that Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai Will Join in the Righteous Cause

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Shen Honglie arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. Leaders from various circles in Zhejiang, including Xu Jiqing, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaolai, Shou Yicheng, Wang Zhengting, and Qian Xinzhi, welcomed him at the International Hotel at 4:00 PM, attended by industrial and commercial figures from Shanghai such as Chu Fucheng, Gui Yanfang, and Hu Xiyuan, as well as Zhejiang Provincial Assembly Speaker Zhang Qiang, Civil Affairs Director Ruan Yicheng, Construction Director Pi Zuoli, and Special Commissioner Yu, Section Chief Zhou, Xu Hao, Jin Runquan, Chen Cheng, etc., who came from Hangzhou. Wang Xiaolai presided over the banquet.

Wounds and Scars Everywhere, Small Towns Especially Severe

Chairman Shen reported on the political situation in Zhejiang Province, stating roughly that since taking office, he has inspected 35 counties. Only 7 counties are intact. 70% of the remaining counties are 100% destroyed. The destruction of small towns is especially severe. It is truly a sight of wounds and scars! More than 20 counties in the province's rivers are suffering. More than 800,000 acres of farmland have been destroyed, greatly affecting production. Therefore, the current important policies are to reduce the people's burden and to urgently seek local construction. The former has ordered the abolition of unnecessary taxes and strictly prohibited apportionments. The central government has also approved the reduction of land tax to 5.567% to 50%. The latter is to repair water conservancy. Starting from November 1, Jinan, Qiantang River and Qianjiang Ferry and Xixing Wharf will be repaired first. It is expected that one-third of the province's water conservancy projects or one-fifth of all projects will be completed within the year.

Utilizing Civil Power to Repair Transportation

In terms of increasing grain production, the province is still short of 2 to 3 million dan. It is expected that it will be self-sufficient within three years, and this year it can increase production by more than 600,000 dan. In short, the current direction of administrative work is to seek the people's peace and prosperity. This year's total budget is over 24 billion, and the income is only 6.8 billion. Even with the central government's subsidy, it is still short of 9 billion. The provincial government's policy of building Zhejiang has two principles: not increasing the people's burden and not relying on the central government. Therefore, on the one hand, it utilizes civil power, mobilizing the province's national compulsory labor to repair transportation, and on the other hand, it has negotiated with the Zhejiang-Fujian branch of the Executive Yuan to obtain 21,000 tons of flour to be used for the construction of large and small water conservancy projects, provincial and county roads, houses, and sanitation facilities.

Floating Capital Flows to Rural Areas of This Province

On the one hand, under the slogan of "Zhejiang People Save Zhejiang, Zhejiang People Build Zhejiang," it is hoped that the Zhejiang compatriots in Shanghai will allow the large amount of floating capital in Shanghai to flow to the rural areas of this province and build transportation and production projects in their counties. The people can reduce their burden; the government is willing to take responsibility and provide guarantees. The biggest purpose of my visit here is to first repair the Qianjiang Ferry and Xixing Wharf, raising a fund of 800 million yuan, and deeply hope that fellow townsmen in Shanghai will enthusiastically complete this righteous act to facilitate transportation between eastern and western Zhejiang. Chu Fucheng, Xu Jiqing, Zhang Qiang, and others gave speeches, expressing gratitude for Shen's virtuous policies and deep hope for the assistance of fellow townsmen. According to Shen, he will stay in Shanghai for three days before returning to Hangzhou.

### Jiangjing Wheel Starts Sailing to Ningbo Today: China Merchants Bureau Hosts Visit

The wheel is scheduled to sail on the Shanghai-Ningbo Qian line starting today, departing from Shanghai to Ningbo every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and departing from Ningbo to Shanghai every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, coinciding with the original Jiangya wheel's departure from Shanghai and Ningbo on the same day. The wheel was built in 1940 at the Tsurumi Shipyard in Japan. After Japan surrendered, it was taken over by the China Merchants Bureau. It has a total tonnage of 3,724 tons, a speed of 13 miles per hour, a horsepower of 2,500, a length of 309 feet and 2 inches, a width of 47 feet and 7 inches, a depth of 14 feet and 10 inches, a draft of 12 feet and 5 inches, and a passenger capacity of 1,180 people.

### Five Trolleybus Lines Increase by an Average of Ten Vehicles

The British-owned Tram Company in this city has recently shipped a large number of trolleybus rubber tires and various parts from the United Kingdom. Therefore, it is currently working hard to assemble them. Moreover, starting from the 3rd, the trolleybuses on the 14th, 16th, 17th, 20th, and 24th lines in the city have been increased by an average of ten vehicles per line. The degree of passenger congestion can often be reduced from now on.

### Trafficking Morphine: Four Key Criminals Caught at the Da Shanghai Hotel, Secret Compartment Discovered in Suitcase

[Report from Our Newspaper] Last month, on the evening of the 28th, Zhou, the Chief of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, received a tip that a large amount of morphine had been shipped from Tianjin to Shanghai. All the drug traffickers were hiding in Room 319 of the Da Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road. At about 11:00 PM, he ordered Zhang Tiansu, the Chief of the Criminal Investigation Section, to lead a number of police officers to the address. Three key criminals were arrested on the spot: Ma Qingtong, 27 years old, Luo Qiubo, 26 years old, and Luo Jianhao, 30 years old, all from Guangdong. After being taken to the station for questioning, they confessed that all the morphine was hidden in a suitcase at No. 12 Sanduoli, Daji Road, Chongshi. The person in charge then rushed to the location and found three pounds of morphine in the hidden bottom of an 18-inch suitcase. They further confessed that their accomplice Wang Chunfu was hiding in Room 225 of the Da Shanghai Hotel. He was also arrested, and a large suitcase was confiscated. It was an empty box, with mechanisms on both sides and the bottom for concealing drugs. According to their confession, all the morphine they had transported had been sold out. They were all taken to the station for strict investigation. It is reported that the drug trafficking organization is very large and involves many criminals. The police station is working day and night to arrest them, and it is hoped that the truth will come out in the near future.

### Two American Professors Come to China to Promote Child Welfare

[Report from Our Newspaper] The United China Relief Association held a reception for the press in this city at 4:00 PM yesterday on the third floor of the West YMCA to welcome Dr. W.C. Ryan and Dr. & Mrs. Braest G. Osborne, who came to China from the United States. Dr. Ryan is the Director of the Education College of the University of North Carolina, and Dr. Osborne is a professor at the Teachers College of Columbia University, and his wife is a public health nurse. The mission of their visit to China is to promote China's welfare undertakings. The Osbornes are visiting China for the first time, while Dr. Ryan visited China in November of last year! He was in charge of relief work and left China in March of this year.

He is returning to prepare for the establishment of the China Child Welfare Association, which will be held in Shanghai from October 4th to 9th. Before and after the conference, they plan to go to Nanjing, Beiping, and other places to meet with local leaders in children's welfare undertakings to discuss further.

Dr. and Mrs. Osborne expressed their opinions on Chinese children as follows: Chinese children have the same mission as American children, and Chinese children should have the same future as American children, which will have a great impact on the entire world. Currently, their task is to improve the education of Chinese children. They also believe that the children's relief supplies organized by "One United" are of great significance, because the purpose of the United China Relief Association is to assist in building a new China, and children are the future masters of the new China. Therefore, how to enable them to receive reasonable training and become a complete person with working ability is a matter of urgency. They are very willing to do their best to promote it.

### Lie Detector: Police Bureau Purchases Equipment, Allocates Rong Desheng's Bonus

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Police Bureau has recently allocated a portion of the bonus presented by Mr. Rong Desheng to purchase criminal police equipment. Zhang Shi, the Director of the Criminal Department, has prepared a budget proposal, which has been approved by Director Xuan. The total amount is US$10,000. It is reported that one of the new equipment is a lie detector, which can immediately identify whether the confession is true when investigating a criminal case. It has been popular in Europe and the United States for a long time, but in China, only Chongqing and Nanjing have such equipment. The cost is more than US$800. Other items, such as wireless broadcasting machines, radios, and various special photographic materials, are urgently needed at present.

### Super Jumbo Jet: More Passengers, Higher Speed, First One to Arrive in Shanghai by the End of the Year, Longhua Airport to Build Runway, Realization of Pacific Line Expected

[Report from Our Newspaper] The runway of Longhua Airport will soon be paved with cement. The runway is 6,000 feet long. The entire project requires 40 billion. The Ministry of Communications, the Municipal Government, the Central Aviation Corporation, and the Aviation Committee will discuss the construction. According to reliable sources, it may be completed before the end of this year.

To pave the runway, the Central and China Aviation Corporations will each invest 10 billion yuan. The plan of the two companies to use four-engine aircraft to open up the Pan-Pacific route will be realized in the future. The "Central" is currently ordering two super-empty aircraft from Boeing in the United States. The aircraft is the famous B29 jumbo jet. "China" is currently awaiting the arrival of the C54 transport aircraft ordered by the company, which is said to be first used for flights between Shanghai and Manila. However, both companies know that it will be difficult to compete with the American Pan-Pacific route in the future, and the low production of four-engine aircraft in the United States recently will increase the difficulty of the two companies.

Chen Wenkuan, Director of the Flight Division of the Central Company, said that the company's first super-empty new aircraft should arrive by the end of this year. The aircraft can carry 80 passengers on the Pacific route. If the route is shorter, it can be increased to about 100 people. Because of the pressure chamber equipment, it can fly extremely high, with a speed of 340 miles per hour.

Currently, the two companies' overseas routes only reach Hong Kong and Manila. They both have contracts with Philippine airlines, but only China is currently operating flights to the Philippines.

### Zhang Beisheng and Other Traitors Escorted from Suzhou Today

[Report from our Suzhou office, 4th] The Suzhou High Court has scheduled the 8:50 AM express train to Shanghai on the 5th to transport forty convicted traitors to Shanghai. Chen Songnian, warden of the Third Prison of Jiangsu, and Xiang Jian, a recording officer, will lead the court police to escort the prisoners. They are expected to arrive at the North Station around 12:00 PM, after which they will be transferred to the Tilanqiao Prison for execution. Among them are the traitor Zhang Beisheng, the former head of civil affairs under the puppet Jiang regime, and Pan Hongqi, the former puppet county magistrate of Jiangdu. Traitors such as Chen Jun and Chen Min are not included in this group.

### Death Sentence for陣 Chunpu, a Key Figure in the Puppet Regime; Chen Jiufeng, a Puppet Baojia Committee Member, Testifies, Indicating that Several Senators Were Former Colleagues

[Report from our office] Chen Chunpu, a relative of the traitor Wang Jingwei and a key figure in the puppet regime, was sentenced to death by the High Court yesterday afternoon. The main text of the judgment reads: "Chen Chunpu colluded with enemy countries and plotted to resist our country. He is sentenced to death and deprived of all civil rights for life. All his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, will be confiscated." Yesterday, Chen was wearing a gray serge long gown and rimless glasses. He feigned composure upon hearing the verdict and made no expression. He was escorted back to prison by the court police. Chen is 47 years old, from Xinhui, Guangdong Province, and a member of the Kuomintang. He held various positions in party and government organs for a long time. During the War of Resistance, when the traitor Wang colluded with the Japanese invaders and betrayed the country for peace, Chen left Chongqing ahead of Wang in December of the 27th year of the Republic. Later, when Wang and the Japanese invaders negotiated the "Basic Principles for Peace" in Shanghai and formed the puppet regime, Chen served as his personal secretary and followed him closely. In March of the 29th year, he became the Secretary-General of the puppet Executive Yuan, concurrently serving as the Deputy Secretary-General of the puppet Political Affairs Committee and an executive member and Deputy Secretary-General of the puppet Central Executive Committee. In October of the 31st year, he was transferred to the position of Minister of the puppet Ministry of Construction. In the 32nd year, he concurrently served as the Minister of the puppet Central Party Headquarters' Organization Department. In April of the 33rd year, he was transferred to the position of Governor of Guangdong Province and Pacification Commissioner, which he relinquished in February of the 34th year, when he became a member of the puppet National Government until the victory. After the victory, he was arrested and transferred to the High Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution.

In another case, the verdict for Jin Gengxin, an employee of the puppet police bureau suspected of being a traitor, was: "Improper jurisdiction. This is an ordinary criminal case and should be transferred to the local court for trial."

Chen Jiufeng, 40 years old, from Shangyu, Zhejiang Province, graduated from the Law Department of Great China University. He used to run a business in Shanghai. During the enemy's occupation, he served as the secretary of the "Shanghai Citizens' Joint Preparatory Committee" and the "General Director of the Shanghai Baojia Self-Government Preparatory Committee." After the victory, he was arrested and prosecuted by the High Procuratorate. The prosecutor's indictment accuses him of being responsible for compiling household registration and issuing citizen certificates, hindering the activities of patriotic elements and underground workers in Shanghai. Chen argued vehemently during his trial at the High Court yesterday, stating: "On February 14th of the 31st year, the Laozha District was blockaded by the enemy, causing a severe food shortage. The Baojia Self-Government Preparatory Committee was initiated and organized to alleviate such terror blockades. As a resident in the blockaded area, I participated because I was influenced by the environment and also wanted to relieve the suffering of the masses. However, the committee was a people's organization and not an affiliated agency of the puppet regime." The chairman of the "Baojia Self-Government Preparatory Committee" was Yuan Ludeng, and the vice-chairmen were Zhou Bangjun and Yu Hualong. Later, the chairman of the "Baojia Committee" was Ye Futun, and the vice-chairmen were Wang Boyuan and Wang Lianfang. The 20,000 Baojia chiefs at the time continued to serve after the victory. I have been in custody for a year, and I have not heard of any Baojia committee members being reported as traitors. I have only heard that someone has been elected as a municipal senator, and someone has been promoted to an official position. To my knowledge, many current municipal senators participated in this Baojia program in the past, such as Li Wenjie and Guo Linshuang, who were all members at the time. Guo Shun has even gone to the United States. Why am I the only one being detained and prosecuted? It's truly baffling. I absolutely do not believe I am guilty." Furthermore, Ke Pufu, the secretary of the White Russian Emigrants Association, was accused of colluding with the enemy military to harm the former chairmen of the association, Ivanov, and others, who were anti-Japanese. The defendant denied the charges. Both of these cases were concluded yesterday, with the verdict scheduled to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 11th of this month.

On the same day, the High Court investigated the case of Russian immigrant Wu'er Liule Heff, who was accused of serving as an intelligence agent for the enemy military radio station on Jing'an Temple Road, and the cases of overseas Chinese Zhang Yichang, who conducted investigations for the enemy in Manila, Philippines, and Fu Guangyao, who supplied materials to the enemy. The hearing of these cases was postponed.

### The Case of Tang Shoumin Remanded for Retrial

[Report from our Nanjing office, 4th] The case of Tang Shoumin, the former director-general of the puppet National Commercial Control Association, who was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the Shanghai High Court, was appealed to the Higher Court for review. It has now been learned that the case has been remanded for retrial by the Supreme Court.

### Wan Molin Expected to Be Released on Bail

[Report from our office] After Wan Molin was detained, his old illness recurred and has become increasingly serious in recent days. His family had requested bail, promising that he would be available whenever summoned. The authorities in charge considered the matter to be of great importance and telegraphed Chairman Chiang for instructions. It is now rumored that the central government has approved bail, but the formalities still need to be completed.

### Zhang Zi's Suspected Embezzlement Cleared by Investigation Team

The investigation team for the receipt and disposal of enemy and puppet materials in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region previously received a confidential report alleging embezzlement in the return of the China Woolen Factory by the Economic Ministry's special envoy's office. It is learned that Commissioners Wu Wangji and Zhang Qingzhen have repeatedly investigated the office in detail and believe that the original confidential report alleging that Special Envoy Zhang Zi embezzled 1,000 taels of gold is not true and is impossible.

After hearing the testimony of Oppen, the defendant's lawyer immediately sought to prove that his words were not credible and presented evidence showing that Oppen had been deported from Austria in 1936 for drug trafficking. They claimed that Oppen served in the US military's anti-malaria team, injecting DDT in the Jiangwan dormitory, until the US military arrested him. Afterwards, he was employed by the US Navy and participated in the investigation of the Merlini case.

The second witness called during yesterday's trial was Lieutenant Colonel Taniguchi, the former director of the reporting department of the Japanese military headquarters in Shanghai. He was recently escorted to Shanghai from Japan. During his testimony, he stated that after Germany surrendered, he had contact with the defendants in this case, O'Hare, Lee Rantan, and Habenicherand.

### Robbery on North Shanxi Road

[Report from our office] A candy store at No. 237, North Shanxi Road, was scheduled to open within days. The owner, Ma Jialiang, was attacked last night around 9:00 PM by seven robbers, one of whom carried a handgun. More than ten silk streamers that were hung up, 150,000 legal tender, and clothing, coats, gold rings, and lockets were stolen. At the same time, two robbers went upstairs and robbed Mrs. Zhu He of two diamond rings and 500,000 legal tender before escaping.

### An Old Man Commits Suicide by Hanging on Zhoujiazui Road

[Report from our office] Yesterday morning at dawn, an old man was found on the Shuimenting of Zhoujiazui Road, Xin Jian Road, Hongkou, with a rope around his neck, barely alive. At 8:30 AM, the Tilanqiao Police Station, after receiving a report, ordered police officer Li Shaotang to investigate. The old man was wearing a gray cloth short shirt, white cloth shorts, had a shaved head, was barefoot, stout, with a three-inch-long beard, and inch-long fingernails. He was about sixty years old. At the time, he was still barely breathing. He was sent to the Municipal Fifth Hospital for treatment, but died only an hour after arriving at the hospital. His family could not be found. According to the officer handling the case, the old man was definitely not strangled to death, as the rope marks were on the front of his neck, not the back. He appeared to be a refined person in life, who may have committed suicide by hanging after falling on hard times. It is believed that someone moved him to that location.

### Stevedores at Foreign Shipping Companies Go on Strike; Arbitration Remains Unresolved

[Report from our office] Stevedores are demanding a wage increase from 4,000 to 6,000 yuan per shift. The Stevedore Guild negotiated with various foreign shipping companies without success, leading to a strike that began on the 2nd. The foreign companies have requested arbitration from the Social Affairs Bureau, but no resolution has been reached. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company originally planned to receive the Haihang輪, purchased from Canada, today, but due to the stevedore strike and the cargo not yet unloaded, the receipt has been postponed. It is understood that this strike is limited to foreign ships, and domestic ships have not been affected. However, according to sources from the workers' side, if a resolution is not reached soon, domestic ships may also be affected.

### Faces and Neon Lights Reflect Each Other's Redness; Bans Are Still Ignored

[Report from our office] The Public Utilities Bureau has officially announced that all outdoor neon lights and decorative lights will be temporarily suspended from receiving electricity starting on October 1st. However, at night, neon lights still dazzle pedestrians, and illuminated billboards still blind people. It is understood that the Public Utilities Bureau has requested the assistance of the Police Bureau to enforce the ban and has instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inform the various commercial guilds to notify the shopkeepers in the city to comply. However, this is only a temporary measure to alleviate the city's electricity shortage and does not mean the removal of the neon lights and decorative lights installed in the shops, only a temporary suspension of their use. Many shopkeepers are not clear about the truth.

### US Military Tribunal Re-Examines German Intelligence Agent Case; Witness Oppen Testifies About Espionage Activities

[Report from our office] The US military tribunal yesterday re-examined the suspected German intelligence agents for the second time. Witness Oppen stated that Shen Ke (another German war suspect who previously accused US reporter Randall of defamation) was ordered by the German intelligence agency O'Hare to try to get Oppen into the Chinese interior to spy on US military intelligence. When the war broke out, Oppen claimed to be an American citizen and was detained in the Pudong concentration camp by the Japanese army. Shen Ke contacted the Japanese military police and planned to have Oppen escape from the concentration camp and sneak into the interior as an American citizen to engage in espionage. However, this plan was never realized.

Oppen appeared weak, with a full head of white hair. He vividly recounted his past espionage activities in China under the orders of the O'Hare intelligence agency. He stated that the monk Zhao Kong (also known as Drewe District Lincoln) and the doctor Merlini, who practiced medicine in the city, were both spies, and Merlini was later assassinated by O'Hare's agents.

Oppen stated that the O'Hare agency's work continued as usual after Germany surrendered. He claimed that he met with another defendant in this case, Rudolph, on August 17th of last year, and Rudolph told him that the agency's activities had only ceased two days prior. The Nazi Germans in the city at the time were protected by Kanna, the leader of the city's secret police, who was one of Oppen's closest friends. Oppen identified the defendant Habenicherand as the second leader of the O'Hare agency, responsible for collecting military intelligence. Another defendant, Bechik, was not only an expert in microphotography (reducing photos to a very small size) but also able to forge various documents and had forged a certificate for Oppen as a doctor on a Portuguese ship.

When answering questions from the defendant's lawyer, Oppen stated that each member of the O'Hare agency had to swear an oath not to inquire about the affairs of other members.

Oppen stated that another defendant in this case, Mossburg, was the person who taught him espionage methods. Mossburg ordered him to "avoid lying as much as possible, especially about things that are easily proven to be false. This point is even more important."

### Disowning His Wife; Facing Each Other in Court; A Case of a "Wife of the War of Resistance"; Separated for Fifteen Years, Seeing Only the Newcomer's Smile, Not Hearing the Oldcomer's Tears; A Bound-Foot Wife Accuses an Aircraft Mechanic of Bigamy and Abandonment

[Report from our office] The local court yesterday heard a bigamy case. The plaintiff was a middle-aged woman with bound feet, wearing a blue cloth short jacket and black cloth pants. The defendant was a Chinese Airlines mechanic in a khaki American-style air force uniform, looking heroic and high-spirited, like a flying general. A classic beauty and a modern hero faced each other in court. The plaintiff stated that her name was Zhou Qianyinxian, from Nantong, 36 years old. She entered the Zhou family in Haimen as a child bride at a young age. She married her husband, Zhou Zhongming, in the 19th year of the Republic and had a child who died after a few months. In the 20th year of the Republic, her husband left home to join the army and has been gone for fifteen years, without any news, abandoning her. Because she could not bear the abuse of her husband's parents, she came to Shanghai to work as a maid. Later, she learned that her husband was in Chongqing and that he had married another "Wife of the War of Resistance." She had once corresponded with him, but due to the dangerous mountains and rivers, she could not find her husband. After the victory, Zhou Zhongming came to Shanghai with his "Wife of the War of Resistance." After being informed by fellow villagers, she went to negotiate, but Zhou Zhongming not only refused to provide for her but also refused to recognize his former wife, abandoning her to marry another, which constituted bigamy. After Zhou Qianyinxian finished speaking, she presented a piece of evidence to the court, a letter from her husband, Zhou Zhongming, to his mother, which clearly showed that Zhou Qian was his wife. The defendant, Zhou Zhongming, stated that the plaintiff was his child bride and that they were not married, so although they had the name of husband and wife, they were not husband and wife in reality. The matter of having a child was baseless and fabricated. Since the court had a letter as evidence, the facts were clear, so it ordered a reconciliation outside of court first. If a reconciliation could not be reached, a retrial would be scheduled.

### Answering Readers' Legal Questions: Legal Full Rent Increase

Chen Yihua asked: My relative, Ms. Wang, took back the house she had rented to Mr. Jia for her own use after the victory in Shanghai last year. However, Mr. Jia used the excuse that it was difficult to find a house and delayed the move. At that time, Mr. Jia still refused to delay the move due to the trouble of moving. Later, Mr. Jia claimed that if she wanted to take over the house, there was another place, and Ms. Wang was forced to take over a single two-story building from Mr. Jia for 40 taels of gold. Mr. Jia accompanied Ms. Wang to the real estate company to transfer the account, signed a six-month contract, and said that there would be no problem with the renewal when the contract expired. Unexpectedly, after the expiration in April of this year, when she went to the landlord to renew the contract, the landlord demanded a ten-fold increase in the rent. They have been in stalemate for two months, and it has not been resolved. Now my relative has come to Beijing, talking about the above situation, if she owes two months of rent, she will lose legal protection. Please write a letter to inquire about how to negotiate with the landlord?

[Answered by Lawyer Ya Xia] If the lease is for a fixed term, the lease relationship expires when the term expires. I will answer Ms. Wang in five points: (A) Mr. Jia should have expressed opposition to her continuing to use and profit from the leased property when the lease term expired. (B) Does the real estate company have any intention to object to her continuing to use the current house as a leased property? (C) According to the first paragraph and the first clause of Article 100 of the Land Law, "taking back the house for self-residence" is one of the situations where the house can be taken back. The method should be carried out. First, inform the lessee, and then demand surrender according to law. (D) The real estate company should be informed to collect the rent. If it is invalid, you can apply to the court to designate a deposit according to law. (E) The municipal authorities have standard regulations for house rent, which can be negotiated with the owner accordingly.

### Government Bonds Fluctuate

Government bonds were initially strong and then leveled off. Speculative retail investors were active. The general trend was warm, stable, cold, and tired. The morning opening price of the Unified Class C bond was 1920 yuan. The high price once rose to 2060 yuan, before encountering pressure. Due to tight credit, many retail investors were forced to sell, and the price fell back to below 1900 yuan. As a result, it rose by 100 yuan compared to the previous close. The Unified Class E bond rose by 20 yuan, while Class A, B, and D bonds each fell by 30 yuan. Trading was still active, with a face value of about 4 million yuan.

### Foreign Stocks Also Fall Back

Foreign stocks also saw selling pressure due to tight credit and declined. The steel industry was relatively deserted, with no changes. Ewo Cotton Mill, starting from 10,600 yuan, fell back to 9,500 yuan at the close, resulting in a decline. Compared to the previous close, only the steel industry was flat. British American Tobacco fell by 10%, and the shipping industry fell slightly. The rest fell by less than 5%.

### Gold and Dollar Lead to Rise in Yarn Prices; 20-Count Double Horse Reached Over 2.3 Million; Cotton Cloth Has Subsidy Fee, Market is Relatively Slack

[Report from our office] The yarn market, after three consecutive days of decline, rose yesterday due to the impact of the US dollar and gold prices. Buyers actively absorbed heavy goods, and prices rose. 42-count Blue Phoenix rose again to 3.5 million yuan, and 20-count Double Horse opened at over 2.3 million yuan. The former rose by 200,000 yuan, and the latter also rose by over 100,000 yuan. Considering the recent trend, it was extremely sluggish. Although the underlying thinking was very firm, prices still fell, which was not without reason. This is why it rises immediately upon stimulation because the inventory is not abundant, and credit is very tight with high interest rates. Therefore, fellow traders would rather replenish goods at high prices than pad goods and pay interest, resulting in eating away their profits. Later, as the bulls took profits and left the market, it gradually declined again. At the close, it only reached 2.24 to 2.25 million, still up 70,000 from the previous day. Other brands also rose and fell with Double Horse. As a result, coarse yarn rose by about 50,000 to 70,000 yuan, and fine yarn rose by 100,000 yuan. The cloth market continued to be slack and showed no improvement. Prices also remained weak. Xin Yang He fine cloth was priced at 86,000 to 87,000 yuan, while Blue V-font fine twill cloth was even priced with a subsidy of 2,000 yuan on top of the weaving factory's price. This situation is actually due to the tightness of credit and the high prices. Therefore, fellow traders are unwilling to hoard goods beyond their capacity, which would only lead to losses. Four Gentlemen serge was priced at 94,000 yuan. The trading of woolen cloth and printed cloth was also not active.

### Hua Shares' Momentum Surges, Then Plummets in Late Trading

Building upon the previous session's momentum, Hua shares were abuzz even before the market opened. Rumors circulated that Yong Yarn was trading as high as 8253, boosting investor sentiment significantly. At the opening, all stocks rose sharply. After the opening bell, aggressive buying pushed available shares to very low levels, further fueling the bullish sentiment. New buyers joined the fray, along with retail investors, and large institutional investors added fuel to the fire. Yong Yarn and Jingfu reached new highs, Xin Guang matched its previous high, and Meiya neared its peak. Qin Xing, while rising, did not reach a new high. Fifteen minutes later, the rally gradually lost steam as profit-taking sellers emerged, creating a softening effect. The market churned downwards, stabilizing only after 10:45 AM. Many retail investors then rushed to buy, but without substantial buying power. Despite the slight increase, buying interest remained low, and momentum failed to sustain. Furthermore, tight credit conditions and the fact that proceeds from today's sales would be available on Saturday, incentivized some to sell and cash out to avoid interest charges. The trading floor became more fluid, and most shares dipped below their opening prices, a negative sign. Only Qin Xing saw concerted buying interest from numbers 91, 152, and 198, indicating stability. After 11:30 AM, sellers aggressively sought buyers, but the overall trend had reversed, and the bullish camp collapsed. Panic gripped investors, and the decline intensified near midday. News that the gold market saw the central bank dump over 2,000 bars, further tightening credit, prompted widespread selling as a precautionary measure. By closing time, only Zhong Si maintained its high price, while the rest plunged to close at their lowest points. Compared to the previous session, Yong Yarn, Jingfu, and Qin Xing fell slightly, Meiya, Xin Guang, and Xin He dropped by half a percent. Zhong Fang and Huo Chai remained flat, while Datong, Rongfeng, Xin Ya, Li An, Wu He, and Nei Yi rose slightly. Tong Yi Company fell slightly, while Zhong Si, Hua Yuan, and Jing Lun rose by half a percent. Cement saw no trading. The total trading volume for all stocks reached 17.5 million shares. After-hours trading saw minimal changes, both positive and negative.

### Cotton Yarn Allocation: Over 1,500 Units

[Our Dispatch] The Yarn Factory Joint Allocation Committee held its regular meeting yesterday afternoon to allocate yarn. They agreed to sell a standard quantity of 20-count cotton yarn: 719 units from private factories and 860.5 units from Fangjian (with some sources reporting 849 units). These were allocated based on a weighted assessment of the applications. The price for a 400-pound, 20-count standard unit remains at 1.55 million yuan. The next sales date is reportedly set for October 7th.

### China Farmers Bank Tea Loan Objective: Hoping to Export 20,000 Cases

To develop foreign sales of Chinese tea, and assist tea merchants with refining and distribution, the China Farmers Bank has decided to provide an additional loan of 1 billion yuan. The loan is to be distributed by the Qimen, Tunxi, Wenzhou, and Shaoxing branches of the bank. 54 exporting firms are eligible. The bank will loan 50,000 yuan per case for refining raw tea and 10,000 yuan per case for transportation. This falls short of the 120,000 yuan per case requested by the tea merchants. With this loan, the China Farmers Bank hopes that the tea merchants will be able to export 20,000 cases. If the loan program performs well, an additional loan of 500 million yuan will be considered. The interest rate remains at 3%, with a three-month term requiring full settlement by the end of the year. However, exporters hope for a longer repayment period.

### Special Import Permits: First Batch Limited to Year-End Imports; Second Batch Under Review; Central Bank Reaffirms Foreign Exchange Settlement Procedures

Since the establishment of the Customs Import Management Office, the import quantities of five categories of specially permitted goods—vehicles, gasoline, tobacco leaves, films, and refined sugar—are to be applied for by importers quarterly, each period covering three months. Due to delays in the mandated implementation, only one application was processed this year, covering the first, second, and third quarters, ending in September. The second application, for the fourth quarter (October to December), closed at the end of August. It is understood that the import permits applied for by various importers are currently under review. The number of importing firms remains at over 180, and the import quantities will be handled according to the regulations of the Supreme Economic Council. Existing firms that have temporarily ceased operations may apply for reinstatement, and upon successful review and registration, will be eligible to apply for import quantities again. The first batch of approved import quantities must be imported by the end of the year. Failure to arrive before December will result in a reduction of the third import quantity or a suspension of business.

Regarding the items listed in Schedule A of the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, which require an import license before import, the Central Bank, in Circular No. 56, notified all designated banks to reiterate the following two points regarding foreign exchange settlement procedures after the Import Management Office issues the import license:

1.  Foreign exchange settlement requires an irrevocable letter of credit or a purchase order, and the shipment of goods must occur within three months from the date of foreign exchange settlement.

2.  Alternatively, the applicant must possess full shipping documentation sufficient to prove that the goods have indeed arrived.

Furthermore, the amount of foreign exchange sold by designated banks under the above conditions must be clearly indicated on the import license.

[Another Dispatch] Regarding the import of trucks, the Central Bank, in Circular No. 57, notified all designated banks that foreign exchange settlement is prohibited without prior approval from the Central Bank.

### Shanghai Stock Exchange Assistant Manager Gu Shanchang Discusses Improving Stock Exchange Operations

Gu Shanchang, Assistant Manager of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, recently traveled to Beijing to consult on exchange-related matters. He returned to Shanghai yesterday and reported that his trip involved consulting with the Ministry of Finance on: (1) whether transaction taxes, as stipulated in the transaction tax regulations for transactions within the exchange, should also apply to off-exchange transactions; and (2) whether the 50 million yuan required for broker guarantees, of which 20 million yuan must be cash and the remaining 30 million yuan in acceptable substitutes, could include unlisted stocks or bank guarantees. The Ministry of Finance has agreed to consider the matter. In other news, the afternoon trading session will commence once all brokers have deposited their 30 million yuan guarantee. The review of the second batch of new brokers will be decided at a review meeting next week.

### Four-Bank Joint Office Revises Deposit Interest Rates in Various Locations

The sixteen branches of the Four-Bank Joint Office in this city, in conjunction with local bank branches, have re-negotiated the deposit interest rates for various banks. The rates have been approved by the Four-Bank Joint Office headquarters as follows: (1) Shanghai: 8 to 10 mills for current deposits, 11 to 12 mills for term deposits; (2) Hankou: (same as Shanghai); (3) Jiangxi: 12 mills for current deposits, 14 to 16 mills for term deposits; (4) Zhejiang: 8 to 11 mills for current deposits, 10 to 14 mills for term deposits; (5) Tianjin: 8 to 9 mills for current deposits, 10 to 11 mills for term deposits; (6) Fujian: 10 mills for current deposits, 15 to 20 mills for term deposits; (7) Chongqing: 8 mills for current deposits, 10 to 12 mills for term deposits. Other locations, such as Chengdu, Changsha, Kunming, Beiping, Ningxia, Neijiang, and Ziliujing, will follow Chongqing's rates.

### Under Strict Supervision, Japonica and Indica Rice Prices Slightly Rebound Yesterday; Raw Peanut Market Prices Continue to Decline

The rice market saw balanced sales and distribution. Although production prices were high, sentiment weakened. New japonica rice continued to arrive, stabilizing the market and reducing prices by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Indica rice also rebounded slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, but due to the sharp decline in the price of Bai Yuan rice, customer interest remained low. Recently, the supply has tightened, causing prices to rebound by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Yesterday, 800 bags of Taiwan rice were allocated, with prices remaining unchanged. Registered goods totaled over 7,000 *shi*. Wheat and Minyu continued to be distributed, maintaining market strength. Bran prices from Zhejiang halted, so no sales were conducted. Soybean prices from Shantou and Xiamen saw slight interest, with high-quality goods rising by 500 to 600 yuan. With a large quantity expected from the Northeast, the market is not expected to rise excessively. Broad bean supplies continued to decrease, with active and brisk trading, causing prices to rise by another 1,000 yuan. Yellow hemp prices declined for high and medium grades. Corn trends were firm. Red sorghum was stable. Raw peanut supplies surged, causing sluggish sales and a downward trend. New raw peanut prices dropped by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, while old goods fell by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Peanut prices also decreased slightly by 10,000 yuan. The oil market saw crude peanut oil fall by 500 to 600 yuan, with rapeseed oil and soybean oil following suit. Taiwan soybean cake prices saw slight movement, maintaining stable prices.

Rice Review Committee Investigates Suzhou Rice Prices

The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau convened the 35th Rice Price Review Committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the conference room. Attendees included Ji Mingzhai of the Social Affairs Bureau, Qian Xingzhong of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and representatives from the rice industry, including Qu Zhenhua, Zhang Xichao, Qiu Fuxiang, Yang Jiuchi, and Hu Weigang. Ji Mingzhai began by reporting that the Suzhou white japonica rice price limit was set at 65,000 yuan. After consulting with the mayor, it was decided to send personnel to Suzhou to inquire with the county government and determine a confirmed price. After careful discussion by the attendees, it was resolved to maintain the original price for white rice and to discuss adjustments next week. The authorities indicated that the legitimate profits of rice merchants should be protected, while any arbitrary price increases or market disruptions should be severely punished.

### US Dollar Grain Storage Bonds: Redemption Procedures Undetermined

The Ministry of Finance issued US dollar grain storage bonds in Yunnan, Shanxi, and other provinces in December of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), totaling over US$10 million. These bonds were allocated to the Ministry of Food for the requisition of grain at the time and were issued through the China, Communications, Farmers, Central Trust, and Postal Remittances Bureaus. The bonds were issued in denominations of US$10, US$20, and US$30, with each US$5 converted at a rate of 100 Chinese national currency. All bonds matured on December 1st of last year. When bondholders attempted to redeem them at the issuing bureaus at that time, they were told that the Ministry of Finance had not yet allocated the funds, and redemption was temporarily suspended. This matter has continued for ten months. Recently, numerous bondholders have been going to the savings department of the Bank of China headquarters in this city to request redemption daily. The Bank of China authorities have repeatedly invited representatives from the other two banks and two bureaus to jointly discuss a solution, and have requested that the Ministry of Finance expedite the allocation of funds for redemption, but no response has been received. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance issued a reply to the Four-Bank Joint Office on July 30th, which was then forwarded to the banks and bureaus, stating: "The redemption of US dollar grain storage bonds has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and approval. Funds will be allocated for redemption immediately upon approval." However, since the banks and bureaus have not received the Executive Yuan's approval for redemption procedures after two months, they are finding it difficult to make payments.

National Cotton Production Prices at a Glance; Production Volume 6.5 Million Dan

After the sharp rise in yarn and cloth prices in this city, cotton prices have also fluctuated accordingly. It is now known that cotton prices in various cotton-producing regions have also been affected by this and are rising steadily. Fangjian Company previously purchased cotton from various regions and estimated that the national production volume this year would be approximately 8 million *dan*. According to reports from various regions, the highest possible production volume is only 6.5 million *dan*. The amount purchased is currently difficult to estimate. The cotton prices in various cotton-producing regions are listed below (in units of 1,000 yuan per market *dan*, except for Guangzhou Indian cotton, which is per *sima dan*): 1. Northeast Region:

(1) Shenyang: Northeast Grade 1 Fine Lint 182

### Traditional Chinese Medicine Is Weak and Cannot Recover; Lycium Supply Surges and Prices Plunge

Since Guangbang ceased operations, the traditional Chinese medicine market has been quiet. Unexpectedly, the supply from various regions has increased dramatically, causing market conditions to plummet and remain weak. Last month, the supply of lycium berries was short, and customers, anticipating the upcoming sales season, stocked up heavily. New top-grade lycium berries reached a high price of 80,000 yuan. However, recently, the supply has also surged, and various parties have sufficient stock, leading to stagnation. Market conditions have deteriorated, with prices falling frequently and dramatically to around 30,000 yuan.

### Business Briefs

Tea: Although foreign firms have demand for old red and green teas, suppliers are holding prices too high, hindering successful transactions. Yesterday, Zhen He Tea Company sold over 200 cases of 1945 vintage top-grade Qimen tea to Jardine Matheson.

Timber: The market is firm and strong. Due to the rising US dollar, sentiment for foreign pine is high, and asking prices are increasing. Chinese fir continues to be strong, with prices for all grades remaining firm.

Hardware: All goods are very firm. Door locks and copper-plated locks are rising significantly. A continuous supply of emery cloth is arriving, causing slight weakness.

Tin Foil: Demand is high, and prices in Shaoxing are rising frequently, causing prices in Shanghai to increase accordingly. Furthermore, there is no news of export tax rebates, so the market is turning prosperous.

Tin: The price in Shaoxing, a major sales area, has recently turned sluggish. Shanghai is experiencing some price declines due to continued arrivals of goods.

### In Half a Month, Vulcanization Costs Doubled; Indanthrene Dye Reaches 25 Million

[Our Dispatch] The recent surge in vulcanization dye prices has been almost manic. Within half a month, US 693 has risen from 1.6 million to over 3.1 million, and NK has risen from 1.5 million to 3.2 million. The momentum is such that everyone is taking notice. Although the prices are now somewhat stable, stocks are scarce and very firm, threatening to surge again at any moment. Dye factories are hesitant to set dye prices. The reason for this originally came from the purchasing in Hankou and subsequently from the price increases by manipulators. In the past few days, the market has been chaotic, and merchants from other cities have been deterred because prices are too high, and sales would result in losses. Vulcanization alkali has also slightly improved, and the market is still within the 80,000 mark. Indanthrene Blue and Baosai Lin Blue are being quoted at 25 million, and the market is very competitive.

### National No. 8 Middle School Students: Return to Sichuan and Settlement Prepared

[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 4th] The repatriation of national middle schools was originally scheduled for May to July, with each returning to their original domicile. The Ministry of Education allocated funds to various receiving bureaus and transferred them to local authorities for handling. Sichuan-domiciled students, hindered by transportation or being homeless, were to be handled by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education, as determined by the Ministry for eight schools. Due to various issues, the Sichuan Department of Education initially did not take over, causing delays and greatly impacting studies. Considering this, the Ministry of Education has reorganized six middle schools in Chongqing to accommodate these No. 8 Middle School students: (1) Chongqing Municipal No. 2 Middle School will expand from twenty classes to thirty, accommodating high school boarding students and homeless students; (2) Mumen Pass Middle School will accommodate Sichuan-domiciled students from Chongqing suburbs and homeless students; (3) Santai Middle School will accommodate Sichuan-domiciled students from northern Sichuan and homeless students; (4) Chongqing Normal School will accommodate male students from national middle schools unable to relocate; (5) Rongchang Normal School will accommodate junior high boarding students; (6) National Women's Normal College Affiliated Middle School will accommodate female students from national middle schools unable to relocate. This well-organized allocation will still be managed by the Sichuan Department of Education. The national middle schools have all been fully arranged and resolved. Regarding the public funds for students in these middle schools, the Ministry of Education has petitioned the Executive Yuan to extend them until next summer vacation for continued relief.

### Kunming Autumn Rhapsody

— Kunming Air News on September 8th, Xu Ji

It is the end of the rainy season, a touch of sunshine. Intermittent drizzling rain sprays the ground wet. Of course, this is a minor inconvenience for pedestrians, but in terms of weather, it is very satisfying. There is wind, there is rain, and there is sunshine. How can you ask for that in the Beijing-Shanghai area?

Crossing the rainy season will be a series of fine days. Kunming's climate is indeed beyond reproach. May I ask, how many places in China can you sleep under a quilt on a hot day? After autumn comes, it is even colder in the early morning and evening. Ladies are already displaying their new clothes, lightly and ostentatiously, giving a hint to those without clothes, a bit of a threat. It is not yet clear, and more and more people are wearing new clothes. However, on the other side of the street, some people are pulling up their collars and thinking silently. What are they thinking about? They are thinking: "The whole family is in the west wind, and the cold clothes for September have not yet been cut!"

A Dance Ban Order Silences the Sounds of Demolition

Young masters and misses are really bored. Eleven dance halls have closed their doors all at once, and they have no place to stand. A waltz rings out from the loudspeaker on the street, and people will unconsciously flicker rhythmically on the cement sidewalk. Wild children stare blankly, only to suddenly remind people that there have long been no dance halls in Kunming!

Xiaodong Street and Taihe Street are lonely. The sound of demolition will no longer be heard on the streets, and occasionally a few South American tunes will be heard from the "Pika-Poka", but it will no longer be possible for the "dancing citizens" to let go of their steps without restraint. What has risen instead is singing, is vaudeville, but it is not as bewitching as the tango and the Langbai. "The voice is soft, the steps are charming..." How can that taste be relived! The appearance of amusement parks is only a transition. When people walk through Xiaodong Street, they can only look at the glass items displayed in the window, and there is nothing to see.

Kunming currently has twelve entertainment venues, but the population is still less than 300,000. Naturally, there are not few places to pass the time, but they are biased towards local pastimes, and not many people appreciate them after all. The vaudeville that focuses on fun is only a gift for the petty bourgeoisie. What about Peking opera? There are three in total. The "Golden Treasure Fan" and "Stone Monkey Born" of the Yunnan and Southwest gardens will be performed endlessly, and the few roles are always fixed. Naturally, movie theaters are considered the only place to pass the time.

However, misfortune seems to be closely following Kunming's entertainment. The dispute between the eight major companies and the theater over foreign films has always been unclear. The conditions on the company side are harsh enough, and with conflicting interests, it is naturally difficult to reach an agreement. After repeated stalemates, the outcome is unclear. In short, for two months, no leg dance could be seen in Kunming cinemas. Only the Republic, Eagle Lion, Soviet Union, India, and domestic film companies have found a way out.

Midnight Gunshots Sound: Driver Kills Master

The rainy season in the mountain city has not ended, and the news will not come to an end. The costume dramas "Peach Blossom Fan" and "Chen Yuanyuan" of the New China Drama Society are being staged enthusiastically. On the night of August 25th, when the show ended, gunshots were heard again at midnight. The driver of a sedan car injured the master's wife. The wife's name is Sun Duolan, a National Congress representative from Henan and the wife of Liu Shishang, the former Chief of Staff of the Forward Headquarters. Liu Zhihuan was also shot at the same time. Liu is from Sichuan and was a former Youth Corps cadre. Because both men and women are in "public office", there will naturally be a lot of speculation outside. Sun Duolan's residence is in Shangyuan, Daguan Road, in the suburbs, which is where the shooting occurred. A car suddenly stopped, and the driver said he was checking the fuel tank, but then gunshots rang out. The bullet hit the face. It entered from Liu Zhihuan's right cheek, and half of his tongue was gone. Sun Duolan was hit in the head by one bullet and in the left cheek by one bullet, a total of four bullets. The two shared the autumn equally, which is quite clever.

Liu Zhihuan had been on the battlefield after all. After being shot, he still had the courage to pounce on the murderer. He ran dozens of steps before finally collapsing. That night, both the male and female protagonists were carried into Kunhua Hospital. When the reporter ran over early the next morning, they were both bandaged and out of danger. The doctor did not allow us to talk much, and we still felt at a loss for a while. Fortunately, the murderer Li Heng was caught near the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway Station at 6:00 AM the next morning. Let's wait for the confession before describing the case.

The City Police Headquarters interrogated the case that day. The murderer Li Heng, 26 years old, is from Daming County, Hebei. He spoke generously and said bluntly: "Liu Zhihuan and the wife (referring to Sun Duolan, because Sun is the wife of her master, Chief of Staff Liu) have long had "dishonorable" behavior. I shot Liu Zhihuan just to be worthy of the Chief of Staff and to calm my heart. Now that the incident has occurred, even if I am shot, I am willing!" Then he was asked if anyone had instigated him? Li Heng's voice became brighter, "A hero does things like a hero, this matter is entirely my own idea, and there is no other instigation." Then he talked about the process and motive for the murder, "At 7:00 PM on the 25th, Liu Zhishen came to Shangyuan (Duolan's residence). The wife said that she was going to see a drama today and asked me to drive into the city. At that time, I couldn't stand their intimate appearance, but I finally forced myself to send them to the theater. I was so angry that after drinking ten glasses of wine and half a pound of beef, the intention to kill had arisen. I lay in the warehouse afterwards and waited until the end of the show. The scene in the car made me unable to stand it even more, so I drew my gun and shot. I didn't want to hurt the wife, but because I had drunk too much, I couldn't control myself."

After the case was questioned, it has not yet been decided how to deal with it, but the injuries of the male and female protagonists are almost healed.

### Mountain Colors and Lake Light in Autumn: Xizi Changes Clothes

— Hangzhou News on September 30th, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

The water of West Lake is always like a pot of hot water, unable to escape the embrace of summer. It turns out that this year's autumn is late. Hangzhou's autumn fragrance (in the seventh month of the lunar calendar) has been affected, and there are fewer people "wanting to play" (Hangzhou slang for playing) in West Lake. On the riverside road, there are more beggars. The business of lakeside hotels and restaurants is not good.

Fortunately, the Zhejiang tidal bore on the tenth of the eighth lunar month attracted tourists from all directions to Hangzhou, but the weather was still very hot, and they left quickly after watching the tide.

In the past few days, the weather has gradually cooled. Xizi has already changed into autumn clothes. The willow branches on Bai Causeway and Su Causeway have changed from emerald green to dark green. In the inner West Lake, you can no longer see lotus flowers, only many lotus leaves, which are gradually aging. The osmanthus flowers in Manjuelong have also withered. Several maple leaves have begun their golden age. Late at night, there are not many people walking in Lakeside Park, and the boatmen have no energy to solicit customers. The cylindrical lamps in the park are not as brilliant as before.

Behind the Industry and Commerce is More Sadness

The things in the shops are really cheap. Just take stationery as an example, Parker ink only sells for 600 yuan a bottle, and those Minsheng-type inks have been eclipsed. Glass belts have long defeated leather belts, glass handbags were popular for a while, and all the shoe stores are having big sales, with leather handbags and belts especially cheap. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, I heard that many large stores could not support themselves, but now they have finally supported themselves. Although they have supported themselves, they are still very sad behind the scenes. First, many specialties cannot be exported due to internal turmoil. Second, foreign goods are cheap and good, and Chinese goods are too expensive to compete. Third, labor is too expensive, and workers are clamoring for salary increases every day, and capital is in short supply. This is really the tragic situation of industry and commerce in Hangzhou today and cannot but be taken into account.

High Interest Loans Turn from Red to Remnants

Hangzhou's "high-interest loans" were once very popular. One or two cents is not uncommon. I know that several places borrow money from banks and then lend it out at high interest to maintain expenses. Little did they know that the people who were lent money at high interest rates were lending it out at even higher interest rates. Therefore, high-interest loans were oppressing the people heavily. Recently, many high-interest lenders have also run out of ways. First, because poor people cannot afford high-interest loans, it is better not to borrow them. Second, there is no guarantee for the future of the business, so why borrow high-interest loans. Third, people who hoard goods feel that there are no goods to hoard. Hoarding may result in losses due to the invasion of foreign goods, so they still do not hoard goods. Fourth, the new Yideng has appeared, and people who hoard rice should hurry up and throw it out. Fifth, the current prices are rising in an orderly manner, not jumping wildly. These many high-interest loans have run out of ways, so they break through the east and突 to the west, and販 some foreign goods to sell. As for investing in industry, high-interest lenders have not even dreamed of it.

Entertainment is Absurd, Donations and Taxes are Heavy

Several former dance halls were later changed to amusement parks, but although the business is good, the profits are still not good, so they want to resume dancing. Recently, I heard that there will be tea dance fundraising. I am afraid that with such "efforts", dance will always be restored one day. Before the dance is restored, the entertainment they organize includes the leg dancing of the pre-war Plum Blossom Dance Troupe type, the singing of the song "Peach Blossom River Dance Partner", the low-level humorous comedy, and the civilization drama style of who wins. This kind of entertainment, tea sells for two thousand yuan a cup, a bottle of not very good brand of soda, sells for two thousand two hundred a bottle. Like the Jin country, it is full every day. There are also movie theaters, many of which show relatively old movies. One theater that specializes in showing Chinese movies is still showing "Three Smiles" and other films. However, the theaters are full every day. A "big world" includes various types of entertainment. Last month, because the film in the movie theater burned, the audience was frightened and fled. The escalator collapsed, injuring many people. After a period of closure, it has now resumed business, and the business is still very good. However, according to people in many amusement parks, although the business is good, donations and taxes are heavy, and the cost is high, so there is not much benefit. In any case, from another perspective, "entertainment desert" is indeed a problem that deserves consideration in such a beautiful place as Hangzhou.

Vegetables Raise Their Prices High

Although autumn is cool, prices have not cooled down in the same way. Pork is already selling for two thousand yuan a catty, eggs sell for one hundred and fifty yuan each, vegetables are two hundred and fifty yuan a catty, bean sprouts also cost two hundred and fifty yuan a catty, and only fifteen white fruits cost one hundred yuan. One day, the police bureau drove away the vendors to rectify the city appearance, and many people selling vegetables carried their loads and fled. As a result, many families could not buy meat or vegetables that day. Hangzhou vegetables are expensive, and the reason is quite puzzling, because there are many vegetable gardens and farms near Hangzhou. Some say that labor is expensive, but why is labor expensive? Upper rice has dropped to 40,000 yuan a dan, and cheap cloth is also available. The housing in the countryside is not occupied by VIPs, so there is naturally no housing shortage. Some say that vegetables are expensive because of gold, but can our vegetables be compared with gold? In my opinion, vegetables are expensive due to the exploitation of middlemen. Many people who sell vegetables deliberately raise the price of vegetables.

In the fall, the Hangzhou Municipal Council had a storm because the speaker spoke for the traitor. As a result, the old speaker resigned, and a new speaker was elected. The Zhejiang Provincial Council focused on reducing the tax rate on land, which lasted for twenty days. The investigation team came and did not find any major cases.

Li Jishen, Shao Lizi, Yu Feipeng, and Xie Guansheng all came to Hangzhou in the fall. Yes, autumn is deep. Visiting Hangzhou and seeing Xizi's autumn clothes is the time!

### Autumn Breeze and Horse Hooves: Talking About Hong Kong

— Hong Kong Airmail Report, September 29th, Special Correspondent Ling Fang

A few days ago, the Hong Kong Observatory hoisted the fifth hurricane signal of the year. The hurricane ultimately didn't strike, but it chased away the sweltering heat. Although theaters still display signs advertising air conditioning, some audience members waiting to enter are already wearing light gray or coffee-colored woolen coats. Although summer time hasn't changed yet, the morning light already brings a hint of chill, and the chrysanthemums on the balcony whisper: Autumn has arrived.

Acquiring Famous Horses, Selling Lottery Tickets Extensively

The world of human affairs seems to be changing in tandem with the natural world. Newspaper headlines loudly proclaim two major pieces of news: Starting in October, the Star Ferry fares have been reduced. A monthly pass that cost ten dollars is now six dollars (before the war, it was three dollars). Electricity rates in Hong Kong have also been lowered, from a wartime surcharge of 260 percent to 200 percent. In real terms, this means that the price per unit of electricity has dropped from 58 cents to 48 cents. People are breathing a sigh of relief under the burden of life, but their common interest seems to be focused on another goal: The autumn lottery will soon be drawn!

Batches of Australian horses are being shipped in by ocean liners, their hooves already echoing in Happy Valley. There's no "horse racing ban" here. Under the auspices of the Army Department Relief Fund, the directors of the Jockey Club are sparing no effort to acquire famous horses, and wealthy "taipans" are hiring jockeys far and wide. Everyone wants to get rich, so they're selling lottery tickets extensively. Unlike the spring's Grand Champagne Lottery, where the top prize could reach 250,000 dollars, this time the scale is smaller, with a maximum of only a few tens of thousands of dollars. But a few tens of thousands is enough to spend lavishly. People eager to get rich are running up the twenty or thirty stone steps to the Jockey Club office on the second floor of the Exchange Building, nervously handing over money, and gleefully exchanging it for lottery tickets. On the afternoon of the 29th, Hong Kong will gain another small fortune! "The spring breeze feels delightful as the horse gallops," and the autumn breeze is no different!

September Clothes: Unable to Afford Tailoring

People can't talk about three sentences without mentioning "September clothes." Second-hand Western suits in decent condition are priced at over 120 dollars, but that 120 dollars is only enough to pay for the tailoring of a suit at a third-rate Western-style tailor shop. Better tailoring costs over 180 dollars per suit. Australian wool fabrics cost 150 to 200 dollars per suit, while British fabrics cost at least twice that. The tailoring cost of a suit is almost equivalent to a worker's monthly salary. Everyone has only one thought: Just wear last year's worn-out clothes!

The Hong Kong government doesn't seem to be deliberately joking with the overseas Chinese, but just when most of them can't afford new clothes, it announced a price limit on ties: eight dollars per tie, devaluing the colorful American ties by more than half. Why not announce price limits on wool fabrics and tailoring? A month or so ago, the Hong Kong government announced the control of piece goods, obtaining 20,000 bolts of woolen and cotton cloth from importers. It was announced at the time that they would be allocated to citizens at public prices. Those woolen and cotton cloths are probably still in government warehouses. Under the interests of the Sterling bloc, it is said that Australian and British woolen fabrics still have to be freely purchased by merchants for sale in Hong Kong. The so-called control is actually only on American woolen fabrics.

Price Index: Continuously Rising

The Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department today released wholesale price indices for recent years, stating that the current wholesale price index is eight times higher than the pre-war average. The statistics assume that the index for 1938 was 100. Compared with the first half of this year, the average food price is 768.6 higher, metals and minerals are 308.2 higher, textiles are 818.8 higher, and other miscellaneous items are 718.9 higher. The retail price index in the market is likely to be even higher. Taking food prices as an example: Food prices once trended upward with the arrival of the Mid-Autumn Festival, but after the Mid-Autumn Festival, except for the prices of chickens, ducks, and livestock, they didn't fall back much. According to official statistics on September 22:

(1) Beef: 2.8 dollars (per catty), (2) Pork: 3.8 dollars, (3) Salted fish: 3.2 dollars, (4) Lobster: 4 dollars, (5) Potatoes: 70 cents, (6) Eggs: 35 cents, (7) Peanut oil: 2.4 dollars, (8) Top-quality white rice: 1.3 dollars, (9) Cabbage: 1 dollar.

The official estimate of a worker's weekly food expenses has reached 14 dollars, or one dollar per meal, equivalent to about 750 national currency units—wouldn't it be cheaper than a set meal in Shanghai?

This reporter dares not assert that the cost of living in Hong Kong is higher than in Shanghai, but at least it wouldn't be lower, right? Cantonese people like to eat, and they go to tea houses for dim sum two or three times a day, or at least once. Recently, the business income of restaurants and tea rooms in Hong Kong, according to unofficial estimates, has decreased by half compared to two months ago. According to the owner of a large tea room who told this reporter, due to the recent sluggishness of various businesses and the high cost of living, the spending power of most people in society has sharply declined. In the past, three or four people would go to a tea house and the bill would be at least ten or eight dollars, but now it's down to five or six dollars. Although the number of tea drinkers hasn't decreased, the tea room's income is much lower than before!

Corruption Rampant, Actions Public

The day before yesterday, the Hong Kong Chinese newspapers published a message in the most prominent position:

"British Government Pays Attention to the Administration of Hong Kong

Sending Personnel to Investigate Government Administration"

As early as August 26 (a month before the news leaked), the British Colonial Office had already dispatched two Chinese and Western officials to begin investigating the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department, moving relevant documents from the department to the Police Headquarters for review. This is a case of "smuggling" similar to violating the Hong Kong government's control treaties. "More than 200 related merchants are involved, and the person in charge has sent personnel to search the relevant Chinese and Western merchants, and the export permits and related documents have also been retrieved to the police station for review." This is a case "rare in a hundred years," and "the British Colonial Office sending personnel to investigate is also a record in Hong Kong's history." The merchants who have been searched are mostly transportation companies and shipping companies. It is said that those involved include some senior officials of relevant agencies. Because the Hong Kong government has not yet completed the investigation, it has no intention of immediately publicly announcing the details of the case, but the relevant parties inadvertently leaked it. The Hong Kong government spokesman did not deny it, but said, "If such rumors are true, then it is 'very good news'."

The Industrial and Commercial Evening News commented: "The atmosphere of corruption in Hong Kong is generally not weaker than in the mainland, but because of various legal covers and the more orderly handling of affairs, even if there are errors, it is easy to escape the eyes and ears of people..." In the post-war situation of "fishing in troubled waters," the atmosphere of corruption in Hong Kong has become even more rampant, to the point where it is "uncoverable" and "inescapable." The Hong Kong government agencies listed in the investigation list may not be just the Customs and Excise Department! The Industrial and Commercial Evening News also said: "When Hong Kong had not fallen into enemy hands (referring to the Japanese), the corruption of the bureaucracy was well known. Police detectives accepted bribes everywhere, covered up prostitution and gambling, did everything. Even street vendors, one dollar and a half, were all looted. Other agencies, if residents had requests, mostly determined whether they were feasible and how quickly and in what order based on personal relations and bribes. The most obvious thing was the problem of immigration certificates and the issuance of export permits when the war was about to come, which was a source of great pain for Hong Kong residents at that time..."

Even the British-run DeChen Western News said: "Corruption has occurred from time to time among civil servants and government offices in Hong Kong, and it was discovered before 1941. Since the victory, the scale of corruption, the boldness of those who engage in corruption, and the fact that they actually act openly, are also unimaginable before the war..."

Now, after the war, and starting anew with the people, it is necessary to thoroughly rectify the bureaucracy in Hong Kong.

### Autumn Typhoon

— Kaohsiung Airmail Report, September 28th, Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun

After being swept by its special product, the typhoon, autumn in Taiwan has given the people of Taiwan province a disaster unprecedented in 35 years. Even the people of this province, who are used to welcoming typhoons, have been unable to overcome nature's challenge to mankind. This reporter happened to be traveling in the central and southern parts of the province and witnessed and experienced the disasters brought by the typhoon. It is enough to show that mankind has not yet controlled nature and the power of the changing seasons. For the victims, the reporters shed tears of sympathy again and lamented the violence of nature!

Tainan Plain: A Sight of Disaster Everywhere

This reporter felt like he was detained for a night in a Chiayi hostel. There were no lights, no fire, only the sound of wind and raindrops. This was the first time in half a year! On the 25th, the reporters braved the tail of the typhoon and took a truck to Tainan.

Because of a fault in the truss beam on the Kaohsiung line, the central traffic artery between Fanzi Tian and Shanhua, we had to take a freight truck south along the highway. We squeezed into a truck full of Shanghai textiles. Within fifteen minutes of leaving the city, we were subjected to heavy rain. The truck roof had no tarpaulin, and the twenty or so people huddled together were all drenched. The rain was still like pouring, and the wind blew away the straw hats of our fellow travelers. The temperature dropped significantly, and there was a chill.

Several sections of the highway were completely submerged in water. In some places, there were large holes on the sides of the cement bridges. In the distance, the sweet potato sprouts that were silted in the mud had withered and scorched. The bare stems of the ramie plants, like sugar cane, bent their waists in the same direction. The blood and sweat of the farmers in the sugar cane, rice, and potato fields were repaid to the natural storm without any compensation! This reporter thought of this year's crops, especially the sugar cane harvested in December. The increase in sugar production was clearly hit! Mango trees along the highway were knocked down. After the car had been driving for a while, the driver had to get out of the car to clear the road. In the wilderness, there were several shepherds wearing straw raincoats and hats and farmers with hoes on their shoulders, as well as people rejoicing in catching fish, decorating the small scenes of the disaster area. This reporter did not miss these Jiangnan-like scenery, but was concerned about how the people whose farmhouses and factory houses had collapsed were coping with the unfortunate days brought by the old god? This aroused the reporter's resonance.

The wind gradually weakened. The wind blowing in our faces had a bit of heat in the coldness. This reporter had already tasted the southern part of Taiwan Province, which is a tropical region. The green cars of the post office were carrying workers to repair the broken lines of the power poles. The power company was also driving yellow trucks along the road looking for the places that had been destroyed. The wind disaster only gave people the task of quickly restoring things and quickly maintaining the original state!

What used to be an hour's drive took four and a half hours. This reporter arrived at the long-awaited ancient city of Tainan. The city's dilapidation and the traces of wartime disasters were everywhere. There was no electricity, no electric lights, no telephone, no water, and even water for washing clothes and hands became a problem. The darkness and desolation of Tainan made people feel even more that this was a veritable dead city!

### Autumn in Lanzhou

— Special Correspondent Bingzi, September 10th, from Lanzhou

Autumn is cool, and the northwest of the Loess Plateau is particularly cool earlier, and Lanzhou is naturally no exception. Whenever there is a windy day, soil and sand slap your face, making you feel all the more desolate.

News from Xining is that the Qingxin Highway, which is under construction, has recently experienced extreme weather changes along the route, and there are swarms of mosquitoes, which have caused a large number of transport livestock to die, which has now affected the progress of the project.

Since the cool autumn, some rumors that make people's hearts hot have been constantly circulating here. Lanzhou has always had the most rumors, but this time the rumors are gradually approaching the truth. After the Communist army Li Xiannian's troops sneaked into southern Shaanxi, they had the intention of entering Gansu and passing through the Xilan Highway to rush to northern Shaanxi. Now, groups of people robbing the people have been found in Huating and Wei counties in Gansu Province. Each group is said to be no more than three or four hundred people. It is not yet clear whether they are Communist troops or bandits. It is said that the people are already full of hatred for these robbers.

The price of gold in various places continues to fall, but Lanzhou remains high, with ingots hovering between 240,000 and 50,000 per tael, which is closely related to the rumors circulating.

The "Wudu Ape-Man," which shocked China and abroad, is a major discovery by scientific workers in Gansu Province and may also become a major discovery in the world. A similar human skull discovered last time is still under careful study. Mr. Wang Yongyan, a researcher at the Gansu Science and Education Museum, will soon go to Wudu again to continue the excavation.

After the Longhai Railway between Xuzhou and Kaifeng was destroyed by the Communist army, wired telegrams from Shanghai to Lanzhou are also no longer possible. Telegrams sent from Lanzhou to Shanghai are sent by wireless radio, and the time for wireless radio communication is limited. Telegrams sent from Shanghai to Lanzhou may be received as late as two weeks later. The prices of various commodities in Lanzhou have also fluctuated greatly due to the closure of the road to Shanghai.

A burst of coolness, and the maple leaves suddenly turned red.

In places where skyscrapers block out the white clouds, Mid-Autumn is just a "festival checkpoint." Millions of people who toil all day long no longer have the leisure to fantasize.

Just like that, growing old in busyness, ending a life in busyness.

The rotation of machines shattered the dream of the countryside, but hopefully these fragments of longing can bring moments of comfort to travelers!

Spring and Autumn

### Reviving France

— Shi Zhecun

A Translated Passage and a Postscript

The Work of Men of Letters Has Never Been Greater Than at This Time

At this time in which we live, we have only one thing to do; one unique thing. What is it?

Revive France.

Revive France. For whom? For France? No. For all the people of the world. It is not to re-ignite that torch for the sake of the torch.

People re-ignite that torch for those in the darkness, for those in the dungeon groping for the walls of that fatal obstacle; for those lacking guidance, light, warmth, courage, righteousness, purpose; for those who have a shadow in their future, in their work, in their conscience; for those who need a clear vision in their battles or victories. People re-ignite a torch, which is also for those who feel ignorant because they extinguished this torch.

But, to re-ignite that torch, to revive France, what method should be used? How should it be done?

This is certainly difficult, but also simple: We should make it emit light.

From where should it be emitted?

From the souls of the people.

Louis Aragon and Paul Éluard are two French poets who both belonged to the Surrealist movement before the war. After the fall of Paris, they both engaged in underground work, not only fulfilling their war resistance tasks in literature and art, but even becoming indispensable figures in organizing the masses and training the underground army. This may seem a bit unimaginable in the Chinese literary world, because Chinese scholars have always regarded Surrealism as a passive, anesthetizing, and imaginative literary movement, without knowing that its starting point was originally to resist tradition and resist restraint, and from this to obtain the result of resisting Fascism.

Yesterday, a friend in France sent me a magazine of poetry and prose. The magazine is named "Eternal Review." It is a beautiful magazine that was secretly published by Éluard during the war and is now being continued by Louis Barraut as the chief editor. This small magazine makes us feel that the French literary world is carrying out a very healthy restoration work. Looking back at our own literary publishing world, it is a bit suffocating.

This new issue No. 4 of "Eternal Review" publishes a short article written by the great French writer Victor Hugo in 1875 at the beginning of the volume. This short article is very interesting and can be regarded as a declaration of French literary workers reorganizing after victory. I am very happy to translate it as above, and, let us change the words "France" to "Republic of China", shall we?

### Thoughts on Visiting the Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting from Past Dynasties

— Pan Boying

The China Cultural Relics Company recently held an exhibition of calligraphy and painting from past dynasties in Shanghai. This truly gives people the joy of "hearing a footstep in an empty valley"! Both times, I visited with an encouraging mood. Regarding artistic appreciation, if I were to talk about it, there would be too much to say, and it cannot be written in a hurry. I will wait for a day or two, when my mood is a little calmer, to contribute some superficial views on this point separately for the criticism of connoisseurs.

I think the Cultural Relics Company has already done a precious starting work. It has attracted attention to social perceptions, which is the greatest value and harvest. In today's world of continuous wars, this kind of effort is not only not "playing with things and losing one's ambition," nor is it "holding onto the remnants and guarding the shortcomings," but it contains the spirit of "collecting the fallen threads everywhere" and "publicizing the secluded and subtle."

When the country is unstable and society is poor, a group of people always think that cultural undertakings are money-losing things and are not urgent tasks, and no one is willing to work hard on them. Indeed, cultural undertakings, in their entirety, are money-losing, and must lose money. But with regard to the small part of calligraphy and painting, it is not necessarily a money-losing thing, and can even make money. If it is managed properly, it is a very stable and profitable business. Therefore, those who do this work should not be afraid of losing money and not being able to support it. As long as you work hard on a career, you will definitely make money. These words may sound unrefined, but to really do it, you still have to start from here. However, "starting" is not "focusing." Our focus is still on the cultural effect. Earning some money is for maintaining and developing this career, which is fundamentally different from the merchant's "only profit is the goal." Only in this way can we not worry about things not being done, and can we achieve the purpose of cultural effect.

This matter should have been handled by the government. Since the government does not have time to do this, people without money have no power to do it, and people with money disdain to do it. Therefore, we are particularly delighted and hopeful for the Cultural Relics Company. From this point of view, I would like to express my hope for several things as follows.

First, I hope that this kind of exhibition can continue to be held more often. This time, it was exhibited in the clear and refreshing autumn, and it has already achieved good results. In the future, on good days in spring and autumn, good days and festive seasons, it can be held simultaneously in several places.

Second, I hope that the Cultural Relics Company will further develop its spirit of humility and responsibility and establish closer cooperation with various collectors. Credit is built up. This time, many collectors did not take out their masterpieces, which is understandable in the early stages of doing this. We want to say that such an achievement is already very difficult. Collectors have many good reasons for not easily showing their beloved calligraphy and paintings to others. We can work hard to overcome these difficulties to achieve greater success. In the future, collectors will have more guarantees and will be happy to send out their collections, which will definitely be more exciting.

Third, I hope that it will not only be satisfied with the exhibition, but also take a further step to do photography and printing work, so that famous works can be passed down. And can be passed down at a low price. (Low price and making money are not only not mutually exclusive, but also complement each other.)

Fourth, I hope to do more explanation and enlightenment work to arouse the general public's love and interest. Just hanging a painting on the wall is only loved by high-level connoisseurs. But if the author, era, and reasons why this painting is good are explained in detail, concisely, and simply, ordinary people will also love it. This kind of enlightenment work is very necessary. If this kind of work is successful, then the cultural goal and the money-making goal can be achieved in one fell swoop.

I have only hastily written down these few points as I felt them. Because of this, I also remembered the slogan shouted by the British during this war. When Britain was dazed by the German blitzkrieg, the British shouted the slogan "We learn from the enemy." In fact, everything in the world is a "teacher without constant form." "When three people are walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher." This is called "following the strengths of others." Regarding the reproduction and promotion of Chinese calligraphy and painting, we cannot erase the efforts of the Japanese. In their work, there are many laughable things, but their laughableness is enough to show their efforts. This deserves our vigilance and deserves our efforts. We should start from now on to do better than them!

### Compassionate Executioner

— ·Qian Fanfu·

Ascending a few steps, I could already hear a burst of laughter upstairs. Reaching the second-floor parlor, I indeed saw Jinqiu and her siblings playfully fighting over a bag of peanuts. Beside Jinqiu sat an elderly woman, her face gaunt and silent.

Jinqiu immediately asked why I was so late. I casually explained that there were many people waiting for the bus, and it took a long time to squeeze onto the tram. Then, I gestured to ask her who the old woman beside her was. Jinqiu smiled. I didn't think she had any reason to smile, but Jinqiu stood up and said:

"You've come at the perfect time! This is Mrs. Huang, and this is Mr. Qian. Mrs. Huang wants to find someone to write a letter for her, so please, trouble you to do it."

Jingqiu—Jinqiu's younger sister—had already placed paper, brush, and ink on the table. I had no choice but to walk over and greet the old lady with a smile. What she wanted to write was a letter to her son. Based on her words, I recorded the following brief letter:

"To my son Zhanpeng: Your letters have become infrequent, which deeply worries me. Your mother is approaching the end of her life, and her physical strength is declining day by day. I am staying with your sister and brother-in-law, which is not a long-term solution. Are your endeavors outside going smoothly? You must promptly reply and tell me whether you plan to come to Shanghai for a reunion or have other plans! From your mother."

After finishing writing, I read it aloud to Mrs. Huang, and she nodded in satisfaction. As I sealed the letter for her, I suddenly noticed Jinqiu making a face at me from afar, suppressing her laughter. I felt that her behavior today was a bit abnormal.

Before Mrs. Huang took her leave, she didn't forget to thank me. Watching her gaunt back and faltering steps, I couldn't help but feel infinite sympathy for this wandering old woman.

As soon as the old lady left, we young adults felt as if a layer of constraint had been lifted. I began to question Jinqiu: "Just now—?"

"You made a fool of yourself and don't even know it."

I couldn't help but feel surprised:

"How did you see that I was a fool?"

"Because you just wrote a letter to someone who is already dead."

"Ah!" I exclaimed in astonishment after a long pause, "Dead person?"

Jinqiu poured me a cup of tea. While drinking, I listened attentively to her explanation.

It turned out that Mrs. Huang's family had been very wealthy. After her husband died, the situation gradually deteriorated. By the time Zhanpeng graduated from middle school, they could no longer afford to send him to college, so he took a job as a trainee at a bank to support himself and his family. He had been pampered since childhood and couldn't stand being wronged, so he often had disputes with his colleagues. Others held grudges and secretly plotted to frame him. One day, when he was assigned to collect debts, they deliberately altered the figures. When Huang Zhanpeng returned with the collected money, he submitted it for verification and found that one hundred yuan was missing. That was in the autumn of the twenty-sixth year [of the Republic], and one hundred yuan could buy ten shi of rice! Zhanpeng was unjustly accused, unable to defend himself, and had no way to make up the difference. The young man couldn't bear the humiliation and was afraid to face his mother, so he walked onto the rooftop amusement park of a large department store in a daze and jumped down, his brains splattered on the spot. However, three hours after his death, the bank had already confirmed that he had not cheated, but it was too late.

Speaking to this point, Jinqiu sighed and then told me: "His sister, upon receiving the tragic news, discussed it with her husband and decided that Mrs. Huang's constitution was weak and couldn't withstand the shock, so they hid the truth from her, falsely claiming that Zhanpeng had gone to collect debts in another city. Coincidentally, the war broke out, and transportation was disrupted, making communication impossible. To this day, the son who has been dead for nine years still lives in his mother's heart."

After Jinqiu finished speaking, a silence fell over the room.

I pondered for a while and then said to Jinqiu, "I think that avoiding temporary pain has instead caused this old woman endless long-term suffering—leaving a strand of undying hope that forever lurks in her life, tormenting her. In any case, it is a cruel thing."

"What do you think should be done?"

"Tell her the whole truth, so she can offset ten years of pain with one day of sadness."

However, when Jinqiu and I went to Zhanpeng's sister's house and presented our opinion to her, she politely declined. In the end, I did not become this "compassionate executioner."

### River and Mountains Congealing Splendor

### Prairie

— Peng Xianghan

In the Forest

In the forest, we walk...

Along the sloping path of the hillside, the trees densely present their individual postures, creating a green misty curtain that shields the sky.

We stroll, stepping on the shade of the trees, the straight trunks standing upright, like spires pointing to the azure sky. The downward-spreading foliage covers, like layers of roofs, and from the dense shade, the sunlight casts checkered shadows on the green grass...

"I yearn for a vast and deep forest!"

Every day, I come to this forest to let my lungs expand in the fresh coolness! And the green liquid waves of the forest are always surging continuously, continuously...

Thus, we hold hands, walking slowly in the forest, walking...

Prairie

Autumn, stopping at the prairie in Jiangnan.

In the wide embrace of the prairie, I picked a purple flower, containing the power of life,

Spreading and clustering flowers! Gently, vaguely blowing towards you, blowing towards the heart of the prairie.

Don't worry! I won't blow my unspeakable pain, endless longing, and the prairie dream you gave me into the depths of your life.

"Let the prairie chase, galloping across this green sea of grass!"

So, we lie down, letting the soul of life drift in the prairie dream...

Records of Seal Carvers in Sichuan

### Xiao Youyu

— ·Gao Tianxin·

Before the war against Japan, General Wang Zhiyi of Sichuan flew to Beiping to bring Qi Baishi, known as Qishan Ren, to Sichuan and housed him in his mansion. For a time, Qi Baishi's seals were highly valued in Chengdu, becoming a popular topic of conversation. One day, a soldier came to Wang's mansion, claiming to want to see the old Mr. Qi. The guards, belittling him as a mere soldier, jokingly informed Qi Baishi. Qi Baishi was greatly surprised and invited him in. This soldier, upon meeting Qi Baishi, did not say a word but knelt down on both knees. Qi Baishi asked him why, and he replied that he had come specifically to learn seal carving. Mr. Qi Baishi was moved by the soldier's sincerity and readily agreed. Who was this soldier? It was Mr. Xiao Youyu. To this day, Mr. Xiao resides in the city of Xufu in Sichuan, and many seek his seal carvings. In my opinion, there are not many who have learned the single-knife white-text style of the old Mr. Qi as well as Mr. Xiao, because he truly carves with a single stroke, not with double strokes using a single knife. Here, I add a word superfluously: I heard that General Wang Zhiyi had all the seals carved by Mr. Qi ground away because many of them did not conform to the Six Scripts. I do not know if this is true?

### An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood 53

— Ye Jingfeng

I saw the young leader jump out of the car, grabbing his pistol with one hand and making hand gestures with the other, his face turned towards the side of the mountain. In less than a second, the people from all three cars got out, each taking up a defensive position, running to where the leader was, forming an irregular skirmish line. Including the leader and the drivers, there were nine people, with three submachine guns and the rest having pistols or Mauser pistols. Seeing that it was only about half a kilometer from here to the radio station, I decided not to take the car and half-negotiated, half-informed Dingyuan, "I have to go down and take a look. Big brother, you wait in the car." I also said to the driver and the two comrades, "If you have any weapons, please give me one. This engineer, Wu, is a technician under Commander Feng, and he is just recovering from illness, so he should stay in the car. Please keep an eye..." They immediately gave me a German-made twelve-shot pistol, even detaching the magazine and handing it over.

At this time, the nine people in front had adopted a searching posture, encircling the earthen hill. I tightened the magazine, checked the pistol, released the safety, and chased after them. We searched to the top of the earthen hill, but we didn't see anyone or hear any gunshots. I felt a bit strange. The situation here was that to the east were continuous mountain ridges, and to the south, separated by a valley, was the entrance to the highway. Crossing over, there were more earthen ridges, rising and falling, stretching along. To the east was the town in the basin, and beyond that was the railway. Our radio station and the road bureau's power plant were all on the eastern slope of the opposite mountain ridge. Afraid that the leader was not familiar with the terrain here, I went over to him and said, "It's important that we cross over to the opposite mountain first. The radio station and the plant can be seen after crossing that small hill."

The leader agreed with my words, and we moved diagonally downwards towards the mountainside. Just as we reached halfway down, we spotted three or four people on the highway, running straight towards the town. Because it was already dusk, it was hard to see who they were, only knowing that they were not wearing military uniforms, but they all had weapons in their hands. As soon as the leader saw them, he made a hand gesture and quickened his pace, rushing down the mountain, crossing the highway, and ascending the opposite hillside. Because the highway curved south along the foot of the mountain, he didn't ask if there was a road but took the direct route in a triangular fashion, running diagonally, so he could intercept those guys head-on. As we ran, we didn't expect that those guys, for some reason, had also abandoned the highway, moving diagonally upwards towards the mountain, probably not noticing that we were rushing towards them.

"Stop, hey!" The leader shouted loudly at them, less than a hundred yards away, and fired two shots into the air. To those who understood military affairs, they were completely surrounded by us because our position was higher, the terrain was favorable, and we were downhill, with more people than them, like air combat, we had already controlled their blind spot. Logically, they should have laid down their weapons or immediately found terrain to hold out, hoping for reinforcements; if not, they should have fought to the death. Who knew that these guys had no military knowledge and refused to take either of the main roads? Hearing the gunshots, they looked back in surprise, but still ran forward desperately.

Bang! ... The first one in front fell down. This was our leader giving them a warning, because he still wanted to call them to stop and ask what was happening: maybe they were people from our side, maybe they were local self-defense forces. If they were enemies, they could be captured alive and questioned.

Who knew that the remaining three just threw away the weapons in their hands and still ran along the route. Seeing this situation, our leader was stunned, chasing while turning his head to ask me, "What's going on?" In other words, he was saying, why are those guys all amateurs?

### Chorus of Voices

— Shaofu

The Chorus of Voices basketball team, after coming to Shanghai, won all eight of its games, creating a majestic momentum, shocking the Shanghai sports world and satisfying the basketball cravings of thousands of fans.

The times are merciless, especially in the sports world, which is the most cruel. To be honest, seniority cannot be sold on the court. If he was a star ten years ago, and he is still active ten years later, that only proves the lack of progress of later generations, because the crown on the court can only be maintained for ten years for one person.

Why? Because in addition to technique, abundant energy is the most basic condition. Today, if we still let someone over forty years old pant on the court, it seems a shame.

Many friends say that people who make a living by playing ball are almost in a position where they cannot stop, surrounded by people, with a sentimental attachment to their bones, so they have no choice but to disgrace themselves on the court in a contradictory state. Can there be anything more tragic than this in the world?

What the Chorus of Voices showed in Shanghai, I believe, is not their record of eight wins in eight games, but the truth they brought to us: If you want to progress, seize the times, and take life seriously.

In fact, not only is a basketball team like this, but in all things, can one be free from the constraints of these three factors?

### The Magnificent Rivers and Mountains Must Not Be Lost Again! Pay Attention to the South China Sea Islands

— One

According to the Shen Bao of September 28th, the Executive Yuan ordered the Guangdong Provincial Government to take over the South China Sea Islands. The so-called South China Sea Islands, including the Dongsha Island, Xisha Islands, Nansha Islands, and Tuansha Islands, are all distributed in the southernmost South China Sea. A certain piece of history and the situation are quite worth discussing: These islands are like many pearls scattered in the South China Sea of China, emitting their brilliance and reflecting on the climate of the South, where it is summer all year round, exceptionally hot. The lowest, Louisa Reef, is at a latitude of about six degrees, close to British Borneo. Because they are located far away, most people have no impression of them.

Scenery of the Archipelago

Among the archipelagos, Dongsha Island is the closest to Guangdong Province, while the Xisha Islands are closer to Hainan Island. Dongsha Island is formed by sand accumulation. Fishermen from Guangdong often go there to fish. The island is equipped with a lighthouse and a meteorological station and is rich in trees, medicinal materials, and phosphate mines. The Xisha Islands are composed of more than ten islands of varying sizes. Previously, they were under the jurisdiction of Yaxian County, Hainan. Many Hainan fishermen come here to fish, because the shallow seas of the archipelago are rich in marine products such as abalone, sea cucumber, lithospermum, kelp, and hawksbill turtle. The phosphate mines are especially rich. Every night, the stars are scattered like chess pieces, and the phosphorescence shines in the sea, creating a beautiful scene. The Nansha Islands are all composed of coral reefs and are relatively desolate, but they are also rich in fishing and salt resources.

Japanese Invasion

There is more to say about the Tuansha Islands: the Tuansha Islands are southeast of the Xisha Islands. They are named so because they are all formed by sand accumulated in mounds. The distribution area is very wide, more than two hundred li from Hainan Island, but they have always been a fishing ground for fishermen from Yaxian, and the history is very long. Many of them are dangerous areas and important navigational hubs, so there is often a risk of running aground. In the seventeenth year of the Republic [1928], the Guangdong Provincial Government sent people to survey, with great intentions for development. Later, in the twenty-second year of the Republic [1933], France forcibly occupied nine small islands in the west with a fleet. When the war broke out, the Japanese immediately invaded and occupied them, claiming that they were discovered by Japanese people and renamed them the Shinnan Islands, under the jurisdiction of the Kaohsiung Prefecture of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office. For a time, land resources were greatly developed, and immigrants were added to the Xisha Islands, with the intention of permanently occupying them. The phosphate mines on the island have been mined and are now almost depleted! After the victory, the Taiwan Provincial Government sent personnel to take over as usual, and a sign was erected stating that the takeover by the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Chief Executive Office was completed. Apart from this, there were no inhabitants. The receiving personnel, upon arriving here, felt a sense of vastness, with wide seas and sparsely populated lands.

Someone Covets

This year, the Republic of the Philippines became newly independent. Seeing that our country did not care about the Tuansha Islands, they had the intention of invading and occupying them, including them within their national defense perimeter. These facts are absurd. It is sad that the newly independent Republic of the Philippines already has territorial ambitions! On the other hand, looking back at our country, our great rivers and mountains are not being taken care of. Now, hearing that the Executive Yuan has ordered the Guangdong Provincial Government to send personnel to take over is very gratifying! I wish them success! These archipelagos originally belonged to Hainan Island and were under the jurisdiction of Guangdong Province. If Hainan Island is established as a province in the future, it should be under the jurisdiction of Hainan, which is a certain principle.

Finally, the South China Sea Islands nominally belonged to our country before the war, but in reality, resources such as phosphate mines were secretly transported by the Japanese, and we were unaware. Now, we must not let these resources be given to others for nothing. We must know that in addition to the abundance of products in the South China Sea Islands, they are also greatly related to territorial boundaries and national defense. In the future, when our naval forces develop, these can be opened up as military ports, which will not only protect the motherland but also control the South China Sea. Therefore, their importance is not limited to the wealth of industry!

We cannot ignore the South China Sea Islands, nor can we abandon them. The beautiful rivers and mountains must not be lost again!

### Public Trial of Jeepka

— Shen Lu

Time: Today this month

Location: Shanghai

Judge: "Defendant Jeepka and others, originally from the United States, since arriving in China, have relied on their strength and impulsiveness, disregarding discipline, and treating human lives as if they were grass. Their crimes are unforgivable. Now, the victims—plaintiffs ×××××××× and others—have filed a lawsuit, and the facts are clear. According to the law, they should be severely punished! (Slight pause) Do you have anything to say in your defense? You can speak now!"

Jeepka: (Rambling) "Your Honor, our cars are indeed from the United States, and each one is strong and robust. Our original service purpose was to help your country recover. Who knew that people would be fearful and become accustomed to it, not knowing how to give full play to our service abilities, but instead using us as a brand, only allowing people to follow us everywhere, and we never let anyone else! We are driven by our masters and have no choice. But because of this, we are known as 'Atomic Tigers,' bearing the blame for others. What else is there to say! But to accuse us of crimes is difficult to keep silent! I beg Your Honor to investigate carefully!..."

### Sunspots

— He

According to a missing telegram published in the Shen Bao on September 24th, it was stated in parentheses that global radio communications were disrupted and cut off at the time due to sunspots. Sunspots, also known as solar blemishes, exist in great numbers on the sun as small, grayish-black spots. The so-called small spots are actually larger than our Earth, some even thirty or forty times the size of Earth, but they are still considered very small in the sun.

Sunspots are spiral-shaped, with a core in the center and metallic hot gas swirling around, truly resembling a huge whirlwind.

Why are sunspots slightly darker than the rest of the sun? This is a rather difficult question to answer. Some scientists say that it is because the gas emitted from the surrounding areas gradually cools, but this is not very reliable. In short, there are still many mysteries surrounding it, waiting to be solved in the future. The diameter of sunspots can be as large as forty or fifty thousand miles, but the ordinary ones are about ten or twenty thousand miles.

Everyone knows that the Earth has magnetic force, otherwise why would the compass always point south? But the sun also has magnetic force, and it is constantly changing. The sun often experiences magnetic storms, especially in the area of sunspots. Astronomers have measured that sometimes the storm of this magnetic force (the so-called magnetic storm) can be more than ten thousand times greater than the Earth's magnetic force. But to this day, it is still unknown whether this kind of magnetic storm occurs on the surface of the sun or inside the sun. However, within the scope of sunspots, there is intense swirling of charged material, resulting in constantly changing magnetic storms, like a generator.

Sunspots can generate magnetic force, so the magnetic attraction within the scope of sunspots is unimaginably strong. If you place iron tools such as knives, needles, saws, and hammers near sunspots, no matter how much force you use, you will not be able to separate them. But in reality, regardless of whether you can separate them, they will already be melted into white heat by their temperature, although the temperature of sunspots is slightly lower than other parts.

Near the Arctic, one can often see luminous bands of light coming out of the horizon, reflected in the dark long night, creating a spectacular sight. This is called the aurora borealis, also known as the Northern Lights. When the aurora borealis occurs, the magnetic storm of the sunspots and the compass both change with the size of the aurora borealis, indicating that there must be a close relationship between the three, and especially when the aurora borealis is discovered, the sunspots are very turbulent.

The magnetic storms of sunspots can hinder radio communications on our Earth, especially when they are agitated the most. The agitation time of sunspots is uncertain, and they are far from Earth, so Earth is not deeply burdened. If the Earth's satellite, the moon, also had magnetic storms like the sun, then the moon is closer to Earth and produces bursts of magnetic storms on Earth, which may hinder the communications of the radio on the entire Earth. Fortunately, the moon has no magnetism and does not generate magnetic storms. What about the sun? It is not always having powerful magnetic storms reaching the ground to hinder radio communications. So, the hindrance of radio communications by sunspots is not very common.

News within the News

Recently, a friend in America who works part-time as a reporter for a Shanghai newspaper wrote, "Foreign news agencies stationed in China often have one correspondent in one location, sending out dispatches from where they sit. But Chinese newspapers with relatively strong financial resources can only specially contract foreign reporters who have to run around to several places, rushing between major cities, causing them to be overwhelmed. This is not because the newspapers can't afford the money, but because it's not easy to buy foreign exchange in Shanghai. Occasionally, after many twists and turns, they manage to get approval to send some foreign exchange, but it's not even enough to pay for travel expenses." I heard that the overseas department of a Chinese-language party newspaper in New York hasn't seen a penny of subsidy since January, probably for the same reason. Of course, we can't just use these reasons to criticize several banks for their misguided approach to "dragging" and "shelving" foreign exchange applications from the news industry. But when we think about how some "inspection personnel" often bring their families and servants to foreign countries, lingering over cocktails and forgetting to return, and how many merchants are approved to consume large amounts of foreign exchange on the shipping and sale of glass products, we really can't help but feel sorry for the lagging state of the Chinese news industry!

Whose Fault Is It?

Since the Chorus of Voices basketball team came to Shanghai, they have won eight games in a row, especially the game last week when they overwhelmed Hua Lian with a score of 66:45. We saw the "embarrassment" of Li Zhenzhong, Bao Songqi, and Chen Xuechong, who were exhausted. We also saw a microcosm of the current corrupt society in Shanghai. We don't want to comment on the harm that this kind of society does to the private lives of successful players, but just looking at the current situation: Bao, Li, and others can be considered veteran players, but it is precisely because they are "old" that a society that worships heroism has promoted their arrogance and damaged their drive. The Chorus of Voices, with its lineup of young players, went north and defeated Hua Lian in one fell swoop, while Hua Lian was planning to send "veteran players" to the United States to study basketball. I am willing to provide this fact to those "old" seniors in society who consider themselves experienced and often treat young people with "what are you?" You have to take a closer look at us!

Common Sense, Common Sense!

A few days ago, the Tianjin Yi Shi Bao had a feature from Yinchuan, which included a passage: "...When he (probably a friend of the author) was studying at Nanjing ×× University, on the day of registration, he took his resume to the registration office to apply for a subsidy for students from the border region. The registrar, not knowing where Ningxia was, approved it for review. The gentleman disagreed and argued, alarming the director of the department, who eventually instructed, 'Ningxia belongs to the Northeast Provinces, he should be given it.'" It seems like a joke, but it is actually a painful lesson. Didn't many students also move the Himalayas to North Africa and have the Tarim River flow through Southern European countries into the Mediterranean Sea on the geography test questions of the joint entrance examination of Tsinghua and other three universities a few times ago? Taiwan and Changchun still have street names like "Cho" and "Bandichi." Don't talk about politics, economy, and culture. Just this little bit of human geography education should really make us think deeply and work hard in a concrete way!
