### Both Sides Accept Mediator's Opinion, Hopeful for Resumption of Peace Talks, Government and Political Consultative Conference Representatives Visit Chairman

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th Dispatch] It is reported that the situation of the peace talks has gradually become concrete on the 5th. Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can accept the mediator's new plan to reopen the peace talks. However, although Zhou Enlai gave a detailed explanation on military and political points after meeting with the people of the Democratic League on the 5th, it was still considered too broad. The government hopes to simplify the problem and solve the more important and urgent ones first. As for the opinions put forward by the Democratic League and others, although the issue of the National Assembly has been mentioned, there is no definite suggestion on the postponement. The government representatives stated that the National Assembly would not be postponed.

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th Dispatch] Representatives of the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social dignitaries have agreed to the new plan for peace talks on the 5th. It is reported that the content only focuses on the resumption of negotiations, and the form of the meeting is still to be finalized. Some people believe that it is too early to say that a comprehensive meeting will be held on the 6th.

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th Dispatch] Zhang Junmai visited Shao Lizi in the morning of the 5th, then visited the American Ambassador, reiterated the mediator's opinion, and attended a meeting held at the Bank of Communications at 10 o'clock. Zhou Enlai was also invited to attend and reported on the contacts with the US and the government since the ceasefire in June, as well as the Communist Party's opinions on the peace talk process, listing the key points of the troop deployment in great detail. In the afternoon at 4 o'clock, government representatives Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Zhang Lisheng, and Lei Zhen gathered at Wu Tiecheng's residence. At the same time, Miao Jiaming, Mo Dehui, Zhang Junmai, Liang Shuming, Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Bojun, and Luo Longji also attended. Zhang Junmai and others reported on the Communist Party's opinions and put forward more concrete opinions. Then, government and Political Consultative Conference representatives visited the Chairman at 5 o'clock to report everything. The Chairman immediately expressed that the government sincerely seeks peace and agrees to reopen the peace talks, but the process and form of the peace talks are still to be studied. It is understood that government representatives will meet again at 3 o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th to discuss further, and meet with the people of the Democratic League at 5 o'clock to report the government's attitude. In summary, it seems that there is hope for the opening of peace talks, but it is still difficult to determine how to start it.

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th Dispatch] Communist Party member Wang Bingnan visited the American Ambassador in the morning of the 5th. Fu Jingbo visited Song Ziwen at about 11 o'clock.

However, the arrangement work is extremely busy. The reporter visited the guest house. The internal facilities include the China Cultural Service Agency, which is convenient for representatives to buy books, newspapers, and stationery; a temporary post office, a library (arranged by the Central Library), a supply department, which is operated by a cooperative for laundry work; and a telecommunications bureau, which solves the difficulty of long-distance calls. The restaurant is operated by the Nanjing Catering Industry Association, which entrusts a representative office to handle matters such as sending letters, remittances, and purchasing train tickets on behalf of the representatives. A total of 32 staff members in the five guest houses can cope with all affairs. In addition, there are transportation vehicles for representatives to go out. There are six routes in the city from 7 o'clock, with one bus every hour. In case of special events, application can be made for temporary use. The staff are very humble. If the representatives feel dissatisfied, they can fill in the "Representatives' Opinions on Reception" and send it to the preparatory committee for improvement. In addition, the police department transferred the Chinese military police stationed in Japan to guard the post. Anyone without a pass is not allowed to enter. For a time, reporters were rejected outside the door. It was then decided that those with official agency badges could enter, so that they could be interviewed.

### Xu Chuanlin Elaborates on the Current Situation, Approves of the Responsible Cabinet System

[Our Report] Mr. Xu Fulin, Secretary-General of the Democratic Socialist Party, told reporters on the 5th that he returned to Shanghai on the 1st, so he did not know much about the current situation of the peace talks in Nanjing. He also had no way of knowing the specific content of the new compromise plan reportedly proposed by Mr. Zhang Junmai. However, judging from the various situations reported in the newspapers, there are many difficulties ahead. He heard in Nanjing before that there was a saying that after the opening ceremony of the National Assembly, there would be a recess for several days to discuss the matter at length. However, according to the law, since the National Assembly has been convened, whether or not to recess is the right of the National Assembly itself. In fact, considering the government's eagerness for governance and the goal of permanent peace and unity, even if the meeting is postponed, it will never damage the government's prestige. He deeply hopes that the government will be open and honest, think from a long-term and broad perspective, and always prioritize tolerance. Mr. Xu believes that the reorganization of the National Government is also difficult in fact. After the establishment of the coalition government in the future, it is feared that a lot of time will be spent on disputes, and the administrative efficiency may not have great progress; what is valuable about the coalition government is that it is a necessary transitional stage before reaching a truly democratic government. Regarding the draft constitution, Mr. Xu said that he himself had participated in drafting the constitution more than once. He met Sun Ke and Wang Honghui, who are currently sorting out the draft constitution, in Nanjing a few days ago. He believes that although the views of all parties on the draft constitution are different, there should not be any serious problems in general. He himself believes that a responsible cabinet system is more appropriate.

### Clauses on Opening Haikou Must Be Properly Used

Shanghai Shipping Industry Submits Opinions

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] According to Mr. Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the Shipping Industry Association, Article 22 of the Navigation Section of the Sino-US Treaty of Commerce stipulates that the various taxes and fees levied on the ships of the contracting countries shall not be higher than those of domestic ships. Paragraph 2 of Article 23 stipulates that the premiums, tax refunds, and other preferential treatments of any kind given to goods exported and imported by domestic ships shall also be given to the ships of the contracting countries. These two points are not conducive to the national merchant ships and international trade of countries with immature industries and shipping industries. It is hoped that vigilance will be exercised in the implementation to avoid adverse consequences.

Paragraph 1 of Article 21 stipulates that there should be freedom of commerce and navigation between the territories of the contracting parties. This freedom should refer to international navigation. The ports where ships of the contracting countries can dock should refer to the coastal ports of commerce open to international navigation in the country, such as Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. The right to open or not to open these ports of commerce is in the hands of the national government.

Article 24 stipulates that the ships of the contracting countries may load and unload a part of the cargo at any port or place within the territorial waters of the country that is open to foreign commerce and navigation, and then transport the remaining cargo to other ports. This kind of accommodation is also very prone to abuse.

Paragraph 2 of the same article, regarding the assumed most-favored-nation clause for inland river navigation and coastal trade, is actually superfluous. The new Sino-US equality clearly stipulates that the United States abandons its rights to inland river navigation and coastal trade in China. The treaty is based on the agreement supplemented by the former clause. However, some people believe that after the treaty is concluded, China will not guarantee the right to inland river and coastal navigation, which is a misunderstanding. If the government opens up inland river and coastal navigation, our shipping industry will resolutely oppose it. International navigation has been established since the 16th century with the establishment of the high seas system, and the commercial revolution broke the old rules of closing the country to the outside world, which has been generally adopted by all countries. Except for military reasons, few people prohibit it. Now is the time for China to provide relief and reconstruction, and it needs the United States to transport a large number of machines and materials. Local products such as tung oil, raw silk, tea, pig bristles, and medicinal materials are also in urgent need of promotion and export. It is deeply hoped that after the implementation of the Sino-US Treaty of Commerce, economic cooperation between the two countries will be strengthened, and the United States will be able to transfer its surplus ships and shipbuilding equipment to China on favorable terms to help us establish a new-style merchant fleet. This is what the national shipping industry urgently hopes from the United States and the public.

[Our Nanjing Office, 5th Dispatch] According to sources in diplomatic circles, the draft of the new Sino-British Treaty of Commerce has recently been completed and is currently being reviewed by Li Gan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Supreme Economic Commission, and other experts. It will be formally signed soon. It is heard that the content of the new treaty is roughly the same as that of the new Sino-US Treaty.

At 10:30 AM, Judge Wang Hongquan, accompanied by Clerk Chen Zuo, opened the investigation court. Sheng, wearing a gray striped woolen jacket, blue silk zipper narrow-leg pants, and broken black satin round-toe shoes, was escorted into court by his family. He was hunched over in the defendant's seat, his figure withered, his hair streaked with gray, his beady eyes opening and closing from time to time, and his toothless, sunken mouth muttering defenses in an inaudible voice, completely in the demeanor of an old gun. In court, he was questioned one by one about his property and various property rights lawsuits recently received by the court. Sheng also answered each question, cunningly claiming that all his property was purchased out of a "charitable heart" and through "legal procedures," and that he never took advantage of the enemy's power to forcibly seize or purchase anything. Regarding the various property rights lawsuits obtained by the High Court a few days ago, he excused himself by saying that the accusers were "extremely poor and bored, and falsely accused him in times of danger." Sheng also claimed: "All my family property has been sealed by the Military Statistics Bureau, which can be said to be all confiscated. Some time ago, I saw in the Shanghai newspaper that the list of my property, the 62 gold bars, had become 47. I request the court to issue a document to the Military Statistics Bureau and the Enemy Property Bureau to first send the list for legal processing." The court agreed. The interrogation ended at 11:45 AM, and the court ordered his return to custody. This cunning old man in his seventies was again escorted out of the courtroom by his family, his gait staggering and his face ashen, his miserable state both laughable and pitiable. During the enemy-puppet period, Sheng organized the "Hongji Shantang" in Shanghai, promoting the policy of comforting the dead, and served as a tool for the tiger, committing heinous crimes. The court attaches great importance to this. In addition, Luo Hongyi, a member of Sheng's gang, will be interrogated in the High Court at 10 AM on the morning of the 6th.

### Guan Yixian, a Traitorous Journalist in North China, is on Trial

Categorically Denies Providing Intelligence to the Enemy

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th] Guan Yixian, a well-known puppet journalist and director of the intelligence bureau in North China, was publicly tried in the Hebei High Court at 2 PM today. The spectator area was packed. During the interrogation, Judge Wu Guan specially emphasized the intelligence work, but Guan categorically denied it, saying that the bureau's job was to manage puppet newspapers, magazines, and broadcasting associations, and was purely a propaganda agency. Everything was in accordance with the command and plan of the enemy's military news department. If it can be confirmed that he provided intelligence to the enemy, he is willing to be judged by the national law. Regarding his positions as the president of the puppet North China News, the advisor of the puppet China News Agency, and the headmaster of the puppet China Journalism College, he said that he was forced to do so.

### Printing and Typesetting Workers Strike; Hong Kong Newspapers Suspended Publication for One Day; Work Resumed Last Night, Both Parties Agreed to Arbitration

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 5th] As a result of the strike by printing and typesetting workers late last night, 1.5 million of our compatriots in Hong Kong have no newspapers to read today. The strike affected a total of seven morning newspapers and five evening newspapers, in addition to some small publications. The workers demanded that food and lodging be provided free of charge in addition to their regular wages, which, when combined, would be equivalent to a 100% increase in wages. The publishers said that such an increase would inevitably lead to financial difficulties, and as a result, most newspapers would be forced to close.

[United Press, Hong Kong, 5th] Chinese printing workers have resumed work tonight after a 24-hour strike. The strike was caused by demands for free food and lodging, and it has now been agreed to proceed with arbitration.

This treatment shall apply to exchange rates and to any prohibitions, restrictions, delays, taxes, or other charges applicable to the exchanges, loans, and other transactions described in this paragraph. In short, the implementation of any such control shall not affect the competitive relationship between the nationals, juridical persons, and organizations of the other High Contracting Party and the nationals, juridical persons, and organizations of any third country in a way that is detrimental to that High Contracting Party.

### Starting from the Absurd Statement of the Chinese Communist Party

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) delegation issued an absurd statement on the 4th of this month, with two main points: (1) The National Assembly convened on November 12 was a unilateral action by the Kuomintang government in violation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). The PCC resolutions are a temporary constitution, so any violation is an act of destroying the law, and the CCP protests against participating. (2) The claim that the "draft constitution formulated by the PCC Constitutional Draft Review Committee is the blueprint" is unfounded both legally and factually. We find it very surprising: the CCP is actually talking about "law" today, actually demanding that there be a basis in "law," and even pointing out that the National Government's convening of the National Assembly on the 12th of this month is an "act of destroying the law." This is truly a legal theory of wild imagination!

In response to this absurd statement by the CCP, the government has already issued a rebuttal yesterday, generally saying: Whether the National Assembly can be convened as scheduled depends on whether the number of participating representatives reaches the legal quorum. The CCP's participation is purely a political issue, so if enough representatives report to meet the quorum, it can be held. Even if the CCP refuses to participate, it will not prevent the National Assembly from being convened as scheduled. As for which side's "law," the government's or the CCP's, is more reasonable, clear-sighted people can understand without being told.

First, we must remind everyone in the government and the public: Today, China has only one legitimate government, and that is the National Government, which is recognized by both domestic and foreign parties; today, China only has laws passed by the legal legislative body of the National Government that the people should abide by. No matter how the National Government will be reorganized recently, before the constitution is promulgated and constitutional government is implemented, China is still in the period of political tutelage in the process of revolutionary nation-building based on the Three Principles of the People. The reason why the National Government wants to convene the National Assembly today is to move from political tutelage to constitutional government step by step. However, in this transitional period, if everyone does not abide by the law first, especially if they can overstep the law to accommodate realistic politics, who will respect the constitution produced in the process of violating the law? Therefore, the CCP is racking its brains at this moment, trying to hold up the two words "destroying the law" to scare the government, fool the people, and shake their determination to convene the National Assembly as scheduled. In fact, if we don't talk about the law, everything the CCP has done is a violation of the law. The CCP's "destruction of the law" theory is tantamount to exposing its own crimes! What legal basis does the "Border Region Government" in Yan'an have? What legal basis does the title "Democratic Allied Forces" have? What legal basis is there for banning legal tender and over-issuing anti-Japanese currency and border notes? What legal basis is there for the conscription and taxation in the "Liberated Areas"? The CCP's own acts of destroying the law and disrupting discipline are too numerous to mention, but they are all ignored, and instead, they falsely accuse our country's only legitimate government of ordering the convening of the National Assembly to make a constitution as "destroying the law." This is truly an unprecedented story!

Second, regarding the nature of the Political Consultative Conference, we pointed out at the time that it was merely a political measure to resolve party disputes, a political meeting where all parties exchanged opinions and reached common conclusions, and should never be regarded as a national legislative body, let alone a body representing public opinion. Therefore, mutual respect for the PCC resolutions is the political responsibility of all parties, and not a legal issue at all. In other words, if the PCC resolutions have not been passed by the national legislative body and the procedures have not been approved by the people's representatives, then there is no way to talk about "law," let alone falsely calling it a "temporary constitution"? Since there is no such thing as a temporary constitution, how can the convening of the National Assembly on the 12th of this month be forcibly labeled as an "act of destroying the law"? We must make it clear that, in the eyes of the people, the PCC resolutions are nothing more than a gentleman's agreement on a political truce between various parties, and have nothing to do with the people of the whole country. Moreover, the focus of the PCC resolutions was originally nothing more than reorganizing the National Government, convening the National Assembly, and formulating a constitution based on the revision opinions suggested by the PCC. Today, the government is working hard to implement these points. The government first expressed its willingness to reorganize the National Government Committee immediately, and then expressed that the National Assembly's constitution-making would be based on the draft constitution formulated by the PCC Constitutional Draft Review Committee. It can be seen that the government is sincerely abiding by the PCC resolutions to fulfill its political responsibilities. On the other hand, the CCP is not satisfied with reorganizing the National Government Committee, does not disclose the list of National Assembly representatives, and even openly declares its refusal to participate in the National Assembly, and then incites other parties to echo it, in an attempt to obstruct the work of the National Assembly to make a constitution. Therefore, it is the CCP itself that violates the PCC resolutions!

In short, standing from the people's standpoint, we want to shout loudly, please all parties and factions, open your eyes today to look at Japan, and then look back at yourselves. Be very vigilant, and never cause trouble again, harming the overall situation of the country, especially do not mistakenly fall into the CCP's trap of destroying the country's peace and unity! Today, we only have one demand, which is to reorganize the National Government Committee and convene the National Assembly as scheduled to make a constitution. Only in this way can the country achieve true peace and unity. The government must carry this out responsibly, and all parties and factions with a national concept must also cooperate in this way to be worthy of the people. Those who waver, hesitate, wait and see, and delay this undead and unalive situation, or even destroy and obstruct it, causing the country to fall into a more chaotic situation, are all sinners of the nation for thousands of years!

### Four Foreign Ministers Discuss the Italian Peace Treaty; Sharp Disputes Between the US and the Soviet Union; Will Listen to the Opinions of Representatives from Italy and Yugoslavia

[Reuters, New York, 5th] The four foreign ministers are scheduled to continue their meeting at 8:30 PM today. (4:30 AM, Shanghai time, 6th) Before the meeting yesterday, the four foreign ministers received a protest letter from the Italian government regarding some parts of the peace treaty, which pointed out the excessive amount of reparations, the impropriety of the demarcation of boundaries, and stated that the treaty was not in accordance with the principles of the Atlantic Charter.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 5th] The four foreign ministers met in the afternoon yesterday in the Astoria Hotel parlor to discuss the disputed points in the Italian peace treaty. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov frequently argued with the other foreign ministers, so there were few concrete results after three hours of discussion. The first topic of discussion was the border issue between Italy and Yugoslavia. Both Italy and Yugoslavia had the right to speak, but the question was which country should speak first. After careful discussion, it was decided that the Italian representative would express his opinion first, and then the Yugoslav representative would state his opinion.

Next, regarding the clauses on the border between Austria and Italy, Molotov refused to insert the agreement between the two countries on the status of the people of Tyrol into the peace treaty. Byrnes said that the four foreign ministers had no reason to abandon the decision adopted by a two-thirds majority at the Paris Peace Conference. The four powers had put a lot of effort into the signing of the Austrian treaty and should formally approve it as the right thing to do. However, Molotov firmly refused, saying that the people of Tyrol were dissatisfied with this agreement, so the issue remained unresolved.

Then, the discussion turned to the articles added to the peace treaty, which stipulated that the people in the ceded territory of Italy should be guaranteed human rights and various fundamental freedoms. This article had been passed by a two-thirds majority at the Peace Conference. Molotov said that the insertion of this was not necessary, because the victorious allies did not need to be suspected of intending to deprive people of their freedom, and that the inclusion of this article contradicted previous articles. Byrnes and Molotov debated repeatedly, without any agreement being reached. The issue was also temporarily shelved.

Finally, the discussion turned to Italy's reparations to Greece and Yugoslavia. The Paris Peace Conference decided that each country would receive US$100 million. Molotov believed that this figure was unfair, because the loss of the port of Trieste had greatly reduced what Yugoslavia had hoped to gain from the Peace Conference. Therefore, the compensation to Yugoslavia and Greece should be calculated at a ratio of two to one. British Foreign Secretary Bevin vehemently opposed this, saying that he would never accept this plan, because in his view, Greece had already been treated unfairly. Byrnes pointed out that the ceded territory that Yugoslavia had obtained, including coal mines and industrial equipment, was worth US$195 million, which was part of the reparations. However, Molotov expressed his disagreement, saying that this equipment was located within Yugoslav territory and could not be used as reparations. Molotov took the opportunity to explain the harsh treatment of Yugoslavia in the peace treaty, and that the four foreign ministers should not impose too much loss on that country.

[Reuters, New York, 4th] Before the foreign ministers' meeting was convened this afternoon, Byrnes held talks with Bevin, Molotov, and French Deputy Foreign Minister Chauvel separately. Byrnes had told Bevin that the handling of the Palestine issue had been transferred to him by President Truman. During their meeting today, they also discussed the merger of the British and American zones in Germany. Byrnes said that he would discuss the Palestine issue with them during the time outside of the foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the peace treaty.

### Trusteeship Issues Unfold in a War of Words; The British and Soviet Blocs Stand in Opposition; The Prime Minister of South Africa Demands Full Annexation of Southwest Africa; Thomas Describes British Empire Colonial Policy

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 5th] The Trusteeship Committee will continue its meeting at 8:00 PM today. Indian representative Singh will speak first, and will likely propose a new resolution advocating that trust territories be governed by the United Nations, rather than by individual countries.

[Central News Agency, New York, 4th Dispatch] The United Nations Trusteeship Committee began its work today. Before submitting appropriate recommendations for action to the General Assembly and possibly establishing a Trusteeship Council, the Committee will first examine the agreements and reports submitted by the major powers responsible for governing non-self-governing territories. South African Prime Minister Smuts formally requested the annexation of the Southwest African territory under his mandate today. Smuts denied Ukraine's accusation that South Africa's request was sudden, saying that he had announced his desire at the San Francisco Conference last year and at Bredton this year, and that he had anticipated Soviet opposition beforehand, but he did not take Soviet opposition seriously, saying that the matter would be discussed with the people of Southwest Africa. Smuts told the Soviet Union that there were some territories that had been annexed without similar consultations. Later, another representative of the British Empire, Colonial Under-Secretary Thomas, spoke, counterattacking the Soviet Union's accusations, condemning the Soviet Union for shelving Britain's draft trusteeship agreement and preventing the early establishment of the Trusteeship Council. The "trusteeship battle" is unfolding, with the lineup being the British Commonwealth against the Soviet Union.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 4th] British Colonial Under-Secretary Thomas said in the Trusteeship Committee that Molotov had previously stated that the United Nations organization had been established for two years, but the mandated countries had not taken any steps to establish a Trusteeship Council. The British delegation was deeply surprised by this statement, wondering how his intelligence was so poor. As far as Britain is concerned, every step has been taken, and Britain was the first to publish the terms of the mandate. Thomas explained Britain's colonial policy, saying that the trusteeship system drafted by Britain was a product of modern British policy, and that the basic freedoms in British colonies were more adequately guaranteed than in many other sovereign countries. Some say that colonies are a source of wealth for Britain, but in fact Britain has planned to spend 120 million pounds paid by British taxpayers on the colonies in the next ten years. Britain has always believed that self-government is the ultimate destiny of the colonies, so it will do its best to train the people of the colonies to develop towards self-government. [Our Correspondent in New York, 4th]

### Our Correspondent Broadcasts in New York

[Our Correspondent in New York, 4th] The United Nations Radio and WLIB Radio invited our correspondent Mao Shuqing to give a radio speech. Mr. Mao broadcast in Chinese on the United Nations Radio, entitled "Chinese Journalists at the General Assembly." This afternoon, he also broadcast in English on WLIB Radio, discussing the Chinese Communist Party issue, strongly stating that "this issue is China's internal affair and can only be resolved by China itself."

### Economic Unification of Germany; British and Americans to Open Negotiations

[Report from this newspaper] London, 5th Broadcast: The British and American sides have decided to start negotiations on the issue of economic cooperation between the two countries in Germany next week. The location will be in Washington. Experts from the State Department and the Treasury Department of the United States will participate. Key British officials have also flown to Washington to assist the staff of the embassy in the United States in conducting negotiations.

### Security Council Adopts Polish Proposal; The Spanish Case Removed from the Agenda; To Be Directly Debated by the General Assembly

[Reuters, New York, 4th] The Security Council unanimously passed Poland's resolution today, removing the Spanish issue from the Security Council's agenda so that it could be directly debated by the full General Assembly. Polish representative Lange said that there were already many records on this issue, and these documents would be handed over to the full General Assembly for handling. This move does not affect the rights and privileges of the Security Council, and any member is still free to raise the issue. Poland's motion was seconded by the United States, which advocated that the Council should study whether other issues should be handled in the same way. This was clearly an indirect indication of the long-pending issues of the Soviet Union and Iran.

### Political Committee Discusses Membership Applications of Outer Mongolia, etc.

[Ta Kung Pao News] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: The United Nations Political Committee met at 1:00 PM today (midnight in Shanghai) to discuss the membership issues of Albania, Outer Mongolia, Ireland, and Portugal.

### Unity of Far Eastern Countries Requires Greater Activity

Chinese and Indian Representatives Issue Call

[Reuters, New York, 4th] Indian chief representative Pandit Nehru addressed a reception hosted by Asian groups, calling on Far Eastern nations to participate more actively in world affairs in order to catch up quickly. Other speakers included Chinese representative Zhang Pingqun and Iranian Ambassador to the United States Ala, among others.

### Ceasefire Ordered in East Indies; Indian Troops to Withdraw by the End of the Month

[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 4th] The Dutch and Indonesian military authorities formally issued a ceasefire order today in accordance with the ceasefire agreement recently signed here by both sides.

[United Press, New Delhi, 4th] The Indian Provisional Government's Ministry of Defense announced today that Indian troops would withdraw from the East Indies by the end of the month. Since the Indian troops began fighting in the East Indies, a total of 966 people have died, 1,684 have been injured, and 222 have gone missing.

Wallace hints at dinner party

### If the Democratic Party Fails in the Election, a Third Party Will Appear in the United States

Wallace hints at dinner party

[United Press, New York, 4th] The National Political Action Committee's campaign has come to an end. At its final dinner party today, former Secretary of Commerce Wallace and other speakers clearly hinted that if progressive Democratic candidates fail in Tuesday's election, they will lead the organization of a third party.

### If India and Pakistan Do Not Stop Conflicts, Twenty People Say They Will Starve Themselves to Death

Riots in India intensified yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] London, 5th Broadcast: Gandhi today called on India and Pakistan to end the conflict within 24 hours, otherwise he will starve himself to death to apologize to the people. Conflicts in India intensified today.

[United Press, London, 4th] Undersecretary of State for India Henderson declared in the Lower House today that as a result of the Indian-Pakistani conflict from July 1 to October 30 of this year, a total of 5,018 people have been killed and 13,320 have been injured.

[Reuters, Bombay, 4th] There were 17 stabbing incidents in Bombay today, but no one died as a result. The situation in Ahmedabad, a major industrial city in Bombay Province, has improved. The military and police took special precautions in major cities such as Bombay, Calcutta, Patna, and Ahmedabad during the Muslim Bakr-Eid festival.

### First Major Election in the United States After the War; The Republican Party is Doing its Best to Compete; The Outcome of the Election Determines the Presidential Candidate

[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 5th Broadcast, New York News: President Truman voted at 3:15 PM today and then took a train back to Washington.

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: The US election was held today in an enthusiastic atmosphere, but in some areas, voting has not yet been completed due to transportation being blocked by heavy snow (27 inches deep). Preliminary results show that Dewey can be re-elected as the Governor of New York State. Dewey has received many votes this time, indicating that he has hopes for the presidency in the future.

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] On the eve of the election of all members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the senators by 35 million men and women citizens of the United States, the Republican Party's victory is expected by most people. Those participating in the campaign are still giving speeches everywhere tonight, but President Truman has not said a word since the start of the campaign. The House of Representatives has a total of 432 seats, and the senators to be re-elected have a total of 35 seats. In the current House of Representatives, the Republican Party occupies 192 seats. If it can win 26 more seats, it can gain a majority advantage of 216 seats. The Democratic Party originally occupied 235 seats. If it only loses 17 seats, it can still maintain its control. In the Senate, the Republican Party originally had 39 seats. If it can win 10 more seats, it can gain the upper hand. The Democratic Party originally had 56 seats. If it only loses 7 seats, it will not affect the retention of its advantage. Before the election, the two parties inevitably made predictions about the election results. Democratic Party Chairman Hannegan said: The number of seats for the Democratic Party in both houses is expected to increase again, while Republican Party Chairman Reece said: The Republican Party in the House of Representatives may increase by 7 to 14 seats. Political observers also predict that a third party, the Labor Party, will be formed, and at least four people are expected to lead the new party to success in the election. These four people are Wallace, who recently resigned as Secretary of Commerce, Interior Secretary of the former Roosevelt cabinet, Ickes, who also resigned due to disagreements with Truman, Murray, the president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, who helped President Roosevelt win four presidential elections, and Senator Pepper, the far-left authority on foreign policy in the Senate. However, these four people seem to be willing to stay in the Democratic Party and continue their work in their positions. They hope that by the time of the next presidential election in 1948, their efforts and the inevitable economic development can change the Democratic Party's organization and make it a progressive party. If so, the Democratic Party will lose the support of conservative Democrats in the southern states, but it can also gain the support of liberals from the Republican Party.

[United Press, New York, 4th] Today, more than 35 million voters in the United States elected senators and representatives from more than 1,000 candidates. The results of voting in the 16 major states will likely indicate the trend of the US Congress in the next two years. The Republican and Democratic parties are fiercely competing in these states. Which party will control both the House and Senate of the 80th Congress will determine the situation. In addition, governors are also being re-elected in 30 states at the same time. The election trend is most notable for the Republican Party's offensive to seize nine Senate seats from the Democratic Party. If this is successful, the Republican Party will gain control of the Senate for the first time in 16 years. These nine seats are being elected in the nine states of New York, Massachusetts, Missouri, Idaho, Montana, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, and New Mexico. The Democratic Party is also making a desperate effort to win votes in Kentucky and California. The results of the elections in the above 15 states, plus Illinois, which does not require fierce competition, can influence the overall situation. Most observers predict that this election war can measure the public's level of resistance to the Truman administration's handling of meat and other controls, and the dissatisfaction with the general situation of demobilization. Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace said in a speech in New York that if the Republican Party wins, the world can regard this as a sign of reaction in the United States. Republican Senator Taft said in Chicago that the Democratic and Republican parties are almost identical on foreign policy.

### The De Gaulle Faction in France: Expressing Pro-American, Anti-Soviet Sentiments

[News Agency Report] London, May 5th (Radio Broadcast): Mr. Capitant, a former Minister of Education and close associate of De Gaulle, stated in a speech at a De Gaulle League gathering today that the alliance's foreign policy is to ally with the United States to prevent the threat of Soviet imperialism. This speech is the most explicit pro-American, anti-Soviet declaration by a French politician since the liberation of France. Most observers believe that the De Gaulle faction has gradually abandoned its previous strict neutral stance. [Special Dispatch from our Tokyo Correspondent, dated the 4th] After the promulgation of the new Japanese constitution, the Liberal, Progressive, and Social Democratic parties have all expressed their admiration. The Communist Party stated that the new constitution still preserves capitalism and the Emperor system of large landowners, and that they will strive for a republican constitution to protect civil rights and realize democracy. Japanese democratic movement leader Ozaki stated that on the day the old constitution was promulgated, the unfortunate assassination of the Minister of Education occurred, and he hopes that a similar event will not occur today. However, the day before the promulgation of the new constitution, the Tokyo District Court sentenced Matsushima Matsutaro to eight months imprisonment for defaming the Emperor.

### Jewish Detainees Released by Britain; Jewish Purchase of Hundreds of Ships a Natural Phenomenon for Refugees

[News Agency Report] Paris, May 5th (Urgent Radio Dispatch from London): The British government has announced the release of several Palestinian Arabs who have been detained until now. The rumor that detainees from Jewish associations have also been released has been confirmed by British officials. These Arab figures were imprisoned on the island of Seyschelles for several years for conducting anti-British propaganda.

[United Press, Haifa, May 5th] British naval intelligence officers here said today that Jewish secret organizations have purchased at least a hundred ships to transport Jewish refugees from Europe to Palestine. Much of the funding for these ships was raised in the United States. British naval authorities will hold a meeting in Malta this week to discuss ways to prevent the illegal immigration of Jewish refugees to Palestine.

### New York Times Publishes Article Evaluating Sino-American Commercial Treaty

[Central News Agency, New York, May 5th] The "New York Times" commented on the Sino-American commercial treaty, stating that this is the first treaty with extensive content signed by the government after the war, and that it will set a precedent for future treaties that the United States may wish to conclude with other countries. A key provision of the treaty stipulates that any mineral development rights granted by either party to a third country must also be granted to the other party. The newspaper stated that Assistant Secretary of State Clayton had stated that the U.S. government will provide greater support for investments in the development of products it lacks or relies on from overseas. Based on this point, the provisions in the treaty are of particular significance.

### Sino-American Commerce Association Expanding Scope of Activities; Membership Reaches 400 Companies

[U.S. Information Service, New York, May 5th] Mr. Feuer, the president of the Sino-American Commerce Association, announced that the association's scope of activities will be expanded to other regions in Asia, becoming the first American trade association dedicated to promoting American trade with the Far East and India. The association's name has been changed to the Far East American Commerce and Industry Association, but its China branch will retain its original name.

### Mayor Explains Cost of Living Index, Clarifies Compilation Principles Limited to Daily Necessities, Gold-Based Wage Calculation Already Better Than Pre-War, End of Solar and Lunar Year Are Two Major Hurdles

[News Agency Report] Regarding the cost of living index published monthly by the municipal government, many workers in the city have had doubts in the past two months and have requested explanations and improvements. Mayor Wu stated at yesterday afternoon's reception for the heads of various newspapers that in the past two months, many workers in the city have had doubts about the cost of living index published by the municipal government. The reason for this is that various places compile price indices, while this city compiles a cost of living index. The scope of price indices is wider, including soaring construction materials, and therefore the index shows a sharp monthly increase. However, this is not the case with the cost of living index. The current workers' cost of living index only uses daily necessities such as rice, fuel, and cloth as the basis. The municipal government has always taken suppressing these basic commodity prices as the principle, so daily necessities have never fluctuated greatly. This is the main reason why the cost of living index has risen so minimally. If yarn prices stabilize, cloth prices are expected to fall, so the November cost of living index will not only not rise, but may even fall.

The reason why workers are so suspicious is that they see the frequent rises in price indices in various places. At the same time, workers occasionally go to see a movie or buy a box of matches, and they think that prices are soaring. However, this is not enough to serve as the basis for the cost of living index. The price index and the cost of living index absolutely cannot be confused, and the price increases of certain imported goods and luxury goods are not the daily necessities of workers, so they cannot be included as the basis for calculating the cost of living index.

Mayor Wu also used various examples to make workers understand that due to the adjustment of base salaries, they are already better than before the war. Before the war, wages were only enough to buy 1.5 dan of rice, while now each worker's monthly income is enough to buy more than 3.5 dan of rice. Even calculated in gold, workers' income today is better than before the war. Therefore, the workers' cost of living index has clearly increased compared to before the war. According to Mayor Wu's observation, the end of the solar year and the end of the lunar year this year are two major hurdles that must be overcome with the close cooperation of both labor and capital. If workers can no longer understand the current difficulties of the capitalists, it is tantamount to "killing the chicken to get the egg," and the result will definitely be that the chicken dies, and the egg cannot be obtained either.

### Deeply Hope City Saves Electricity, Benefit Increase Production

Mayor Wu also emphasized the issue of electricity conservation in the city at the reception for the heads of various newspapers, saying that Shanghai can currently produce 60,000 pieces of cotton yarn per day, and if all spindles are started, it can reach 80,000 pieces. Although the production volume of 60,000 pieces is enough to meet the needs of Shanghai, we must also take into account the needs of other regions. The reason why the current production of cotton yarn in Shanghai cannot reach its peak is purely due to the insufficient supply of electricity. Therefore, to encourage production, electricity must be saved. Mayor Wu also said that the implementation of electricity saving measures will inevitably have many difficulties, but the authorities are determined to implement them because it is necessary. The reason why the wartime zoning power outage method was not applied in Shanghai is due to the different environment and the authorities' understanding of the citizens. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that citizens can save electricity automatically, without the authorities taking punitive measures. Lights on all night in stores and excessively bright lights in households are a waste, and it is hoped that they can be saved automatically. If households with ten lights reduce them to seven, or originally 100 candle power lights reduce them to 70 candle power, it will not hinder work within the household and will greatly benefit increased production.

### City Museum to Exhibit Sun Yat-sen's Calligraphy

[News Agency Report] Yang Kuan, curator of the Shanghai Municipal Museum (formerly the principal of the Japanese elementary school on North Szechuan Road), has decided to hold a grand Sun Yat-sen calligraphy exhibition at the museum on the 12th of this month, Sun Yat-sen's birthday. On display will be Sun Yat-sen's autographed horizontal scrolls, letters, appointment orders, photos of Sun Yat-sen's various works and life, Sun Yat-sen's works, the books and newspapers he usually read, and records of Sun Yat-sen's words and deeds, books, relics, etc. Most of the relics were collected from Ye Gongchuo, Feng Ziyou, and Lu Danlin. In addition, the museum is also discussing with Dean Sun Zhesheng to borrow some of Sun Yat-sen's relics.

Among the most valuable exhibits is a letter from Sun Yat-sen to Zhang Zuolin in 1923, requesting him to send troops to suppress Chen Jiongming in Guangzhou. There is also a letter from Sun Yat-sen to Ye Gongchuo, informing him to raise more funds for the suppression of the rebel army, as Ye was the Minister of Finance at the time. This exhibition will be the first comprehensive and rich Sun Yat-sen relic exhibition in the city. There was a similar exhibition in Chongqing in 1943, but it was not as rich as this one.

Also reported: The museum welcomes people from all walks of life who have Sun Yat-sen's calligraphy, relics, portraits, and various historical materials related to the Founding Father to send them for display. The deadline for submission is 5:00 p.m. on the 10th of this month.

### Site of Municipal Council Still Not Resolved

[News Agency Report] The site of the Municipal Council was previously resolved in a general meeting to be purchased from the enemy property processing bureau, the former site of the Japanese Overseas Autonomous Association on Tihui Road.

As a result, the processing bureau stated that the site was booked by the Central Trust Bureau and the U.S. military authorities, originally expiring on November 14th of this year, but can be extended for three months after the expiration date, and the U.S. military authorities have requested an extension. The Municipal Council believes that the first general meeting will be convened in December, and the issue of the meeting site needs to be resolved urgently. Although the U.S. military headquarters has the right to request an extension of three months, the Trust Bureau has the right to decide, so it still asks the municipal government to contact them and request the return of the site.

The organizational regulations of the committee were passed, and two subgroups were established under the committee: design and distribution, each with five members. It was decided that the purpose of the committee is to recommend the allocation of materials by the headquarters of the Executive Yuan based on the needs of Shanghai, but it does not have the final decision-making power. The main task of the design group is to make various plans according to the actual needs of the relief work in Shanghai. The task of the distribution group is to review and distribute the urgency of materials needed by various units in the city according to the source of materials. At present, the Executive Yuan has limited materials, and the committee will do its best to request them while not allowing waste. Therefore, the work of the two groups should be closely coordinated; empty plans should be avoided as much as possible.

Mr. Nasi stated that he would report the establishment of the committee in Shanghai to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and state its importance, hoping that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration would provide as many materials as possible. The design group is scheduled to hold a meeting next Thursday, and the distribution group is scheduled to hold a meeting next Tuesday, to begin discussing and carrying out work. The actual relief work in the city will be carried out by the municipal government.

### Five Days After Marriage, Bride Imprisoned; Female Special Agent Group Leader Accused of Corruption

[News Agency Report] Ke Jinfeng, a woman from Hubei, alias Wang Huaqing, 26 years old, with a beautiful appearance and a higher education, was formerly a major group leader in the special agent group of the First Brigade of the Second Column of the Military Intelligence Bureau's Special Operations Army. During the enemy and puppet period, she was ordered to be stationed in Wuhan to carry out underground work, and she risked her life several times and made many outstanding achievements. On January 11th of this year, she was accused of corruption by her subordinates in Wuhan, and was subsequently detained by a certain local agency for investigation. As a result, she was allowed to be released on bail, and Hubei merchants Chen Bingchen and Xu Yingzha jointly guaranteed her release. By June 26th, the agency summoned Ke Jinfeng but she did not arrive, so the guarantors Chen and Xu were detained in prison for three months. They were temporarily released on September 23rd and ordered to investigate Ke Jinfeng to bring her to justice. After the two were released, they inquired in many ways and learned that Ke was hiding at her uncle's place at 95 Shandong South Road in Shanghai. They took a car to Shanghai and went to the address at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, found her, and handed her over to the street police, who took her to the Huangpu Police Station. According to Ke Jinfeng's confession: When she was in office, there was Xie Zian, a major staff officer of the regiment, who proposed marriage but was unsuccessful, and Zhu Jieshou, a subordinate, who failed to borrow money. The two then secretly plotted to falsely accuse her of corruption. Now it is known that both of them have been sentenced to seven years in prison. After interrogation, the branch office temporarily detained her, waiting to send her to the local prosecutor's office for verification. It is reported that Ke joined the secret work in October 1940. She was arrested by the Japanese invaders a total of four times and suffered brutal torture, and her right arm has become disabled. After arriving in Shanghai for several months, at the suggestion of her uncle, through the intercession of friends, she married Chen Shoujun, who worked as a packaging merchant. She had only been married for five days and experienced the taste of iron bars.

### The Mystery of Japanese Ship Flying Sun Flag; Various Parties Concerned Expressed Opinions

Since the incident in which ships flying the Japanese flag sailed into the Wusongkou and docked at the Pujiang Qiujiang wharf a few days ago, it has aroused close attention from all parties. Although the main ships have sailed away, this matter is of great importance, and all parties are still very concerned. The reporter specially visited the authorities of various relevant agencies yesterday to inquire about the truth and opinions of the matter, and the details are recorded as follows:

Navy Inspects

(1) Staff Officer Hu of the Fleet Command of the Naval Headquarters, who is responsible for investigating this incident, stated that on the 21st of last month, an American transport ship with a displacement of about 1,800 tons and six Japanese barges (displacement of 267 tons) came from Japan to China. At that time, the navy sent the No. 3 gunboat to the Qiujiang wharf to inspect. The six Japanese ships left Shanghai and sailed away three days later (the 24th). It was recently heard that a Japanese ship had come to Shanghai. The No. 3 gunboat, which was anchored at Gaochang Temple, set out to patrol again, but did not find anything. Staff Officer Hu also stated that according to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the six Japanese barges will come to China again with the American transport ship to carry relief supplies within a few days.

Customs Investigation

(2) Deputy Customs Commissioner Li told the reporter that the customs authorities had not learned of the Japanese ships' entry in advance. After investigation, it was learned that of the seven Japanese ships, six were tugboats and did not carry goods. They were transferred by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration from Japan to the Executive Yuan. The other ship was a escort ship sent by MacArthur's headquarters. The flag hoisted at the bow of the ship was the flag of MacArthur's headquarters, so the customs did not stop it when it entered the port. Subsequently, the customs authorities heard that the ships had flown the Japanese flag, so they sent a letter to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration inquiring about the nature of the ships, but have not received a response to date. Deputy Customs Commissioner Li finally stated that the customs is only responsible for inspecting import and export merchant ships and has no right to interfere with ships transporting relief supplies to and from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Executive Yuan.

United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Tugboats Not Flying

The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Executive Yuan explained as follows: The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration admitted that there were six United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration tugboats that were sailed from Japan to China and handed over to the Executive Yuan. The U.S. military authorities stationed in Japan sent a ship to escort them. It is not known whether the ship flew the Sun flag, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is not responsible. However, the six tugboats did not fly the Japanese flag, and there are photos of the six tugboats taken at the time as proof. The six tugboats have now been handed over to the Executive Yuan for use. As for the Executive Yuan, they are unwilling to comment on this matter, only admitting that the six tugboats have been transferred by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to the Executive Yuan's Water Transport Brigade for transportation.

### Yangjing Town Drug Trafficking Suspect Case: Residents' Testimony in Court Inconsistent

Accusation of "King of Heroin" Suddenly Claims Legitimate Grain Merchant

[Our Newspaper's Report] The three suspects arrested by the police in Yangjing Town in mid-last month for trafficking heroin, Li Yangshi, Huang Aliu, and Huang Panshi, were initially tried yesterday by the Fourth Criminal Division of the District Court. Residents of Yangjing jointly accused Huang Aliu of being a notorious drug dealer, known as the "King of Heroin."

Li Yangshi also denied ever buying heroin from Huang Aliu. Judge Shen Tianbao stated that this case still needed to gather evidence and decided to postpone the trial. The defendant's lawyer requested bail for the defendant, but Judge Shen stated that if the trafficking was proven, the sentence would be severe, so the request was denied.

### German Resident's Residence: Forged Chinese National's Name, French Resident Illegally Occupies, Attempt to Sell Gold Bars, Reported and Handed Over to the Judiciary

[Our Newspaper's Report] German resident Jia Tu, who has resided in this city for a long time, owns a residence at 302 Rue Liasse (now Middle Sichuan Road), occupying 0.81 acres, and holds property certificate No. 14235 from the former French Concession Land Office. In 1944, when the German army was losing on the European battlefield, Jia Tu, foreseeing Germany's inevitable defeat, consulted with Frenchman Pu Xu. Pu forged the name of a Chinese national, "Jin Mantang," to transfer the property to the puppet Land Administration Bureau, obtaining a license and a fake contract. After the victory, Jia Tu was briefly held in an internment camp but later managed to secure his release and continued to reside in the house. Recently, as Jia Tu was being sent back to Germany, the Frenchman Pu Xu came forward, falsely claiming that the property belonged to the Mei Yi Electrical Engineering Firm at 2, Lane 645, Fuxu Road (now Yan'an Middle Road), and attempted to sell it for twenty-seven gold bars. In September, someone secretly reported this to the investigation team and the handling bureau. Recently, the investigation team handed the case over to the judiciary for handling.

### Kidnapping and Forced Marriage Leads to Suspended Sentence: Demanding Compensation for Losses, Changes Heart Upon Seeing the Woman, Unwilling to Terminate Engagement in Court

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Civil Division of the District Court yesterday heard a case of breach of engagement. The plaintiff, Zhang Shunfa, 23 years old, from Nantong, became engaged to Ju Zhuzhu (22 years old), a local, through matchmakers Yan Hanshi and Li Shishi on February 22 of this year. They set the wedding date for the eighth month of the lunar calendar this summer. However, Zhang Shunfa could not wait for the wedding date and attempted to "kidnap" Ju Zhuzhu in May, but was unsuccessful. During the "kidnapping," he injured Ju Zhuzhu's mother, who sued him in the District Court. Zhang Shunfa was sentenced to six months in prison with a two-year suspended sentence for assault. Zhang Shunfa, feeling resentful, hired a lawyer to demand that Ju Zhuzhu compensate him for losses of 1.68 million yuan. When the court session opened at 4 p.m. yesterday, the defendant, Ju Zhuzhu, appeared in court with her mother. Ju Zhuzhu, wearing a light blue cheongsam, stated her reasons in a soft voice, which was quite touching. Under these circumstances, Zhang Shunfa suddenly changed his mind, willing to abandon the demand for compensation and unwilling to terminate the engagement, repeatedly declaring, "I want the person, not the money." However, Ju Zhuzhu firmly stated, "I don't want to marry him," and said: "He is violent by nature, how can I marry him?" The plaintiff's lawyer, seeing Zhang Shunfa change his mind, was greatly surprised and immediately stood up and declared: "The agent only knows to demand compensation. Now that the client wants the person and not the money, the agent has no opinion." The court, feeling that it was inappropriate to make a hasty decision, adjourned the session and announced that a verdict would be delivered on the ninth.

### Throwing Stones and Filling Soil to Repair Seawall: Parts of Liuhe and Haitang Completed, Over 42,000 Labor Days Completed, 85 Tons of Flour Issued as Compensation

[Our Newspaper's Report] The seawalls along the south bank of the Yangtze River from Wusong to Fushan have been in disrepair for years, and were extensively damaged by the enemy and puppet regimes during the occupation, with dozens of breaches. Since its establishment this spring, the Xingzheng Yuan (Executive Yuan) - Jiangsu-Nanjing branch has begun restoration work, and with the assistance of the Water Conservancy Commission, the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, and local county governments, the Jiangnan Seawall Engineering Committee was established to focus on emergency repairs. The section of Dachang Liuhe is contracted by the China Construction Corporation, and a portion has already been completed. The company specially invited the press of this city yesterday to visit.

The completed seawall is 283 meters long, sloping, and constructed with wooden stakes and boulders. There were originally three breaches in this area, and the river water had flooded inland more than once, with the flood in June of this year being the most severe. At that time, the villagers had carried out preliminary repairs. After the China Construction Corporation contracted the project in July, construction began in mid-August. According to the company's engineers, the construction process involves first filling the bottom with soil-filled sacks, and then driving stakes in two rows, front and back, each stake being five meters long. Then, stones and soil are thrown in, for a total of five or six layers. After the surface layer is piled up and leveled, the seawall is completed. The maximum number of workers per day is about 500, currently about 200, all using the method of work for relief, with each person being given six catties of flour per day by the Xingzheng Yuan. The timber is transported from Fujian, and the stones are collected from Jiangyin, Suzhou and other places. According to the announcement of the Taicang County Post-Disaster Relief Association, the overall situation of the project in Taicang County, from Xuejingtang Estuary to Lumingjing, is approximately 25 kilometers long, and it started at the end of March this year. Workers were collected from 47 townships and towns along the seawall, forming 12 major teams to participate in the work. Over 42,000 labor days have been completed, and over 3,700 bags of flour have been issued, totaling 85 tons. Most of the most dangerous earthen seawalls have been filled and repaired, and many of the less important ones are still being filled and repaired.

Tu Da, director of the Xingzheng Yuan - Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch Chief Technician, Deputy Director of the Subei Canal Project Work Relief Bureau, and Zhu Kaijun, speaker of the Taicang County Council, also inspected the site yesterday and made statements to reporters, hoping that all sectors of society would recognize the importance of seawall engineering. Mr. Tu also reported on the work of the Jiangsu-Nanjing branch of the Xingzheng Yuan, stating that relief work is divided into urgent relief and construction projects. In addition to the seawall project which is already underway, the Yangtze River Dike in the Jiangnan area, the Zhenghe Canal, and the restoration projects of provincial highway bridges are also planned to begin. The dredging of the canal in the Jiangbei area had already been assigned to people to go and negotiate during the period of the Communist occupation. Now that it has been recovered, it can be actively carried out. Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong, Zheng Tonghe, director of the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch, and Shen, deputy director of the Water Conservancy Commission, will go to Huaiyin on the 8th of this month for inspection.

### Fuxing Park Temporarily Closed: Preparing for Chrysanthemum Bonsai Exhibition, Works by Kong Zhiqing Will Also Participate

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Chrysanthemum Exhibition organized by the Bureau of Public Works Parks and Fields Administration is scheduled to be held at Fuxing Park starting on the 8th. Fuxing Park has been temporarily closed since yesterday to prepare for the event. This reporter made a special visit last night and saw no less than a thousand pots of chrysanthemums of all sizes in the park, dazzling and eye-catching. In the center of Fuxing Park's large lawn, chrysanthemum mountains are piled up with various chrysanthemums, about two zhang (about 6.6 meters) high, with a conical pointed top. In addition, the remains of the recently deceased panda, Xiaoru, have been made into specimens and are also displayed in Fuxing Park, accompanied by a pine tree and many pots of chrysanthemums as a foil, with a snow mountain as the background. The panda is in a leaping pose, resembling a natural picture.

It is heard that a chrysanthemum bonsai competition will be held at that time. The Bureau of Public Works will hire horticultural experts to serve as judges, and there will be trophies. In addition, the Parks and Fields Administration is scheduled to host the press of this city at Fuxing Park at 3 p.m. tomorrow (the 7th) for a preliminary visit.

### Ban on Outdoor Neon Lights: Manufacturers' Business Affected, Over 3,000 Firms Jointly Request Continued Opening

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to a neon light industry insider who spoke to a reporter, the industry's turnover has decreased by at least half since the authorities banned outdoor neon lights. Other losses are even greater. For example, recently, outdoor neon lights that the industry accepted from customers for installation could not be paid for in most cases after installation because the authorities prohibited them. Currently, the installation of neon lights is limited to indoor use, but there are limited employers, and competition among peers is fierce, and prices have plummeted. If this continues, the factories in the industry will have no choice but to close down. In addition, the businesses of factories and stores in this city have also suffered considerable losses due to the ban on outdoor neon lights. Therefore, more than 3,000 firms have jointly signed their names and affixed their seals, asking the industry to appeal to the authorities to continue to allow outdoor neon lights within the limit of 70% of electricity consumption. According to the investigation, neon lights are not energy-intensive. Each rectifier is equipped with a 50-foot neon tube, and its power consumption is only equal to one hundred incandescent lamps, but the lighting intensity exceeds it. The power consumption of neon light lighting in the city is no more than 300 degrees per day, while the power consumption of ordinary electric lights in the city reaches 67,000 degrees per day. The power consumption of neon lights only accounts for 227th of this amount. Therefore, even if the energy consumption of outdoor neon lights is saved, it will only be 150 degrees per month, which is of no help to factory electricity consumption. On the contrary, the blow to the industry is particularly severe. There are currently 39 companies in the industry, with a total of more than 4,000 employees. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities can reconsider opening outdoor neon lights to consider the difficulties of businesses and maintain the livelihoods of thousands of workers.

### Rundall Case Concludes: High Court Declares Appeal Dismissed

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the case of German spy suspect Shen Ke accusing Rundall, the manager of the United Press Association's China office, of defamation, the District Court has acquitted Rundall. Shen Ke was unwilling to accept this and appealed to the High Court. Several trials were held, and the two sides debated fiercely, which has been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. At 10 a.m. yesterday morning, after the Presiding Judge Zhang Qinglan and Judges Wang Jian and Zhang Shijie took their seats, Judge Zhang ordered Rundall to listen to the judgment and immediately read the main text, saying: "Appeal dismissed." According to the Criminal Procedure Law, only those sentenced to more than five years in prison can appeal to the Supreme Court, while the maximum punishment for defamation is only two years. Therefore, this trial is the final one, and Shen Ke can no longer appeal.

### Recorders of Public Gatherings Not Guilty of Defamation

The High Court still supported the decision of the first instance court to accept the case, believing that although Shen Ke was an enemy alien and had been prosecuted by the U.S. military court as a war criminal and listed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the list of those to be sent back to his home country, he still had the right to sue and appeal to the court.

At Rundall's request, the court explained the reasons for the judgment, saying: Shen Ke's appeal was dismissed based on Section 4 of Article 311 of the Criminal Law, which states that those who reprint announcements from the central and local governments, public trials in court, and public gatherings are not guilty of defamation, and Rundall's record on April 15 was based on the U.S. military's official announcement. Since Rundall's news came from a U.S. military press conference, whether the content of the news is true or not is irrelevant to this case. In addition, Shen Ke and an agent, lawyer Yao Wudi, were not present at the time of the judgment yesterday.

### Defendant in Railway Bureau Corruption Case Accuses Chen Bozhuang of Recovering Payment for Goods

[Our Newspaper's Report] Xin Dingfu, the legal representative of Yixin Paper Company, the 36th defendant in the corruption case of the Materials Department of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Administration, hired lawyer Wang Peiji to file a lawsuit in the District Court after being acquitted on October 24, accusing Chen Bozhuang, the director of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Administration, of failing to pay for the goods and requesting a judgment ordering payment. His complaint stated in brief: The defendant, the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Administration, ordered 300 reams of 60-pound Daolin paper from the plaintiff on August 20 of this year, at a price of 41,800 yuan per ream, for a total of 12.54 million yuan. The plaintiff delivered all of the above-mentioned Daolin paper on August 24, holding a purchase order signed by the defendant, No. 41. According to the regulations, payment should be made on the day the goods are delivered. However, the defendant repeatedly delayed payment. Until September 10, it forcibly deducted 2,027,000 yuan, so on September 11, it only paid the plaintiff 10,513,000 yuan, owing a loan of 2,027,000 yuan. Repeatedly urging payment was ignored. Therefore, he was forced to file a complaint with the court on September 17, requesting the court to review it and expedite the trial, requesting a judgment ordering the defendant to pay the loan at one time, totaling 2,027,000 yuan, and the statutory interest from September 17, the date of the lawsuit, to the end of the execution. He also requested that the court declare provisional execution ex officio, and that the defendant bear the costs of the litigation. The Civil Division 11 of the District Court heard the case yesterday, but the defendant Chen Bozhuang was not present. The court ordered a retrial on the 28th of this month.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Dai Ailuo, the manager of the Shanghai branch of the puppet Central Reserve Bank, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court yesterday, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. All of his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, was confiscated. Before the war, Dai served at the Bank of China, Osaka Branch, and once presided over the editing of the Banking Weekly. After the outbreak of the war, he immediately joined the puppet government and held key positions in the financial industry for as long as seven years.

### Case of Zang Da's Two Sons Being Killed: U.S. Military Court to Open Trial, Rear Admiral Case Visited Mayor Yesterday and Issued Statement

Rear Admiral Case, commander of the U.S. Navy in Shanghai, returned to Shanghai from Qingdao on the 4th. Yesterday morning (the 5th), he made a special trip to the city government to meet with Mayor Wu Guozhen and made a statement about the progress of the investigation of the Zang Da's two sons case.

### One Page of Facsimile Telegrams: New Facsimile Machine, Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau Completes Installation, First Successful Trial

[Our Newspaper's Report] The "Western Union" facsimile telegraph machine installed by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation has been completely repaired and was successfully tested for the first time within the bureau on the 2nd of this month. Once the Nanjing Telecommunications Bureau completes its installation, it can be submitted for approval, and it may be officially opened in Beijing and Shanghai this month. If the Nanjing machinery is installed smoothly, it is planned to be tested during the National Assembly. The new automatic machine of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau's facsimile machine can continuously send and receive messages. It was shipped from the United States via India to Kunming before the victory, and then transported to Shanghai via Chongqing. It was severely damaged along the way due to the bumps. There are two types of facsimile telegraph machines. One type is like taking a photo, which needs to be received in a darkroom. What is received is a film, which is then developed. The other type is a true facsimile telegram, which is a true copy when received. The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau uses this type. The paper for sending the true facsimile telegram is 7 inches wide and 11 inches long. The handwriting is very clear, even for size 5 font. However, pictures are clearer when they are black and white. Facsimile transmission is very helpful for commercial and industrial communication and can prevent forgery. It can also be used to send true memorabilia to relatives and friends for celebrations.

The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau's telegram sending and receiving situation is gradually getting back on track. Currently, Beijing-Shanghai telegrams are transmitted in less than an hour. In addition to the Beijing-Shanghai and Hangzhou lines for wired telegrams, the two lines affecting Fuzhou are being abandoned. The Wuhan line is being actively reorganized. The wired telegram service to Tianjin will depend on the situation. The wired telegram service to Guangzhou is planned to be routed through Hankou. The bureau has ordered teletypewriters from the United States. After they arrive, sending telegrams will be much more convenient.

### Reader Consultation: Legal Questions

(1) Property Dispute

Question from Li Ruilin:

My grandfather purchased a residence with a deed from someone named Jia from the clan during his lifetime, more than 60 years ago. Jia has three brothers, and Yi and Bing's family property has long been divided. Jia's heirs have also fled and their whereabouts are unknown. Now Yi and Bing's heirs want to redeem the house from us. Please advise: (1) Can a house purchased with a deed more than 60 years ago still be redeemed? (2) Do Yi and Bing's heirs have the right to redeem the property legally? We would be grateful for your answers in your column!

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] (1) Article 3 of the "Regulations for Clearing Real Estate Mortgages and Pledges" implemented in the Republic of China in 1915 stipulates: "For mortgages and pledges of less than 60 years, regardless of whether there is a redemption period or whether the pledge has been increased or redeemed, if it has been more than 20 years from the date of the contract, the original owner shall be limited to redeeming it within three years after the implementation of these Regulations. If the redemption is not made after the deadline, the original owner shall only be allowed to declare that the property is absolutely forfeited to the pledgee and shall not be allowed to redeem it." Therefore, a property purchased with a deed more than 60 years ago cannot be redeemed according to the law. (2) No.

(2) Bullying by Force

Question from Zheng Xi: In 1938, I rented a front building room at a certain number on Zhongzheng Middle Road from a Taiwanese named Liu. In 1944, Liu used the excuse of turning the front building into a public lounge and forced me to move to the back room, but he allowed me to still set up a bed, table, and chairs in the front building for meals and accommodation. My family has four members, and there are many books, so it was inconvenient to move. He then used the power of the enemy constitution as a threat. Afraid of his power, I moved into the back room without light or air in January of that year. Unexpectedly, after the front building was changed into a lounge, he did not allow me to use it, and discarded the bed, table, and chairs in the patio. I am old and cannot argue with him. After the Japanese surrendered last August, I asked him to allow me to move back to the front building, but he still refused. Friends were indignant and tried to reason with him on April 28, but to no avail. Please advise whether there are any legal provisions that can be cited to seek a reasonable solution. [Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] If the rented premises are indeed the "front building," and the "move to the back room" was indeed forced, and you can provide concrete evidence, you can request the landlord to hand over the "front building" according to Article 423 of the Civil Code. Invalid, you can file a lawsuit in accordance with the law. Forcing to live and "discarding things in the patio" if it is done by violence or coercion, if there is a way to prove it, you can report the crime of obstructing freedom to the procuratorate or file a criminal self-suit with the court.

### Mayor Wu Announces Regulations on Gauze: Guarantees Elimination of Black Market and Stabilization of Market Prices, Manufacturers Should Cooperate Due to High Profits

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu invited the heads of various newspapers in the city to a meeting in the City Hall conference room at 3 p.m. yesterday. Those present included Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yunsheng, Li Zikuan, Zhan Wenhu, Zhao Minheng, Chen Xunyu, Yan Duhe, and Zhu Baiying.

Mayor Wu reported on the handling of cotton yarn and cotton cloth by the Cotton Management Committee.

Regarding the cotton yarn issue, the mayor believes that it must be strictly managed, with unified prices, and distributed to those who truly need it. Regarding the crackdown on the black market for cotton yarn, four specific measures were proposed on the 1st of this month, namely: (1) Regardless of futures or not, from October 25th, all sales will be at the negotiated price of 1.75 million yuan for 20-count yarn. For those with differences in previous futures prices, the difference will be refunded or supplemented. (2) Except for futures buyers who have priority, the remaining yarn shall not be refused for sale. (3) Each manufacturer's export volume of cotton yarn shall be reported to the committee for verification. (4) Whether futures or spot goods, the buyer's name, address, and quantity shall be recorded in detail and reported to the committee for verification.

No Difficulty in Refunding or Supplementing

Mayor Wu said that if the above four measures can be effectively implemented, it can be guaranteed that the black market for cotton yarn in this city will disappear in the first ten days of this month. However, after these measures were proposed, manufacturers believed that the first measure needed to be considered because it seemed inconsistent with commercial practice and might cause more disputes, so they repeatedly requested consideration for revision, but it was considered unfounded and could not be established. The mayor's response was: If manufacturers can have better measures to eliminate the black market for cotton yarn in this city in the first ten days of this month, then the first measure may not be strictly enforced. Otherwise, the original measures must be strictly implemented.

Suppressing Prices Starts with Yarn

The mayor believes that if you want to suppress prices, then suppressing yarn prices is essential. There are different opinions on the management of cotton yarn. Some people believe that cotton yarn cannot be managed when supply and demand cannot be balanced. However, the mayor's opinion is the opposite. He believes that it is precisely because demand exceeds supply that it must be managed. The current number of spindles in operation nationwide is 2.5 million, only half of the pre-war number, and the people's need for cotton yarn and cloth is even more urgent after the war. Even if it is restored to the pre-war 5 million spindles, it will still be insufficient. Therefore, the production of yarn must be properly managed.

Management Methods Divided into Three Steps

The management methods can be divided into three steps: (1) Control the production of yarn. This is easy to do because the right to control electricity is in the hands of the city government. (2) Control the price of yarn. The negotiated price of yarn is 1.75 million yuan per piece for 20-count yarn. A lot of research has been done beforehand. In addition to including costs, interest, and legal profits, the profit of development opportunities has also been added to the negotiated price. According to the calculation of this negotiated price, it is estimated that the profit per piece of yarn is quite considerable. If manufacturers still think it is too low, they can only be considered unreasonable. (3) Control the prices of various industrial products. Industries such as machinery dyeing and weaving, knitting, towel and blanket, handkerchief, handmade cotton weaving, and underwear weaving are directly allocated yarn. Before the survey is completed, they are temporarily allocated at 60% of the price. According to the estimated sample survey, the price of cotton yarn is sufficient for application. Since the price of cotton yarn has been stabilized, the price of compound products can be reasonably limited. The current reasonable profit for compound products is set at 10%, but it is only limited to this city. If it is transported and sold to other places, the profit is set at 5%.

The Set Yarn Price Is Not Fixed

Mayor Wu also said: The current yarn price of 1.75 million yuan is not absolutely fixed and can be flexible depending on the rise and fall of cotton prices. But he said that if the above measures can be implemented step by step, he is absolutely confident that "prices will not rise or fall sharply."

### Gold Prices Continue to Rise, Foreign Currencies All Fall

Yesterday, Hsiatzhi continued to revolve and rise under the prosperity of the people's hearts. The morning opened at 2.373 million, and this price rose due to public demand, gradually becoming prosperous. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 120 bars at a price of 2.3875 million. After that, there was still no sign of a decline, and demand was still strong. It rose to over 2.39 million near noon. In the afternoon, it continued to rise, and the next-day delivery was once shouted as high as over 2.41 million, but then it fell back due to pressure. As a result, it continued to rise by 18,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were at 54,000. Silver and silver dollars rose slightly. The private lending market eased slightly, and interest rates were around 15%.

The foreign currency situation was stagnant. The black market for U.S. dollars was between 4,070 yuan and 4,120 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day. Hong Kong currency continued to fall due to the softening of telegraphic transfers. As a result, it fell by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The Hong Kong telegraphic transfer was even lower yesterday, and there were no sales. Yesterday, 865 yuan was still in short supply. Indian exchange at 1,055 yuan was also a selling situation. British exchange at 14,000 yuan was in supply and there was no demand. The official exchange rate for the U.S. dollar was unchanged, and there was no trading.

### Unified Class C Bonds Fall, Miscellaneous Brands Rise

Yesterday, the major bondholder Fuyuan still had an appetite for Unified Class C bonds. The morning opened at 1,590 yuan. Due to a sale by a household on the fourth floor, it once fell to 1,500 yuan. Fuyuan and others took advantage of the low price to maintain it, and the high price reached 1,670 yuan. The stock market was sluggish, and people's hearts were inevitably hit. It struggled around 1,600 yuan at the close. As a result, it fell by 100 yuan compared to the previous close. Classes A, B, and D rose by 100 yuan. Unified Class E also rose by 70 yuan. The transaction amount was 6 million yuan.

### Bulls Take Profits, Chinese Stocks Rise and Fall Suddenly

The initial opening of Chinese stocks yesterday was still stable, but people's hearts were not lively. After the opening, they showed slight weakness, and financial stocks immediately absorbed them, which was able to support them, causing the shorts to cover their positions, and the stocks showed their colors and rose. The situation in the middle was uncertain, rising and falling suddenly at high prices. After 11 o'clock, the high price was taken over by the bulls, such as No. 176, to take profits, and the market saw a loosening. The shorts took the opportunity to frequently put pressure on them and began to decline slightly. However, after 11:30, there was a sudden covering of shorts at low prices, and a rebound occurred once. After all, there were not a few who closed with profits. At noon, the shorts panicked again and started selling again. Stock stocks showed slight weakness, but they were still above the morning low price. Compared with the previous close, the hot stocks Yongsha, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Meiya each rose by about 3%. Xinhe alone rose by a strong 50%, and the cold stocks rose more than they fell. In the afternoon, the market stabilized again, but the bulls sold to take profits, and arbitrageurs took the opportunity to sell at high prices. After being firm, they gradually weakened, and the market helped to short again, and No. 185 also sold, so Yongsha retreated to around the noon closing price. Qingbang and others maintained them at low prices and gradually announced the market. People's hearts were prosperous, and the market was still firm at the close. As a result, the hot stocks Yongsha rose by 2% compared to the previous close, Xinguang rose by 4%, and Meiya, Qinxing, and Jingfu rose by 50%. Xinhe alone rose by 8%. The cold stocks Xinya, Yonggong, Lian, Wuhe each rose by 50%, and Match Datong Jinglun rose slightly. The rest fell slightly. The total transaction volume was 14.32 million shares.

The shipping, paper, and Jardine Matheson companies returned to the team by 50%, and the rest fell slightly.

### The Ministry of Finance Strictly Orders a Crackdown on Underground Banks

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 5th dispatch] Since the Ministry of Finance strictly ordered a crackdown on underground banks, more than a dozen underground banks in Nanjing have disappeared, not as active as before. In addition, the lending interest rate is as high as 30%, and the lowest is also around 18%, and there is no guarantee for lending. The market is full of downturns, and it is easy to lend but difficult to recover. The risks are too great. People in the industry are wary. Since the Ministry of Finance approved applications for the resumption of operations by banks and money shops, they all plan to participate in this legitimate way. Therefore, all underground banks will automatically close by the end of this year. The Ministry of Finance recently sent a telegram to the Central Bank ordering a crackdown on usury. The Audit Department of the Central Bank has notified all banks and money shops to comply. It is learned that the authorities have decided to strengthen the crackdown on underground banks, and all banks and money shops that have resumed operations without approval will be ordered to suspend business within a time limit. It is heard that although these banks and money shops that have resumed operations without approval have been cracked down on repeatedly, there are still many existing in the counties of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces that have resumed operations without authorization. The authorities have decided to order these banks and money shops to suspend business entirely by the end of the year. As for underground banks that do not use the name of a bank or money shop, but only use the name of an enterprise company or even have no name at all, and lend high interest rates, which is a behavior that violates the law, once it is verified, the court will severely punish them according to the law.

### Applications for Transporting Yarn and Cloth to Southern China Begin: 340 Qualified Manufacturers

The Textile Business Management Committee officially started accepting applications for transporting yarn and cloth to South China yesterday. The committee has issued registration cards and application forms to all approved yarn and cloth manufacturers and distributors. Approved manufacturers can apply to the committee with their certificates. According to the committee's announcement, after the committee dispatched personnel to investigate the yarn and cloth manufacturers and distributors registered last month, only 340 of the more than 800 registered manufacturers had complete content equipment and had previously operated export businesses. There were 210 yarn and cloth factories and 130 distributors. As for the yarn and cloth transported to South China, according to the pre-war production figures, the monthly export of cotton yarn is 4,967 pieces and cotton cloth is 110,647 pieces.

In order to supervise the import of yarn and cloth in the four ports of Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou in South China, the committee will send special commissioners to the four places and will go there soon.

### Coking Coal's Destination Widens

Since the price of white coal lumps has risen frequently, most users' purchasing power has weakened, and they have successively adopted other fuels as substitutes. Coking coal should be purchased by most users in a timely manner. The current actual sales volume of coking coal has exceeded 3,000 metric tons per month. In addition to the local use of anthracite coal chips from Zhongxing to be refined by indigenous methods and the products of the Songjiang Coking Coal Plant, coking coal mainly relies on imports from other ports, with Hankou Pingxiang Coking Coal, Lantian Coking Coal, and Xuzhou Jingxing Coking Coal being the main sources. In addition to the Qingzhong Zhongxing refined by local indigenous methods, which still sells for a high price of 800,000 yuan, the price of other coking coal is 450,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan, only half the price of white coal lumps.

### Wool Yarn Price Lower Than Cost: Review Meeting Decides on Wholesale and Retail Profits

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Wool Yarn Price Review Committee held a meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3 p.m. yesterday. Chen Qi'en and Deng Zhonghe from the Wool Textile Dyeing Industry Association, Shen Laizhou and Zhang Yiping from the Wool Yarn Business Association, Pan Shihao from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Director Gu Bingyuan attended. Regarding the manufacturing cost, based on actual investigation, it was reviewed again. Representatives of the Business Association reported the market price, roughly saying that the selling price is falling. The current price of high-quality goods is 58,000 yuan, first-class goods are 48,000 yuan, and ordinary goods are 132,000 to 36,000 yuan, which is the retail price per pound, which is very limited compared to the manufacturer's cost. Representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce also pointed out that the recent low market price is indeed lower than the cost, and the review should be particularly cautious, advocating not to stipulate a fixed selling price for the time being, which was agreed by all. Then, the legal profit was discussed, and it was agreed that the wholesale profit should be 15% and the retail profit should be 20%. Later, the issue of the burden of commodity tax was also discussed by all parties. According to representatives of the Industrial Association, they are still striving for tax exemption. If tax exemption is not obtained, there will be problems with the burden. It is heard that a certain wool yarn factory has produced various wool yarns such as General, Red Beauty, and Green Beauty, which will be sold soon, and the grades were also reviewed yesterday.

### Raw Oil Drops Sharply, Rice, Wheat, and Coarse Grains Are Flat and Weak

The rice market registered 12,000+ shih of goods. Both northern and southern japonica rice fell by 1,000 yuan. White rice was sluggish and fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan. The negative impact was strong and resolute, and it was weak. Indica rice was firm in the producing areas and remained stable. Wheat also returned to flat. There was a slight source of flour from the inland, asking for 300-500 yuan. The limited retail price of miscellaneous brand flour is 20,500 yuan per bag. It is recently heard that the Northeast will have a large batch of soybeans arriving in Shanghai, and people's hearts are weak, and the price has dropped by 300-500 yuan. Soybean cakes are being procured from Shantou and Xiamen, but the factory is still supplying a lot, and they are returning to a small 100-200 yuan. Due to the surge in goods from Qingdao today, oil mills have eased their stomachs, raw oil has dropped sharply by 6,000-7,000 yuan, soybean oil and Qing oil are flat and stable, and sesame oil is similar. Corn has decreased by 500-600 yuan. There are not many red grains arriving, and they are still firm. Fujian help is inquiring about broad beans. The source is still scarce, and the price has risen by 1,000 yuan. There is still a demand for raw peanuts from Nanyang and Taichai, and they are soaring again, rising by 1,000-2,000 yuan. There is not much sesame in stock, and it continues to rise by 2,000-3,000 yuan.

### Plain Thick Wool Is Popular

Recently, due to the warm weather, the actual sales of wool have not progressed in various places. Although there are various beneficial buying news one after another, the price has always been stable. At the tea party yesterday, only one type of plain thick wool was popular. The estimated price for the top number was 95,000 yuan per yard, the second number was 80,000 yuan, and the third number was 65,000 yuan. Customers were adding a lot to their purchases, and the factory's goods were not being produced. Very few imported goods were transported, and there was a sign of scarcity in the market.

### New Tung Oil from Eastern Zhejiang Enters the Market; Increased Costs Lead to Price Hikes

New tung oil from Jinlan and other areas in Eastern Zhejiang has entered the market, with daily receipts of ten to twenty pieces. The price is 100,000 yuan per shi dan (unit of weight). Recent news indicates that the China Plant Oil Factory has handled thirty pieces at 100,300 yuan, delivered in Hangzhou. It is said that the factory still has an appetite for it. Because the new product is just appearing, the supply is intermittent, making it difficult to purchase in large quantities. However, the market already has a standard, and it will be difficult to see prices ease unless there is a surge in supply. Moreover, this winter's yield is lower than last year's. Because various places are waiting for new products, future sales will definitely not be weaker than in previous years, and it will be difficult to find cheaper prices. As for the Jiaxing area of Western Zhejiang, the yield seems to be better than last year's, and seeds have also appeared. The market price is generally around 30,000 yuan per shi, which means the cost of tung oil must be above 100,000 yuan. Therefore, although some inland traders initially sold it at 75,000 yuan per shi dan, they quickly increased the price to 90,000 yuan, and recently it has increased to 100,000 yuan, with few sellers. Initially, various firms in this port hoped for lower prices, but after observing the environment recently, it seems that prices are more likely to rise than fall. They want to place advance orders, but there are no sellers, which is a common sentiment. Yesterday, the black market trading of rayon was still good, with semi-matte goods being the most popular, rising by more than 100,000 yuan. No. 120 old-fashioned Tianqiao glossy goods had a flat asking price in the morning, but in the afternoon, because the new-fashioned goods rose to 3.17 million yuan, with the highest bid being 200,000 yuan, they also followed suit, increasing by 50,000 yuan. As a result, the old-fashioned goods were 50,000 yuan higher than the previous day, and the new-fashioned goods were 100,000 yuan higher. No one inquired about No. 120 miscellaneous brand glossy goods and No. 150 glossy goods. The asking price was the same as the previous day. The factory prices were as stable as the previous day, but the trading was very quiet. The silk market situation remains sluggish. Yesterday, quilt covers fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Hua Jin crepe was priced at 3,200 to 3,300 yuan, and rayon feather yarn was priced at 3,400 to 3,500 yuan, depending on the quality of the goods.

### Yarn and Cloth Both Show Slight Activity; Factories Pushing Out Fine Yarn, Which Remains Sluggish; Cloth Prices Fall Below Cost, Sales Slightly Improve

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market continued to trend upward. Customers from Jingwu and inland areas showed strong interest, mostly targeting medium and small 20-count yarns. There was also a significant amount of 20-count heavyweight yarn. As a result, various brands rose by another 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Due to the fact that many duplicate factories were pushing out Silver Moon, Lima, Blue Phoenix, and other brands of 32-count fine yarn and 42-count double-strand thread, and the sales were particularly sluggish, the market price showed no progress. Although the authorities have the confidence to stabilize the yarn market, most of the allocated goods are for forward delivery. If autumn sales see another surge, the spot goods may not be sufficient for sales, and there is a high possibility of a rebound in prices.

Although the listed prices of cotton cloth from Fangjian have declined, sales in this street and in areas such as Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou have been slightly stronger, showing a trend of firmness. It has been found that the recent sharp decline in cloth prices has caused customers to take a wait-and-see attitude, and counter sales in this street are also extremely sparse. Recently, the market price has fallen below cost, coupled with high interest rates, resulting in significant losses for weaving manufacturers. However, it is currently the sales season, and the sluggish sales of cotton cloth seem unreasonable according to past experience. Therefore, the general psychology is that if the weather turns cold, sales may increase, and there may be a turnaround.

### Fire Machine Cotton Cannot Be Sold, Cotton Farmers Greatly Affected

[Report from our newspaper] The coastal area of ​​Pudong belongs to sandy fields with salty soil, which is not conducive to rice cultivation. Therefore, the farmers there mainly grow miscellaneous grains, peanuts, and cotton, commonly known as "Fire Machine Cotton," which is exclusively sold to various yarn factories in this city as raw material for spinning 16-count and lower yarns. This year, a large number of foreign cottons were imported, and yarn factories used foreign cotton, rejecting local cotton, taking advantage of its lower price and higher quality. The "Fire Machine Cotton" produced in Pudong cannot be sold at all. In addition, this year's continuous autumn rain has resulted in poor harvests, with each mu yielding only seventy to eighty jin, which at the current price, is only about 30,000 yuan. Farmers have worked hard all year round, and not only is there no compensation for seeds, fertilizers, and labor, but tenant farmers have no way to pay their land rent. The bankruptcy of the countryside is imminent. Although the government has agricultural loans, cotton farmers who have no access cannot obtain them. Even if they do obtain them, how will they repay them in the future? The impact will inevitably lead to a decrease in farmers' interest in planting cotton, and the cotton fields will inevitably decrease next year. Yarn factories are feeling the lack of raw materials, but the cotton of cotton farmers cannot even be sold. This is also one of the contradictory phenomena in today's economic world.

### New Needle Eyebrow Tea Rises Sharply

The tea market has been very flat for domestic sales recently. For foreign sales, Qimen aged floral-scented tea is still selling smoothly, and the buying momentum for high-grade red tea from English estates is also unabated. New green tea is in short supply because exporting firms are rushing to meet shipping deadlines, so they are scrambling to make up the shortfall. As a result, the market is very strong. In addition, the supply of new Wenzhou needle eyebrow tea is relatively slow, and demand is even higher, so the price has risen sharply. As a result, each dan opened at 100,000 yuan, a jump of more than 15,000 yuan compared to before. [Report from our newspaper, Beiping, 4th] The price of gold in Tianjin and Beiping has risen again this week due to the influence of the current situation and currency value. Compared with the beginning of the week, it has risen by 10,000 yuan. The price of gold in Tianjin has even exceeded 250,000 yuan. Silver has also risen in tandem. The price at the beginning of the week was 2,200 yuan per tael, and it rose to 2,400 yuan at the weekend. It is said that most of the silver is transshipped through Tianjin and Shanghai to Hong Kong, Bombay, and London. Because there is a rumor of cracking down on the black market for US dollars, its price has been hovering around 4,000 yuan. Grain prices are slightly lower, but still particularly high compared to Shanghai. Flour is 37,000 yuan per bag, rice is 790 yuan per jin, and cotton cloth prices are still relatively stable. Because coal from Jingxing cannot come north and the Ping Sui Railway is also damaged after the robbery, the price of fuel is still firm. Because Zhangjiakou has been opened, the price of meat has decreased, and the price of cigarettes is still stable.

### Although There Are Many Joint Shopping Centers, Actual Sales Are Not Strong

[Report from our newspaper] Recently, American-style stall joint markets and domestic goods markets have sprung up in this city. The goods displayed are all sold at discounted prices to attract customers. However, according to surveys, the actual business of these collective markets is not booming. Moreover, the establishment of some shopping centers has speculative overtones. However, it has a profound impact on the business of general department stores. The peak season for department stores throughout the year should be in the past two months. However, business has not improved recently. The average daily sales of ordinary stores can only afford the salaries of employees at most. Fortunately, the business of department stores is mostly stable, so in the current chorus of high interest rates, sluggish business, and weak purchasing power, they can barely maintain the situation, hoping that business will be better in the future.

### American Cotton Falls Again

[United Press, New York, 4th] Today, the cotton market was affected by selling in New Orleans, and cotton futures were forced to fall. Most of the goods sold were bought by yarn factories. The closing price fell by 2.5 to 3 yuan per bale.

### World Cotton Production Totals Two-Thirds of Pre-War Levels

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] According to estimates by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the world's total cotton production this year is 22,050,000 bales (500 pounds per bale), while the average for the years 1936 to 1940 was 30,800,000 bales. Therefore, this year's production is two-thirds of the pre-war level. Last year was one of the lowest cotton production years in twenty-three years, and this year it has increased by 1.5 million bales compared to last year.

[Reuters, Memphis, Tennessee, 4th] Georgia Congressman Pace warned U.S. cotton farmers, while discussing the future of U.S. cotton and price controls at a House subcommittee meeting, not to collapse production to more than 12.5 million bales in 1947. Pace said that if cotton farmers do not limit cotton production next year, they may not avoid repeating the overproduction after 1937.

### Dredging Riverbanks in the Thirteenth District

And Establishment of a Mediation Committee

The Thirteenth District (Putuo) District Office noted that in the 26th and 27th Bao, Yaoshui Lane area, there was an original riverbank that could connect to the Suzhou River.

### The Chairman's Birthday Celebrated All Over the Capital

— October 31st, Nanjing Dispatch from our Special Correspondent, Ding Kuanghua

Today is Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday, and joyous cheers fill every corner of the country. The birthday celebration movement has long been underway. The central authorities believe that the Chairman has dedicated his entire life to the Party and the nation. To honor his remarkable achievements, following the century-long education plan, it was decided that dedicating schools would be the sole birthday gift. The Nanjing Municipal Government took the lead by dedicating sixty schools. From the newspapers, we see that the achievements of various provinces and cities in dedicating schools are staggering. Private schools, in particular, voluntarily canceled their long-standing historical names and renamed themselves "Zhongzheng" schools, demonstrating the greatness of the Chairman's virtue and influence. The Nanjing Municipal Party Committee also launched a campaign for all party members to donate a Zhongzheng Library to lay the foundation for public education in the capital. As the birthday approached, the gift-giving expanded daily. To save manpower, material resources, and financial resources, Chairman Chiang announced on the 30th that he would decline birthday celebrations, demonstrating the Chairman's noble and simple personality. The entire city's birthday wishes at the Lishi Society, the Central Party Headquarters' signing of respects, the National Government's enthusiastic congratulations, the Nanjing students' grand chorus of ten thousand people... all echoed in the Chairman's ears. To reduce the busy social activities of civil and military officials, Chairman Chiang had to take a trip to the suburbs to avoid the celebrations.

### The Birthday Star Arose Early for Family Birthday Greetings

On this day, the birthday star woke up early, and family birthday greetings were, of course, unavoidable. The two sons, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren gathered happily. Committee Member Kong Xiangxi also made a special trip from Shanghai to Nanjing on the 30th to offer birthday greetings. After 8:00 AM, the Chairman drove around the National Government, rested at his official residence for a while, and then took a trip to the suburbs with his wife and Commander Ma and his wife to avoid the celebrations. A special train with six carriages was prepared on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, decorated extremely luxuriously, with "Longevity" characters visible everywhere inside the carriages. The Chairman and his party boarded the train at Hepingmen, accompanied by Director Yu Jishi, Director Chen Bozhuang, and the famous American writer Ruth. The Chairman smiled and accepted the cheers of the people along the way, taking a short trip to Taihu Lake in Wuxi, and returned to Nanjing by the same train in the evening.

Today, every corner of Nanjing is enveloped in a birthday celebration atmosphere. National flags flutter on the streets, firecrackers crackle continuously, and the Central Broadcasting Station, Yishi Broadcasting Station, and Youth Broadcasting Station broadcast birthday celebration programs all day long. A giant jade portrait of the Chairman, created by the National Defense Department's Information Bureau, stands tall on the streets, becoming a treasure most appreciated by the citizens. The clocks on major thoroughfares are inlaid with "Longevity" characters circling on neon lights. Several major shopping malls have erected colorful arches with the inscription "May the Rivers and Mountains Share Longevity," appearing both exquisite and majestic. Noodle restaurants are particularly busy, with ordinary people eating bowls of longevity noodles on this day to wish Chairman Chiang a long life, relying on the Chairman's blessings, a meaning that is also very profound. Cars are covered with birthday slogans, driving back and forth in a flurry of activity, adding to the liveliness of the Chairman's birthday.

### Central Figures Gather to Sign Birthday Greetings and Pay Respects

The birthday hall arranged by the National Government today is simple and solemn. Starting at 8:00 AM, central figures began to sign birthday greetings. Chief Secretary Wu Dingchang and Acting Chief Aide-de-Camp Wu Siyu led all staff members to sign birthday greetings in accordance with the decision. President Dai Jitao, with his white hair, and Vice President Zhou Zhongyue jointly arrived at the National Government around 9:00 AM, signing their names on the specially prepared red birthday book to offer congratulations. After 10:00 AM, foreign envoys arrived one after another, all with smiling expressions, writing historical "Longevity" characters and birthday gifts on the signature book. Particularly noteworthy was the birthday celebration of the Mongolian and Tibetan representatives. Wearing their unique attire, they signed different characters. The National Government specially set up one hundred tables for the birthday feast, inviting all the participants to celebrate, and the eldest son, Chiang Ching-kuo, personally expressed his gratitude to each guest.

Today, the Central Party Headquarters hung a large "Longevity" character in the center of the auditorium, with pine and cypress trees symbolizing longevity placed in the center, adorned with red and green electric lights, appearing exceptionally brilliant. Mr. Wu Zhihui, an elder statesman of the Party, arrived the earliest, being the first to sign his name to pay respects. He was particularly excited today, touring the auditorium. When he saw the "Thousand Autumns" longevity area presented by the People's Representative of Dangtu County, he nodded for a long time. Starting at 9:00 AM, Dai Chuanxian, Yu Youren, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Chen Guofu, Zhang Lisheng, Liang Hancao, and others arrived one after another, signing birthday greetings, presenting birthday essays, and reading birthday greetings, keeping the staff busy. Party workers in Nanjing and representatives from various places in the suburbs of Nanjing flocked to offer their congratulations.

### Crowds Gathered at Lishi Society, 100,000 Citizens Enthusiastically Participated in Signing

The capital's birthday hall for celebrations from all walks of life was set up in the auditorium of the Lishi Society. Therefore, Yixian Bridge on Zhongshan East Road to Huangpu Road was crowded with traffic and people, the only lively place in the capital today. To maintain order inside the birthday hall, vehicles were not allowed inside. Twelve tables were placed at the entrance, where everyone offering birthday greetings first had to sign their name. Birthday greetings were offered in order of arrival, with sixty people forming a group, and the receptionists were extremely busy organizing their ranks. Each person was given a square "Longevity" character made of red silk with golden characters as a souvenir. The arrangement of the hall was as follows: a "Longevity" character neon light was suspended in the center, and the four characters "May You Live Ten Thousand Years" were displayed above the birthday stage. On the side hung large colored pictures of the Eight Immortals Celebrating Longevity and the Queen Mother Offering Longevity, embroidered in Xiang embroidery. Mr. Wu Zhi, the old gentleman, personally wrote a couplet: "Starting with Genghis Khan conquering the West, Washington leading North America again," which was also displayed here. At 8:00 AM sharp, the capital's birthday celebration ceremony began. Mayor Ma, Hong Lanyou, and Yuan Shouqian represented the Chairman in accepting the ceremony, and Huang Renlin returned the greetings, wearing a blue robe and black mandarin jacket, making him appear even more stout and kind. Then, Ma Yuanfang, Xiao Zanyu, Chen Yuguang, and Shen Zumu, representing 830,000 citizens of Nanjing, dedicated schools and libraries as gifts of eternal significance to celebrate Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday. Mr. Chen Guofu's father, Qinshi, also came to offer birthday congratulations, supported by two people. Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, Lu Zhonglin, Kong Xiangxi, Huang Zhenqiu, Zhou Zhirou, Zhu Shiming, Zhang Zhen, and others also came to offer birthday greetings. The Chairman's eldest son, Chiang Ching-kuo, nodded and shook hands with the guests, looking joyful and drawing the most attention. After the birthday greetings, everyone flocked to another room to view photos of the Chairman's life. The Lishi Society's auditorium was filled with more than a thousand precious photos of the Chairman's life over the past sixty years. Entering the room, the reporter first saw an enlarged heroic image of the Chairman during the Northern Expedition, with a sword across his waist, his spirit swallowing rainbows. We looked up at the Chairman's majesty, which was still undiminished. Looking at the photos of the Chairman's life, it was clear how much he loved the people. Leading the Northern Expedition, leading the War of Resistance, comforting soldiers and civilians, and caring for his comrades were all vividly depicted on paper. And the Chairman's family reunion photos were particularly appreciated by the citizens. From morning to night, the reporter never left for a moment, only seeing the signature papers being changed again and again, piling up thickly. According to the reporter's lowest estimate, there were more than 50,000 people, and with children and women included, the actual number of people offering birthday greetings was definitely more than 100,000, and certainly not less.

### Commemorative Supplements Flying All Over the Streets

The capital's newspapers have been collecting the Chairman's past life photos for the publication of birthday commemorative supplements. Some started working three months ago, drafting articles and competing fiercely, creating a white-hot competition. Today, everything has been revealed. All newspapers have expanded their pages today, with birthday celebrations as the main theme. Early in the morning, newspapers were flying all over the streets, and citizens scrambled to buy them. Although each newspaper printed several thousand or even tens of thousands of copies, they were sold out by 3:00 PM. The Shanghai newspapers brought by China National Aviation Corporation were also snapped up, and even existing subscribers had to be arranged for separate delivery. The long-established Shen Bao published five large pages today, including several precious photos of Chairman Chiang's life, which were most popular with readers. The competition in the cultural world is also a good story in the midst of the birthday celebrations. Today, the sky is high and the air is crisp, the sun is bright and the breeze is gentle, symbolizing the Chinese Republic lasting for billions of years, and Chairman Chiang living ten thousand years.

### Going to the Northern Jiangsu Front

— October 25th, Liangduo Dispatch from our Correspondent Ling Songshou

Since the Yunhe Line was reopened, the situation in Northern Jiangsu is nearing a stage of complete suppression.

Following the start of the war on the Fan Gongdi embankment, the reporter, entrusted with the task by the newspaper, made a trip to the east line.

On the 22nd, I spent the whole day busy with vehicles. There were certainly no passenger cars available; moreover, the work of suppressing the Hai-Tai Line on both sides had not yet been completed. For the sake of safety, it was necessary to request assistance from the military.

Since the 83rd Division was the main force in the east line war, a rear headquarters of the division was set up in Taixian, specializing in supplying provisions to the front. The reporter's first step was to go to the headquarters. According to Section Chief Lin of the Adjutant's Office, vehicles were available, but there was no guarantee when they would depart. If there was any need at the front, they could set off at any time. He promised to notify me if any vehicles were leaving. Although this was not yet certain, news reporters need to seize the moment completely. If it was delayed for another three or five days, and once Dongtai was recovered, the trip would lose its timeliness. Therefore, the reporter also consulted with Staff Officer Wang of the 148th Brigade of the 25th Division. The Staff Officer introduced Instructor Hu of the Brigade Station to plan for the reporter, but they did not meet twice; by the time it was dusk, just as I was anxiously wondering, the Adjutant's Office of the 83rd Division suddenly sent a notice that a special car would depart for the front line at 6:00 AM the next morning. Upon seeing it, my heart was filled with joy, and I felt boundless comfort.

I got up at four o'clock on the morning of the 23rd, and in the light wind and dim morning stars, the reporter yearned for the flames of war on the eastern battlefield, one hundred and sixty miles away.

Arriving at the division headquarters at six o'clock, the vehicle was held up by other matters and did not depart until ten o'clock. The vehicle was driven by Deputy Company Commander Lian of the Motor Vehicle Company of the Division ("Uncle A", as he has been nicknamed for nearly ten years, addressed that way by everyone from the Division Commander to the soldiers), and the director Luo of the political department of the 56th regiment of the 19th brigade was also traveling with him.

The car moved at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour. On the way, we encountered many returning troops, striding forward with chests out and guns on their shoulders. Someone in the car said: "This is truly a manifestation of the awakening of the people's consciousness". At 10:31 AM, we arrived at Jiangyan, a place that the reporter had visited three times in three months. The first time was just after its recovery; the second time was after the Magou battle, when I followed Staff Officer Wu of the 108th Brigade of the 25th Division with brother Hang Zhou to inspect; today was my third visit here, and the car sped past, making it difficult to take it all in. I thought it must have progressed and prospered a bit!

Heading east from Jiangyan, it took ten minutes to reach Baimi. This section of the road is still frequently sabotaged by the Communist army. Fortunately, the organization of road protection is very complete, and repairs are made whenever sabotage occurs, so traffic is not cut off and military transport is not hindered. However, there are still unavoidable bumps and unevenness on the road, and the car jolts violently as it passes over them.

After passing Qutang, we arrived at Hai'an at 11:20 AM and stopped briefly. We ate some refreshments at a small snack shop by the roadside; "flies swarmed", and it was unbearably dirty. Director Luo, who was traveling with me, had reached his destination, and we shook hands to say goodbye. At 11:50 AM, we advanced north from Hai'an. After the car passed the west entrance of Hai'an, a large Temple of the King was left with only the two stone lions in front of the mountain gate still intact, the rest of the houses, whether the Great Buddha Hall or the meditation rooms, were either broken or collapsed, having been "baptized" by the cannons of Western religion. The outskirts of Hai'an were surrounded by earthen forts and covered with caltrops, showing a tense state of preparedness, and here the reporter even thought of the cruel scene of the Communist army's all-out attack on the 19th!

At 12:05 PM, we arrived at Maijiaji. Traveling in the same direction as the car were also many Cantonese soldiers of a certain division. Now it is the tenth month of the lunar calendar, and the plum blossoms on the ridges should be budding. For eight years, they have been fighting across the north and south of the Yangtze River. Now, in coastal Northern Jiangsu, they are raising the banner of punishing the wicked and relieving the people. I wonder if they ever think of the plum blossoms in their hometown?

North of Maijiaji, the Communist army left behind many fortifications that had only recently been built. Near Fuan, there was even a small airfield, which the National Army and residents were working together to clean up.

We arrived at Fuan at 12:25 PM. Ruined walls stood opposite each other, and almost every house in the town was scarred by bullets; the displaced victims of the disaster were dismantling the remaining houses, not knowing whether it was because they were uninhabitable and it would be cleaner to demolish them, or whether they were preparing to rebuild them. Many relief vehicles from a certain unit, painted with blood-red crosses, were carrying out post-disaster relief work. This was the result of four days and nights of shelling.

Originally, our intended destination was Fuan. However, in order to cooperate with the development of the war situation, the headquarters of the 83rd Division had already been moved, so the car continued to advance north. At 12:40 PM, we reached the outskirts of Anfeng, and the reporter could clearly hear the sound of artillery fire from the front line.

The streets of Anfeng are very narrow, and there is a bridge on the Tong-Yu Highway east of the town that was destroyed by the Communist army and has not yet been repaired. Therefore, the car had to pass through the center of the town. More than a dozen cars were crowded on the street. Our car could not back up, so we had to signal the car in front to retreat, while we temporarily stopped on the side of the road. At this time, Section Chief Wang of the Division Headquarters' Military Affairs Office was going to Hai'an, and we met on the roadside. Section Chief Wang warmly told me about the war situation on the front line and said: "All the officers and soldiers of the 83rd Division will give you, 'the number one reporter,' a very welcome and spiritually boundless comfort." It took more than half an hour for the car to finally pass. By the time we reached the division headquarters, it was already 1:30 PM. General Li Tianxia was commanding on the front line, and upon hearing the news, he specially sent Senior Staff Officer Chang Xiaode to greet the reporter, and I followed him to the front line to meet the Division Commander.

It had been three months since I had last seen Division Commander Li. Upon seeing each other, the Division Commander was very happy. When talking about the article I wrote, "General Li Tianxia's Demeanor", he laughed and said, "It's too exaggerated". But he also admitted that the people of Taixian and him felt a special closeness with each other!

This time, the National Army advanced north from Hai'an, and Division Commander Li personally commanded on the front line every day. He said to Senior Staff Officer Chang and the reporter: "In this kind of war, what is the point if the officer in charge doesn't go to the front?"

The forward command post was very simple, set up in a grass shed. Two large tables served as desks, and telephones and military maps were placed on them. The fate of tens of thousands of people on the Fan Gongdi was decided in this very simple setting.

Senior Staff Officer Chang was in his forties, and his leg was injured in the Battle of Wanjialing outside Wuhan in 1938 and is still a bit lame. He is with the Division Commander all day long, advising on military matters, and is a major figure in the forward command post. In order to assist in the advance work and enhance the effectiveness of the war, the Air Force Headquarters specially dispatched a squadron of aircraft for use in Northern Jiangsu, so next to the command post, there was an Air Force liaison team. The team was set up in a truck and followed the command post at all times. The Air Force Headquarters also sent technical personnel here to be responsible for managing the liaison between the land and the air force.

To the right front of the forward command post, there was a gate. The Communist army had written "Liberation Gate" on it, with a couplet on both sides: "Punish the wicked and express righteousness, consolidate the country's foundation through production." The Division Commander instructed me to take a photo and then ordered the soldiers to paint it over.

### Only Three Li Away from the Fire Line, the Situation on the Street is Abnormally Quiet

Anfeng was recovered on the morning of the 22nd, and the reporter arrived in Anfeng only the next day. But the situation on the street was abnormally quiet, and the children were rolling coins freely; if it were not for the troops coming and going, you would not know that this was a town that had just been recovered for a day and was less than three li away from the front line.

At about 4:00 PM, the reporter returned to his residence to rest. The residence was a private house of a Mr. Zhu that was borrowed by the Adjutant's Office of the Division. The homeowner was very good and provided us with meticulous hospitality, and we could ask for anything we needed. The reporter brought a few Shenbao newspapers from Taixian, and he gladly borrowed them to read, sighing and saying, "I haven't seen this kind of newspaper in seven or eight years!" They felt that the articles "Attacking the Heart with a Lone Sword" and "General Li Tianxia's Demeanor" in the special feature column of this newspaper on October 13 were particularly interesting.

The reporter wanted to inquire about the situation during the Communist army's occupation from them, but they insisted on not saying anything, and no amount of persuasion was effective. They only said: "The National Army must severely punish some people who have been helping the tigers!" Hearing the words of this group of strangers and yet familiar compatriots, the reporter felt endless emotion!

In the evening, I chatted with a section chief Geng of the Adjutant's Office. He told me: "When I first came here, I wanted to contact the district office about something. I asked an old man where the district office was. Do you know what he said to me? He said to me: 'Your district office is over there, our district office (referring to the Communist Party organization) has already moved!'" May I ask, what kind of fact is this? Originally, the villagers have simple knowledge, and the occupation has been too long, so this situation is inevitable; however, what plans will the authorities have to engage in "re-education" for them?

Today the war was quiet, with only intermittent artillery fire. On the front line, Division Commander Li excitedly pointed to the military map and told the reporter: "Liangduo has entered the range of the artillery, and our troops advancing from the direction of Zhengdong have also crossed Shinian and reached a certain place. The troops on the right wing are confronting the Communist army across the river, and it is very likely that we will successfully take Liangduo tomorrow." The largest stronghold south of Dongtai is only Liangduo. The reporter is preparing to step into the gateway to Fan Gongdi—Dongtai—from here.

### The Evolution of Greece: A Struggle Unfolds Between the US, Soviet Union, and England, While Internal Strife Continues

— Nan

Recent developments in Greece indicate that although the public referendum on September 1st determined the country's course, it did not alleviate the tense situation in Greece. Instead, the struggle among powerful nations to control Greece has intensified. The United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union continue to vie for this peninsula, which, despite its poverty, is strategically crucial.

Recently, the new American aircraft carrier "Roosevelt" and its escort warships visited Athens for a "goodwill" visit, showcasing American naval power. The British Mediterranean Fleet is also scheduled to conduct exercises off the Greek coast. While the War Office is drafting plans for the withdrawal of British troops from Greece, the British navy can still control the situation in Greece.

The Soviet Union has no troops or warships in the Mediterranean, but it is using its diplomatic weapons. The Soviet ambassador to Greece was recalled, expressing dissatisfaction with the results of the referendum. At the Paris Peace Conference, the Soviet delegation vigorously attacked the Greek government and supported Albania's and Bulgaria's claims against Greece. At the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet Union also demanded that countries report on the troops they stationed in non-enemy territories, which of course included British troops stationed in Greece.

Within Greece, left-wing parties believe the results of the referendum were unfair. The volatile civil war between royalists and pro-communists continues, resulting in numerous casualties each week.

Strategic Importance: England and America Determined Not to Relinquish

The great powers attach such importance to Greece because it is the only country in the Balkans not controlled by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies are determined to extend their influence to Greece, while the British, Americans, and the Greek royalist government are determined to prevent Soviet influence from encroaching. The struggle is extremely intense.

Everyone knows that the northern border region of Greece is a cradle of political conflict, inhabited by a mixture of Albanians, Greeks, Yugoslavs, Macedonians, and Bulgarians. The ideology promoted by the Soviet Union has divided these mixed races into two camps. Slavs, Albanians, and some Greeks advocate for the organization of a Slavic alliance led by Tito of Yugoslavia, with its territory extending from the Danube River to the Mediterranean coast.

This vast group would be led by Moscow, and Greece is determined to prevent the realization of this pan-Balkan dream. The ethnic minorities within Greece are useful tools for Tito and his Soviet allies. In retaliation, the Greek minorities within Albania are extremely useful for the Greek royalist leaders who promote nationalism.

Greece's eastern coastline is extremely long, and the islands in the Aegean Sea are scattered, controlling the entrance to the Mediterranean. In that area, Thessaloniki is an excellent naval base. This important port has long been a breeding ground for pan-Balkan activities, and now Bulgaria is eager to seize it to gain a "window" on the Aegean Sea. If Thessaloniki falls into the hands of a Slavic country, then Eastern European countries could gain a naval base from which they could sail directly into the Mediterranean overnight.

The Trieste Issue: Crucial to Greece

At the same time, the struggle between Yugoslavia and Italy for Trieste (in reality, a struggle between the Soviet Union and the United States and England) is also extremely important to Greece. Ships entering and leaving the Port of Trieste must pass through the west coast of Greece. Albania, which is friendly to the Soviet Union, controls the northern part of this waterway, while Greece controls the southern part. If Soviet influence extends to Greece, then the Adriatic Sea will be completely under Soviet control.

Furthermore, the Greek peninsula extends into the Mediterranean, and the decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers to grant the Dodecanese Islands to Greece brings the country's borders close to the Near East. Therefore, if Greece is in the hands of pro-British and American factions, it can protect Britain's maritime lifeline; otherwise, there is a risk of threatening the movement of British ships in the Mediterranean.

In addition, the issue of the Dardanelles Straits has recently become very heated, and it is closely related to Greece. The Soviet Union is eager to control this waterway from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, but the United States and England strongly oppose it. In this region, Turkey and Greece are the only two countries controlled by anti-communist governments. If Greece leans to the left, it will effectively trap the European part of Turkey in an encirclement of pro-Soviet governments, and the Soviet Union can take a further step in controlling the Dardanelles Straits. Therefore, Turkey warmly welcomed the news of the restoration of the Greek king.

All of this is enough to explain why Greece is so important to various countries. Due to its geographical location, Greece is a base for political and military activities from the heart of the Balkans to the center of the Mediterranean.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Four Foreign Ministers Meet Again!

— Chu Yukun

The Relationship Between the US and the Soviet Union is Becoming Increasingly Delicate

In the past seven days, the international arena has been filled with an air of harmony. In particular, Marshal Stalin's remarks to a reporter from the Associated Press denied that relations between the United States and the Soviet Union were becoming increasingly tense and expressed that the Soviet Union was not particularly concerned about the entry of American warships into the Mediterranean. He also frankly stated that the Soviet Union genuinely had peaceful intentions, saying that the Soviet Union did not possess atomic bombs and that the western part of the Soviet Union had been devastated by the war, suffering heavy losses, and that it would take ten years to restore it to its former state. These remarks are indeed a stabilizing factor in the current world situation, and countries such as England, the United States, and France have all welcomed them, believing that the prospects for world cooperation are promising. However, there was a passage in Stalin's speech that involved Churchill, attacking him for attempting to incite a third world war; this aroused Churchill's dissatisfaction, and he delivered a speech in England, retorting in kind. Churchill firmly asserted that the total number of Soviet troops stationed abroad was two hundred divisions, while Stalin said that there were only sixty divisions. Thus, the dispute between two hundred and sixty has become a noteworthy issue on the international stage.

Molotov Remains Anti-American

Although Stalin's remarks had the effect of being pro-American and anti-British, the repercussions they caused internationally were quite positive. In particular, the American people, who were eager to live in peace with the Soviet Union, expressed their warm welcome; political and diplomatic figures generally believed that as long as Stalin's remarks were sincere and not just lip service, and would be put into action, then an improvement in US-Soviet relations would appear before our eyes. Following this, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on the 30th, proposing four suggestions: (1) All countries in the world should implement universal disarmament; (2) The use of atomic bombs in warfare should be prohibited; (3) The Security Council should exert its effectiveness in maintaining world peace; (4) A Trusteeship Council should be established as soon as possible.

These four suggestions are, in principle, likely to be approved by all countries in the world, especially since the United States has no reason to express any dissent. However, Molotov's speech was filled with anti-American rhetoric. He criticized the United States for using atomic energy as a backing for its foreign policy, using it to threaten other countries. At the same time, he used his dollar diplomacy strategy to try to control the entire world. He also attacked the entry of American warships into the Mediterranean. His views were completely different from Stalin's remarks, running in opposite directions, making one wonder whether the Soviet Union is now adopting a dual foreign policy. US Secretary of State Byrnes was the first to point out that Molotov's speech contradicted Stalin's remarks; at the same time, Austin, the chief representative of the United States at the United Nations General Assembly, also said that Molotov's speech had a cold war nature and seemed out of place; he said, "I do not believe that mutual accusations between allies can promote international unity."

Byrnes Issues a Warning

Molotov's speech clearly aroused two different reactions in the United States. One was the opposition, represented by former Secretary of Commerce Wallace, who said, "If the United States and the Soviet Union can treat each other honestly and each reduce their armaments, it is not impossible." On the government side, Byrnes expressed deep dissatisfaction with Molotov's speech. He was full of complaints, but for the sake of maintaining good relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, he remained silent and did not comment, but he was still very distressed in his heart. Therefore, he used the opportunity to issue a warning to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, saying, "If the Four Foreign Ministers Conference cannot reach an agreement on the German issue, then I will refuse to participate in any new international conference."

The Four Foreign Ministers Conference of England, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union opened as scheduled on the 4th of this month. According to the pre-budgeted agenda, the work completed by the Paris Peace Conference will first be reviewed and approved. The draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland are also expected to be passed in these few days. After being signed by various countries, they will be officially established. After the 20th of this month, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference will begin to discuss the German issue. All parties are already preparing for the discussion of the German issue.

The Issues of Japan and Korea Cannot Be Ignored

The Four Foreign Ministers Conference may discuss the issue of Allied control of Japan. According to the report of the US investigation team, Japanese financial cliques still control vast wealth and economic power; industrial associations. The continued existence of their latent power is indeed a threat to peace in the Far East. At the same time, the domestic economic situation is also continuing to improve, and they are now seeking to restore their foreign trade. It is expected that Japanese-made goods will once again flood the world market. The Ming country's policy of controlling Japan must be re-examined.

The Korean Southern Democratic Association also appealed to the United Nations on the 2nd of this month, making three demands: (1) Immediately implement the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations; (2) US and Soviet troops should immediately withdraw from Korea; (3) The Korean provisional government should be allowed to join the United Nations as a member state. It also said that "dividing Korea into two occupation zones is a direct threat to world peace." Standing in the position of a neighboring country, we express our deep sympathy and hope that the United Nations General Assembly will not turn a deaf ear, because how to resolve the Korean issue is something we cannot ignore.

### The Conflict Between India and the Islamic League

— Zhang Yiren

Nehru and Jinnah

In recent months, the conflict between Hindus and Muslims has been heard of daily in various parts of India. The plane carrying Interim Government President Nehru was also attacked some time ago. At this time, when India is facing independence, there is still internal infighting between Hindu and Muslim sects. People with old-fashioned minds think that India is only fit to be ruled temporarily and not fit to rule people, because "freedom and independence" only lead to more mutual killings and riots.

We must also not ignore the impact of the current Hindu-Muslim conflict on the Indian Interim Government; Nehru has to slow down his pace, and every action must be carefully considered. The general public in all major cities has a worse impression of Jinnah (leader of the Muslim League) than Nehru. Nehru has more of the masses and can still sway people's hearts, while Jinnah is single-mindedly unwilling to join the government to stop the conflict, which is his weakness. Nehru believes that Jinnah's opposition to the government is a small matter, while opposing the independence of the entire India is a matter of great importance. Nehru uses Jinnah's intention as a tool for counter-propaganda against Jinnah. However, this is not easy, and Jinnah is also taking the withdrawal of British troops from India as a bargaining chip everywhere. Since Nehru is known as a patriot, he must also make British troops withdraw from Indian soil as soon as possible. Once the British troops withdraw, Nehru will naturally become even greater in the eyes of the people! From Jinnah's point of view, he can begin to disrupt Nehru's interim government with violence at all costs. If Nehru uses his own army to suppress it at this time, then Jinnah can use the excuse that Nehru is oppressing Muslims and withdraw from the government.

In addition, another pillar of Nehru is foreign aid. Nehru has gained foreign sympathy. Therefore, Nehru's current work on Jinnah is to use all methods to isolate Jinnah's followers and prevent them from obtaining foreign support and sympathy. The last time Jinnah wanted to seek help from Soviet Russia, Nehru knew about it and "waved" to Molotov at the Paris Peace Conference; Jinnah wanted to establish a Muslim League country from the Red Sea to the Coral Sea, and Nehru specially sent a goodwill mission to the Near East countries for this purpose; in this way, Nehru's consistent policy is to isolate Jinnah, so that he cannot get international sympathy and help.

Today, not only do 300 million Indian people need independence, but we also need India to be free from the standpoint of Indian friends. However, the problem lies in whether India's independence is the Muslim League India that Jinnah hopes for or Nehru's India of all sects? This question will be answered by how the Hindu-Muslim conflict ends in the future! (Excerpted and translated from the Millard's Review)

### The Indian National Congress Party

— Zuo Qi

India has been under the economic control of the East India Company since the 17th century, becoming a vassal state of England. In 1876, the British king also became the Emperor of India, and it was officially reduced to a colony. It was not until recently that Nehru, the former chairman of the Indian National Congress Party, came forward to organize an independent interim government.

The predecessor of the National Congress Party—the National Congress—was established in 1885 and was originally an organization loyal to the British Governor-General of India. However, since the end of World War I in 1919, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the National Congress carried out a non-violent resistance movement of non-cooperation with England, thus forming a strong political party and becoming the base camp for the Indian independence movement.

The organization of the Congress Party (the abbreviation of the National Congress Party) includes the majority of Hindus and a minority of Muslims in terms of religion; in terms of class, there are princes, large landowners, entrepreneurs, low-ranking classes, and socialists, so there are many party members, numbering more than five million.

The Congress Party demands a unified Indian government, while the Muslim League (which believes in Islam) advocates the division of India and the Islamic League. Therefore, since the establishment of the interim government, the people of the two religions have been in constant conflict. Recently, the Muslim League agreed to participate in the government, and the reorganization has been completed. Although the conflict has not stopped, it is expected to gradually ease, and they will sincerely unite to serve the newly established independent government.

### Behind the Scenes of the US Election

— Special Article by the Editorial Office of this Newspaper Xi

More than 35 million American men and women will mobilize on November 5 to participate in the 80th National Election. This election will determine the political landscape of the 80th Congress, which will be convened in January next year. The first US Congress was convened in 1789.

Since the era of the founding fathers, American voters have used their voting rights without interruption. They elect the president and vice president (the executive branch of the government) every four years and determine the organization of Congress (the legislative branch) every two years. This year's election is commonly referred to as the congressional election because it only involves the election of members of Congress. The next presidential election will be held in November 1948.

The term of office for members of the House of Representatives is two years. Therefore, voters in each of the congressional districts in the 48 states will vote to elect all members of the House of Representatives, totaling 435 seats. The term of office for members of the Senate is six years, and elections are held every two years, with only one-third of the total number of seats being elected each time. This year, due to some deaths and resignations, the number of seats to be elected is slightly more than one-third; that is, 36 of the total of 96 seats. Maine has already elected a representative from that state in advance according to its laws, so the number of senators to be decided in this election is 35.

In each state, the number of congressional districts is determined by its population; New York, the most populous state, has a total of 45 districts and occupies the same number of seats in the House of Representatives. The least populous states have only one or two districts. Each state, regardless of size, can elect two senators.

For the 14 years since the birth of the "New Deal" under the leadership of the late President Roosevelt, the Democratic Party has always maintained its majority position in the Senate and the House of Representatives. This election is the first congressional election since Truman, who was elected vice president in 1944, succeeded as president last year.

Under the American political system, the power of each party in Congress is bound to rise and fall. If the opposition party has an advantage in Congress, or if it is composed of a Democratic majority in the Senate and a Republican majority in the House of Representatives, then President Truman's term may come to an end. The second situation described above has been seen many times in history. In the past 50 years, the opposition party has had an advantage in the House of Representatives before the expiration of the terms of US Presidents Taft, Wilson, and Hoover, although they at least maintained a minimum majority in the Senate before leaving office.

Regardless of the outcome of this election, the executive head of the US government will not change. President Truman will continue to hold office and will be able to retain all cabinet members and heads of government administrative departments, but in 1948, the presidential position will face a critical juncture. Therefore, the question worth noting in the current election is what kind of senators and representatives will be elected. The trend of the election is a reflection of public opinion, which will be carefully studied by party leaders and presidential candidates in 1948.

A Change of Pace

In the past few weeks, predicting the outcome of this election has become the main topic for political commentators and newspaper editors. However, this prediction is not easy for the following reasons: This election is the first general election in the United States after the war. If history repeats itself, voters may have the intention of "changing the pace"; after a party has held a majority for a considerable period of time, there will be cyclical changes; the lack of housing, food, and supplies; the unstable wages, prices, and cost of living; and the difficulty in determining the political trends of the 12 million to 13 million returning veterans, among whom the young people are voting for the first time.

Although Democratic and Republican candidates disagree on domestic issues, there is no significant dispute over US foreign policy. After traveling around the country, journalists have published their opinions, which are generally consistent. The comments of Drummond, the director of the Washington branch of the Christian Science Monitor, can be used as a representative. He said, "In the states I have traveled to, I have never encountered a Democratic or Republican congressional candidate who has raised any objections to US foreign policy."

In congressional elections, especially in House of Representatives district elections, local issues occupy an important position. In addition to voting for government candidates, more than 2 million public positions must also be elected, including municipal officials, judges, public school board members, and more than half of the governors. Therefore, in most states, the strength of party organizations and party members is enough to determine whether the Democratic Party or the Republican Party has an advantage in public opinion.

### Metaphors in Literary Works

— Zang Kejia

Metaphors occupy a significant position in various fields. A storyteller uses its magic to captivate the audience; when describing a beautiful woman, they might say she has "almond eyes, willow leaf eyebrows, pearly white teeth, and a willow-like waist," concluding with "truly like a celestial maiden descended to earth." Even the general public, including the so-called "peddlers and hawkers" often disdained by the literati, uses the weapon of metaphor in various situations. If someone has a slightly large head, they might be called "big-headed ghost"; if their tongue is long, they might be stuck with the nickname "hanging ghost." If someone's expression is cold, others might scold them, "as if someone owes you two hundred cash." The examples are truly countless. We scold Japanese militarists as if they were mad dogs, and Stalin, in a meeting, likened the Soviet Union to a vegetable garden and aggressive ambitious people to pigs.

Even outside the realm of language, it continues to operate and function. Forming a circle with the forefinger and thumb of both hands will immediately make it clear to others what they represent. Raising a hand above the head conveys a sense of depth or height. You can use gestures when speaking to someone; in short, this "unspoken understanding" relies entirely on the "comparison" to act as a bridge.

Now, let's confine it to the garden of literature to discuss.

Open any literary work at random, be it poetry, prose, or novel, and "metaphors" will dazzlingly catch the eye with their colors, tease the ears with their sounds, and stir up people's feelings with other different postures. I often wonder, if it were banished from the literary landscape, what would literature become? It is unimaginable. Therefore, we must investigate what it is about "metaphor" that gives it such magic. In fact, the answer is easy to find, as its very name clearly indicates its meaning. However, if a "definition" is absolutely necessary, it's simple: "to compare one thing to another," an old saying that gets the job done, doesn't it?

Metaphor is originally a technique in rhetoric, but it has achieved a very high status in literary expression. Open the "Classic of Poetry," the ancestor of all literature, and in the footnotes of each poem, you will encounter words like "Fu (descriptive)," "Bi (comparative)," and "Xing (evocative)." The expressive techniques of the entire "Classic of Poetry" are categorized into these three areas. Now, let's first study how it is applied in literature and then touch upon its function and other aspects.

"Hands like soft rushes, skin like congealed fat," "like flowers, like jade," bringing a woman's beauty before our eyes. "The thick strings hum like a sudden rainstorm, the thin strings whisper softly," "The clear sound of orioles chirping outside the flowers," the pure tones of music and the delicate voices of beautiful women resound in our ears. "What he eats resembles a sick horse, his moving shadow seems to shift mountains," this is a self-portrait of a patient. Reading "fallen flowers still resemble soldiers in formation," a poignant feeling of pity arises in the heart for the tragic death of a peerless beauty. "The vast future weighs heavily like a sea," "Just like a river of spring water flowing eastward," drawing for the reader the depth and magnitude of sorrow. To describe the swiftness of life, in China, there is the metaphor "time flies like an arrow, days pass like a weaver's shuttle," and in the West, there is the saying "I Come Like Water, Like Wind I go." "Radiant as peach and plum blossoms, cold as ice and frost," describing an unattainable immortal. If we were to continue citing such examples, we could easily exhaust an entire bottle of ink. All these "like, similar, resembling, as if, as... " are symbols of metaphor. In modern terms, that would be "same, similar to, seems, as if... " and so on. But one thing must be pointed out here: not everything that carries these words is necessarily related to metaphor. For example, "if it is so, if that were the case, it seems like this..." Conversely, some metaphors don't wear such outward clothing, but their essence is still metaphorical. "My heart is like ancient well water," "The half moon of the eighth month is as clear as a mirror." There are countless examples to show us.

Why does metaphor have such fiery magic? From the examples above, we can extract a general principle. If you only say "time runs so fast! Really fast!" even if you repeat "really fast" ten thousand times, you still won't be able to convey a sense of speed. If you say a beautiful woman is "really gorgeous," the reader won't be able to visualize a beautiful woman from the four empty words "really gorgeous." The reason is that you are only shouting abstractly without placing a concrete image before people's eyes. If you say "parents' love is as deep as the sea," you won't fall into the satire of Mr. Lu Xun: "The love of parents, oh, oh, I cannot express it." Speaking of which, we should understand the meaning and value of metaphor. It can give people a vivid impression that can be seen with the eyes, heard with the ears, touched with the hands, and smelled with the nose. With it, the posture of literature becomes lively, the colors become bright, like green leaves setting off red flowers, adding brilliant blossoms to embroidery.

A metaphor is not as easy as "summoning it and it comes," on the contrary, it is like "entreating it thousands of times before it finally appears." Every concrete or abstract thing and concept in the human world can be a metaphor for another thing. You call your lover "My Moon," but you can also say conversely "the moon seems like a beauty's face." "Lotus flowers are like faces, willows like eyebrows," you can also reverse the metaphor and apply it. To describe something, a concept, there can be countless similar comparisons. You have the right to compare a full moon to a beauty's face, but you can also compare it to a jade plate. You can compare a valuable death to Mount Tai and a worthless one to a feather, but you can also compare them to something else. However, while there are many things that can be compared, only a few, or even just one, are appropriate and perfect. Whoever can seize this most appropriate few or that one will be considered successful. Like shooting at a target, from the outside in, ring by ring, the number of rings that are hit indicates the shooter's skill level, and hitting the "bullseye" is the mark of a master.

How do you elicit a metaphor? This is not a simple question. We should start with the generation of metaphors. All phenomena in the natural world and human affairs create different images through the function of the senses, and these images are often accompanied by emotions. Seeing high mountains naturally gives rise to solemn thoughts, and seeing "a clear river as still as silk" gives rise to thoughts of detachment and tranquility. But at the same time, we should also analyze the essence and attributes of each image. For example, the moon is a planet, it has different shapes of waxing and waning, and it has a changing brightness... Having this one-sided knowledge is not enough. We must also dissect the essence of the thing to be compared in the same way, clarify both aspects, and then take the parts you need. "The moon is like a hook" uses the shape of a crescent or waning moon, "half a mirror in the blue sky," "a face like a full moon" are naturally different. "Longing is like a full moon, its clear brightness diminishes night after night," uses not its shape but its brightness. "Appearing like a rabbit escaping" - if it is not used to convey the idea of being good at running, and you say someone is like a rabbit, what would that be?

The same metaphor should be applied according to the circumstances. When playing funeral music, one can use the phrase "like resentment, like longing, like weeping, like pleading." But using this as a comparison in a wedding music setting would be a joke. "Suddenly hearing of the recovery of the Soviet North outside the sword pass, tears of joy wet my clothes at the first news." If you compare tears of joy to a source of sorrow, it only shows your ignorance. A blind man can make the joke of "groping a plate and tapping a candle," but a sighted person stubbornly putting Zhang San's hat on Li Si's head would truly be a joke of jokes. Metaphor only seeks approximation, not complete identity. Taking a photograph to compare it to a person, you can't say it "resembles" you; you should say it "is" you. The wonder of metaphor, the effectiveness of metaphor, lies entirely in this semblance. This contains an exaggeration that gives the reader a clearer, more vivid, and more prominent impression, increasing the infectiousness of literature. Loving someone, you say "I love her deeper than the sea," the reader will not accuse you of exaggeration, but will feel the depth of your love. "A neck like a caterpillar, cicada forehead and moth eyebrows," reading these two lines of poetry, we only feel that the comparison is good and will not scold the author for comparing a beautiful woman to some scary insects.

Sometimes you may feel that some metaphors seem "inappropriate." "The sun is like a broadcasting station placed in the sky," "A vague piece of sorrow, silent raindrops falling," at first glance, it seems unreasonable, but after savoring it, you feel that it is apt. Remember that Shelley also compared sound to color. But this is not something that can be randomly compared. It must be analyzed and compared, and the closest point must be taken. The acquisition of a metaphor goes through a long process; it is not inappropriate to say "creating a metaphor." In the application of metaphors, one must not be too verbose, coming up with a large string of them like Wen Tingyun and Li Shangyin of the late Tang Dynasty, only using them to cover up the emptiness of their content. Metaphor does not exist merely as an embellishment; it often fully contains emotions attached to an object. "Lotus face and willow eyebrows" touch the heart and wound the spirit, "How can I face this?" "Tears fall" accompanied by pressing memories. In order to avoid being too rigid, one need not fill the paper with words like "seems, same, generally..." etc. One can change the technique so that there is the reality of a metaphor without the appearance of one. "In the morning, they are like cut-off hibiscus flowers, in the evening, they follow the eastward flowing water." The concept of the impermanence of life is activated on the page through metaphor. Let's give another example:

(1) The force of the secluded valley brings up a string of deep thunder—the sound of artillery.

(2) Have you ever seen someone catching chickens at night?

They are caught just like that. There are many ways to put on metaphors. The flexibility and rigidity of the application depend entirely on the skill level of the technique.

We must discard stale metaphors without mercy. "Like beautiful flowers and flowing water," the creator of this metaphor was a genius, but unfortunately, its life has been tortured to death by the hands of some mediocre talents. Now, taking this skeleton as a treasure is truly becoming a slave. "Time flies like a white horse passing through a crack" no longer evokes a fresh impression. Changing the wording to "time passes faster than a horse" feels a bit fresher. Stale metaphors can also give people a new feeling, which must be based on the fact that they are placed in the right position. For example, the metaphor "dream-like" immediately feels a bit annoying, because one is tired of seeing "life is like a dream" and similar sentences. But writing "Snowflakes fall dream-like" in a poem, you might want to read it a second time. "Turning rottenness into something magical" is not easy. Seeing butterflies and calling them sisters, seeing the moon and calling it an elder sister, those who have lowered the value of metaphors too much, this little essay may be of some use to them.

### Sichuan Clouds (Oil Painting)

— Guan Liang

### Turgenev and Women

— Shen Si

The Russian novelist Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev (1818-1883), although he lived a solitary life, was never without women. In 1841 (at the age of thirty-three), he returned to the Soviet Union from Germany for the first time and fell in love with a serf girl from his own household. Later, this serf girl married another Soviet official, which greatly angered Turgenev. In his later years, he fell in love with a Madame Feydeau, and the two got along quite well. He would show her each of his works after completion. Once, when his famous work "Smoke" was completed, she happened to be in Berlin, so he felt very sad and depressed all day long.

### Art and Science

— A Long

Art is an abstract name, and if we were to give it a footnote, we could say this: anything that achieves its "purpose" through "expression," where the expression seems impractical and especially useless in terms of material things, is called art.

Therefore, art and science become two extremely separate departments, because science is geared towards the practical, making discoveries that benefit human life. As a result, the argument that science is the truth arises. Regarding this kind of dogmatism, there is room for consideration, or rather, it should be discarded, because it obliterates the function of art. It is impossible for science to pass through the inorganic, organic, psychological, and physiological to reach the so-called phenomenon of human life; we deny this.

The concept of science lies only in the word "knowledge"—an abstract concept. Scientists use this to advance the era, humans are able to progress, and the world can be transformed. However, science has many shortcomings: for example, the prosperity of science has led to the invention of the atomic bomb. The atomic bomb itself is innocent, but humans use it to threaten world peace and maintain world peace. Therefore, some people attribute the impact of the atomic bomb's invention on world peace entirely to knowledge. This is just like a politician selling out the country for personal gain.

The reason is that knowledge has unreliable concepts to affirm its "ideas." And art can often avoid this shortcoming, but it cannot be said absolutely. I once heard someone say, "Beauty" is enough to arouse desire but cannot satisfy a person's selfishness. To this, we have nothing to say; he is a traitor to beauty!

Similarly, seeing a beautiful woman in a painting will stir the heart; this is because the observer's immoral concept exists. Art can only be an observer, and only art that does not arouse desire can be called true art!

Therefore, art is difficult, immortal, and art has countless truths. To put it plainly, art should be "applicable to all under heaven and await the judgment of sages for generations without confusion."

### Dew

— Jiang Dun

People who love dawn always like dewdrops.

When the black night passes and the rosy clouds dye the east red, in the awakening garden, on the flower buds, on the tips of the leaves, hang crystal clear and fresh dewdrops, like the tears in a young girl's eyes! They contain joy, but also endless sorrow...

People who love dawn often have a dewdrop-like state of mind. In the ocean of the universe, humans are as small as a drop of dew. Morning dew longs for the caress of the morning sun, and then melts into the embrace of the morning sun, dissolving everything of itself. Like all those who pursue sunshine, when dawn arrives, they have offered their entire lives!

Dewdrops are formed in the cold of the night. Let the warm sunshine take them away. Dewdrops nourish all the flowers and leaves facing the sun! Dewdrops are the enlightenment of dawn.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 84

— Ye Jingfeng

Having gone only a few steps, I suddenly heard that fellow, opening his hoarse voice, start singing our local tune:

"A maiden of eighteen years, goes into the embroidery room—

Entering the embroidery room, endlessly thinking of her beloved—

Her beloved, far away on the horizon—

Far away on the horizon, doesn't it break my heart!—"

The more this guy sang, the smaller his voice became, and the further he walked away. From the pronunciation of these words, it can be determined that this guy must be a Japanese devil, who must have spent a lot of time in the Northeast; otherwise, it must be some traitor here who taught him this folk song. It's a pity that he learned it very well, but every sentence can't get rid of the Japanese ending particle, "Pu," just like the fox spirit in the story, although it has cultivated into human form, it just didn't get rid of its tail.

When Tiger heard this guy singing, he almost laughed several times, and at the same time, he felt a bit annoyed; I also felt a little unable to restrain my laughter. This seemed to completely relax our tense mood and revive our spirits. Taking advantage of the fact that the searchlight had not yet swept over, I curled up my feet, because they had been stretched straight for a long time and had become stiff and sore. Who knew that this curl revealed that everything below my thighs was several times heavier and, after being soaked, had not been active, resulting in some numbness. My feet were even heavier and could not be pulled over. The pair of leather shoes I was wearing were completely filled with mud, forming a round ball, looking like two newly mud-coated preserved eggs.

While we were tidying up our shoes and socks, we spoke quietly. I told Tiger the principle of the searchlight so that he wouldn't worry, and also told him that it would be best to wait for the light to pass briefly before starting to climb over the wall. This would be the safest and most unhurried option.

After we tidied up, we rested for a while. We each took out a little something from our small pockets and ate it, and then we prepared to climb over the wall. The searchlight had already turned past three or four times while we were resting, and the timing was very accurate, so we didn't need to worry too much.

This stone wall was probably six or seven feet high, and the top was paved flat. When the light passed, at a prearranged signal, Tiger placed his hand on the top of the wall, shrugged slightly, and, as nimble as a civet cat, he had already reached the top of the wall, lying prostrate there, giving me a gesture of safety. Seeing this gesture, I immediately shrugged and climbed up the wall, also lying prostrate on the top of the wall like Tiger. As soon as I focused my eyes and looked around inside the wall, Tiger had already slid down along the wall. Sliding two steps at a time, like a black shadow, he crossed a road about ten feet wide and burrowed into the trees on the other side of the road.

This wall was more than a foot thick, entirely made of mountain stones. The top of the wall was paved very flat, and at the base of the wall inside, there was a foot-and-a-half-high platform. This was probably prepared for people to stand on, just at the height of an average person, so it would be convenient to shoot outwards. Down the platform was a tidy road, wide enough for two large military trucks to run side by side with plenty of room to spare. On the edge of the road, along the road were planted neatly arranged clumps of trees, seven or eight feet high and three or four feet thick. In this dim night, looking at both ends, this heavenly road seemed to have no end. Beyond the trees, there were no buildings; it must have been a boundless plaza.

### Who Buys?

— Shao Fu

According to the person in charge of the Trust Bureau, the result of the first public auction of enemy and puppet properties was that one of the three properties, although someone had already paid to purchase it, the original occupying agency had not yet moved out. The buyer spent a huge sum of nearly ten thousand yuan, only to obtain ownership.

This is a lesson. With such high interest rates, who would be willing to spend money to quarrel with others and increase trouble? It's really being idle with nothing better to do! Therefore, although this time a magnificent full-page advertisement has been published for the public auction of thirty-nine units of enemy and puppet properties, I am afraid that very few people will inquire, because for those friends who really have money, there are all kinds of real estate for sale in Shanghai. Why bother to seek trouble and headaches for oneself!

If no one buys, the Trust Bureau is not responsible and will hand it over to the Disposal Bureau. The Disposal Bureau has been very competent and meritorious in dealing with these complex enemy and puppet properties for more than a year. However, it is a temporary agency that will end in a short period of time, so how can it leave a pending case behind? And ordering the original occupants to move out first is neither reasonable nor justifiable. Moreover, the case of an agency on Kangding Road is a cautionary tale. What to do? It's a headache!

Why bother with a headache? Take from the people, use for the people. The authorities' main goal is only to recover legal currency, but selling with one hand and allocating funds to build civil housing on a grand scale with the other is truly laughable. In fact, the two things could have been done together. If the Trust Bureau is the owner, can't it collect a deposit from the tenants? Can't it collect rent from the tenants? The sum of these numbers is not too different from the reserve price of the auction, is it? One might as well calculate this and see if the two responsible agencies can report to the higher authorities based on the situation.

A Letter to the Editor

### Garbage All Over Shanghai

— Jin Yishui

Dear Editor:

I am a civil servant, and based on what I know and have seen, I cannot remain silent about the appearance of Shanghai. What I want to say now is: (1) The southeastern end of the main thoroughfare of the city center, by the Sichuan Road Bridge, which has now been designated as a car park (formerly a Chinese park opened by the Public Works Department), is occupied by some refugees, who have made it filthy and littered. Piles of excrement have accumulated at the bridge approach for more than a month, and the stench is overwhelming. Countless pedestrians pass by here every day, covering their noses as they pass.

Of course, I am one of the people who pass by every day, and I have been tolerating it all along, thinking that someone would come forward to attack the city authorities. However, after tolerating it for more than a month, the situation remains the same; therefore, out of a citizen's responsibility, I have taken up my pen late at night, in my busy schedule, to express it. I want this shameful phenomenon, which has made China lose face, to be swept away as soon as possible, and only then will I be happy! On a wooden pole on the bridge approach, there is a telephone exclusively for the police局. Every day, I see police officers covering their noses while making calls. If the police officers making the calls would report the foul odor to their superiors, or if their superiors would report it to the people in charge of cleaning affairs to clear it away, it would be a very simple matter. However, it has not been cleared for a month. I really doubt whether any of the Public Works Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the police局 of the municipal government have ever passed by the Sichuan Road Bridge. If even one person had reported this matter, then the superiors should have immediately taken action. If the director, mayor, and other leaders do not receive reports from their staff on a daily basis, it is clear that their subordinates are not doing their duty. If subordinates are not doing their duty, it means that superiors are not diligent and strict in supervision. Following this reasoning, it is not difficult to gradually track down the responsible personnel for every bad incident in the city, so that they cannot evade responsibility. This can be achieved if the superiors put in a little effort in organization and supervision. Therefore, when I am angry, I hate the mayor for being incompetent in managing his subordinates, and the directors and section chiefs cannot shirk responsibility either. If refugees are allowed to occupy the car park on Sichuan Road Bridge, so that cars that were originally on the road are still parked on the road, assuming that refugees are allowed to live there, is it necessary for Shanghai to display these refugees in the conspicuous central district? If refugees need assistance, then provide them with assistance. If they cannot be assisted, immediately evict them. The matter is very simple. However, what is the Social Affairs Bureau doing? What is the purpose of the Public Works Bureau building a car park? I always hate the municipal government for not caring. I hate even more that the citizens don't rise up to report such small things. A few cleaners could solve the problem of clearing away the excrement, but they can't even do it.

Also, there have been two large puddles on the sidewalk opposite the Huiluo Company, north of Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road, for several months. Every day when I pass by, I have to be on guard, fearing that the mayor's car will pass by and splash dirty water everywhere, and that pedestrians will be splashed with a few drops of dirty water. But I have never seen anyone go to repair it. In addition, there are many asphalt pieces accumulated on the sidewalk on the east side of Yi Si Temple. Because it has been there for a long time, the result of pedestrians trampling on it for a long time is that it has taken root. I hate the Public Works Bureau for not finding a way to remove it sooner. This work is also very easy. In addition, the Public Works Bureau accumulates small stones and sand on the sidewalk in advance when repairing roads, often accumulating it for ten and a half months before starting work, making it inconvenient for pedestrians to walk, and even causing vehicles to hit and injure pedestrians on the road. In fact, the Public Works Bureau should send materials on the day of the road repair and clear them away immediately after completion.

Dear Editor, please feel free to attack the bad situation in the city. This kind of attack is to promote the progress of the city and to make the mayor listen more to the opinions of the people. It is definitely not malicious. I am not making a mountain out of a molehill. I want Shanghai to progress and the municipal government to win the hearts of the people, so I say this.

### Driver Causes Accident, Executed On the Spot

— Zheng Fan

The Da Xi Bao reported on the 3rd of this month: When the Wuxi County Government's car was returning to the city from visiting Meiyuan, it hit Jing Shi, a trainee of the military officer corps, due to speeding, resulting in serious injuries and death. Military officers and corps members nearby witnessed the tragic scene and were filled with indignation. They took the county government secretary in the car, along with the driver and assistant, to the corps headquarters and reported to their superiors for instructions. As a result, the driver, Zhu Linbao, was executed by firing squad at the scene of the accident. The secretary and driver's assistant were taken to the local court to await trial.

Comparing this news with the recent jeep accident in Shanghai, the value of human life is as different as heaven and earth. I know that some citizens who have always been intimidated by the power of the city's bullies will surely applaud and cheer when they see this.

However, in reality, the driver was executed by firing squad for negligent homicide due to careless driving. This is ultimately a destructive, ridiculous, and hateful act of justice!

The newspaper also said: "The trainee survived eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, having narrowly escaped many battles, only to die in this tragedy." This is precisely the reason why the driver's life had to be forfeited. The driver was truly unlucky. Wouldn't it have been better if he had hit an old woman from the countryside or a peddler?

Furthermore, it is worth noting that the person who was killed was a military man. What if the driver had been a military man? People in Shanghai would probably frown again!

Mental Health

### Two Types of Fatigue

— Bin Zhi

Everyone feels tired after working for too long. The purpose of rest is to recover from fatigue, and sleep is the best rest. That's what everyone thinks. However, the reality is not so simple. Physical fatigue can be recovered after a night's sleep, but mental fatigue may not necessarily be relieved.

Mental Labor and Physical Labor

A person who engages in physical labor can fully recover their physical strength after a night's rest, no matter how heavy the work is during the day. A person who engages in mental labor also feels clearer in their mind after waking up from sleep. This is because, whether a person engages in mental or physical labor, physical exertion increases during work, and physical exertion decreases during rest. The new growth is more than what is consumed, so physical fatigue is easily recovered. Mental fatigue refers to psychological aversion to work.

When a person is working, their nerves must be extremely tense, which is very inappropriate in terms of mental health. Working under nervous tension for a long time will feel monotonous and boring, which is the cause of fatigue. The simpler and more mechanical the work, the easier it is to feel monotonous, even though it is easier in terms of mental and physical effort. Changing jobs is a common way to adjust the mind and avoid aversion to work due to monotony.

Tension and Relaxation

School timetables are created based on the principles of variation and adjustment. If it is not possible to change jobs for the time being, then being able to relax tense nerves for a moment will also quickly recover, because this is not true fatigue. For example, having a cigarette or a cup of tea while working is simply a way to temporarily relax the nerves.

Emotions are a factor that contributes to fatigue. When nerves are tense, feelings of overthinking, hesitation, and inferiority often arise, leading to unstable emotions and even psychological abnormalities. It is very common to hope that work will be completed but to be distracted by thoughts, or to get angry when work cannot proceed smoothly. Emotional unrest or even outbursts are more often caused by people than by things. Being dissatisfied with someone and involving their work, or feeling averse to one's own work as if it were related to them, is something that a manager should not ignore.

Interest can reduce mental fatigue. A person with low ability who takes on a heavy workload will not only be overwhelmed but will also feel very distressed psychologically. Conversely, using great talent for a small task can also cause the person doing the work to feel bored. These are all reasons why people lose interest in their work. Therefore, a good manager can allocate work well, not only allowing each person to develop their talents but also generating great interest in the work, which promotes increased work efficiency. Interest is the driving force behind work. Although interest is related to talent, half of it depends on cultivation. Success can generate interest, and rewards can also increase interest. The way work is done and the environment in which it is done are also indirectly related to interest.

The working environment is inversely proportional to fatigue. The more perfect the environment, the more energetic people will be and the less tired they will feel. Perfect does not mean having spring-loaded sofas and moving music like in a cafe or dance hall, but attention must be paid to light, air, humidity, and furniture to make people feel very comfortable and happy, because good mental health is based on good physical health.

Ordinary fatigue is not due to a lack of physical or mental strength, but rather to a shadow cast over the mind, which can be easily and quickly recovered from. This is not an illusion but a targeted remedy, as the saying goes, "A mental illness requires a mental cure."

### Engagement Ring

— Qian

In Washington, someone was driving out for a trip early in the morning and saw a young woman standing under a street lamp, completely naked, but still wearing an engagement ring on her finger. According to her, because she refused to return the engagement ring to her boyfriend, he stripped her of all her clothes. (Translated from the Continental News, October 29)

### Society of the Lolo People

— Lecture by Professor Fang Hao, recorded by Ma Huixin

The place is peaceful, and doors are not locked at night.

This summer, Professor Fang Hao of Fudan University Chongqing Campus and others returned to Shanghai and gave a lecture at Fudan University in Jiangwan, entitled "Southwest Customs." The part about the Lolo people is quite valuable, so it is specially recorded and presented to Free Talk:

"In order to investigate the life customs of the Lolo people, I went to the villages of the Lolo people, hundreds of miles away from Kunming. The basic conditions for researchers are to have a strong physique, be able to ride horses, climb mountains, and sometimes bring interpreters."

The Lolo people call the Han Chinese "Kejia" (guests); they themselves do not want the Kejia to call them Lolo, and they consider themselves "Chinese." This is a symbol of unity.

Luggage does not need to be locked; they will not steal.

The interpreter told the Kejia that when traveling to their villages, luggage should not be locked, because they have a strong sense of self-respect, and they think that locking things means that the Kejia are afraid of them stealing. This is a sign of unfriendliness and distrust. They think it is very humiliating. However, they are also very curious and like to look at the clothes of the Kejia. A Lolo woman asked a Kejia for a man's shirt because she simply didn't know it was men's clothing. If there are some things you don't want to give them, they won't force you.

The Lolo people treat guests at night. They think that the most polite way to treat guests is to send two women to accompany them. When you go to sleep, they ask about tea and water and serve you attentively; otherwise, they think it is disrespectful. These women are called "living pillows." They are very humble and never leave. This is difficult for the researchers, who have to call the interpreter to convey their meaning and ask them to leave. At first, the researchers didn't know what was going on. After the interpreter told them, they learned the above-mentioned details. Now, this custom has gradually been eliminated after being taught and influenced by professors and others who have gone to the southwest for research. The place is also very peaceful, with no thieves, and residents can leave their doors unlocked at night. This is something that we cannot reach in our current environment. There are no poor people in the Lolo people's area. If someone doesn't have a job, people are willing to give you work and provide food and clothing.

Also, the doors of their houses are never directly opposite the doors of other people's houses. Therefore, the doors of each house are always set at an angle. They also do not interfere in other people's business, so there is no trouble.

Once, the Lolo people took the researchers to a place that was just a clearing with trees on three sides and no furnishings, which made people feel strange. The Lolo people said that it was the place where young Lolo men and women talked about love. Their love is also very free.

The Lolo people are very respectful of gods. In a deep forest, they surrounded the area with ropes, and sheep horns were tied to the ropes. They stipulated that women were not allowed to enter this area. The object of worship was a black stone, which was hidden in a hole dug in the ground. It was taken out every winter solstice, and the blood of slaughtered sheep was used to worship the gods.

A Strange Custom: A Small Coffin Placed on the Grave

They also have a strange custom: after a person dies and is buried, they make another small coffin, a few inches long, on which is written the name of the deceased, the date of birth and death, etc., with bamboo slips inside. If the deceased is a man, then hair is tied to the bamboo slips. These small coffins are hidden in the rock caves of steep mountains and cliffs, arranged in a very orderly manner. They consider these things to be very sacred, and outsiders must not transfer them. The researchers, accompanied by an interpreter, quietly ventured to climb the cliffs on a moonlit night when everyone was asleep. I (Fang said himself) hid one in my bag and brought it back for academic research.

The Lolo people are also very patriotic. It is said that during the War of Resistance against Japan, a statistic showed that more than eighty Lolo people in a certain area donated eight thousand Yunnan banknotes and one thousand French francs. In the circumstances at the time, their financial resources were already very wealthy. Their eyesight is good, and they can ride horses and shoot guns. It is said that many Lolo people participated in the victory of the Battle of Taierzhuang.

In a school run by Swiss people, a Lolo student ranked first in the Latin exam. This shows that they are also very intelligent.
