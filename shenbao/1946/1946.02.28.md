### Our Country Has Expressed Its Basic Position; The Gloom Over the Northeast May Clear; The Seriousness of Military Conflict Has Also Diminished

[Special Dispatch from Hankou on the 27th] Premier Song, when passing through Hankou, told people that the Northeast problem should be resolved soon, and hoped that the people of the country would not worry too much.

[Special Dispatch from Beiping on the 26th] A qualified person told reporters that the heavily overcast Northeast sky will soon have hope of clearing up. Although President Chiang's meeting with Wedemeyer, Eisenhower's inspection of the Pacific coast, General Keelen's visit to China, and Marine Corps Commander General Locky's trip to Pearl Harbor have all increased the heavy feeling about the Northeast problem, practically speaking, the current situation is already slightly better than before. (1) After this problem was made fairly public, China's basic position and attitude have been more easily recognized by the Soviet Union. The final plan that Chiang Ching-kuo took to Moscow may be given considerable importance by the Soviet Union. (2) The recently signed military reorganization plan includes the Northeast region, which has greatly reduced the severity of military conflicts in the Northeast and has the potential for a fundamental solution. (3) Although the official side still suspects whether the East Mongolian delegation has international or party affiliations after arriving in Beiping, their statement that they seek autonomy within the Republic of China has slightly calmed the storm brought about by the initial information obtained by the official side. Therefore, the situation in the Northeast has the hope of becoming clearer. The spokesperson also told reporters that personnel from the Changchun Railway Company had flown from Chongqing to Beiping a few days ago and will transfer to Changchun in the next day or two, which proves that the Northeast problem has not deteriorated to the extent it did on November 17th of last year. Zhang Jia'ao will come to Beiping shortly to convey the central government's intentions and then transfer to the Northeast. Official figures all believe that Zhang Jia'ao's visit to the north will symbolize that the government has a solution to the Northeast problem, but some also say: if the Northeast deteriorates to the point where a second Changchun evacuation is necessary, Zhang Jia'ao will still go to be the host of the evacuation.

[Special Dispatch from Changchun on the 26th] The Northeast problem has now reached an extremely important stage. Although this is purely a diplomatic problem, some people often mix it with domestic politics, and the actions of these people often shift with diplomatic developments. The complexity of the problem lies here, and the danger lies here as well. There are many Eighth Route Army soldiers in various parts of the Northeast. Some of them came from Shandong in recent months, and most of the rest were organized locally. Their strength is greatest in the east, and they are also scattered along the Changchun Railway line. The train from Panjin to Dalian has Eighth Route Army checkpoints ten miles outside Shenyang, checking the passengers in the train. Trains between Shenyang and Changchun are also often checked in the Tieå²­ area. The checkpoint between Changchun and Harbin is in Dehui. Their relationship with the Soviet army seems to be non-interfering on the surface, but they are sometimes often driven out by the Soviet army. Taking the takeover of Jiutai County as an example, when the county magistrate Qiao Guifang first went to take over, the local Eighth Route Army and the Soviet army were mixed together. The Soviet city defense commander suggested that Qiao negotiate with the Eighth Route Army, but Qiao insisted on taking over from the Soviet army, and thus returned without results. When he took over for the second time, the Soviet army had ordered the Eighth Route Army to withdraw in advance. Yang Hualei, the Eighth Route Army county magistrate, left a letter to Qiao, saying that the retreat was in accordance with the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference and was by no means a show of weakness. Later, when Qiao took over the Yingchengzi coal mine in the county, the Soviet army commander even forced the Eighth Route Army to withdraw more than 50 kilometers away and set a deadline of March 1, with no objection from the Eighth Route Army, but when the National Army advanced, they did not hesitate to risk their lives to resist. Currently, the fighting in the Faku area northwest of Shenyang is fierce, with casualties on both sides. An encounter battle also once occurred in Nongan County after the takeover. In addition, administrative agencies have now been established in all provinces and counties where the Eighth Route Army is located. It is said that the administrative leaders are all elected by the people. They also plan to invite Kuomintang members to participate to form a united front. It is claimed that this is based on the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference, but they rarely mention the decision to exclude the Northeast. These events have mostly occurred recently. The Eighth Route Army in the Northeast has only been around for the past six months. When the takeover personnel arrived here last year, it was still brewing, but now it is everywhere, and the speed of development is astonishing. It is generally believed that the existence of these facts has already added many difficulties in diplomacy, but if diplomacy and domestic politics are completely separated, then a solution is very easy. Currently, the focus of the problem is still on diplomacy, but this diplomacy must be conducted openly, reversing the past practice of acting secretly. I believe that if diplomatic activities here had been conducted in an open manner from the beginning, then the situation would not have become so complicated today. Also, regarding the Fushun incident, it has never been made public here, and most people are unaware of this tragedy, which easily leads to the misunderstanding that the people have lost heart. In the reporter's observation, although the current Northeast problem is extremely serious, if we accept past experience and find a good way to solve it, it is not impossible to break the deadlock immediately. However, the issue of tidying up after this deadlock is broken, especially the issue of selecting the people to engage in this tidying-up work, must be reconsidered.

### Chief of Staff of the Soviet Army in Changchun Declares That the Withdrawal Is in Progress and Hopes to Complete It Before the American Army Leaves China

[TASS Changchun, 26th] Lieutenant General Drozd, Chief of Staff of Marshal Linovsky, held a press conference today and issued the following statement: "In view of the various inaccurate reports in Chinese and foreign newspapers that distort the true situation of the Soviet army's delayed withdrawal from the Northeast, the headquarters of Marshal Malinovsky intends to clarify this situation." "The withdrawal of the Soviet army began in November 1945, but was temporarily suspended due to the first and second requests of the Chinese government, extending to February 1. On January 15, 1946, the Soviet army resumed its withdrawal, which is still in progress, and a considerable number of Soviet troops have already left the Northeast." "However, the reason why the withdrawal of the Soviet army has been slightly delayed is because the Chinese government troops have been extremely slow to move into the areas vacated by the Soviet army. As a result, in many cases, the Soviet army did not know who to hand over the land to. In this regard, one thing is worth noting, that is, last fall, the Chinese government had repeatedly protested to the Soviet army command that the Soviet army was withdrawing before the Chinese government troops arrived." "The Soviet army command had to pay attention to this situation. In addition, it must be kept in mind that a large part of the railways and vehicles in the Northeast had been destroyed by the defeated Japanese army that had been hit by the Red Army. The lack of coal and the winter conditions in the Northeast, on the whole, have created serious obstacles to normal railway transportation." "Finally, along the transportation routes, especially along the railway routes, bandits formed by the remnants of the Japanese puppet troops continue to be active and carry out attacks, thus hindering the free movement of the Soviet army." "The Northeast Soviet Army Command expects to complete the withdrawal of the Soviet army before the US military command can withdraw the US military in China, or in any case, no later than this time. Therefore, all the news in some Chinese and foreign newspapers that the Soviet army deliberately delayed its withdrawal from the Northeast are slanders and fabrications by anti-Soviet, reactionary, and anti-democratic elements, the purpose of which is to shake the Chinese people's trust and goodwill towards the Red Army that liberated them from the enslavement of the Japanese imperialist bandits in Manchuria."

### The Soviet Union Has No Special Rights to Transport Industrial Equipment in the Northeast; The US Secretary of State Denies That There Was an Agreement

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] US Secretary of State Byrnes (see picture) denied at a press conference this afternoon that any tripartite agreement stipulated that the Soviet Union could take away machinery or factory equipment in Northeast China. When asked by reporters whether the Secretary of State knew of any group power country that wanted to undermine the unity of the Four Powers, he answered solemnly that the Four Powers would definitely continue to cooperate in peacetime, as they had in wartime.

[US News Agency, Washington, 26th] Secretary of State Byrnes announced at a press conference today that he had not received any reports of the withdrawal of the Soviet occupation forces from Manchuria. He made this statement in response to a reporter's question, based on news from London that Moscow Radio broadcast that most of the Soviet occupation forces in Manchuria had withdrawn. A reporter said: The commander of the Soviet army in Shenyang had said that the removal of heavy industrial equipment from a dozen factories in Shenyang by the Red Army was based on an agreement of the Big Three. The reporter then asked if there was such an agreement? Byrnes replied: As far as he knows, there is no such agreement. Another reporter asked whether the Chinese side had notified the US government of the Soviet army's transportation of materials. He replied no. Byrnes further denied that the US government had obtained reports from its own agencies or from the Chinese and Soviet sides that the Soviet Union had demanded commercial privileges in Manchuria other than the railway and port agreements of Lushun and Dalian.

### The United States Has Agreed to the Soviet Union's New Annexed Territory

A reporter asked the Secretary of State whether the Soviet Union's annexation of the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin into its territory violated the following method, that is, all enemy territories permanently disposed of should be carried out at the peace conference, and should not be done by unilateral action. And is this a precedent for the United States to obtain defense bases in the Pacific? Byrnes replied: As he said, according to international law, all territorial concessions should be made in the form of treaties. According to international law, if one wants to make a certain land recognized by others, then one can only follow the treaty procedure, which may be voluntary, or as in the case of defeated countries, passive. Mr. Byrnes replied to a reporter's question whether he did not intend to recognize the above-mentioned areas ceded to the Soviet Union unless a treaty was signed. Mr. Byrnes said that the United States is bound by the agreement and has agreed to support the transfer of the land to the Soviet Union. When the treaty is concluded in the future, he will advocate that the United States should fulfill its promise and include the above-mentioned land into the territory of the Soviet Union in the treaty. A reporter asked what would happen if someone objected during the treaty negotiation? Byrnes replied: At that time, one can decide what steps to take.

### Press Conference for Foreign Reporters: Minister Wu Answers Questions

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] The press conference for foreign reporters was held at 3:00 pm today, hosted by Minister Wu Guozhen and Director He Fengshan. The main Q&A is recorded as follows:

(Q) Soviet news broadcasts have stated that the recent student protests in Chongqing against the Yalta Secret Agreement and the Soviet Union's policy towards the Northeast were assisted or organized by the Chinese government. Please state China's official attitude.

(A) The government has never assisted or organized student protests. On the contrary, the government has used various methods to dissuade them. Anyone who has witnessed the student protests in Chongqing must feel that they are completely spontaneous, and the students are all there, so you can go and ask them in person.

(Q) Please explain in detail the results of the recent military conference held in Nanjing.

(A) There were only two agenda items for this conference. In terms of reorganizing the troops, it was decided to reorganize the existing 273 divisions into 90 divisions. This adjustment will be completed around the end of May. After the downsizing, a unified organization will be completed. This work will take about six months. In addition, the employment and placement of the surplus officers and soldiers after the reorganization was discussed.

(Q) Foreign Minister Wang previously raised questions to the Soviet side regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast. Has the Chinese government received a reply?

(A) The government has not received a reply to date.

(Q) Does Ambassador to the Soviet Union Fu Bingchang bring back a statement of the Soviet side's attitude?

(A) Ambassador Fu left Moscow a few weeks ago to go to London to attend the United Nations General Assembly. This time, he returned directly from London to Chongqing, so he did not bring back any documents.

### Gold Prices Continue to Fall in Nanjing and Shanghai

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing on the 27th] Gold prices in Nanjing continued to fall this afternoon due to weak prices in Shanghai, falling by 140,000.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 27th] This morning, the opening price of gold bars was 142,000 yuan at the highest, and the closing price was 140,000 yuan. The closing price of ingots was 137,000 yuan. The highest price of US dollars was 2,040 yuan, and the closing price was 2,020 yuan.

[United Press International, Beiping, 27th] The Beiping authorities today ordered the suspension of gold and silver bar transactions. Military police were ordered to go to registered and black market firms to remove telephones.

[Local News] The market prices of gold, US dollars, and securities in this city fell further yesterday. Gold once fell to 138,000 yuan, and the US dollar fell even more sharply, once reaching a low of 2,070 yuan. Other bond and stock markets were also uniformly weak and unable to rise. According to financial circles, the black market gold price once rose to a peak of 75 US dollars equivalent to one tael of gold. According to today's market price, it has fallen to 66.3 US dollars equivalent to one tael. However, the official price of gold in the United States is only 35 US dollars per tael. Although there are also slight signs of a black market, the distance is not very large. Therefore, the black market gold price in this city is much higher than the US market. If the price of US dollars tends to fall or gradually stabilizes in the future, then the price of gold will also gradually fall.

[Special Dispatch from Hankou on the 26th] Grain prices in Hankou have fallen back, with each dan falling by about 5,000 yuan. The municipal government has also invited relevant agencies to form a Civil Food Adjustment Committee to suppress the rising trend.

### Premier Song Arrives in Shanghai from Hankou to Preside Over the Opening of the Foreign Exchange Market

[News from This Newspaper] Premier Song Ziwen, accompanied by his wife Ms. Zhang Leyi, Secretary Xu Shixuan, Zhu Zhongdao, and others, flew east from Hankou at around 9:00 am yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 12:30 pm. Also arriving were Qian Changzhao, Deputy Director of the Resources Committee, and Liu Gongyun, Director of the Bureau for the Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Property. Premier Song then drove to the temporary Shanghai office of the Executive Yuan in the Bank of China Building on the Bund at 3:20 pm to work. He successively met with Chen Yi, Administrative Governor of Taiwan Province, and Li Zeyi, advisor to the office, and Song Hanzhang, General Manager of the Bank of China. It is reported that Premier Song's visit to Shanghai will preside over the opening of the foreign exchange market. He will also instruct on the procedures for the Central Bank to manage foreign exchange trading and listing, in order to achieve the goal of stabilizing finance and stabilizing prices. In addition, Premier Song's stay in Shanghai will not be too long. He may return to Chongqing after the foreign exchange market procedures are deployed to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee. In addition, the newly appointed President of the Central Bank, Bei Zuyi, was originally scheduled to fly from Chongqing to Shanghai yesterday to take office, but was unable to do so due to weather. He should arrive in Shanghai within a day or two.

[Special Dispatch from Hankou on the 27th] Premier Song and his wife and a party of more than ten people flew from Chongqing to Shanghai yesterday. They landed in Wuhan at around 6:00 pm due to weather conditions. Few people knew about this beforehand. After staying at the Bank of China, they met with Chairman Wang, Deputy Governor Guo, and Mayor Xu. Director Cheng of the General Headquarters also paid a visit. According to Song, after the foreign exchange market was opened, gold prices in Chongqing had fallen, and the government would take effective measures to stabilize finance, and gold prices would continue to fall in the future. In terms of food, the food aid from the China Relief Mission will be transported to Hankou in large quantities, and the rising trend will also be suppressed.

[News from This Newspaper] The Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance in the Nanjing and Shanghai area was previously approved by the Ministry of Finance to end its work at the end of this month. Now, the Ministry of Finance believes that the financial affairs in the Nanjing and Shanghai area have not been completed, so it has ordered an extension of two months, which will be extended to the end of April this year.

### Foreign Exchange Firms Start Registering on Monday

[News from This Newspaper] Reporters visited various financial authorities yesterday and learned that the Central Bank of this city has officially received instructions on the foreign exchange market opening plan and the interim measures for foreign exchange management, and is now actively preparing various procedures to prepare for the foreign exchange listing to begin as scheduled on March 4 (Monday). As for the firms engaged in foreign exchange business, in addition to some "designated banks" that have yet to be designated and announced, other banks, silver firms, money shops, travel agencies, and brokers that have been approved to operate must go through application procedures. The application forms required are divided into two types: firms and brokers. They are currently being rushed to be printed and will begin accepting applications for registration from next week for a period of 15 days. If approved after review, an operating permit will be issued as proof of business.

According to a Reuters report from New York on the 26th, China's move to stabilize the value of the legal tender may be related to the negotiation of a large loan from the US Export-Import Bank to develop China's export trade. Unofficial rumors here say that the new exchange rate may be 1,000 legal tender to 1 US dollar.

### Importers and Exporters Express

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing on the 27th] The government's announcement of the opening of the foreign exchange market and the abolition of the official exchange rate has aroused close reactions in financial circles here. According to an analysis by a financial authority, this extraordinary measure by the authorities will help to stabilize prices. In the future, the rise and fall of foreign exchange prices will depend on imports and exports. However, international traders feel threatened after the abolition of the official exchange rate, so there may be some impact on foreign trade.

[News from This Newspaper] Importers and exporters in this city are closely watching the foreign exchange listing next Monday. A senior official of Jardine Matheson told reporters yesterday that he firmly believes that their business is expected to gradually return to normal in the future, but he still hopes that the difference between the government's buying and selling prices of foreign exchange will not be too large. He said that even according to the current regulations, exporters already feel quite troubled, because after they have paid a large amount of cash to purchase goods, they must be submitted to the Commodity Inspection Bureau for inspection, which takes a lot of time. After the inspection is completed, they will then telegraph foreign price quotations. They need to wait for a reply before they can use the telegraph to request proof from the bank designated to conduct foreign exchange business, and then declare and export. The interest lost during this period is actually considerable. If a very large discount is given at the time of settlement after receiving foreign exchange, then the profits obtained by exporters will be even smaller. His hope is that this difference does not exceed 10%.

### Inner and Outer Customs Have Connected Exchange; Exchange Rate Temporarily Set at One to Thirteen

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 24th] Exchange between the inner and outer customs has now been opened. The Central Bank here has been ordered by telegram from the Chongqing headquarters to start handling it. Before the official regulations of the Ministry of Finance, the exchange rate is handled according to the standard of one to thirteen, that is, for every one yuan of circulation coupons exchanged by the Northeast Bank, the recipient in various parts of the inner customs can get 13 yuan of legal tender. The Central Bank here will first start handling military and government remittances and family support remittances for civil servants on the 25th. In addition, the three banks in Jinzhou will also open soon to handle remittances for civil servants in various places. Family support remittances that have been proven to be indeed for family support by the competent authorities will be exempt from remittance fees. Commercial remittances will be strictly limited in quantity to avoid the purchase of materials and other improper transactions.

### Second Phase of Emergency Agricultural Loans Fully Allocated to the Agricultural Bank of China

### Youth Army Arrives in Jinzhou, General Du Yuming Receiving Medical Treatment in Beiping

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] It is learned that the 207th Division of the Youth Army landed in Huludao within the week and arrived in Jinzhou. Given the current developments in the situation, it will not be able to proceed to Xinmin in the near future. It is also heard that there are currently over 60,000 National Army troops stationed in the Northeast.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Sources recently received news from the Northeast that although the National Army is stationed in Shenyang, it has not yet obtained full freedom of movement. Based on general observations, it is feared that the city's appearance will be difficult to restore to normal in the short term. The train between Shenyang and Jinzhou has been interrupted due to Communist obstruction.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] There are rumors that General Du Yuming, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Nine Provinces Security Command, will go to the United States for medical treatment. It is heard that his position will be filled by Zheng Dongguo.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] Du Yuming flew from Jinzhou to Beiping for medical treatment on the 18th and is currently staying in Ward 224 of the Central Hospital. Du is suffering from kidney disease. Preliminary examinations by doctors have revealed a bacteria on his kidney. However, whether this is entirely due to the bacteria remains to be determined by X-ray examination. Doctors say that if it is bacteria, surgery will be performed, and he can recover in two or three weeks. It is said that people have two kidneys, and even if one is removed, they can still live.

### Spanish Problem Serious: U.S. Sends Note to Britain Saying Franco Regime Must End; Britain Does Not Approve of France's Actions

[This Newspaper Report] London, 27th Radio: The British government received a note from Washington today stating: The Spanish Franco regime must be ended immediately. The British government is considering this note. Also, the British Trades Union Congress issued a declaration today requesting that Britain and the United States sever diplomatic relations with the Spanish Franco regime.

[United Press, Paris, 27th] Three thousand French people gathered at the VÃ©lodrome d'Hiver today, and in a furious mood, burned the portrait of Spanish dictator Franco and cheered the declaration of the closure of the French-Spanish border. The crowd demanded the complete severance of diplomatic relations with Spain.

[Reuters, London, 27th] The French government decided yesterday to close the border between France and Spain starting next Friday and sent a new note to Britain and the United States, reiterating France's view that the current situation in Spain "endangers international security." At the same time, the British government urgently telegraphed Sir Mallet, the British ambassador to Spain, instructing him to investigate in detail the execution of ten Spanish Republicans in Madrid last week.

[United Press, Paris, 27th] The French government decided today that if the United States and Britain still intend to maintain economic and diplomatic relations with the Spanish Franco government, it is prepared to submit the French opposition to the Franco regime to the United Nations Security Council for discussion. It is expected that French Foreign Minister Bidault will ask Britain and the United States to support France on the diplomatic front and jointly sever all relations with Spain. In addition, according to news from Hendaye: It is rumored that the Spanish authorities closed the French border this morning, 48 hours earlier than the French announcement of the closure. The French cabinet has now decided that all railway, road, postal, and telecommunications traffic between France and Spain will be effectively cut off starting at midnight on March 1st, when the trade agreement signed between the two countries in September of last year expires.

[United Press, London, 27th] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office stated today that he did not approve of the French government's order to close the French-Spanish border. It is said that such incidents may prolong Franco's regime, making the Spanish leader a "national hero" rather than a traitor. However, Britain also hates Franco and hopes that a government supported by the Spanish people will emerge.

[Reuters, Paris, 27th] Radio Paris reported that less than twelve hours after the French cabinet decided to close the French-Spanish border, the West ordered that Spanish troops on the Spanish-French border were not allowed to take leave. However, this information has not been confirmed by Western sources. The French cabinet reiterated its views in a letter to the British and American governments, stating that France believes that the current situation in Spain constitutes a condition that endangers international security.

[United Press, Madrid, 27th] Spanish newspapers today published for the first time detailed news of the French government's decision to close the French-Spanish border and its efforts to persuade Britain and the United States to sever diplomatic relations with Spain, and published lengthy commentaries denouncing the French Communist Party and the Soviet Union.

### First Meeting of the Far Eastern Commission: McCoy Elected Chairman; Secretariat Organized to Prepare for Commission's Work; Britain Appoints Australian as Representative to Control Japan

[United States Information Service, Washington, 26th] The Far Eastern Commission held its first meeting today in the dining room of the former Japanese Embassy. Representatives from eleven countries attended: the United States, China, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, India, New Zealand, and the Philippines. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes delivered the opening remarks (see yesterday's newspaper). Subsequently, U.S. Representative Lieutenant General McCoy was unanimously elected as the permanent chairman of the commission, and former U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson was elected as the secretary-general of the commission. The agenda included credentials, commission membership, election of the chairman and secretary-general, organization of the secretariat, preparation for the commission's work, reports on visits to Japan, and other informal matters.

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The Far Eastern Commission held its first meeting yesterday and passed a proposal by Indian Commissioner Bajpai to establish an organizing guidance committee composed of the British representative Sansom, the Indian representative Bajpai, and the Soviet representative Novikov, so that the trial of Japanese war criminals could proceed as quickly as possible. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes read out at the meeting the draft rules of procedure for the Far Eastern Commission agreed upon at the Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers. Australian Representative Eggleston protested first, believing that a final decision could not be made without soliciting the opinions of all commissioners. New Zealand Representative Berendsen also opposed the veto power of the U.S., China, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Philippine Representative Romulo also protested because he was not involved in Southeast Asia and Vietnam. Chairman McCoy said that the committee could consider any event it chose, but there was a distinction between discussion and action. Yesterday's meeting was held in the dining room of the former Japanese Embassy.

[Reuters, Canberra, 27th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt announced yesterday that Paul, a former lecturer in political economy and Australian representative to the San Francisco Conference, has been appointed as the representative of the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and India to the Four-Power Control Commission for Japan. The fact that this position is held by an Australian proves that Britain and other countries of the Commonwealth are willing to increase Australia's position in the Pacific region, and it also proves the cooperation between the British countries. The Four-Power Commission is responsible for providing advice and consultation when MacArthur implements the instructions formulated by the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission.

### New Era in Sino-British Trade Relations

[Reuters, London, 27th] Minister of Commerce Cripps said yesterday at a dinner of the Central Trade Association that Sino-British commercial relations have begun to enter a new stage. Before the war, our country's exports to China accounted for only 2% of our total exports, and China's imports from our country also accounted for a very small proportion. Since this war, most restrictions have been lifted. During the transition period, although we cannot make long-term loans, we can only exchange exports for imports. However, we believe that once shipping tonnage is restored, we can export to China as much as possible, and Chinese goods can also be shipped to Britain in a steady stream. Chinese Ambassador to Britain Gu Weijun also stated that China will purchase ships, train locomotives, steel, telephones, and electrical materials from Britain.

### American Newspaper Correspondent Reports: Soviet Troops in Iran Show No Intention of Withdrawing

[Reuters, Tehran, 27th] The New York Times correspondent reports: Soviet troops in Iran are only four days away from the deadline for complete withdrawal, but there is still no sign of troop withdrawal. The number of defense troops has not decreased, and the railway is still controlled by the Soviet army. British troops have almost all withdrawn, but Soviet troops are still on high alert around their occupied areas, and no one is allowed to enter the Azerbaijan region without Soviet permission, and Soviet entry permits are extremely difficult to obtain. The Soviet Union's energy has caused widespread fear among the Iranian people.

[United Press, Iranian Capital, 27th] The Soviet Embassy in Iran assured today that Soviet troops in northern Iran will be withdrawn, but the Iranian Foreign Ministry and military observers say that there are no obvious signs of Soviet troop withdrawal.

### Soviet Union Will Make Atomic Bomb, Must Wait for "Next Generation," Says U.S. Atomic Research Director

[United Press, New York, 26th] U.S. Army Atomic Research Director Major General Groves said at a banquet today and later told a United Press reporter: Even if Soviet agents may have obtained some information from Canada, the Soviet Union must wait for the "next generation" to produce an atomic bomb. He said: "If we give the Soviet Union unlimited help, the Soviet Union can have an atomic bomb in five or six years. Otherwise, the Soviet Union will need fifteen or twenty years to manufacture it itself."

[United Press, Ottawa, 26th] The Canadian government formally announced the results of the atomic espionage case for the first time today, saying that "several civil servants and several other persons in positions of trust" had provided classified information to a foreign person. The positions of these civil servants were not specified, but as far as those in charge know, one of them was close to the level of deputy minister.

### Egypt Sends Another Note to Britain Demanding Withdrawal of Troops; Students Decide to Launch "Resistance War"

[Reuters, Cairo, 27th] Several thousand Egyptian students held a meeting yesterday and declared a "resistance war" against British imperialists, boycotting British goods, refusing to use English, and taking an unfriendly attitude towards British troops. There was a heated debate when discussing the issue of resuming classes. After a speech by student leader Morsi, a 25-year-old member of the Muslim Brotherhood, it was agreed that the Egyptian government must issue a declaration stating that it would only consider starting negotiations on amending the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty after all foreign troops have withdrawn from the Nile Valley. It is expected that the second note submitted by the Egyptian government in response to the British government's protest against the riots on Thursday will include a request similar to the students' resolution, asking British troops to withdraw from Cairo and Alexandria to create a better environment for treaty amendment negotiations.

### Follow Peaceful Path, Urgently Seek Indian Independence; Do Not Be Used to Harm Compatriots

Nehru Addresses 250,000 People

[United Press, Bombay, 26th] Former Indian Congress Party leader Nehru came to Bombay today to inspect the damage. In the evening, he spoke to a sad crowd of 100,000 to 250,000 people on the beach, urging millions of Indians to pursue independence through peaceful means. If it is necessary to carry out a revolution, legitimate leaders will be able to send signals. Nehru severely attacked the "counter-revolutionaries" for leading the people of Bombay to carry out bloody riots, but said that if Britain does not leave India, India's diseases cannot be cured, and asked "every Indian in the army, navy, air force, and police force not to obey British orders to shoot or harm Indian compatriots. As for Commander Auchinleck's broadcast on Monday evening, announcing the official policy and deciding to punish the mutinying sailors who instigated the bloody riots, Nehru said that he could agree as long as the army, navy, and air force were free, "but we are asking for independence, not participating in politics. I cannot agree with Auchinleck's statement that Indian troops should obey the orders of their superiors and shoot unarmed Indian compatriots. Regarding the clash between Indian sailors and British troops at the Castle Barracks, Nehru said that they were just innocent children who had long been subjected to racial discrimination and inhuman treatment, so they could be forgiven." Nehru's speech was conversational and lasted approximately 90 minutes.

### Nazi Atrocities on the Silver Screen: War Criminals Change Color Upon Seeing Them; Ribbentrop's Request to Summon Witness Denied by Tribunal

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 27th dispatch] The International War Crimes Tribunal today ruled against the defendant Ribbentrop's request to summon Churchill to testify. The tribunal also rejected Ribbentrop's request to write to Churchill to inquire about a certain event he had discussed with Churchill at the German Embassy in London when he was the German ambassador to Britain. Of the 38 witnesses Ribbentrop requested to summon, 22, including former French Prime Minister Daladier and former Foreign Minister Bonnet, were all rejected. Only seven former German foreign ministry officials, including Ribbentrop's private secretary Blank, were allowed by the tribunal to testify. Seven of the witnesses requested by Goering were approved, and he was also allowed to submit written questions to eight people, including Lord Halifax. Hess's witness was Bohle, the former head of the Nazi Party's overseas department.

[United Press, Nuremberg, 26th dispatch] Nazi terrorist atrocities have been accumulating overwhelming evidence in the International War Crimes Tribunal, but the pictures and films of killings screened today made all previous evidence seem insignificant. The Nazi defendants, who had always been indifferent to various testimonies of killings, suddenly changed color and showed sorrow upon seeing these pictures. The scenes depicted in the photos were like the acts of madmen. One photo showed German soldiers wielding axes to chop off the head of a Yugoslav, while fellow soldiers surrounded and laughed. Another photo showed stormtroopers swaying the already hanged corpses for amusement. Another photo showed vicious dogs and hungry pigs feasting on the corpses of those killed. Yet another photo showed the body of a Bosnian female teacher, Stanic, who was executed for joining Tito's Yugoslav army. Several stormtroopers were staring at her beside her. A scene first showed several Germans leading two sheepdogs, and then showed the two dogs biting a Yugoslav and tearing him to pieces, which was too horrible to watch. Later, a picture of the collective hanging of more than ten people was shown, with the executioners standing aside with arrogant smiles. Finally, two Tito soldiers were beheaded with an axe, and the stormtroopers watched and laughed. Then the head was placed on a table with a cigarette inserted in its mouth. Finally, the head was discarded on the ground, just like a child's toy that was discarded when tired of it.

### Notes from the United Nations General Assembly: Two Equally Matched Figures: Bevin and Vyshinsky. Connally and Manuilsky are also an Old Pair.

â Special Correspondent Yu Feng from London

When the United Nations General Assembly first opened, many people shook their heads and sighed. They were not predicting the inevitable failure of the United Nations General Assembly, but lamenting the lack of outstanding figures at the meeting. In particular, journalists felt that there were very few figures with news value, and therefore missed the "Tiger Prime Minister" Clemenceau, Lloyd George, and Wilson of the post-World War I era.

After the Security Council held two meetings, everyone's perception began to change, believing that the General Assembly was making history and also creating figures. By the time the General Assembly ended, everyone was even more satisfied, because this meeting not only had colorful and outstanding figures, but was also a truly epoch-making record in the history of diplomacy. In this meeting, the so-called "diplomatic rhetoric" of the past was eliminated. All speeches and debates were straightforward and decisive, unlike the previous pretenses and circumlocutions.

Straightforward and Tit-for-Tat

British Foreign Secretary Bevin's style is completely different from Eden's. He does not pay attention to clothing and does not let any formal attire bind himself. He came from a dockworker background and has the style of a chivalrous hero. He speaks his mind frankly. He is equally matched with the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky.

Vyshinsky does not give way in debates. He can speak English, but he always uses his native language in the venue. His words are translated, and perhaps they have lost the original essence, but even in the translation, you can hear his wit and intelligence.

Among the cases received by the Security Council, the first was Iran's accusation against the Soviet Union, and Britain supported Iran. The day after Iran filed the accusation, the Soviet Union raised the issue of British troops in Greece, and Ukraine raised the issue of British troops in Java "threatening world peace." Finally, Syria and Lebanon filed complaints about the presence of British and French troops in their countries "endangering peace." When this article was written, the Syrian-Lebanese incident was still under discussion and had not yet been resolved, but the other three cases had all been discussed and concluded. In these three cases, Britain and the Soviet Union were opposing protagonists, debating and attacking each other. Therefore, attending the Security Council meeting was like watching Bevin and Vyshinsky fight.

London's Fog is a Double Entendre

The prelude to the duel between the two began when discussing the date of the Military Staff Committee meeting. At that time, the United States' Stettinius proposed to hold the meeting on February 1, but Vyshinsky said it was not so certain, and the Soviet military representative might not be able to arrive on the 1st, "because," he said with a double entendre, "the weather between London and Moscow is bad!" Bevin did not give way and said with a smile, "I hope the Soviet representative can eliminate these fogs before February 1." Vyshinsky immediately poked the translator and told him to translate: "But the fog in London is always much thicker than elsewhere!"

Since then, the two have often exchanged humorous and tit-for-tat dialogues. The two of them are close neighbors at the horseshoe-shaped table of the Security Council. Sometimes they argue fiercely and then shake hands and make peace. One London newspaper drew a cartoon of Bevin and Vyshinsky fighting in the Middle Ages, shirtless and wielding swords.

Mouth Close to Ear, Not a Single Word Missed

Vyshinsky's personal interpreter sits behind him, with his mouth close to his ear. Bevin says a sentence, and he translates it in his ear, so Vyshinsky knows everything Bevin says without missing a single word and can answer on the spot.

When discussing the Greek and Javanese incidents, Vyshinsky cited various criticisms from the opposition during the British House of Commons debates on the Greek and Javanese incidents. Some of those parliamentarians also said that Britain was interfering in other people's internal affairs. He also cited communications from British newspapers, and the foreign correspondents also criticized the British government, believing that the British army was not supporting the revolutionary government. Bevin smoked while speaking and then answered with a cigarette slanting in his mouth: "We in the British Parliament can speak freely, and there are positive and negative opinions on one thing. I am really surprised that Mr. Vyshinsky is so familiar with one side of the opinion but so unfamiliar with the other side. Tomorrow I can send you a copy of the parliamentary record and ask you to study the other side of the opinion."

Jokes about the Press

"As for newspapers, they are just for entertainment (To Amuse to Entertain.) Sometimes they inevitably mislead readers (To Mislead.) I read the newspaper every day, so I don't take what the newspaper says so seriously." This caused the reporters present to laugh.

When the Security Council met the next day, Vyshinsky said: "Mr. Bevin actually thinks that newspapers are just for entertainment, which is really disrespectful to the press. The transmission of news depends entirely on newspapers. We don't have troops abroad, so what do we rely on for intelligence if we don't rely on newspapers?" Then, he cited a passage from the British Daily Herald and said with a smile, "Mr. Bevin should have some respect for this newspaper!" The whole audience burst into laughter because the Daily Herald is the organ of the Labour Party.

Bevin did not answer this directly but took a puff of smoke and said with a smile: "I'm too lazy to joke with the newspapers anymore."

Dueling, Pounding the Table

When the two argued tensely, they also pounded their fists on the table, and the whole venue was silent. Vyshinsky also likes to use gestures when speaking, holding a pencil, and I often worry that he will point it at Bevin's face next door. When Bevin mentioned Vyshinsky in his speech, he always stared at Vyshinsky, and sometimes he had a cigarette in his mouth when speaking.

Bevin's cheek muscles often twitch, and they twitch even more intensely when he is nervous. When Vyshinsky speaks passionately, he doesn't have a trace of a smile. For a moment, it will be cloudy, and it seems that a big storm is coming. But even in this dark situation, they never forget to bring a point or two of starlight. Sometimes in a tense situation, Bevin would suddenly say: "My friend Vyshinsky is a lawyer and is of course very familiar with the articles." Or just as they were preparing to fight, Vyshinsky would smile and call Bevin a Hot Headed Man.

Bevin's Wife Attends

Because of their wonderful performances in the Security Council, everyone wanted to attend the Security Council, and the small room was so crowded that it was impossible to ventilate. Smoking is not prohibited during the Council meetings, and it is smoky, hot, and stuffy. At one meeting, because they had to shoot a movie, the lights were bright, and the fat Bevin was sweating profusely.

Bevin and Vyshinsky argued the fiercest when discussing the Greek issue, but after the meeting, Bevin went to attend Vyshinsky's cocktail party, and the two talked more congenially than anyone else and laughed more happily than anyone else.

When Bevin was engaged in a war of words, his wife also attended, and many representatives' wives wanted to attend, as if they had been infected by their husbands and were particularly interested in politics.

Vyshinsky's wife did not come, but his daughter came with him. At his reception, his daughter was the hostess. Vyshinsky is originally from Poland, alert and eloquent, and is now Molotov's number one confidant.

Bevin's prestige increased greatly during the Security Council meetings because of his courageous and straightforward speech. In the United States, everyone was discussing Bevin. Going to listen to the Council seemed to be just to listen to Bevin and Vyshinsky arguing.

Another Partner Roars in the Middle of the Night

In the General Assembly, there are more than just Bevin and Vyshinsky who are good at partnering. There is another old pairâManuilsky of Ukraine and Senator Connally of the United States. Both are old with silver hair, but their tempers are extremely high. Connally's voice is loud, and when he is angry, he is even more hoarse. When the subcommittee discussed the issue of the International Trade Union Federation wanting to participate in the United Nations General Assembly, Connally said: "Now we have to discuss this matter. Why did we reject the participation of our American trade union without saying a word? It's really shaving our beards!" The chairman was Spaak, the eloquent Belgian foreign minister. Spaak said: "I really don't understand why you want to insert this sentence!" Connally roared: "Do you think I don't know? Humph! There is a group of people manipulating this little association!" At that time, it was 1 a.m., and everyone thought of this matter and thought it was a midnight roar.

Roaring Off the Stage and Shaking Hands

At the end of the General Assembly, this matter was discussed again. First, Manuilsky spoke in fluent French, believing that the International Trade Union Federation should participate in the General Assembly. As soon as the speech ended, Connally immediately took the stage, shouting loudly, "Mr. Manuilsky" to the left and "Dr. Manuilsky" to the right, which made Manuilsky laugh. Old Mr. Connally spoke more and more vigorously, pounding the table and clapping his hands, almost breaking the table. After roaring off the stage, he shook hands with Manuilsky, which made the whole audience laugh. His wife was also present. It can be said that it was the most wonderful finale of the United Nations General Assembly and the last battle in this peace conference. (Sent from London on February 15)

### Reader's Opinion: After Reading "How to Raise Funds for Industrial Construction"

â Zhang Yushan

Since the end of the war, countries have been working hard on reconstruction. China, as an industrially backward country, feels particularly concerned about this reconstruction. We deeply hope that China can quickly embark on the path of industrialization in terms of economic construction. Industrial construction in a country must have all the necessary basic conditions, but fundraising is of paramount importance. Recently, Mr. Zhao Tongyun's article "How to Raise Funds for Industrial Construction" (see this newspaper on the 17th of this month) suggested the establishment of a China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation, because the machinery, materials, and manpower required for China's industrial construction are huge, and the long-term funds required are not something that ordinary banking organizations can provide. At the same time, China's exchange rate is not easy to determine for a while, and it is not easy for manufacturers to purchase the foreign exchange needed to order equipment from abroad. Therefore, it is planned to establish a China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation, with state-owned banks and major commercial banks, trust companies, insurance companies, etc., jointly investing US$500 million and 5 billion national currency, as the central financial institution to support industrial reconstruction. This proposed company is not a creative suggestion, because industrial advanced countries such as Britain and the United States have this type of organization. All industrial construction in China is still in its infancy, so there is a more urgent need for a central financial institution to support industrial reconstruction. It can realize at least the following benefits:

(1) Solve the funds needed for industrial construction: China is short of funds, and the fundraising of long-term funds and medium-term funds required for industrial construction is the most difficult. If there is a central financial institution to coordinate the supply and make reasonable and effective use, then this difficulty can be solved.

(2) Absorb foreign investment for beneficial production: The amount of foreign investment in China is very large, but most of it is used for non-productive purposes, so it not only does not benefit China's economic development, but makes China in a more unfavorable position in terms of politics and economy. The establishment of the China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation can, on the one hand, guide foreign investment absolutely for investment in productive construction projects; at the same time, it can use the power of the government to strengthen the company's credit abroad, and the amount and scope of utilizing foreign investment will be broader.

(3) Qualitative change in imported goods: Since the Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation acts as an agent for manufacturers to order materials needed for industrial construction from foreign countries, the machinery and raw materials imported by our country will greatly increase. This qualitative change in imported goods will mark a new era in the history of our country's international trade, and there is no doubt that it will be beneficial to the prosperity of the national economy.

(4) Strengthen the power to stabilize foreign exchange: The amount of gold, foreign currency bonds, and foreign exchange held by the people in our country is huge. In terms of individuals, this holding of wealth only has the effect of maintaining purchasing power; in terms of the entire country, this huge amount of gold has not had a favorable effect on national production. Now that there is a central financial institution for industrial reconstruction, the gold, foreign currency bonds, and foreign exchange held by the people can all be used reasonably and effectively.

We confirm that the suggestion to establish the China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation has an inevitable value in the process of completing the great economic construction of industrialization. However, China has a vast territory, and the types and scope of various industrial constructions are very broad. Whether the use of US$500 million and 5 billion national currency can complete this great cause for all ages, the amount of capital really needs to be reconsidered.

After eight years of war, the people's livelihood has withered. Since the victory, all production undertakings have returned to a standstill. We deeply feel that the disposal of enemy and puppet property must not be aimed solely at fiscal revenue, but should be based on maintaining and increasing production. "Killing the chicken to get the eggs" is not something that wise people should do. We deeply hope that the financial authorities will take a long-term view, start from the near future, seize the opportunity, and first concentrate all their efforts to break the chains of the vicious circle. Perhaps the establishment of the China Reconstruction Industrial Finance Corporation can promote industrial construction and achieve the practical effect of increasing production.

### Commentary: Measures That Should Be Taken to Suppress Special Prices

â Xu Erxin

Since the victory of peace, prices in various places have continued to rise, especially after the market opened near the recent Lunar New Year, the momentum has become even more intense, like a raging fire. Those who hold gold, foreign currencies, stocks, and various goods have all obtained huge profits. Those with idle funds are rushing to withdraw cash from banks to buy gold, banknotes, and materials, vying with each other, and the black market interest rate has soared to more than two, people are panicked, and society is showing extreme anxiety. Common people are groaning and haggard, and their lives are extremely painful. Chairman Chiang heard the news in Hangzhou and specially came to Shanghai to summon important figures in the financial and industrial sectors to instruct on countermeasures to suppress prices, which shows that although the Chairman is busy with myriad affairs every day, he is always concerned about the people's suffering. At this time of high prices, insightful people in Shanghai have suggested that the government's existing gold reserves should be sold off as much as possible by suspending listings with official prices to suppress gold prices and stabilize commodity prices. Others have advocated that gold should be nationalized so that gold cannot be used for evil and lose its role in leading commodity prices. In fact, rising prices have both natural and man-made causes, involving politics, finance, currency, finance, production, consumption, transportation, and hoarding and manipulation. A rise in gold prices may indeed stimulate a rise in commodity prices, but it cannot be said that gold prices necessarily lead general commodity prices. At present, the market is flooded with idle funds with no suitable destination, and the amount of goods is huge. Selling off the government's existing gold is like a drop in the bucket and is difficult to sustain. If the gold runs out and the strategy fails, the price of gold will skyrocket, and the phenomenon that occurred when Chongqing stopped listing prices will not be difficult to repeat. Although there are no precise statistics on the gold owned by the people in various places, the estimated amount must be very large. If the government nationalizes it, even if part of the price is matched with the official price and part is given in cash, the issuance of this huge amount of banknotes will inevitably increase the rate of price increases, and the US dollar can also replace gold and play a role in leading commodity prices. The theory of nationalizing gold is not feasible at present and can only be regarded as a way to stabilize finance, and it should not be used as a good countermeasure to solve the extremely complex price problem at present. The author believes that the current price increases are due to three main reasons: the expansion of the amount of currency in circulation, the lack of materials, and the lack of confidence in legal tender among the people.

Therefore, to suppress prices, the government and all the people must work together on the three aspects that cause price increases to implement both short-term and long-term measures. Otherwise, only partial handling, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, or the government blaming the common people, or the people criticizing the government, the result will be "propping up the east while the west collapses" or even no effect at all. The author has held this view very early, and now I will reiterate these implementation countermeasures separately below:

(A) Regarding the "currency" aspect: (1) Contracting the currency in circulation. At present, the Central Bank cannot adopt the policy of raising discount rates and open market operations to contract the currency in circulation, but since the Central Bank is in the position of "the bank of banks" and the issuance of banknotes has already shown a tendency to concentrate, it must be cautious about lending to other banks in the future, and there should also be considerable restrictions on advances and loans to the government to ensure that more is received and less is given out. The allocation of funds to the silver and money industry should also be strictly supervised, and all loan extensions such as credit mortgages of various banks and villages should be investigated at any time to prevent them from being used for speculation. (2) Consolidate various tax revenues to make them abundant, especially direct taxes, which must be seriously consolidated to transfer the purchasing power of the people. Absolutely prohibit the tax package system, strictly eliminate corruption, and ensure that every drop goes to the public. (3) Cut redundant agencies and adjust institutions at all levels to make them reasonable. Reduce redundant personnel and focus on administrative efficiency. Temporarily adopt a policy of "recuperating with the people," stop all non-urgent matters, and strive to achieve a balance of payments. (4) Issue new public bonds or temporary treasury bills and force wealthy households to underwrite them. (5) Conduct wealth registration. All tangible and intangible wealth must be registered uniformly, and the household name should be limited to the name on the national identity card issued in accordance with the Household Registration Law and should not have a pseudonym. This wealth registration can be of great help in consolidating direct taxes and can be used as the basis for apportioning public bonds, which is in line with the principle of ability to pay taxes. (6) Take over enemy and puppet factories in various places and sell stocks based on their assets. Quickly establish a legitimate securities trading market to guide idle funds to industrial and commercial enterprises and bring them into line. (7) Promote savings or force national savings, or hold prize-winning savings. (8) Increase the interest rate on savings deposits, restrict credit demand deposits, and investigate their whereabouts at any time to prevent idle funds from doing evil. (9) Reduce the size of the army and adopt the principle of elite troops. All officers and soldiers who are laid off should engage in reclamation and industry and agriculture to increase production. (10) For enterprises that have a monopoly and cannot be run by private individuals, they should be either state-owned or jointly run by officials and merchants, so that the income can be used to subsidize the shortage of the national treasury or absorb part of the idle funds of private individuals.

(B) Regarding the "material" aspect: (1) Restore water and land transportation, and the mountain Japanese captives will implement road construction and river dredging projects to increase the number of cargo ships and vehicles to facilitate the transportation of goods. (2) Public and private factories must all start work within a limited time. The original enemy and puppet factories must continue to be responsible by Japanese technicians who are about to reach the date. (3) Encourage private investment in various enterprises and guarantee principal and interest. (4) Labor and management should adopt the principle of coordination, and political strikes and work slowdowns are strictly prohibited. (5) Borrow money from foreign countries and provide a sufficient amount of foreign exchange to various gold industries to purchase the necessary raw materials and machinery to expand production. (6) Sell the materials in the warehouses sealed by the enemy and puppets at a flat price and prevent good merchants from monopolizing profits. (7) Fully transport coal to supply cheap electricity. (8) Strictly prohibit similar taxes in various places and implement the crackdown on all exorbitant taxes.

(C) Regarding the "people" aspect: (1) Stabilize people's hearts, arouse the people's confidence in legal tender, and break their concept of valuing things over currency. All the people of the country must work together with the spirit of "fathers teaching their sons and brothers encouraging their younger brothers" so that the credit of legal tender will be enhanced and the value will be increased. (The issuance of banknotes can make commodity prices rise, but the accelerated circulation of currency will easily promote commodity price increases. At present, people are throwing out legal tender to buy goods, and the circulation of legal tender is very fast. Even if the currency is contracted and the output of materials is increased, if it is implemented effectively, the general public will still have the concept of despising legal tender, and the value of goods will still have to rise. Therefore, enhancing confidence in legal tender is a necessary condition for increasing the value of legal tender.) (2) Crack down on speculation, such as strictly prohibiting illegal black market transactions, inspecting warehouse materials, registering, investigating the whereabouts of bills, investigating the source of relevant financial rumors, and punishing speculative and manipulative merchants, but these passive measures can only have a temporary effect. (3) Domestic peace and unity, and improve politics, so that the people have support and respect for the government, and thus welcome and love legal tender and believe in legal tender. (4) Before the government authorities can clearly declare the financial policy (such as the determination of the exchange rate), they should be cautious in their remarks, and it is even more inappropriate to have inconsistent remarks before and after, or to deny them after the fact, so that speculators can speculate on their intentions and take the opportunity to create rumors, take advantage of opportunities, and speculate for profit. (5) Promote thrift and practice hard work and endurance to avoid waste of materials.

The above-mentioned implementation countermeasures are not very high-level, but if the government and the people of the whole country rise up and implement them separately, the problem of rising prices will not be difficult to solve. If commodity prices can gradually fall, the value of the currency will be stabilized, and people's livelihood will be stabilized. It is unnecessary for ordinary people to worry about issuing so-called "Sun Yat-sen banknotes." I hope that the people of the country will unanimously support the National Government, cherish and believe in the legal tender issued by the National Government, so that its value will be permanently stable, commodity prices will not fluctuate, and we can share a life of happiness and well-being. Those who do not hesitate to destroy the value of legal tender, shake the belief in legal tender, and hope to obtain huge profits due to rising prices should be regarded as public enemies of the nation.

### Industry and Commerce Sectors Send Telegram to the Second Plenary Session â Opposing Specialization in Northeast China; Emergency Measures Should Be Taken to Deal with the Economic Crisis; Efforts Should Be Made to Save the Price Rampage; Presenting Three Points of Opinion

Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held a welcome reception for Wu Kaixian, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, at the Dadong Restaurant, and discussed important current economic and diplomatic issues. Representatives from various industry associations, including Luo Qinghua, Jin Lanku, Li Shuxiong, and Xu Xiaochu, and more than 300 others attended. Luo Qinghua, Chairman, delivered a speech first. After Director Wu Kaixian reported on the latest industrial and commercial administrative facilities, it was unanimously passed that the association and the 89 industry associations present would jointly send a telegram to the Second Plenary Session (1) firmly opposing specialization in Northeast China, requesting that decisive and effective emergency measures be taken, (2) suppressing prices and preventing the economic crisis. The original text of the telegram reads: To the Honorable Members of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee in Chongqing: In recent days, the price rampage has fluctuated across the country, and people are panicked, reaching an extreme point. Strikes and work slowdowns are happening everywhere, and they are mutually causal with price fluctuations. The economic crisis affects social order. The associations and others are shocked by this situation and feel a sense of crisis. Now, we respectfully offer three points of humble opinion, sincerely requesting that the honorable meeting take decisive and effective emergency measures. 1. All enemy and puppet materials have been taken over for half a year. In Shanghai alone, there are more than 2,000 sealed warehouses. To date, there are no measures to deal with them. The reason for this is that those at the top deliberately wait for the price to be high to make an unreasonable contribution to the national treasury, while those at the bottom try to delay the matter in order to manipulate things and maintain their own positions. As a result, materials become moldy and rot, are stolen, and various malpractices occur. All these phenomena fully expose the incompetence of the receiving personnel and the dereliction of duty of the management personnel. It should be strictly ordered that all of them be investigated and dealt with before the end of March, either returned to the original owners or sold publicly at a flat price to suppress commodity prices. 2. The enemy and puppet factories that have been taken over should be strictly ordered to immediately investigate the actual situation. If any of them were indeed forcibly occupied by the enemy and puppets, they should be returned to the original owners to take over. If they are indeed enemy and puppet properties, they should be given priority for lease or sale to the industrial circles in the front and rear who have suffered losses due to the War of Resistance. A deadline should be set for them to start work and increase production. The Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau should be ordered to complete the conclusion before the end of March. 3. Oppose disguised state-owned companies competing with the people for profits, monopolizing and manipulating, tracking down the black market, stimulating prices, and causing the main factors of today's price surge and social unrest. They should be strictly corrected to calm the people. And with a quick knife to cut through the messy hemp, the enemy and puppet yarn and cloth they have taken over should be sold in large quantities and publicly at a flat price as stated in the first point. The factories they have taken over should be returned to the original owners within a time limit as stated in the second point, or leased and sold to the industrial circles to start work. As for this type of disguised state-owned company itself, it should be closed immediately to save public funds. The above points are earnestly requested to be quickly adopted and implemented urgently. The future of the country is deeply relied upon. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry, Paper Industry, Woolen Industry, Xinle Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, and other 89 industry associations, all kowtow, feeling.

### Sending Experts to Taiwan to Produce Excellent Silkworm Eggs

"This newspaper news" Ge Jingzhong, general manager of the China Silk Company, flew to Taiwan to negotiate matters related to mulberry seedlings and silkworm eggs. He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties. The reporter specially visited him to inquire about his trip to Taiwan. Mr. Ge said that the climate in Taiwan is mild and it is an ideal area for raising silkworms. The company has agreed with the Taiwan Governor-General's Office to send four or five breeding technicians to cooperate in breeding about 20,000 sheets, which will be used for the needs of breeding grounds in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and will arrive in mid-April. In addition, it is also planned to cooperate in promoting the silkworm and mulberry industry. He also said that in order to remedy the losses in the silkworm areas during the war, he had repeatedly contacted the Allied authorities in Tokyo. Eighty thousand mulberry seedlings have now been shipped from Japan, and one million more are being shipped. In addition, 300,000 sheets of silkworm eggs will arrive within March. At that time, the company will jointly coordinate and distribute them with the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments.

### Narcotics Found on a Puppet Official; Desperate, He Jumped Off the Building and Died

Xu Shichang's Body Was Examined Yesterday

[This newspaper news] Lawyer Xu Shichang, a native of Zhejiang, willingly collaborated with the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War and participated in puppet organizations, serving successively as the president of the Chongming District Court, the chief prosecutor of the Taicang District Court Prosecutor's Office, and the prosecutor of the Wuxing District Court Prosecutor's Office and other puppet positions. After the victory, he fled to Shanghai and hid at No. 242 Aimee Yu Xian Road. Because someone reported him to the Wuxing judicial authorities, Chen Wenxin, the prosecutor of the Wuxing County District Court, who also served as a prosecutor of the High Court, prepared a document and sent Xu Chushu and Qian Jiang of the police bureau to Shanghai to request the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office to send personnel to assist in arresting Xu at his residence on Aimee Yu Xian Road on the afternoon of the 26th. He was imprisoned on the fourth floor of the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office detention center on Masnan Road and listed as prisoner No. 982. It is now known that the prisoner had a habit. When the institute sent personnel to inspect the prison cell as usual the other day, they found a bag of opium paste in Xu's pocket. Xu was panicked and took the opportunity to jump from the fourth floor, causing his skull to break and blood to flow all over the ground. Although the institute gave him emergency treatment, he died at five o'clock. Yesterday, the District Court Prosecutor's Office sent a prosecutor to examine the body, and his son collected it for burial.

### Narrowly Met; Traitor Arrested

Gu Guoxiong Tried Again Yesterday

[This newspaper news] Gu Guoxiong, a secret agent of the enemy's Shanghai South Gendarmerie in Penglai Road, had previously colluded with the enemy gendarmerie to arrest Yang Jiaji, director of the Pudong branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League, but failed, and then took his sister Yang Waner back to the enemy gendarmerie on Bei Dang Road, where she was severely tortured and detained for seven days before being released. After the victory, Yang Waner suddenly ran into him while shopping at the Daxin Company, so she reported him to the police and arrested him. The High Court Prosecutor's Office concluded the investigation and filed a public prosecution. The case has been tried once, and the defendant firmly denied that he had been a secret agent, only claiming to be a handyman. Yesterday morning, Judge Cao Jun opened the court again to question him and summoned Yang Jiaji and Yang Waner to court to falsely describe what happened. The defendant still tried to quibble and deny. The court ordered that the case be investigated further and adjourned for another hearing.

### Four Japanese War Criminals Tried for the First Time

They Killed Three American Airmen

[This newspaper news] Another war criminal trial committee organized by Lieutenant Colonel Macklennan (presiding judge), Colonel Cabot, and six others yesterday morning for the first time tried the Japanese war criminals who killed three members of the Doolittle Raiders at Tilanqiao Prison: Lieutenant General Sawada Shigeru, former commander of the 13th Division; Captain Tachita Sotciro, former commander of the Jiangwan prisoner-of-war camp; Captain Wakou Yujisei, a member of the Japanese military court; and Lieutenant Okada Ryuhei. Plaintiff Lieutenant Colonel Han Derlun stood up and read Sawada Shigeru's seven charges, accusing him of establishing a military court between August and October 1942, violating the rules for prisoners of war, and sentencing Lieutenant Homerak, Lieutenant Faro, Sergeant Spatz, and Lieutenant Meter (this person did not die) to death in Shanghai, and sentencing Lieutenant Haet, Lieutenant Barr, Lieutenant Nelson, and Sergeant Thiercher to life imprisonment, and adding torture. He then accused Tachita of executing Homerak, Faro, and Spatz on October 15, 1942, and torturing the other four American airmen. He also accused Wakou and Okada of the same crime, sentencing the three American airmen to death without following formal trial procedures. Defense attorney Lieutenant Colonel Boting raised objections to the number of jurors in court, and then requested that the court be cancelled. The court ordered that the points raised by the defendant's defense attorney be strictly rejected. Defense attorney Captain Feros then requested that the charges against the four defendants be dropped, but the court rejected them one by one. After both sides debated until 12:30, the court immediately summoned each prisoner to stand before the court and asked whether they had committed any crimes. All four prisoners replied "Not guilty." At this point, the court announced that the trial would begin at 9:00 a.m. on March 11.

In addition, the case of the eighteen Japanese war criminals killing Chinese and American airmen is scheduled to be pronounced at 9:00 a.m. this morning.

### The Issue of British Ships Sailing in Inland Rivers Under the British Flag; Shipping Organizations Question the Administration for Relief and Rehabilitation

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shipping Association, the Merchant Ship Drivers Association, the Marine Engineers Union, the Nautical Drivers Union, the Seamen's Union, the Pilots Association, and the Shipping Association yesterday jointly sent a telegram by express mail to the Administration for Relief and Rehabilitation, asking the administration six questions about the issue of renting British merchant ships flying the British flag and sailing in our country's territorial waters, requesting a detailed reply. It is also learned that regarding the transportation of relief materials, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Shipping Association, the Logistics Department Waterway Military Transportation Command, and other agencies have agreed to use various ships for military transportation, public transportation, and civilian transportation. In addition to urgent military and public transportation, they will transport relief materials as much as possible from Beijing and Shanghai to Hankou and other places, and concentrate all the existing more than 100 motorized sailboats to assist in this transportation to ensure that the transportation of relief materials is not delayed.

### The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Begins to Sell American Wheat

The Tentative Price Is 8,000 Yuan per Market Dan

After the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration of the Executive Yuan began to sell flour without restriction on the 21st at 6,000 yuan per bag, the black market price of flour and rice gradually fell. The administration has also announced that it will sell American wheat from the 28th. All flour mills in this port and other ports with complete equipment that can start grinding flour after purchasing American wheat may formally apply to the administration with a letter based on the following terms and conditions, and it will be reviewed and allocated: (1) Price: The American wheat sold by the administration is calculated in market dan, and the tentative price is 8,000 yuan per market dan. (2) Payment: After the factory receives the administration's notification of the approved quantity, it must pay the full amount of the goods in cash and then pick up the goods, but those who purchase a whole ship of American wheat may apply for installment payment. (3) Delivery: After the transport ship carrying American wheat arrives in Shanghai, the administration will notify the factory to deliver the goods in the ship's hold. All expenses such as weighing, lighterage, and overdue ship rent shall be borne by the factory. (However, those who purchase a small amount of American wheat may apply to pick up the goods in the administration's warehouse, and in addition to the wheat, they must pay the aforementioned expenses.) (4) Hemp bags: The factory must provide its own.

(Another report) It is said that Wu Kaixian, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, has asked the two relief administrations to reduce the price of flat-price flour by another 1,000 yuan to further lower the market price, and suggested that the purchase quantity per household should be reduced to two bags. Those who purchase more than two bags for firms and factories must have a certificate from the respective agencies to show restrictions and prevent malpractices.

### A Batch of Relief Materials to Be Transported from Shanghai to Hunan Province

The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration of the Executive Yuan has nearly 400 tons of relief materials, including old clothes, food, and medical supplies, which were transported to Changsha and Yueyang on February 21 by one SLM landing ship and three LC No. 1 landing craft.

### The British Donate a Huge Sum to Support the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration

Ms. Tingde Hosted the Press Yesterday

[This newspaper news] The British Information Office in this city yesterday, because Ms. Hende, a British labor expert who had served in the Shanghai Municipal Council for more than ten years, revisited Shanghai after touring Chongqing, Myanmar, Hong Kong, and other places to investigate labor and social welfare conditions, specially invited Chinese and foreign reporters to the British Consulate on the Bund. Mr. Luo, the director of the office, and La Jiasuliya, the editor-in-chief, and others hosted the event.

Insufficient Distribution and Supply of Materials

After Mr. Luo introduced Ms. Hende to the reporters, Ms. Hende delivered a speech, roughly saying that the United Kingdom sincerely supports the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the United Kingdom's donation of 110 million US dollars out of the 675 million yuan allocated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to China accounts for about one-sixth of the total amount. The predecessor of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was actually the "Allied Post-War Needs Committee" established in London in October 1941, and the chairman of the committee was Sir Li Ziluosi, who is very familiar to the Chinese. However, the United Kingdom does not want to donate to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration with one hand and then ask the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for assistance with the other to supply Malaysia, Myanmar, and other places. Therefore, the United Kingdom has to find other ways for relief and bear the responsibility of double donations. At present, the distribution of materials in these countries is strictly controlled, but insufficient supply has become the main difficulty.

Widespread High Prices

Ms. Hende then answered questions from reporters, roughly saying (1) Wage standards cannot keep up with commodity prices, which has become a common situation in various countries. Regarding the labor-management disputes in this port, because the situation is not very clear, it remains to be studied. (2) About 100 to 300 tons of relief supplies are transported to Guangdong by railway every day, but now another 500 trucks have been prepared to assist in transportation. (3) There have been strikes in Singapore, and there are many labor-management disputes in Hong Kong, especially the dock workers' strike that lasted for two months, but there was no strike. Ms. Hende is quite concerned about the situation of the Shanghai press and promised to pay attention to the shortage of paper. She said that the largest British newspaper, The Times of London, currently only publishes two large sheets.

### Three Fierce Blows to the Head; Xiao Niu Zi's Life is Over; A Tragic Case Occurs Due to a Dispute Over Dock Work

At around 8:00 a.m. on the 27th, at Zhu Hongwen's home at No. 12 Fukang Road, Yangjiadu, Pudong, a mob of 30 to 40 people, each holding axes, pistols, iron bars, etc., suddenly stormed in. Because they could not find Zhu Hongwen, they grabbed Pan Xiaoniuzi and Xiao Heizi (namely Zhang Gunchun), and used axes to strike Pan's head three times in the back of the house, immediately causing him to fall to the ground and die. Xiao Heizi and Zhu Zhangshi were also injured in the head. The mob fired several shots into the sky and dispersed. The Yangjiadu Police Station rushed to the scene and arrested more than ten suspects, including Chen Guisan and Yang Jinlin, and took them to the bureau for interrogation. It was found that the main culprits in this case were Chen Xiaogou, Wu Changfa, and Liu Fugen, and personnel were dispatched to continue to arrest them. It is said that this case was caused by a dispute over the reinstatement of dock porters. There had been two conflicts on the 9th and 10th of this month, and mediation had failed to reach a settlement, which led to another incident.

### Foreign Currency Imports and Exports Are Prohibited by Customs

Regarding the import and export of foreign currency, the Jianghai Customs issued a notice yesterday, which roughly stated that the import and export of foreign currency banknotes is prohibited without a permit. Foreign passengers are allowed to carry up to 200 US dollars or items of the same value upon import. Amounts exceeding the limit are not allowed to be carried.

### Candidates for Public Office Who Pass the Examination Are Eligible to Participate in the Senate Election; The Civil Affairs Office of the Municipal Government Promotes the Examination Work

The Municipal Government has recently received orders from the Executive Yuan of the Examination Institute to actively prepare for the examination of candidates for public office. After receiving the order, Mayor Qian issued it to the Civil Affairs Office for planning and implementation. It is now learned that this examination business has begun to be held on February 20. Because this city is about to hold elections for representatives of people's organizations at all levels, any city citizen who wants to participate in the election must first apply for the examination of candidates for public office. Only those who pass the examination and obtain the qualifications of candidates can be elected. Candidates for public office are divided into two types, A and B. Candidates for public office of type A are eligible for election as municipal senators and district chiefs and deputy district chiefs. Candidates for public office of type B are eligible for election as district people's representatives and Bao heads and deputy Bao heads. Anyone who wants to apply for examination can go to the Civil Affairs Office or the District Office or the Bao head's office at any time to inquire, and they will be given a detailed answer.

### The Wrecked and Damaged Xumo Ship

The Xumo motor-powered junk, leased by the Ningding Shipping Company, departed from Shanghai on the 17th, carrying 87 tons of cargo to Hankou. On the following day, when sailing near Zhang Huanggang, upstream of Nantong, it encountered a sudden surge of rapid tidal currents coupled with strong winds. The small vessel was unable to withstand the force and ran aground on the sandbank. After the tide receded, it could not be pulled out for some time, resulting in prolonged grounding and damage to the ship's bottom. Consequently, the upstream journey was halted. It was towed to Shanghai the day before yesterday and is currently docked at Buoy No. 4, awaiting repairs.

### Impersonating Inspectors with Weapons

[Reported by this newspaper] At approximately 11 PM the night before last, police officers Li Xianglin and others from the Penglai Precinct were patrolling near the entrance of the Liuyunhui Temple on Lujiabang Road when they apprehended two pedestrians, Yao Kun and Zhang Jinhai. A box cannon was found on Yao's person. They claimed to be members of the inspectorate of the Headquarters. After being taken to the precinct, inquiries were made with a certain Headquarters, which confirmed that no such individuals existed. It was determined that they were imposters. Following interrogation, they were handed over to the Municipal Police Bureau for punishment.

### Social Services: Poor Children's Vocational Institute Appeals for Enthusiastic Donations from All Sectors

â Nianzu

Silver, cash, in-kind donations, and monthly donations are all welcome.

The Shanghai Poor Children's Vocational Institute in Xiaonanmen, Nanshi, has been established for eight years. At that time, it was during the 813 Incident, and the national army withdrew westward, and refugees were all over the field. Therefore, gentry such as Qia Qiqing organized the Refugee Relief Association to accommodate Shanghai disaster victims. Because there were many difficult children, it was urgent to provide education and training, so the Poor Children's Vocational Institute was established. Over the past eight years, all the directors have supported it arduously and never raised donations from outside. The newly appointed honorary chairman, Huang Jinrong, and chairman, Wang Xiaolai, etc., seeing that the equipment in the hospital still needs to be expanded, and the number of difficult children is increasing day by day, and the monthly expenses are also increasing. In addition to the monthly donations recognized by the directors, it is a huge deficit. They appealed to enthusiastic people in the society to donate money, monthly donations, or in-kind donations, such as daily necessities, clothing materials, medical and health supplies, etc., all are welcome, please send to the hospital office at No. 148 Longmen Road, Baxianqiao. When the newspaper publishes the thank-you. Currently, there are nearly a hundred poor boys and girls in the hospital. They attend classes in the morning and work in the afternoon, divided into sewing, paper boxes, net bags, etc., and there is also a well-trained military band. The teaching and management in the hospital are serious, and Chinese and foreign people who visit the hospital appreciate it.

### Remaining Counterfeit Currency Transferred to Educational Loan Fund

Reader's Letter Suggestion

Shen Bao reporter and gentlemen and ladies from all walks of life: We have a small suggestion that you will definitely be happy to support. This question is very simple and very important. I think you must have a lot of counterfeit currency in your hands, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, etc., no matter how much, only one month, the exchange period is about to arrive. Instead of putting it in the drawer, why not send it to the vault, collect it into a number, and then send it to Shen Bao for the educational loan fund to help a few more poor students. Why not do it? A personal view seems reasonable. If you adopt it, please publish it. As for collection and safekeeping, I would like to trouble your newspaper to do its best to support it, which is even more appropriate. Sincerely yours, Wu Xinming, Da Ranzhi Company, to Shen Bao Social Service Column.

Editor's Note: Mr. Wu's suggestion is excellent. Please implement it first. This column will be happy to collect it on your behalf. It is hoped that readers will donate enthusiastically, and poor students will benefit infinitely. This is indeed the only contribution to saving materials for the country.

### Gold, Banknotes, and Bonds Fall After Exchange Market Opens; Exchange Rate Still Subject to Speculation

Han Chi: Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was opened, and Mr. Pei took office as the governor of the Central Bank, the speculation wind gradually subsided. The general psychology is still looking at 2,000 to 1 for the US dollar and 1.35 million for gold, so yesterday the US dollar was inferior to gold in the market. It opened at 1.43 million in the morning, and the lowest was 1.37 million. There was surplus funds to absorb the bottom, (real goods receive real goods, not counting interest, there is absolutely no speculative effect,) once rebounded to 1.51 million, (the buying and selling price is far apart, it is extremely difficult to be sure,) but the US dollar failed to keep up, but saw degradation, it still fell to a little more than 1.4 million at noon, a decrease of 150,000 from the previous close. In the afternoon, the US dollar fell below 2,100 yuan, and the asking price fell below 1.4 million. There were few transactions and it was no longer widespread. The quotations of each firm are different, and the 1.4 million mark fluctuates. The gold ornaments are not listed, the patterned silver is 2,000 yuan, and the silver dollar is about 850 yuan. Supply exceeds demand, and the interest rate is still around 20%.

US Dollar: Yesterday, the majority of the people thought that 2,000 to 1, and the market price was still 10% higher. The seller still felt profitable. It opened at 2,270 yuan in the morning. The seller continued to work hard and gradually dropped to about 2,100 yuan, and then recovered slightly, but it was still difficult to last above 2,150 yuan. At noon, it was still hovering around 2,100 yuan, a decrease of about 300 yuan from the previous close. Although Hong Kong dollars should be an exception, (calculated at 2,000 to 1 for the US dollar, the Hong Kong dollar should be 500 yuan based on the British and American exchange rate, and it should be about 330 yuan based on the Hong Kong black market US dollar,) but in any case, the buyer is ultimately difficult to cheer up, and the new goods are even worse. As a result, the old goods fell by 10 yuan, and the new goods also fell by more than 10 yuan. The transaction was quiet.

Public Debt: At the beginning, the market was still tired, and the hot money hoped to show off. Someone absorbed it at a low price. Category C rebounded from 1,300 to 1,550 yuan, and finally about 1,500 yuan, which was slightly better than the previous close of 50 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands failed to keep up. The Chinese stocks are still hovering around the previous day's price. Some unpopular stocks are in demand, but the asking price is not high, and it is difficult to conclude a deal. Foreign stocks are also about half a percentage point. All of this is real goods supply and demand, and pure counterparty lacks openness.

### Gold Price Falls, Yarn and Cloth also Dip Slightly

Cotton Yarn: Yesterday, the yarn market became more depressed. The price of gold continued to fall, and people's hearts were tired because of this. As a result of the competition among peers, it fell by more than 10% compared with the previous day. Except for Double Horse, the 20-count yarn has returned to the million-dollar mark. The 16-count Guangming saw 910,000 at the beginning, and the closing price fell to 860,000. In the downward trend of various yarn lines, this brand is relatively slow.

Cotton: Yesterday, the transaction of raw cotton was still smooth, and the market situation was still fresh. It was purely affected by the gold black market and the yarn and cloth fell. Generally, the holders depreciated and sold, resulting in a situation of smooth sales and tired prices. The Fangjian Company exclusively imported a huge amount of 2,000 pieces of American cotton, and the Shenxin Yarn Factory imported 5600 bales of fire cotton, and the factory price was reduced by another 34,000 yuan.

Cotton Cloth: The transaction was quiet. Looking at the opening of foreign exchange and the small gold price, all gangs are in a wait-and-see attitude. This street is also in a state of desolation due to the sale of cheap cloth.

### American Cotton and Gasoline Arrive in Shanghai, Large Batch of Bristles Loaded

A large batch of American cotton and gasoline arrived in Shanghai. The Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Toyo Prince, loaded with more than 7,900 pieces of cotton, more than 19,000 barrels of gasoline, and 410 tons of diesel from Los Angeles, entered the port at about 3 pm yesterday and docked at the Asia Terminal first to unload gasoline, and there were 48 passengers who landed at the Customs Terminal on a small boat at the same time. After the gasoline is unloaded, it will be moved to the Sino-American Company Terminal to unload cotton.

A large amount of Changjiang bristles came to Shanghai. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang Yu ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and transported 1,115 pieces of black bristles and 23 pieces of white bristles from Yichang, which is the first large batch of bristles to arrive in Shanghai after the war.

### Grain Price Recedes Slightly, Fuel Also Turns Steady

Yesterday, all grains went downstream in unison. The rice market has been overwhelmed with arrivals and unable to digest. It dropped another 2,000 yuan. Flour also dropped slightly by 200 yuan. Soybeans were extremely sluggish and dropped sharply by more than 1,000 yuan. The price of oil plummeted. There are still sources in Qingdao, and the price is slightly lower by more than 2,000 yuan. Bean cake is tired and falls by 1200 yuan, and bran is nearly 100 yuan lower. Only raw peanuts can still stand.

The coal market transaction is still clean, and the market is gradually stabilizing. Yesterday, a batch of about 100 tons of Lizhang white coal was transported to Shanghai. The coal is produced in Daye, Hubei. The quality is slightly inferior to Yangquan coal, and it is also a good raw material for manufacturing briquettes. This time, it was transshipped from Wuhu to Shanghai, and the price was 220,000 yuan. The transaction was still strong.

Education and Sports

### Zhejiang Education Department Calls School Principals' Meeting; Soaring Rice Prices Severely Impact Teachers and Students; School Principals Bitterly Narrate Facts, Requesting Schools to be Maintained

[Reported by this newspaper's Hangzhou correspondent] Recently, the price of rice in Hangzhou has suddenly risen. On the 21st, middle-grade white rice was still 18,500 yuan, but on the 24th, it soared to 26,700 yuan and is still rising. Public and private secondary schools in Hangzhou are opening at this time, and tens of millions of primary and secondary school teachers and students are severely affected. There is a great possibility that students will not be able to enroll and schools will not be able to open. The education problem is extremely serious. The Education Department specially convened principals of public schools in the provincial capital, as well as section chiefs, supervisors, and secretaries, on the afternoon of the 23rd for a joint consultation. The principals bitterly narrated the facts, on the one hand, pleading for the teachers and students, and on the other hand, requesting the schools to be maintained. The meeting lasted for three hours, and the situation was very tense. According to a certain school principal, there are currently four difficulties: (1) The problem of reinstatement expenses. When schools open and students attend classes, food, lodging, and teaching equipment cannot be reduced. The amount of reinstatement expenses received by each school is very small, and it is really impossible to handle it. There was no result in today's consultation. The schools can only be simple, and teachers and students can only sleep on the floor and recite on the mat. Classrooms, dormitories, and dining halls are mixed together. Based on the current situation of each school, it is possible to borrow money from students. (2) The food problem of publicly funded students, normal school students, and vocational school students. The central government stipulates a monthly staple food fee of 4,000 yuan, and the province has temporarily allocated 3,000 yuan per person per month due to the expansion of the quota, which can only provide more than ten kilograms of rice, which is a big difference. In addition to reporting to the central government and requesting the Grain Office to allocate parity rice, the shortfall can only be collected from the students, which is a serious difficulty for some poor students. (3) The problem of excessive burden on students. This is a price problem, and no one can solve it. The provincial schools only collect 35 to 40 catties of rice for miscellaneous fees, and a total of 1,000 to 1,300 yuan for physical education, medical care, and derivative internships. The collection of miscellaneous fees is only 120,000 yuan for the provincial school's office expenses. The Education Department maintains the hardship of education. The collection of miscellaneous fees is to make up for its use and must be reported to the department for review. The remaining food rice, non-staple food, books, school supplies, and lecture fees are all agency-based in nature, and the profits are returned. A total of 200 catties of rice for the entire semester for boarding students, only 2,400 yuan per month for non-staple food expenses, and other expenses are 14,350 to 22,350 yuan. The most difficult thing is the rice problem. (4) The problem of teachers' lives. The salaries of teachers in this province are meager. At today's rice price, their income is only enough to buy rice. The hardship of life can be imagined. It is planned to ask the Grain Office to issue parity rice to alleviate it slightly.

### Unregistered Vocational Schools Should Proceed with Registration Quickly

[Reported by this city] Many private tutoring schools in this city use names such as "English College" or "Industrial College" without authorization and publish advertisements to solicit students. In fact, they are not at the level of professional materials, and they have started without the approval of the Ministry of Education. In view of this, the Municipal Education Bureau is actively investigating and banning them. For Cambridge English College, Zhijiang English College, Yiyi English College, Mengxian English College Day and Night School, and China Commercial English College Day and Night School, Nanyang Wireless Engineering College, China Journalism College and other nine schools, the ministry order has been notified. The Education Bureau ordered each school not to use the name "College" or "Mouxue College" and must correct the school name as soon as possible. Schools with a college degree should promptly submit it to the Municipal Education Bureau for transfer to the Ministry of Education to carry out the registration procedures, and they must wait until the opening of the college is approved before they can enroll students.

### Yue Da Fee Reduction Movement, School Council Determines the Method

[Reported by this city] All students of St. John's University in this city expressed disagreement with the school's prescribed tuition fee of 75,000 yuan and launched a fee reduction movement, which has been successfully resolved. The chairman of the school's school meeting, Wei Huiqing, and the president, Ni Baochun. After discussing with the representatives of the alumni association, the following principles were determined: (1) The tuition fee is 45,000 yuan. If students can pay the remaining 30,000 yuan, the alumni association will issue a receipt separately. (2) When the school's budget is insufficient, the students will be responsible for soliciting donations, but it must be approved by the school.

### Professors of National Universities Request Adjustment of Treatment; Will Send a Telegram to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee to Earnestly Call

[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, professors of national universities in this city have complained that the prices are rising wildly and the treatment is meager, which is not even as good as a worker in the National Bank. They specially invited reporters to the Youth Association yesterday to tell their hardships. Li Ximou, Pan Chengliang, Chen Daxie, Zhu Baiying, Fudan Ying Chengyi, Chen Kemei, Lin Da Pan, Mai Weiyu, Zhong Zhaolin and other professors from Jiaotong University who attended the meeting first reported on the current situation of treatment by Zhu Baiying. They are still calculated according to the civil servants' base salary of 80 times and the living allowance of 28,000 yuan. The professor who should have the deepest salary can only get 76,000 yuan for a monthly salary of 600 yuan. Other associate professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, etc. are even more miserable. It is said that a professor does not go out of the gate, but his monthly salary is used up to the eighteenth day, so if the government does not personally see the complete bankruptcy of education, there should be a good way to increase the treatment of professors so that they can teach and research with peace of mind. They dare not expect to fully follow the cost of living index, but hope to make reasonable adjustments with reference to the cost of living index, and issue research fees and food rice. If the country always ignores or has no sincerity to solve their lives, then they will only have to resign collectively, change to other industries, and each professor said that they will establish the National University Professors Federation within days and send a telegram to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education for earnest appeal.

City Middle School Teachers Petitioned Yesterday

[Reported by this city] More than 200 teachers and staff members of the ten municipal middle schools in this city, because the salaries were low and insufficient to cover expenses, held a general meeting at Yucai Middle School on Shanhaiguan Road the day before yesterday, and unanimously agreed to request the treatment of the bottom salary at the end of the Republic of China in the twenty-sixth year according to the current cost of living index, and sent a letter to the principals and petitioned the municipal government. Yesterday (February 27) at 10 am, they specially appointed six representatives to the municipal government to petition Mayor Qian. The Secretary-General Shen Shihua received them. For the requests of the teachers, he agreed to the same treatment as the municipal government officials, that is, 100 times the base salary plus a subsidy of 30,000 yuan, and another six buckets of white rice, but the representatives were not satisfied. It is now heard that the teachers and staff will gather again to discuss the method.

### A Woman's Talent is Virtue (Part 1)

â Yang Tongfang

Under the so-called "wise saying" of ancient sages, "A woman's lack of talent is a virtue," countless female geniuses have been buried, and countless women have been deprived of educational opportunities.

For thousands of years, Chinese women have been shackled by the terrible old ethics, without any freedom. The rulers of society in general, as well as the "great scholars" in the scholar-official class, in order to oppress and enslave women, first prevented women from having the opportunity to be educated, creating inequality of knowledge between men and women. Because of the inequality of knowledge, everything else naturally became unequal as well. Since women's status could not be equal to men's, they were always subordinate to men, becoming "playthings" in the hands of men. Men could use the term "chastity" to block the source of women's emotions, while men could openly take concubines without being subject to public criticism. Irresponsible men who seduced and abandoned women could ignore the consequences. Therefore, in feudal society, women were sheep for men to slaughter at will. The "wise saying" "A woman's lack of talent is a virtue," which has been regarded as an irrefutable truth for thousands of years, is even more of a shackle used by those "great scholars" who defend the Way to confine women. Countless women have been sacrificed beneath it.

A Saying That Should Have Been Abandoned Long Ago

Times have changed, and this "saying" seems to have been eliminated invisibly. In today's advocacy of equal rights for men and women, and in today's promotion of equal educational opportunities for men and women, we naturally do not allow such ideas to exist anymore. However, contemporary Chinese society still exhibits semi-feudal characteristics, and all incorrect traditional concepts have not been completely eradicated. Just like this "saying" that has confined Chinese women for thousands of years, there are still people who believe it is the truth. Those who claim to advocate "education for virtuous wives and good mothers" still take this "saying" that should have been abandoned long ago as the basis of their thinking. We cannot deny the progress of women's education in the past fifty years, but women's intellectual status is still inferior to that of men. While there are various reasons for this, there is one point we absolutely cannot deny: most people in society misunderstand the purpose of education. They believe that women's education is merely a kind of embellishment, a kind of decoration. How many people believe that women study for "practical application"? How many people believe that women can achieve the same intellectual status as men through studying? The idea that "a diploma is for the sake of makeup" seems to resonate with many people.

Not only in China, but even in countries like Germany and France, where women's education can be considered developed, there is still a widespread call to "go to the kitchen." The "bride schools" in America specialize in providing future brides with knowledge about household management and raising children, as if women's "talent" can only develop to the extent of the kitchen and the bridal chamber. In fact, women's nature and function are certainly suitable for handling household affairs, but on the other hand, we must urgently expand the scope of women's education. Especially in today's China, after eight years of the War of Resistance, we have finally won victory, and we are about to embark on the journey of national construction, marching towards the great road of building a new China. We need countless knowledgeable women to work together with men to serve the country and society, and to seek the welfare of the people. To achieve this goal, we must first correct the misconceptions that most people have about women's education, and expand the goals of education to the greatest extent possible, allowing women to freely enrich their knowledge and skills, and have the opportunity to satisfy their desire for knowledge.

The Ability to Adapt and Live

We must abolish the reactionary slogan "A woman's lack of talent is a virtue" and replace it with "A woman's talent is virtue." Here, "talent" refers to a person's ability to adapt to life. This is a broad definition, including all knowledge and skills necessary for daily life. True knowledge and skills must be combined with practice to have meaning. By opening up a path between theory and practice, one can naturally adapt well to self-governance and thereby improve life. In this way, from the individual to society, from the small self to the large self, we can surely push the world of mankind towards a bright future. Even if we disregard the country and society (in reality, improving the individual also improves the country and society), a woman with abundant knowledge and skills will surely be of greater help in managing the household and raising children. This is without question. How to manage one's household in an orderly and appropriate manner, and how to ensure that one's children receive good family education (men naturally also have a responsibility in managing the household and raising children) â these all require sufficient knowledge and skills, and are not something that just anyone can do. Letting ignorant and clueless women handle household management and raising children will never work. Moreover, the relationship between the country and society and the individual is extremely deep and important. Women in the future will no longer be "playthings" confined to high-rise buildings and subordinate to men; they should be conscious "members of society" and should recognize their position and responsibilities in society and even in the human race.

Intentional and United Action

As for "virtue," it refers broadly to the term "morality." This includes "moral conduct" and "character." According to the research of modern ethicists, the meaning of morality is extremely broad. What people regarded as moral in the past has now lost its relevance to the times and no longer has moral value. Of course, humanity also has common objective moral standards that can have relatively lasting value. However, morality is always a product of society, and the changes of the times and the evolution of society can change people's concepts of morality at any time. Morality is a rule of conduct; the rule of conscious common action that arises among the members of society to meet common needs is morality. In primitive society, it was believed that morality came from God's commands and that the concept of morality was bestowed by God. In this way, morality was clothed in the garb of religion. As the people's wisdom grew, morality was recognized as an instruction of "reason." People believed that besides the physical self, there was a "rational self." Although this argument broke away from the religious color of "God," it still does not conform to modern ethical concepts.

American psychologist S. Fischir argues that the development of an individual's morality often develops along with the development of the individual's self-awareness. It expands from the self, and the scope of moral concepts grows larger. The growth of the individual and the influence of the environment are the conditions for the formation of moral behavior. According to the analysis of general scholars, high-level knowledge must first be present to form a kind of moral behavior as a basis for reasoning and judgment. Socrates said, "Knowledge is virtue." A Western proverb says, "Most suffering comes from ignorance than from malice." Kant also said, "Knowledge is a mirror that reflects our behavior." Indeed, knowledge is very important, although we cannot deny the importance of good habits and strong willpower in forming moral behavior.

Children

### How to Deal with Children

â Xian

Children are innocent, naturally have a submissive heart, and in their little minds, they generally harbor a subconscious belief that "adults always know more than I do." Therefore, when instructing or exhorting them, one should always adopt a kind and amiable attitude, so-called earnest and patient guidance. There is no need to resort to stern words and harsh expressions. Sometimes, excessive scolding only makes them become "naughty" or even stubborn!

Children are naturally fond of playing, and sometimes they get their hands and faces extremely dirty. This is not their fault. You should clean them up afterwards and tell them that dirty things should not be put in the mouth and that they should wash their hands before eating. Next time, they will wash their hands themselves!

Do not point out their faults in front of others, as this will damage their self-esteem.

When children encounter things they do not understand and ask questions, you should answer and explain them in detail. However, you must not do the homework or exercises they bring back from school for them, so as to avoid fostering dependence.

When giving medicine to children, do not deceive them by saying it is sweet. This teaches them to deceive, and it will not work next time. It is better to persuade them properly, saying that taking this medicine will make the illness go away quickly and their bodies will not be uncomfortable anymore. The effect will be better.

Do not easily grant children's requests. If you grant them, do not forget to give them what they asked for, so as to cultivate their habit of keeping promises.

Kindness and love are good, but too much of them turns into spoiling.

Do not dress children in clothes that are too fancy or elaborate, as this will cultivate their extravagance.

Common Sense

### Priority in Line for Pregnant Women

â Ouli

British Food Minister Sir Ben Smith has specially stipulated that the ration cards of pregnant women should be printed with the words "Queue Priority Please" in order to give preferential treatment to pregnant women in collecting rationed food. Pregnant women who receive this kind of ration card have the right to go to the front of the line when queuing in front of stores in London.

This kind of preferential treatment for pregnant women could also be emulated in our country.

In this society where all prices are rising endlessly, every family is always worried about the difficulty of life, constantly thinking about how to "increase income" and how to "reduce expenditure." One of the slogans of the New Life Movement is: "Be diligent to increase income, and be thrifty to reduce expenditure." Naturally, being able to utilize waste can add up to a considerable amount over the years! Now I will write down a few usable items:

(1) Soap ends: Collect the soap ends that are left over. When you have accumulated a lot, dissolve the soap ends in lard, add some salt, and simmer it into a paste. Pour it into a mold, and after it solidifies, take it out and cut it into soap.

(2) Rags: Scraps of old clothes or fabric can be accumulated and used to make mops. The ones sold in the market are also made of rags.

(3) Shells: Shells can be used as dye. Just put the shells you have eaten, add some green alum, put them in a pot, and boil them with water to dye plain-colored clothing materials.

(4) Old leather shoe soles: Old leather shoe soles are very useful. It is very appropriate to repurpose them to make women's shoe soles or children's shoe soles.

(5) Rice straw ash: The ash burned every day seems useless, but if you use it to scrub copper pots and utensils, you can make old ones look new. Alternatively, you can soak it in water to make a lye, and use the lye to wash clothes. Its function is like that of soap, which can remove dirt; it can also be used as fertilizer.

### Homemade Little Cape

â Cangmei

Children are very wasteful when it comes to clothes. We can find a large piece of old clothing and, with a little effort, turn it into a practical and economical fashionable garment. Capes are very popular now, and I think it is very convenient for little girls to wear capes. Because in winter, if they wear a padded robe and then add a coat, they will inevitably look bulky. A cape is simple and chic.

The dimensions (in feet) of the cape in the drawing are suitable for a five- or six-year-old girl to wear.

Material: Preferably wool fabric. If you use old clothes, just iron the reverse side flat, and it will look as good as new. The material for the piping around the neckline and armholes should be chosen with diagonal checks or bright colors. This can highlight a plain, dark-colored fabric. As for the lining, you can use old materials.

Method: Cut according to the dimensions in the drawing. First sew the pleats and joining points with needle and thread, and then use a machine to stitch along the dotted lines. Join the two pieces on the front, left and right, and then sew them into a cape shape. Attach the hood. Make two shoulder pads (sew them into dumpling shapes, line them with cotton, and pad them on the shoulders). Then attach the lining. (The cutting of the lining can be simpler. The back can be cut into a flat piece, without pleats; the front can be cut by joining the two pieces into one.) After the whole garment is finished, apply the piping. The total length of the piping around the body is about eighty-two inches, and the length of the piping around the sleeve openings is five inches. Sew hooks and eyes on the neckline, and sew two round buttons and a button loop to fasten it. Then a simple and practical cape is complete. You may wish to try making one from an adult's old clothes first. The dimensions can be enlarged or reduced according to the size of the child.

Hobbies

### "Mahjong" That Consumes Life

â Suoyin

"Mahjong" is a pastime that consumes life! Because "time is the stuff that life is made of" (Franklin), consuming time is consuming life, and playing mahjong is the most time-consuming activity, so it is also the most life-consuming.

Chinese society has always presented this contradictory phenomenon: "People have nothing to do, and there is no one to do things." Playing mahjong is one of the most common manifestations of people having nothing to do. Of course, this phenomenon occurs not because there is truly nothing to do, but because people do not know how to do things or are unwilling to do them. This is a very terrible phenomenon. The Ming dynasty perished due to Ma Diao, the predecessor of mahjong. This time, China has suffered an unprecedented disaster, and mahjong is not without its contribution. Because the trend of playing mahjong has been extremely rampant in the past few decades, Mr. Hu Shih once calculated that the total time spent on playing mahjong across the country every day is at least 167,000 days! Just imagine if this much time were used to do other things that would benefit society, the family, or the individual, wouldn't its achievements be very impressive? Accumulate it over a year, over decades, wouldn't its achievements be even more astonishing? Naturally, the fruits of these achievements would be the progress of society and the strength of the country. Now, spending this precious time on playing mahjong, the results obtained are of course the opposite, and the occurrence of national disasters is not accidental.

However, what is even more heartbreaking is that today, after the cooperation of the Allied powers led to the victory of the War of Resistance, when every citizen should be shouldering a part of the work of national construction, the evil trend of playing mahjong still prevails in all social strata, from the upper class to the middle class to the lower class!

Moreover, playing mahjong not only wastes time, but also cultivates a person's gambling mentality, selfishness, and affects the relationship between relatives and friends. What's worse is that because of worrying about gains and losses, it causes people's psychology to become abnormal. When they win, they become ecstatic and want to use the ill-gotten wealth to have fun. Thus, eating, drinking, playing, and all kinds of bad habits begin to form. If they lose, they become dejected, make excuses to be angry, and can't sleep or eat well because they want to "win back their losses." Fortunately, they win back their capital. If they quit from now on, that would be good. But due to the effect of their compensatory psychology (compensating for some mental loss), they are unwilling to stop there and want to win a little more. But if they lose again, will they stop there? No, because they then develop the desire to "gain even more after having achieved one's initial aims." In this way, they always want to win back their losses when they lose and always want to win more when they win, and the cycle continues endlessly. They can never extricate themselves. This is the common psychology of engaging in any kind of gambling, and it is not only true of playing mahjong.

But this mind-consuming and time-wasting pastime is not only loved by men, but women play it even more enthusiastically. Because men always have to go out to work, women, especially the ladies, wives, and misses of the leisure class, can entrust all the housework to servants and devote all their energy and time to playing mahjong without any problems. Even housewives in middle- and lower-class families, who do not have servants to entrust their housework to, will handle the housework and children with extremely "economical" methods: they will buy some snacks to save themselves the trouble of cooking; they will pile up dirty clothes and bedding without washing them first; they will let the dust accumulate thickly in the room without cleaning it; they will leave their belongings in disarray without tidying them up; they will let their children wander on the streets, fight in the alleys, and commit mischief without disciplining or educating them, and they will free up time to engage in playing mahjong. I really don't understand how "mahjong" can be so bewitching!

But I believe that most gamblers understand that they are knowingly committing the act, so this is not something that can be effective through persuasion with words. It is necessary to find constructive pastimes and entertainment to replace it. Because the Chinese people have always lacked good hobbies due to the lack of progress in their thinking and the low level of education, such as the various ball games, swimming, hiking, reading, stamp collecting, and music that Europeans and Americans love. At the same time, due to environmental factors, legitimate pastimes and entertainment are restricted, such as the lack of parks, sports grounds, libraries, and various amateur organizations. Therefore, mahjong has gained the right time and place and has become a popular hobby.

The author has long believed that to eradicate the evil trend of housewives playing mahjong, it is necessary to rely on the power of the community. It would be best if knowledgeable women in each neighborhood led the organization of a kind of community, such as a friendship society, targeting women in one neighborhood or one alley as the organizational object -- the scope of the organization may be small, as this makes it easier to manage. The clubhouse should have books, newspapers, magazines, entertainment equipment, etc., and regular lectures or seminars and home visits should be held to instill women with various necessary knowledge, such as household affairs, hygiene, child psychology and education, and women's self-cultivation. Sometimes, group trips or visits can be arranged, and sometimes educational exhibitions can be held. During festivals, it is also possible to hold a fun fair or a concert. In short, anything that can increase women's knowledge and add to their legitimate interests can be introduced to improve their intellectual level, cultivate their noble hobbies, correct their bad lifestyles, and achieve the goal of eradicating the evil trend of playing mahjong.

### The Diaper Problem in the Soviet Union

â Translated by Xiao Shuzhuang

I was overjoyed. My wife gave birth to a son.

When this little guy, born in the maternity hospital, is ready to go home, what is the most needed thing? Obviously, diapers.

First, the maternity hospital wrote a certificate proving that the child was born alive.

"Go to the women's examination room to get his diapers," they told me. When I got to the examination room, they said:

"You need to have a residence certificate from the landlord of your current residence; you also need a power of attorney when picking up diapers."

"Who will guarantee me?" I asked in surprise. "This baby?"

"The mother can issue a power of attorney," they replied.

So I ran to find the landlord and ran back to the maternity hospital to collect these certificates.

I returned to the examination room. This time, three certificates were exchanged for a new certificate. They mercifully told me:

"Send it to where your wife works."

When I got to where my wife works, my son was registered. Now that I have the records, certificates, etc., I went to the allocation card distribution office. There, I received a card for collecting diapers.

Holding up this small green card, I couldn't help but think: if someone came up with a good idea to supply diapersâor at least diaper ration cardsâdirectly from the maternity hospital, then what would these kind gentlemen have to do?

On the seventh day after my son was born, he, wearing new shrouds, was allowed to be discharged from the hospital. When leaving the hospital, they handed me a slip of paper, saying:

"Here is your certificate for collecting soap."

The little fellow is already over two months old, and that soap collection certificate has only just turned into a bar of soap. It wasn't thrown away. This certificate first ran to the landlord, from there it was directed to the women's examination room, and then back to the landlord. Then it ran to the mother's workplace, from there to the allocation card distribution office, from there to the father's workplace, and then back to the allocation card distribution office, and finally back to the maternity hospital.

It wasn't just the certificate. It has been running around to these places, and the father accompanied it. This is the use of fathers.

On the back of the certificate, the following statement is printed: "The soap allocation card should be collected directly from within the maternity hospital. Printed by Kutzneitsov, Director of the Allocation Card Distribution Office." Just below this, we see again: "Submit this certificate to the department in charge of collecting other allocation cards, and you will immediately obtain a soap allocation card. (Signature, illegible)"

However, we did eventually get the bar of soap, but I kept the certificate. When my son grows up and is able to do things, I will show him this little piece of paper and say to him, "Child, tear it up! Remember, in your life, never issue such a certificate or write such a statement. You must treat your fellow countrymen like human beings!"

The above article is translated from the January 1946 issue of Reader's Digest, originally written by Yefirn Urhunsky. During the War of Resistance, compatriots in the occupied areas tasted the bitterness of the rationing system under the enemy and puppet governments. Due to the oppression of life and the rise in prices, they had to swallow their anger and be ordered around to fill out a form here and get a ration ticket there. The procedures were truly numerous. Housewives were even more endlessly troubled, having to constantly remember when and where to collect items such as rice tickets, flour tickets, sugar tickets, oil tickets, coal briquette tickets, cloth tickets, etc. They had to squeeze and be jostled, and they would either run in vain or spend money to get things that they couldn't eat, couldn't use, or that weren't enough to share. After reading this article, I deeply sympathize with the experiences of this Soviet author.

### Remembering

â Shuyi

Living with children is truly a joy in life. Watching their innocent and lively behavior and their carefree faces seems to make me younger. Sometimes, when my heart is clearly disturbed by the turmoil of the world and immersed in the abyss of sorrow, it will disappear like smoke upon seeing the cordial and lovely children. Learning together with them every day seems to bring me back to the golden age of the past.

In the eyes of the children, I am as dignified as an emperor. My words are the law for the children. Their lives and emotions change with my will. I seem to live in a world created by myself. Although parenting is strenuous and often causes anxiety, afterwards, nothing is on my mind. It is like the reconciliation with my brothers after getting angry at home. If I can see their behavior or studies gradually improving, then the joy in my heart is truly indescribable, and I will cherish this child especially.

Now, illness has kept me away from them for almost two years. Two years of separation have increased my attachment even more. I miss every one of them, and they certainly won't have forgotten me either. If my health and circumstances allow it in the future, I would still like to do this old job again, get along with innocent children, and live a hard but warm school life.
