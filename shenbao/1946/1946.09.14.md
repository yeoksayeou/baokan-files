### Special Envoy Marshall's Eighth Visit to Lushan Yesterday: Advocates Concurrent Discussions on Politics and Military Affairs; Ambassador Stuart and Minister Wu Exchange Views on the Current Situation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Special Envoy Marshall flew to Xunyang at 2:00 PM on the 13th, making his eighth ascent to Lushan. He will convey the Communist side's suggestion to convene a three-person military conference and is scheduled to return to Nanjing with Mrs. Marshall on the 16th. According to relevant sources, both Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart are still making final efforts. Whether the five-person committee meeting and the three-person military conference will be temporarily shelved is currently unknown, as Marshall and Stuart have also been studying the most appropriate approach. It is reported that Special Envoy Marshall believes that if the Chinese Communists propose convening a three-person military conference to discuss the ceasefire issue, then the Chinese Communists should accept the unofficial five-person committee meeting to discuss the reorganization of the government as an exchange condition, and political and military discussions should proceed concurrently. However, the spokesman for the Chinese Communist delegation stated today that the most important thing at present is still the convening of the three-person military conference to resolve the ceasefire issue. As for the unofficial five-person committee meeting, the Chinese Communists will refuse to participate until a ceasefire is guaranteed.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 13th] Marshal Marshall made his eighth ascent to Guling at 6:00 PM on the 13th to spend the weekend. Mrs. Marshall, as usual, arrived half an hour earlier at Xiaotianchi to wait for him, and they both went to the Martyrs' Shrine next to the 99th Army's war memorial to pay their respects to the fallen heroes.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Ambassador Stuart, in addition to meeting with Chinese and foreign reporters at the embassy on the morning of the 13th, also hosted a luncheon for Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng at noon. They exchanged views on the current situation, and Wu and Zhang did not leave until about 2:00 PM. The originally scheduled banquet at President Song's residence at 6:00 PM was canceled due to a change of date. In addition, Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party delegation visited Fu Jingbo at 11:00 AM on the 13th, leaving after a half-hour discussion. Stuart and Zhou had originally planned to meet in the afternoon, but this was also canceled.

[French News Agency, Washington, 12th] Regarding Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart's mediation of the Chinese peace talks, a State Department spokesman stated that the United States has suffered a temporary setback. Subsequently, Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart's mediation of the Chinese peace talks, in an attempt to achieve Chinese unification, will likely encounter several setbacks, but the United States will not be disappointed in promoting cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

### Minister Wu Tiecheng Told Reporters Last Night That the Five-Person Committee Has Not Failed: The Government Hopes the Communist Party Will Participate and Not Create Unnecessary Complications

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Reporters, feeling confused by the Communist Party's repeated claims that the unofficial five-person committee meeting had failed, visited Wu Tiecheng, the government representative to the unofficial five-person committee meeting, on the evening of the 13th. According to him, the meeting has not failed, and the key to convening this meeting lies with the Communist Party's participation and not creating unnecessary complications by raising extraneous demands. When reporters asked about the Communist Party's assertion that there was no need to discuss the unofficial five-person committee meeting at all, Wu replied: "If they say there is no need to talk about it at all, why did they accept this proposal in the first place? Last week, the Communist Party said that after the unofficial five-person committee meeting had results, they wanted to guarantee a ceasefire. Now they say they want to hold a three-person military conference, which is really creating unnecessary complications."

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] It is reported that the government and Special Envoy Marshall, in view of the failure of the three-person military committee to maintain peace in China, are quite lukewarm to the Chinese Communist's request to reopen the three-person committee, especially Marshall, who has refused to accept the request and has entrusted Ambassador Stuart to explain to the Chinese Communist Party. Both Ambassador Stuart and Special Envoy Marshall have resubmitted the government's new proposal: that the Chinese Communist Party first assist in the reorganization of the National Government Committee, so that the three-person committee can simultaneously find ways to prevent rapidly escalating conflict. Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan stated that Yan'an will formally request the reopening of the three-person committee in writing and reiterate the Communist Party's position that peace must be achieved first, and then political negotiations can proceed. Currently, the Chinese Communist Party is retreating steadily in North China and urgently seeks peace, but refuses to participate in the five-person committee until a chance for peace is obtained.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 13th] Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan stated: No Chinese Communist officers have received training in the Soviet Union, and no Soviet representatives are stationed in Yan'an. The Chinese Communist Party has no diplomatic relations with any foreign country other than the United States through Marshall and the Peiping Military Mediation Department.

### The Chinese Communist Party Obstructs Peace, Loses the Trust of the People, US Newspaper Says its Strategy is Controlled by Foreign Countries

[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] The Chicago Sun published a report by its Shanghai correspondent Durrence, stating that based on the situation in China in recent weeks, the Chinese Communist Party is in a difficult situation, and the sympathy of the Chinese people for the Communist Party has disappeared. The reasons for this are, first, the people's patience with the existing disputes has reached its limit; second, they gradually believe that the Communist Party's strategy of obstructing China's peace and unity is heavily controlled by foreign countries. Durrence also pointed out that the Chinese people's intolerance and distrust of the Communist Party seem to coincide with the worldwide aversion to Soviet actions. Some upright people believe that if the Communist Party could genuinely support and assist in establishing a unified China, then they might support the Communist Party, but they are currently only being used. This is also a common feeling shared by some Chinese and foreign figures holding important positions, who are still working hard for the peace and order of this suffering country. Durrence also said: "The Communist Party's obstructionist policies, its breach of promises, the overthrow of ceasefire agreements, the murder of foreigners (especially Americans) and the habit of lying have accumulated into a huge impact: first, this has made President Chiang increasingly popular; second, it has strengthened the US policy in China." (Note: The Chicago Sun is a recognized liberal newspaper)

(Note: Jining is divided into two urban areas by the railway line, with the area east of the railway called Qiaodong, and the area west of the railway called Qiaoxi.)

### The First Japanese War Criminal to be Executed: Takashi Sakai is Executed by Firing Squad; Tens of Thousands of People Compete to Watch the Execution at Yuhuatai

— Our Nanjing Correspondent Zhang Ming

Yesterday, we personally witnessed a butcher who had slaughtered countless of our compatriots being executed by the firing squad of the National Defense Army on the soil of the Republic of China. He fell before us, before the mountains and valleys around the execution ground filled with standing compatriots. He was Takashi Sakai, the number one Japanese war criminal to be executed. The death sentence was pronounced before Bian Jiutian took office. At that time, he stubbornly wanted to defend himself. During those 19 days, he buried himself in the prison, writing thousands of words of defense. When this reporter visited him outside his prison cell at 1:00 PM today, he was still writing, looking very relaxed. He was not wearing any other clothes except for his underwear, and his glasses were also taken off. Things were scattered on the table, and a box of Mid-Autumn Festival mooncakes was accompanying him.

Just as this reporter was visiting, the guarding policeman loudly asked: "What are you doing?" He replied in Chinese: "It's okay, it's not important!" It seemed that he did not know that death was imminent. According to the policemen in the war criminal detention center, he had known for a long time that he would die, but he did not know which day it would be. He often gestured to the policemen that his life was about to end. At 2:30 PM, Prosecutor Guangyu Chen of the Military Tribunal arrived and immediately issued a warrant for him. When Sakai heard the order to summon him, he immediately put on the khaki shirt, dark blue suit, black-and-white polka-dot tie, and black leather shoes that he had worn for previous court appearances. He arrived at the court at 2:45 PM. Prosecutor Chen immediately asked: "Your case has been finalized. Do you have anything to say?" He answered: "I have nothing to say here." He asked: "Do you have a will to leave to your family?" He answered: "Yes, I have written it, it is all about family matters, please be sure to send it. I have not finished organizing it yet. What time is it now? It would be best to let me finish organizing it today. If not, then forget it!" Prosecutor Chen said that time could not wait, but finally agreed to give him 30 minutes to write his unfinished will in the courtroom. Up to this point, his attitude was still pretending to be calm. When the translator was speaking, he even forced a smile, but he insisted on going back to the prison cell to write, saying that his things were very scattered. Only when Prosecutor Chen firmly refused did he shake his head, seemingly regretting that this matter could not be fulfilled, and he would not die in peace. When the writing materials were brought, he wrote with a calmer attitude, the strokes starting thin and then thick, eventually becoming so scribbled that they were unrecognizable. One letter was for "His Excellency Okamura," and the other was for "Kikue Sakai." Both started with "September 13th, 3:00 PM, suddenly executed," and then listed some money and belongings, etc. Because it was written in Japanese and hastily, it was unreadable. After finishing writing, he reorganized his clothes, including a suitcase and two bundles. Although death was imminent, his attitude in reorganizing his clothes was even more meticulous than when he was preparing his luggage before traveling overseas. This action fully demonstrated the stubbornness of the Japanese.

The journey began. The two large trucks of the Ministry of National Defense? were followed by the reporters' small jeeps. In Sakai's car, the guards' bayonets were lined up. The prison car passed through Huangpu Road, Guofu Road, and Zhongshan North Road to Zhonghua Gate. Along the way, the crowds watched the prison car, pointing and saying that this was a heinous war criminal. Sakai, imprisoned in the car, still calmly looked at everything. He arrived at Yuhuatai at exactly 4:00 PM. The mountains and valleys were packed with people, waiting with vengeful hearts. When Sakai got out of the car, he still forced a smile, but his face was full of paleness. His expression had been forced tight by death. On the way to the execution ground, the white gloves he had been holding were dropped on the ground. Upon reaching the execution ground, the executioner Zhou Wenjie raised his gun and fired from behind. One second after the first shot, the second shot was fired. Finally, he fell to the left, his legs apart, his eyes half-open, and his mouth open. In a few groans, he raised both hands upward, showing a struggle for survival. This was the last act. At 4:05 PM, his soul returned to the earth. The applause of the crowd resounded in the valley. Everyone felt so happy, as if they had avenged their parents and children. Afterwards, the local guards of Yuhuatai ordered the local police station to bury him. This deep-seated hatred in the hearts of millions of people was finally relieved to some extent today on the first executed war criminal. (Dispatch from Nanjing on the 13th)

#### Sakai's Crimes

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense announced Sakai Takashi's crimes as follows: After investigation, war criminal Sakai Takashi participated in the war of aggression and massacred prisoners of war, wounded soldiers, and non-combatants in Hong Kong, Guangdong, and other places, and also raped, robbed, exiled civilians, abused torture, and destroyed property. The facts are clear and the evidence is solid. On August 27th of this year, this court, in accordance with Article 1 of the War Criminal Trial Regulations, Article 8, Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the first clause, Article 1 of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, Article 1 of the Paris Peace Treaty, Articles 4 to 7 and Article 23, Paragraph 3, Clause 7, Article 28, Article 46, Article 47 of the Hague Regulations on Land Warfare, Articles 1 to 6, Article 9, Article 10 of the Geneva Convention, Article 34 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law, Article 101, Paragraph 1, and Article 55 of the Criminal Law, sentenced him to death, and submitted a report to Chief of Staff Chen this month, which stated, "After investigating that the defendant Sakai Takashi participated in the war of aggression, undermined peace, and abused his troops, violating wartime regulations, and that the interrogation was indeed accurate, the original sentence of death imposed according to law is not inappropriate. Having been submitted to Chairman Chiang of the National Government, he instructed approval to proceed. It is hoped that it will be followed immediately. Report immediately upon execution." etc. Upon receiving this, we immediately submitted a proposal regarding the criminal Sakai Takashi at 4:00 PM on the same day, verified his identity, and escorted him to the execution ground to carry out the death sentence. In addition to reporting, this proclamation is to be announced to all for their information. The details are as follows: War criminal Sakai Takashi, male, 60 years old, from Hiroshima, Japan, residing in Tokyo.

### The Next General Assembly of the Political Consultative Conference Will Be Held After the National Congress, Minister of Communications Yu Reports on the Current Status of Transportation to the Standing Committee

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] There has been much speculation about the date of the next meeting of the Political Consultative Conference, and some even say that it will not be held before the end of the current term.

(3) The tonnage and quantity of water transport are the same as before the war. (4) Aviation must be highly developed, but there are many difficulties due to ground equipment. It has been decided to greatly develop private aviation next year, but it will still be dominated by state-owned aviation. (5) There has been some progress in postal and telecommunications. After the report, councilors Xue Mingjian, Liu Zhenru, Chen Qitian, and others raised questions one after another. Yu denied the rumor that aviation sovereignty had been ceded to foreign countries. He said that due to the lack of airport equipment and parts, the establishment of civil aviation companies was restricted, but there was no discrimination. Regarding the issue of repairing the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, Yu believed that it should be coordinated with the French side's road construction work; he also answered questions about the increased price of airplanes and the crowded trains. Subsequently, four proposals were passed: (1) Wu Zhaoxu and four others proposed that the government should quickly plan and implement effective ways to accommodate out-of-school youth in large, medium, and small schools across the country this year, so that all citizens can have schools to enter and books to read, laying a foundation for a hundred years. The resolution was passed and sent to the government for its earnest implementation. (2) Xue Mingjian and four others proposed: Please ask the Inspection Department of the Central Bank to improve the deposit reserve system for banks and commercial banks in provinces, cities, and counties. Resolution: Send to the government for attention. (3) Xue Mingjian and four others proposed: Please ask the government to issue an order to transportation agencies across the country, such as railways, cars, and ships, to give preferential treatment to discharged military officers and their families returning home. Resolution: Send to the government for prompt handling. (4) Li Qia and five others proposed: Relief for the disaster situation in Qinghai. Resolution: Send to the government for prompt handling.

Full Text of the Declaration

(Continued from Yesterday's First Edition - End)

This war was a worldwide war against aggression. China served as the vanguard against aggression. Only China, with its spirit of disregard for success or failure, insisted on resistance, which led to the formation of the anti-aggression nations' alliance, the defeat of the fascist Axis powers, and the attainment of final victory. Although our material strength is far inferior to that of our scientifically advanced allies, our national military and civilians' moral spirit of sacrificing for truth is sufficient to be proud of to all mankind. We are the youth, the Three Principles of the People youth who are fighting for the construction of a new world. What we pray for is that the victory of this war can produce international democracy and cooperation, and promote the realization of the four freedoms of all mankind. However, looking at today's international situation, we cannot help but feel deeply anxious. The ideals proclaimed by the United Nations during their joint operations, and the Magna Carta signed, have not been fully trusted and practiced by the various United Nations nations after the victory of the war. In dealing with defeated countries and territorial issues, strong countries often place the security of one country above the security of the international community, and individual interests above collective interests. The lack of mutual trust has reduced the spirit of cooperation during wartime, which has had a deeply adverse impact on the work of world reconstruction. In the past year, "the independence of the Philippines and the establishment of the interim government of India are gratifying to us, but many major issues related to international peace have not been satisfactorily resolved or proceeded smoothly. China, which sacrificed the most and suffered the longest in the anti-aggression war, has not yet obtained full respect for its national independence, equality, and freedom after the end of the war, which is particularly painful for our national youth.

We are reminded of the ancient saying "A nation must insult itself before others insult it," and we cannot help but conduct a painful self-examination of the current domestic situation in our country. The purpose of our war of resistance was to seek national independence and survival, and national unity and progress. We are the Three Principles of the People youth, whose lifelong aspiration is to abide by the last words of the national father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, to struggle peacefully to save China, to seek national unity, and to maintain world peace, because we deeply believe that only by establishing a unified and strong China can we lay the foundation for peace in East Asia and guarantee world peace. However, one year after the victory, national unity and progress have been severely hindered. On the one hand, the small Chinese Communist Party supports its armed forces, not hesitating to create civil strife and divide the country, causing social and economic destruction and making reconstruction work extremely difficult. On the other hand, corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry, as well as unscrupulous merchants who made fortunes during the national crisis and the victory, indulge in their insatiable desires, speculating on prices and exploiting the majority of our compatriots, making the suffering of the people after the war impossible to alleviate. These are the biggest obstacles to the Three Principles of the People. In addition to our heartache and grief, we believe that we must unite the national youth and work hard to eliminate them, so that we can overcome the current national crisis, so that the people of the whole country can truly enjoy the fruits of victory, and so that the Republic of China can permanently maintain its international status obtained through arduous resistance.

The team arrived in Taiwan on August 3 and has conducted on-site investigations in five counties and six cities. They will fly back to Nanjing in the coming days to recommend that the central government send more people to come.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 13th] Regarding the malfeasance cases in the two bureaus in Taiwan Province, Chief Executive Chen Yi has recently replied to Liu Wendao, head of the Fujian-Taiwan Region Cleanup Team, accepting the team's suggestion to impose administrative sanctions on Ren Weijun, director of the Monopoly Bureau, and Yu Baixi, director of the Trade Bureau, and transfer them to the court for handling.

### Wuhan Branch Director of the Central News Agency Xu Yuanyu and Others Accused of Malfeasance; Seizing Large Amounts of Materials by Taking Advantage of Receiving Opportunities

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 13th] The Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Region Cleanup Team recently released accusations against Xu Yuanyu, director of the Wuhan branch of the Central News Agency, and others, for seizing large amounts of materials by taking advantage of receiving opportunities. The entire case is divided into four parts: (A) Stealing Photographic Equipment from the Chiyo Yoko Company Operated by the Japanese: stating that over 30 tons of photographic equipment from the company were moved away by Cai Shuwen from the Central News Agency in over 30 truckloads in October last year. After the former Sixth War Zone Headquarters discovered this, it arrested Yuan Xuzu, an employee of the agency who carried out the theft, and recovered the equipment. Although the agency returned part of the equipment, a detailed inspection revealed that the quantity was less than one-tenth of the original. Based on the ratio of subsequent auction prices, the total value of the quantity that was embezzled privately was at least around 300 million yuan. Furthermore, Yuan Xuzu's confession in court and the agency's prior and subsequent protection both prove that this case was instigated by Xu Yuanyu. (B) Looting of Fang Benren's Property: stating that Xu Yuanyu privately took over 20 types of property from Fang's residence during the receiving process, the most valuable of which were five large boxes of German paint and over 30 clothing boxes. (C) Embezzlement of Revenue from the Cultural Hall: stating that after Xu Yuanyu took over the Cultural Hall, all income and expenditure statements have not been handed over, and at least 24 million yuan in revenue has not been turned over. (D) Forcibly Occupying a Car: stating that Xu Yuanyu took possession of a sedan owned by the traitor Shi Xingchuan during the receiving process and is still using it publicly. After investigating the above four cases, the team has transferred them to the Wuhan District Court Prosecutor's Office for handling and has detained Cai Shuwen for interrogation. However, Xu himself has not returned to Hankou after going to Nanjing to report on his duties. It is heard that he has been detained in Nanjing.

### U.S. Loans to China Totaled $67 Million This Year; Export-Import Bank Reports to Congress

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 12th] A report submitted to Congress by the Export-Import Bank shows that loans to China this year totaled $67 million in six tranches. The first loan was to the Bank of China to assist the bank in purchasing American cotton, amounting to $33 million, enough to purchase 275,000 to 300,000 bales of American cotton. The term of this loan is 24 months, starting from the date the American cotton arrives in China, guaranteed by the Chinese government. The other five loans to China totaled $33.8 million, provided to China to purchase ships, barbed wire, repair equipment and equipment for coal mining, and auxiliary power plants in the United States, with each loan as follows:

(1) Ten coastal freighters, totaling over US$4,243,000; (2) Sixteen freighters, US$2,600,000; (3) Railway repair equipment, US$16,650,000; (4) Ten hydropower auxiliary power plants, US$8,800,000; (5) Coal mining equipment, US$1,500,000.

The terms of the above loans vary depending on their use. The loan for purchasing coastal ships accounted for 75% of the selling price, and the remaining 25% was paid in cash by the Chinese government. The term of this loan was 20 years, with an interest rate of 3.5%. In April 1946, in response to President Truman's China policy statement on December 15, 1945, the Export-Import Bank prepared to lend US$500 million to various Chinese government agencies and private enterprises. However, as of June 30, 1946, the Export-Import Bank and representatives of the Chinese government had not completed the agreement to implement the loan.

Editorial

### The Future of the Racecourse

Recently, the Shanghai citizens have been commonly paying attention to the issue being discussed in the Municipal Council: whether or not to resume horse racing. According to the estimated proposal submitted by the Municipal Government, resuming horse racing would generate a tax revenue of 2.4 billion yuan within six months. However, the mayor also stated that his intention was solely to accumulate these funds to reclaim the racecourse for proper use within two years, a "taking the wool from the sheep" approach, and not to "flatter foreigners." Thus, it can be known that the resumption of horse racing has neither anything to do with Sino-foreign relations, nor does it have a significant impact on increasing taxes to make up for deficits (the municipal government estimates a deficit of over 30 billion yuan in half a year, which definitely cannot be compensated by the meager surplus of around 2 billion yuan). Therefore, the focus should be on the mayor's policy of reclaiming the racecourse.

We strongly support the mayor's policy of reclaiming the racecourse. There are many reasons why the racecourse should be municipalized, and the councilors are certainly well aware of them. It is said that Councilors Feng Youzhen and Zhao Junhao have even proposed converting it into a cultural center. In the future, will this large green space beside Nanjing West Road remain a racecourse? Or will it become a cultural center? Or a large park? Or a recreation center? Or, as the mayor said, will the landowners of the Jockey Club be allowed to sell their land to build houses? The Municipal Council should give the citizens an answer!

But regardless of the future fate of the racecourse, what we must first point out is that before submitting this proposal, the relevant departments of the Municipal Government should first explain the following points to the citizens: What is the history of the racecourse? How many acres does the racecourse occupy? To whom does the property right of its land and buildings belong? Should it have been entirely or partially owned by the municipality? How much money from the racecourse revenue has been donated to charitable causes each year in the past? And which charitable organizations and causes have benefited? If the government wants to reclaim it, what is the current estimated value? Apart from allowing horse racing, are there absolutely no other ways for the government to prepare the funds for this purchase?

From the perspective of the general public, firstly, such a lively area in the central district of Shanghai really needs a place for most citizens to relax. Whether it becomes a large park or is converted into a cultural center, it definitely cannot be allowed to continue horse racing in its original location. The Municipal Government should consider the health of the general public and not solely focus on the foreign merchants of the Jockey Club, let alone only be concerned with the calculation of 2.4 billion in half a year. Secondly, if the racecourse is to be municipalized, the property rights should be clarified, a fair valuation should be made, and funds should be raised for the acquisition. Thirdly, the change in the use of the racecourse should be primarily aimed at promoting the physical and mental health of citizens, and absolutely no more alley houses should be built there, because it is essential to preserve this green space in the bustling city. Fourthly, speaking of horse racing, it is originally a form of exercise, but involving betting on horses and gambling on wins and losses, then whether it should be considered a type of "gambling" under the criminal law should first be sought in legal terms. If the council passes it rashly, wouldn't it be taking a risk? Everyone must pay attention: Shanghai no longer has concessions! Chinese law and central government orders must be considered first; it cannot be assumed that just because something existed in the concession era or exists in other countries, we can have it too!

Defining National Civil Aviation Policy

It is reported that the Ministry revoked the license of the privately-owned Dahua Aviation Company, causing it to fail to operate publicly. It is said that the issuance of this business license must wait until the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan pass civil aviation regulations, which will take a long time. Under these circumstances, the company intends to seek registration in Hong Kong, using Hong Kong and Kowloon as its base, and Shanghai will also be a major stop. At this time, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is letting General Chennault operate air transport with aviation equipment worth 3 million gold yuan. In addition to transporting relief supplies, it also intends to operate passenger and cargo transport. Before obtaining confirmation, we are unwilling to comment on whether Dahua Aviation Company is planning to register with the Hong Kong government, or whether the air transport operated by General Chennault also intends to operate passenger and cargo transport in addition to transporting relief supplies. However, the publication of this news makes us think about the policies of our country's civil aviation, which the government should determine and promulgate as soon as possible.

Before the government decides on a civil aviation policy, what we cannot understand about the Dahua Company case is why the government's actions are so inconsistent? The relevant authorities can issue a license first, and the Executive Yuan can revoke it later. If the company suffers losses in preparation and operation, where will it seek compensation? Moreover, on the one hand, government agencies are signing contracts with Dahua Company to transport goods and passengers, and on the other hand, they are ordering it to cease operations with lightning speed. We really don't know if our government is a unified entity or not? Why play such a joke on a private airline company?

When it comes to civil aviation, we originally knew that even in the United Kingdom and the United States, which advocate free enterprise, strict control is adopted. In the United Kingdom, the operation of civil aviation is close to a monopoly, unlike other general enterprises, which advocate competition. The mainland of the United Kingdom is not large, and civil aviation is not as developed as in the United States, but the operation of overseas air transport is almost entirely monopolized by the British Overseas Airways Corporation, which is subject to government supervision and funding. In the United States, civil aviation is also subject to strict government control. The approval of routes and the setting of fees must be approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board. As for overseas air transport, the operation of airlines such as Pan American and Western Airlines is also subject to government supervision and control. Therefore, in the field of civil aviation, whether adopting a monopoly policy or free enterprise, it must be subject to government supervision and control, and cannot allow unregulated free competition. Our country's civil aviation industry is developing relatively late, and the scale is initially established. In the future, should we adopt a policy that is somewhat monopolistic like the United Kingdom for civil aviation? Or should we follow the example of the United States, or refer to the policies of both the United Kingdom and the United States, and formulate a policy that is suitable for our country's national conditions? This is something that really needs to be considered.

Speaking of our country's industrial production and economic foundation, it cannot be compared with the United States, so the American system cannot be fully adopted in the operation of air transport. However, our country has a vast territory, and land and water transportation is inconvenient, so the operation of private air transport cannot be said to be useless to the country and the people. Judging from the frequent flights operated by Dahua Aviation Company since its operation, it can be seen that it is not without demand. Currently, there are only two civil aviation companies in our country, and most of the air transport routes they operate are the same. What we need to decide now is whether to let China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) exclusively operate our country's civil air transport? Or, in addition to these two companies, should we also allow other companies to operate air transport to encourage progress through competition? If a monopoly protection policy is adopted, then the relevant departments' issuance of a license to Dahua Company in the past should be held responsible for the mistake. If an open policy is adopted, then strict control must be exercised on the approval of routes and the setting of fares, and the Legislative Yuan should promptly determine regulations. Our country's civil aviation industry is just beginning, and we hope that the government can adopt appropriate policies for civil aviation, maintain this emerging industry, and avoid delays and hesitation, so that young people who are enthusiastic about aviation will not be confused.

Advocating Just Diplomacy

At the stage when the Paris Peace Conference entered its seventh week, our representative Yu Junji declared in the Italian Economic Committee that although Italy had obtained huge amounts of reparations from our country after the so-called Boxer Rebellion in 1900, our country was unwilling to seek compensation for this war from Italy. The issue of compensation for the losses suffered by our country in the war against Italy will be resolved through negotiations between China and Italy. Yu also reviewed the issue of compensation, urging all countries seeking compensation not to make compensation demands that exceed Italy's ability to pay. Because today's enemy is tomorrow's friend; if excessive compensation is demanded from the conquered, it will cause their collapse, which is certainly not the way to world peace. "We must have a long-term vision to win peace." This statement is sufficient to reflect our national spirit of benevolence and tolerance, which is unanimously agreed by the people of the whole country. The Chinese people have always treated others with loyalty and forgiveness, and do not haggle over gains and losses; the abandonment of demanding reparations is the best manifestation of our national virtues.

The same spirit is not only reflected in the abandonment of reparations demands from Italy, but also in the overall attitude of our country towards the defeated countries. On the eve of his departure from Paris, Foreign Minister Wang told visiting reporters, "Peace cannot last unless it is based on justice, and justice means that all weak countries and defeated countries should be treated fairly." Regarding our country's attitude towards defeated Japan, Wang stated frankly: "China does not believe in a policy of revenge. China provides assistance to Japanese democrats and allows them to consolidate their position." From the statements of Foreign Minister Wang and Representative Yu Junji, it can be seen that our foreign policy is based on justice and originates from benevolence. All of this is the lofty ideal of our country, and it is indeed a matter of gratification that our foreign policy can be consistent with the spirit of our country.

Indeed, in the current international situation, suspicion and doubt have become a widespread phenomenon; even the victorious countries are only focused on fostering and supporting their own interests in preparation for future troubles. In fact, after two great disasters, despite the invention of the atomic bomb, there has been no significant improvement in ideological consciousness. As an ancient country with a rich culture, we may not be able to catch up with others in terms of material production, but how can we be content to lag behind in the recognition of spiritual values? The advocacy of "just diplomacy" is almost like a voice in an empty valley in today's era of power worship; but if we look at it from a long-term perspective, how can diplomacy without justice win lasting peace? In today's world, we need more advocacy and practice of "just diplomacy." Only in this way can we save humanity from the future disaster of war.

### Achieving China's Peaceful Unification and Maintaining the Open Door Policy: Wallace Elaborates on U.S. Foreign Policy, Based on Understanding and Coordination with the Soviet Union

[Central News Agency, New York, December 12] U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace recently stated in a speech here that for the sake of world peace and the interests of the Soviet Union, world peace requires China to maintain a transcendent position, standing outside any sphere of influence, both politically and economically. We insist that in China, as in the entire world, the door to trade and economic development opportunities must be fully opened. Continuing to speak on China, Wallace reiterated the United States' hope for a united government, stating that unless there is a unified and peaceful China, built on the cooperation of all groups in the country and based on a policy of non-interference, the open door to trade and economic development opportunities in China is meaningless. His words are open to various interpretations.

Wallace's speech tonight was not entirely to the liking of some left-wing and progressive liberal elements, especially the Communist Party, because Wallace also made sharp remarks about the political activities of the Communist Party in the United States, South America, and Western Europe. Wallace stated that the Soviet Union does not need to incite local Communist Parties in Western Europe, South America, and the United States, just as we do not interfere in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. He stated in his speech that the Soviet Union should stop spreading its communist form, which must, even if necessary, defeat democratic countries by force. At the same time, we should turn a deaf ear to those among us who want us to believe that the Soviet Union's communism and our free enterprise system cannot coexist and prosper. He further warned that the Soviet Union must know that we are not planning a war against the Soviet Union, and we are certain that the Soviet Union is not expanding its territory or ruling the world through communist parties around the world. It is said that Wallace's remarks against the Soviet Union and the Communist Party were intended as a propaganda attack by the Republican Party on the Democratic government's appeasement of the Soviet Union.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, December 13] U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace, in a speech at a meeting of the Independent Professional Committee here, advocated that the United States adopt an impartial foreign policy. He stated that New York Governor Dewey recently made a speech advocating Anglo-American defense, but I think it is not so. The United States should not rely on the atomic bomb and conclude a military alliance with the United Kingdom. Anyone who relies on atomic warfare will sooner or later suffer from it. British imperialism in the Near East and the Soviet Union's retaliation policy will lead the United States directly into the vortex of war. Unless the United States formulates its own clear and realistic policy, it can be avoided. The price of peace cannot be estimated in gold yuan. The United States should send technicians and release credit loans to assist the industrialization of other countries, especially China and India. The United States' current protectionist trade policy is inappropriate. In terms of relations with the Soviet Union, it is unwise to befriend the former Axis powers on the one hand and haggle with the Soviet Union on the other. Some reactionary elements once firmly believed in the victory of the Axis powers. At this moment, they express friendship to the United States, but these people are still working hard to cultivate war between the United States and the Soviet Union. These people do not truly welcome the United States, but only want to make the United States and the Soviet Union destroy each other. We must recognize that the United States does not care about Eastern European affairs, just as the Soviet Union does not care about Latin American affairs. A policy of understanding and coordination with the Soviet Union should be the basis of U.S. foreign policy.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, December 13] President Truman declared yesterday that he basically agreed with the spirit of Wallace's speech, advocating respect for the Soviet Union, and that Wallace's views did not conflict with the policies promoted by Secretary of State Byrnes.

### London Expresses Deep Surprise at Wallace's Speech

[United Press, Washington, December 13] President Truman announced today that he fully agreed with Secretary of Commerce Wallace's speech on foreign policy in New York, and that its content did not contradict the views of Secretary of State Byrnes. However, diplomatic authorities here have speculated that the speech will have far-reaching effects. The focus of attention in diplomatic circles is Wallace's advocacy of frankly acknowledging the existence of U.S. and Soviet spheres of influence, and seeking to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union on this basis.

[This Newspaper] London, December 13 broadcast: A British Foreign Office spokesman expressed deep surprise at U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace's speech, and the fact that President Truman apparently agreed with Wallace's views was noteworthy. The spokesman did not understand what kind of interpretation should be given to Wallace's so-called "British imperialism." At a time when Britain recognizes India's independence and British troops are withdrawing from Iran as scheduled, there is no possibility of war between Britain and the Soviet Union.

### Wartime Military Cooperation Between Britain and the United States Remains Unchanged

[United Press, London, December 12] Radio Moscow broadcast today an article by Rear Admiral Khuvit of the Red Army Navy in Pravda, saying that "the superiority of the American Navy incites American aggressors to tend towards far-reaching expansion plans, and what these people preach is a policy of force.

### Improvement in US Labor-Management Relations: West Coast Seamen End Slowdown, Truman Authorizes Steelman to Mediate, Some New York Truck Drivers Return to Work

[Reuters, New York, 13th] Labor Secretary Schwellenbach’s special representative, Feinsinger, announced: The strike of seamen belonging to the West Coast Labor Association has ended. The slowdown stopped after shipowners guaranteed that recently collectively bargained wage increases would take effect immediately. A spokesman for the Industrial Organizations Congress Seafarers Union in San Francisco said: Seamen belonging to the union will strike from midnight onwards, seeking the same treatment as seamen in the West Coast Labor Association. In addition, the Seafarers International Union’s members are still continuing their slowdown. Earlier reports stated that, although the White House suggested a solution, all striking seamen voted to continue the slowdown until the government guaranteed that wage increases negotiated with shipowners were approved.

[US Information Service, Washington, 12th] White House Press Secretary Ross said today that President Truman has authorized Economic Stabilization Director Steelman to handle the seamen's labor dispute.

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] The White House today bypassed the Wage Stabilization Board and proposed its own solution to the seamen's labor dispute. The demands of the striking seamen of the American Federation of Labor will be fully approved. However, it remains questionable how long the labor dispute will continue. Some shipowners have not yet expressed their position, and the Industrial Organizations Congress Seafarers Union is also vowing to obtain the same treatment as the American Federation of Labor seamen. These are all obstacles to an early return to work.

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Two developments today have reduced the severity of the labor disputes in the United States: (1) A portion of the 30,000 truck drivers in New York, who have been slowing down for twelve days demanding wage increases and shorter working hours, have resumed work today following a union order. New York Mayor O'Dwyer said that leaders of the three unions have assured him that trucks from the four major food wholesalers and one transportation company will be ordered back to work. (2) Meanwhile, Economic Stabilization Director Steelman today consulted with the Wage Stabilization Board on the matter of raising the wages of 500,000 seamen. White House Press Secretary Ross said that Steelman has the power to decide whether to maintain wage stabilization or reject the seamen's decision to increase wages. Steelman's decision, after approval by President Truman, will be effective.

### Arab Nations Firmly Oppose Partition of Palestine, Three Arab Political Elders Meet to Seek Compromise Solution

[Reuters, London, 12th] In today’s two closed sessions of the Palestine Conference, representatives of the Arab nations firmly opposed Britain’s plan for autonomy of the Palestinian provinces. After lengthy debate, no concessions were made. In the next phase of the conference, Arab representatives will present their plan for Palestine in detail. It is expected that the continued implementation of the 1939 British Government White Paper policy, namely, the complete cessation of Jewish immigration to Palestine, will be the minimum demand of the Arab peoples. British Foreign Secretary Bevin did not attend the second meeting today, but he reviewed the opinions expressed by the Arab representatives in the Foreign Office. He will present a response when the conference resumes next Monday.

[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 12th] It is reported that three senior Arab politicians departed today for Baghdad to engage in negotiations to find a solution that could make the London Conference successful. King Abdullah of Transjordan has departed for Iraq, where he is said to be meeting with former Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri and Arab Executive Committee member Hilmi. This discussion will be based on the independence of the Palestinian Arabs, while also recognizing some Jewish territorial rights. If the three can reach an agreement on basic policy, a treaty can be established between Iraq, Transjordan, and the Arabs of Palestine to form a coalition, which could open a path for the London Conference.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] It has just been learned that Britain has decided to recognize the Arab League as a diplomatic entity and has invited it to send diplomatic representatives.

### Zhao Zukang Reports on Public Works: "Emergency System" Implemented in the Past Year

The Shanghai City Senate held its seventh meeting this morning, where Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang reported on the Public Works Bureau's policies. He stated that the bureau is responsible for eight types of projects: roads, ditches, houses, parks, bridges, docks, rivers, and dikes. In the year since taking over, he felt that both the quantity and quality were insufficient. The city's roads are about 1,000 kilometers long, with more than 300 kilometers being asphalt roads and the rest being cinder and gravel roads. Their quality and pavement height are not up to standard. According to the municipal construction regulations promulgated by the central government, the road area should account for 20% of the city's area. Shanghai's total area is 890 square kilometers. According to the central government's regulations, the road area should be increased tenfold. In terms of ditches, the total length of sewage and rainwater ditches should be 1,800 kilometers, which is also insufficient. In terms of housing, Shanghai has more than 4 million people and 700,000 households. The city should have at least 500,000 to 600,000 houses to be sufficient, but there are only 300,000 to 400,000 houses now. During the Anti-Japanese War, more than 30,000 houses in Nanshi and Zhabei were destroyed, making the quantity even more insufficient. In terms of parks, the city currently has 14 parks, covering an area of ​​about 1,000 acres, which should also be increased at least tenfold based on the population and city area. In terms of bridges, Shanghai has a total of 670 bridges, with more than 200 important ones, but there are no bridges on the Huangpu River. Most of the docks are owned by private individuals and foreign merchants, while the municipal government only owns more than 20 docks. Rivers are divided into four levels, with the first level being the Huangpu River, Suzhou Creek, and Yunzao Creek, and the second level having 16 rivers. In terms of dikes, the western dike from Qiujiang Wharf north to Binshan is safe, while the eastern dike from Caotou'an at the mouth of the Huangpu River to Huangjiawan in Chuansha County is mostly collapsed. In short, the quantity of public works projects in this city is insufficient, and the destruction was even greater after eight years of occupation. The difficulties of the bureau's work are: 1. Lack of organization of ditches and roads. 2. Too much destruction. 3. Incomplete drawings. 4. Lack of technicians. 5. Difficulty in purchasing materials. 6. Limited funding.

As for the implementation of work in the past year, in general, what has been done is the four words "emergency system," meaning the projects that need to be done urgently in engineering and the establishment of various basic systems in public works, based on the past situation, and hoping that the Senate will assist the Public Works Bureau in increasing funding, etc.

### Public Works Bureau Staff Have Corrupt Behavior, Delaying the Issuance of Licenses and Soliciting "Facilitation Fees," Senators Raise Questions One After Another

As soon as Director Zhao finished his report, Senator Zhao Yangxiong raised two questions: (1) "Regarding the housing shortage, I remember Director Zhao promising in the Provisional Senate to build 3,000 public housing units, with the required funds advanced by the Farmers Bank. But today, one year later, only 145 units have been built, which is too far from the number of 3,000. At that time, Director Zhao planned to order more mobile homes from abroad. How many have been purchased now? Where have they been erected? (2) Regarding the problem of water accumulation on roads, once there is heavy rain in this city, the lower-lying roads become swamps. This city is an international metropolis, which is really undignified, and it is especially inconvenient for citizens. Therefore, drainage projects must overcome all difficulties and be completed in the short term." He also requested the rapid removal of obstacles left by the enemy in Nanshi and other places. Senator Zhao's standard Mandarin was crisp and pleasant to listen to, and his questions received applause from the entire audience. Jin Hongxiang began to speak, denouncing the bureau chiefs for pushing the blame for matters that should have been done but were not done to economic difficulties. Senator Jin said that things depend on people's efforts. Dr. Sun Yat-sen founded the Republic of China, and Chairman Chiang led the war of resistance. The difficulties and hardships are self-evident. The lack of funds was originally conceivable, but it was eventually achieved. He hoped that future reports would mention less economic difficulties. Senator Jin finished speaking, and the entire audience applauded to show their support. Following this, Ma Shaoquan and Sun Zhenchun raised questions that in today's serious housing shortage, the Public Works Bureau not only does not provide convenience to the real estate industry to build houses, but also creates difficulties everywhere. Ma cited an example saying: On the empty lot at the intersection of Linsen Middle Road and Jianguo Road, the owner of the land, a real estate company, has designed and built more than 30 houses. After the drawings were sent to the bureau for revision, the building permit was only issued after six weeks. Because construction is time-sensitive, being delayed by the Public Works Bureau for six weeks means that the entire project cannot be completed this year. There are many similar situations. There are some who have not been issued permits for nine weeks. Looking back at the former concession period, after reviewing the design drawings, the permit could be issued in a maximum of two weeks. Now, the staff of the Public Works Bureau intentionally delay the issuance of permits, and their intentions are very suspicious. Senator Sun added that when the Public Works Bureau issues construction permits, there is corrupt behavior such as soliciting "facilitation fees." The entire audience expressed great concern about this shocking statement.

### Reports from Various Bureaus Are Not Candid Enough

Senator Fei Shusheng, a cadre of the Shanghai Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, made a statement of感想 before asking questions, saying: "The reports from the bureau chiefs are not candid enough." He asked four questions: (1) The Public Works Bureau should have a concrete plan for repairing roads and flood control projects and complete them within a limited time. (2) Is there any corruption among the staff in the bureau? If so, how will it be dealt with? (3) Zhongzheng Middle Road (formerly Avenue Foch) has been repaired, but it was damaged again after being washed away by rain. Is there any malfeasance in the construction? (4) The housing shortage is so serious, please investigate whether there is any manipulation, etc. Senator Chen Linsheng spoke on behalf of the suburban citizens, requesting that the road surface and bridges on Pudong Avenue be repaired as soon as possible, and saying: "The current municipal authorities ignore the suburbs and only focus on the former concession area. However, the suburban area is 700 times the size of the former concession area, and the residents account for one-third of the city's population. The construction of the suburbs is at least 50 years behind the former concession area. I hope that the municipal authorities will pay more attention to the suburban construction in the future." Roads Directorate Ma Junshuo asked questions about public housing, (1) There is a lot of public land in the city government, so why is the recently built public housing built in remote areas? (2) According to estimates, each unit is worth a maximum of 2 million yuan, why is it sold for 3 million yuan? Can it be rented out? In summary, the main points of the senators' questions can be divided into: (1) housing shortage and public housing, (2) road construction, (3) road drainage projects, (4) suburban transportation. The senators' questions were very enthusiastic. Due to limited time, Speaker Pan announced the suspension of questioning at 11:25 am and asked Director Zhao to answer the previously asked questions first.

### Director Zhao Answers One by One

Director Zhao immediately stepped onto the podium and answered one by one, saying: "The drainage plan has been formulated. Part of the Fahua Creek has been dredged. Currently, the Xu Jiahui drainage area south of Fahua Creek is under construction. However, funds are difficult, and prices are high. One meter of cement pipe is worth 250,000 yuan. The total length of the city's ditches is 590 kilometers, so repairing even a small part of it is very expensive. Road resurfacing is also limited by machinery, materials, and technicians, and we cannot do whatever we want. The original price of public housing is only 1.48 million yuan per unit, plus elementary school (a school is attached to the public housing area), roadbed, water and electricity, and other ancillary projects. The total cost is 2.28 million yuan per unit on average. If the second batch is built again, it may not be possible without 3 million yuan. Therefore, it was passed by the Municipal Council that the price per unit is set at 3 million yuan. Temporary projects in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas have now begun to be sorted out, but the basic projects must wait until the route plan is coordinated with the urban design before construction can begin. As for the obstacles in the Nanshi and other areas, the garrison headquarters instructed that they be temporarily delayed for demolition. As for the construction permit, it is issued by the competent department and competent section. If there is no land ownership dispute and the route design is not a problem, the permit can be issued. If there is corruption or other circumstances, please report it, and it will be dealt with severely. In the past, two staff members committed fraud and were immediately dismissed." He also said that the Caobang Bridge will be completed within half a month, the Shanxi Road Bridge will be repaired first, and the Fujian Road Bridge will be postponed. Finally, he said that the bureau's current policies are emergency and institutional. Emergency is the target of the target, and the system is the basis of the basis. He also hoped that the Senate would provide more supervision. Director Zhao finished his answer and it was noon at 12:00. Speaker Pan announced the adjournment of the meeting.

### Public Utilities Bureau Policy Report: Zhao Zengjue Describes Six Points in Detail

Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue reported on the policies implemented between April and August of this year, divided into six items: electricity, water supply, gas, transportation, telephone, and ferries. He proposed how to eliminate the possible electricity panic between October of this year and January of next year, solve the water supply difficulties in West Shanghai, increase the gas supply, control the traffic in the central district, add telephones in various districts, and purchase more ferries, etc.

Electricity Problem

Electricity is the source of power for all of Shanghai and is of deep concern to all citizens. Before the war, Shanghai's electricity reached 260,000 kilowatts. After the war, all of Pudong was lost, Zhabei and Nanshi lost 70%, and the foreign electricity company lost 25%. When it was taken over last year, there was a sense of electricity panic. Foreign and Zhabei power plants are actively repairing, but the machines sent to the United States for repair will not be completed until February next year due to the impact of the American strike. Currently, two-thirds of Shanghai's electricity is supplied to industrial users, with the most supplied to textile mills. The future plan is to complete the Greater Shanghai Ring Power Grid, and everything will be standardized. Regarding the adjustment of electricity prices, the uniformity of the city is a mistake. Because in the future, Shanghai Electric Power Company, French Electric Power Company, Zhabei, and Pudong Electric Power Company will all generate electricity separately. Because the conditions are not uniform, the electricity prices should not be the same. At present, the national electricity price is the lowest in Shanghai.

Water Supply Problem

The West Shanghai area is currently the most serious, because the number of houses and factories in West Shanghai has more than doubled compared to before the war. The Public Utilities Bureau is actively preparing to establish a West Shanghai water plant.

Gas Problem

The British Gas Company supplies 3.5 million cubic feet per month, which is used by about 20,000 households, but it is still not enough. The solution is to tighten the amount of usage and purchase high-quality coal with strong volatility. At present, the gas company not only supplies gas, but also supplies coke and asphalt. In the future, if foreign coal is used, the gas price may need to be adjusted. The Technical Committee is planning to set up a high-pressure gas network, which will be completed within five years.

Transportation Problem

The transportation problem in the central district is extremely difficult and cannot be solved by plans in the office. The crux of the problem must be studied on the ground. Solving the traffic in the central district requires solving the transportation problems in other districts at the same time. I hope that the Senate will help solve the traffic difficulties in the central district. On sunny days, 65% of Shanghainese walk on the road, which is about 2.7 million people. 1,600 public vehicles are needed to solve the transportation problem, but currently there are only a quarter of them. The current plan focuses on opening up north-south traffic, and the routes must be average, passing through both busy and remote areas. Trams and buses are integrated.

Telephone Problem

At present, the Ministry of Communications' Telecommunications Bureau manages the telephones in Nanshi, Hongkou, Zhabei, and the city center, while the labyrinthine telephones in the old two concessions are operated by the American Telephone Company, so communication is sometimes difficult. Shanghai needs a highly efficient telephone network. Now, the Telephone Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, and the American Telephone Company have each sent two people to form a committee (convened by Director Zhao) to discuss the city's telephone problems. It was decided to divide the area within a 10-kilometer radius of the North Station into four zones. In the future, the central district telephone numbers will be changed to six digits.

Ferry Problem

Before the war, there were a total of 14 ferries, but currently there are only 8, and one is under repair. The number of people taking ferries per month is 1.2 million, while before the war it was only 500,000. Therefore, the order is poor. It is planned to expand the ferry business in an enterprise manner, organize a ferry company, and cooperate with truck transportation to build warehouses in Pudong and promote Pudong.

Finally, Director Zhao said: If foreign exchange is used to acquire foreign public utility enterprises, it will only increase the consumption of foreign exchange. Foreign businessmen will use this fund to set up factories in Japan, Hong Kong, India, and other places, which will not benefit our country.

[Report from This Newspaper] Regarding the two proposals submitted by the mayor to increase house donations and hold municipal donations, the third review committee preliminarily resolved the previous day to levy municipal donations instead of increasing house donations. According to reporters' further solicitation of opinions from some senators yesterday, Senator Zhu Wende believes that municipal donations are modeled after the methods of the former工部局era. He does not object to the levy of municipal donations, but it is worth considering whether it is appropriate to use the old method. Senators Chen Cunren and Yang Fusheng expressed their opinion on municipal donations: If the government does use them for municipal construction and has a concrete plan, then they do not object to the levy. Senators Zhao Diqun and Zhang Yiqu also opposed increasing house donations, because it is easy to stimulate prices and affect the entire lives of citizens. But creating a levy on municipal donations, because municipalities contain construction, is an obligation that citizens should fulfill.

Senators Su Shuxiong and Wang Weiyu advocated increasing house donations. Their main reason is that house donations are direct taxes, the collection procedures are convenient, and they can make the rich pay more and the poor pay less. Shen Ding's opinion: If you want to increase donations and taxes, you must clarify their purpose. The city government's overspending is mostly personnel expenses, so how should the staffing be? The city government must first determine this so that we know, and the work plan must also be taken out first for future verification.

### Receiving Tap Water Requires "National Currency" to Pave the Way; Zhao Zengjue Responds to Interpellations, Further Investigation Pending

After the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Zhao Zengjue, finished his report, the oral interpellations began. Due to time constraints, those who did not have time to interpellate were postponed to this morning. The interpellation by Ma Shaoquan regarding the installation of tap water was the most remarkable. In order to solve the housing shortage, Mr. Ma built a new house and requested to connect the tap water, but after three weeks, there were still no results. Initially, Mr. Ma's friend told him that everything in Shanghai is based on "business acumen" and that "national currency" must be used to pave the way. Mr. Ma had no choice but to spend 200,000 yuan in tips, but after three weeks, the connection was still not completed. Moreover, it is said that if you don't pay a tip, when calculating the cost of connecting the water pipes, they often take a big detour. In fact, the water pipe could be connected near Jike Mountain, but the result is that it costs more and takes longer. In addition to questioning, Mr. Ma also stated that the delay in official matters only increases the opportunity for extortion. He also asked if it was possible to connect the water pipe within five hours. Director Zhao's response was very brief, saying that the procedures for requesting the installation of tap water were extremely complicated. As for the detailed actual situation, he will provide a written response after investigation, and he will pay special attention to it in the future.

Zhong Yuliang questioned: The No. 6 municipal ferry has been under repair for ten months, and it has not been repaired yet. I don't know when it can be repaired or when it can operate. What are the chief engineers, deputy engineers, trainee engineers, and engineers doing? The response was: This ship was received from the navy. All the internal machinery was missing. After a newspaper advertisement, it was found at the Jiangnan Shipyard. However, there were many missing parts. Because it was made in Germany, it was difficult to purchase them, so they all had to be made in-house, which took a lot of time. As for personnel, it is roughly the same as before the war, but the business side has been reduced by eight people. The technical side has only increased by eight people.

Tao Guangchuan asked: (1) The lights in the Nanshi area are very dim. Can they be improved? (2) Every night after 10 pm and before 6 am, the Nanshi telephone often cannot be connected for one or two hours. How can it be improved? (3) How to solve the crowding and disorder on trams and buses? (4) It is difficult to install telephones. Can more public telephones be set up, or can more private telephone extensions be added? (5) The authorities have decided to ban rickshaws in two years. What plans are there for future transportation? Director Zhao replied: We are striving for a rational solution to the telephone problem in Nanshi. The telephones in that area are managed by the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation. The Ministry of Transportation and the municipal government are on an equal footing, and the municipal government can only notify them at any time and has no right to manage them. The crowding of public vehicles will gradually be resolved. The poor order is indeed due to the fact that armed comrades do not abide by the rules, which has greatly affected good people. I sincerely hope that the senators will make more appeals in terms of public opinion. Regarding the ban on rickshaws, it is a central government order. There is already an official document reaching the municipal government, saying that if the ban is not implemented after October, it will be considered disobedience.

### Automobile Licenses · Employees Accepting Bribes

Zhang Zhi inquired: The newspaper reported that in order to develop the city's transportation, the Public Utilities Bureau ordered forty buses from overseas. After they arrived, they were not suitable and needed to be modified, but the modification cost exceeded the price of the cars, so they bought new cars instead. Who should be responsible for this, and how is it being resolved now? It is also rumored that lower-level employees of the Public Utilities Bureau accepted bribes and removed some fake automobile license cards so that cars purchased from the puppet regime could be re-registered. Were the automobile license cards complete when the Public Utilities Bureau took over? The response was: The Public Utilities Bureau did not order buses from abroad. We are paying close attention to automobile license matters. Please report any illegal activities. If there is any illegality, we will definitely deal with it severely. At the same time, we will severely punish corruption and reward integrity. Shanghai is a society with money and power. Some people use money and power to induce others. Please pay more attention to it.

Lu Shidao inquired: The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company can now generate more than 4,000 kilowatts. It is said that it has a contract with the Shanghai Electric Power Company to return half of the electricity generated to that company. The remaining 2,000 kilowatts, in addition to being used for public purposes and factories directly related to people's livelihood, can still have more than 1,500 kilowatts left. According to the regulations of the Industrial Electricity Review Committee (chaired by Director Zhao), it should be distributed equally to various private factories. Now it is said that all of it has been allocated to the Tianli Nitrous Gas Factory, and more than 130 other factories have not received any. What is the legal basis for this? The response was: Zhabei Water and Electricity generates 4,700 kilowatts, of which 700 kilowatts are for self-use, and 2,000 kilowatts are returned to the Shanghai Electric Power Company according to the contract. The rest is allocated to the Central Printing Factory, the Central Mint, the Fuxin Flour Mill, etc., totaling 1,147 kilowatts. As for the Tianli Nitrous Gas Factory, other solutions need to be found.

### Trams Not Stopping at Stations · Urge the Company to Pay Attention

Senator Zhai stated: I have a few simple questions: (1) Ask the military police to help remove and correct armed comrades who do not obey the rules on trams. (2) The current tram stations are extremely inconvenient for passengers. (3) Trams do not stop at stations. (4) The progressive telephone charging system is unreasonable. The response was: The tram stations will be investigated, and the tram companies will be urged to pay attention to trams not stopping at stations. The progressive telephone charging system aims to discourage excessive and unnecessary calls.

Other interpellations are briefly described below: The tram preparation office of the Public Utilities Bureau plans to supplement and improve the unreasonable situation of the city's transportation. The British-owned trolleybuses have ninety vehicles that cannot be used because they lack rubber tires. Twenty French-owned buses are expected to arrive by the end of October. The Public Utilities Bureau will add one bus route every month.

### Alternate Senators Request Permission to Speak · The Ministry of Interior Replies by Telegram, Denying the Request

Before holding this session of the Municipal Council, the Municipal Council received letters from more than ten alternate senators, including Yang Zhiqian, requesting to attend and speak. Because this request did not comply with the central government's regulations, the council telegraphed the Ministry of Interior for instructions. The Ministry of Interior recently replied by telegram, stating that it should be handled according to the original regulations and denying the request. The Ministry of Interior's telegram is copied below: "Shanghai Municipal Council, your telegram has been received. It should be handled in accordance with the original interpretation of the Yuan telegram. Ministry of Interior, Minjia Seal."

### Education and Social Affairs Bureau to Report on Policy Implementation Today

[Report from this newspaper] On the agenda of the Municipal Council today, the morning session will feature a report by Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau (Director Gu Yuxiu is in Europe), and the afternoon session will feature a report by Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau. In addition to senators' interpellations and bureau directors' responses during today's session, Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau will continue to respond to unfinished interpellations. Five representatives will also be elected to participate in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui receiving work inspection team.

### Recover the Racecourse · Rebuild as a Cultural City · Proposals by Feng Youzhen and Zhao Junhao · Property Rights Issues · The Assembly Has Requested the Land Bureau to Investigate

The racecourse issue has become a focus of interest for the Municipal Council. It is expected that when the case is brought to the assembly for discussion, a fierce debate will occur. According to a reporter's inquiry: Senators Feng Youzhen and Zhao Junhao, produced by the Journalists Association, proposed to the assembly yesterday to recover all real estate of the racecourse and rebuild it as a Shanghai Cultural City. They suggested that all the buildings and grounds of the racecourse be taken over by the city and rebuilt into a meaningful cultural center, called Shanghai Cultural City, in order to establish a century-long plan for the development and construction of Shanghai. First, a Shanghai Cultural City Construction Committee will be established, with several members recommended by the Municipal Council and well-known Chinese and foreign figures invited to jointly plan it. The city will be divided into three parts: (1) The Municipal Council will be established. (2) A cultural center will house all cultural and academic groups in the city, such as libraries, museums, revolutionary historical materials exhibition halls, as well as the Journalists Association, the Municipal Education Association, cultural and artistic groups, opera houses, etc. (3) A square will be opened as Roosevelt Stadium to commemorate the great achievements of the late US President Roosevelt, so that citizens can have a place to exercise their bodies. It is said that dozens of senators have jointly signed their support for the proposal.

In addition, the issue of restoring horse racing in Shanghai, submitted by Mayor Wu for discussion, has attracted much attention from all sectors. The discussion in the Municipal Council is very heated and has not yet been decided. However, in order to understand the true situation of the property rights of the racecourse, the Municipal Council has specifically sent a letter to the Municipal Government's Land Administration Bureau for a thorough investigation and response, as a reference for discussing the horse racing issue.

### Police Chief Tang Zong Visited a Fire Drill Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] After inspecting various departments of the Municipal Police Bureau the day before, Police Chief Tang Zong visited a fire drill by the Fire Department last night. The location was in front of the Municipal Government gate on Jiangxi Road. First, police officers stood guard around the area. Then, Ye Binyong, Section Chief of the Fire Department, arranged everything and diligently greeted reporters, explaining the situation of the Fire Department in detail. At about 7:50 pm, Chief Tang arrived accompanied by Yu Shuping, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, and Zhou Zhaoxiang, Director of the Fire Department. The performance then began. First, three Pu Fire Engines came from the south on Jiangxi Road and drove to the destination. Then, two ladder trucks, two scaling ladder, two lighting trucks, one ambulance, one rescue truck, and one hose truck arrived one after another. Firefighters came and went like weaving, each doing their own job, or climbing the ladder to a height of one hundred and ten feet. Seven searchlights illuminated the area as if it were daytime. Meanwhile, police officers held huge water hoses and sprayed water to extinguish the fire on the second floor of the Municipal Government. A house was set up on the side of the road, and the interior was filled with smoke. Actors tried to open the windows, and police officers wearing smoke hoods entered through the windows and rescued the person who had fainted inside, carrying them onto the ambulance and driving them to the hospital for treatment. The police officers were well-trained and moved quickly. At 8:10 pm, the wonderful performance came to an end.

### Regulations on Housing Leasing Management · Compulsory Enforcement After Mediation Fails

Ma Junshuo Believes There is a Flaw in the Division of Judicial Power

[Report from this newspaper] During this period of severe housing shortage, there are many disputes between landlords and tenants. Therefore, the Municipal Government has specially formulated a new regulation called "Regulations on Housing Leasing Management," which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. It was also submitted to the tenth group of the Municipal Council for review the day before. According to Senator Ma Junshuo, the review committee will conduct a serious study of the case, because the regulations mention that the Municipal Government can enforce compulsory enforcement after mediation fails. In fact, according to the law, this point has a flaw in the division of judicial power. The right of enforcement belongs to the judicial organ, and the administrative organ has no right to enforce it. These regulations are currently planned to be trialed in Nanjing for one year, but the situations in Shanghai and Nanjing are different. Since the Municipal Council has the right to review the Municipal Government's regulations, it is necessary to consider these regulations.

### The Assembly Passed a Resolution · Decided to Participate in the Investigation Team · The Number of People Caused an Increase to Five

[Report from this newspaper] The problem of "participating in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui receiving work investigation team," which had been causing disagreements among the senators for days, was finally resolved by a two-thirds vote at yesterday's session. Of the 138 senators, 115 voted to participate. Before the vote, Speaker Pan first reported that Zhang Zhiben, the leader of the investigation team, had seen in the newspaper that he was to be consulted, so he rushed over without waiting for the telegram to be sent. After the speaker contacted him, he decided to extend the working period to the end of the month. At the same time, he could invite three senators to participate.

Then Zhuang He's opinion received a round of warm applause. He said: The general public has great expectations for us. If we don't participate, how can we avoid disappointing the public? If we have a way to avoid disappointing the public, then it doesn't matter if we don't participate. As for the selection of personnel, if we want to participate, every senator is qualified, but those who have been involved in receiving work in the past year cannot participate. I myself am the Director of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Executive Committee, and I am also involved in receiving work, so I am not qualified to participate. The Municipal Party Committee itself is an institution being investigated. This brings us to Senator Feng's previous proposal to recommend Senator Zhan Wenhuxu from the press. I don't think it is appropriate, because Senator Zhan is a receiving personnel from the Central Propaganda Department. We should recommend someone who has no connection with receiving work.

Feng Youzhen thought it made sense, so he said that his previous proposal to recommend a lawyer, an accountant, and someone from the press has been formally overturned, since Senator Zhan is also one of the receiving personnel. Instead he proposed to invite Senator Zhao Junhao, who has never participated in any receiving work.

One wave subsided, and another wave rose. The senators had different views on the number of participants. He Yuanming and Zhang Zhongyuan and others advocated for five people to participate. Zhang Zhongyuan also said that there must be two people from the business community, but Jiang Huaisu felt that five people were not appropriate. Since the speaker had already agreed with team leader Zhang on three people, they would have to go back and ask again if he would agree.

At this time, the speaker spoke: If you must have five people, you can go back and ask again. At the same time, it is not stipulated that there must be accountants, lawyers, and people from the press. Anyone can be recommended. However, I want to ask one thing first: If team leader Zhang does not agree to five people, will we not participate at all? No one could answer this question definitively. Zhang Zhongyuan said this matter is very important, and three people are not enough. Zhang Zhihan insisted that people from the industrial and commercial sectors must be included.

The best way is to vote. As a result, sixty-seven people voted to send five representatives, and twenty-two people voted for three. But based on the number of people present, 130, sixty-seven votes did not pass half. Lu Shidao mentioned the organizational regulations and turned to the Shanghai Municipal Council Organizational Regulations, which clearly stipulate in Article 12: "The Municipal Council shall not open a meeting without the attendance of more than half of all senators, and no resolution shall be reached without the agreement of more than half of the senators present. If the number of votes for and against are the same, the chairman shall decide." This means that sixty-seven votes cannot decide.

Imperceptibly, the number of people at this meeting needed to be accurately counted. The secretariat staff became nervous and found that there were only 117 senators present. It turned out that 19 people had left midway. "Left midway"! Zhang Zhihan cleverly pointed out: "Article 6 of the draft rules of procedure specifies that leaving the meeting should be reported to the chairman, and the number of people who left should not be removed." The speaker also smiled and could only say, "Some people have asked me for leave, and some have not. Now people are gone, and there is no way." In the end, the supporters of five people won. But who to choose? Some people suggested that the speaker nominate the candidates to save trouble. But the speaker's opinion was: "There is not enough time today. It has been decided to issue ballots for election tomorrow." Before he finished speaking, all the senators applauded unanimously, representing a verbal "agreement."

### Six Peking Opera Theaters Prepare for a Charity Performance

The Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association has been established for more than two months. Various entertainment circles in the city have held a charity performance for the refugees in Northern Jiangsu. Now, six Peking Opera theaters, including Huangjin, Tianchan, Queen, Grand Stage, Gong Stage, and China, also plan to hold a charity performance each, or plan to jointly rehearse a charity opera by famous actors from various theaters for two days. The association has appointed a special commissioner to launch this activity, and the date will be set soon.

### US Soldier Steals Film · Russian Receives Stolen Goods

[Report from this newspaper] The commander of the US Naval Port requested the police bureau to arrest the suspects because the headquarters of Yangshupu had been repeatedly stolen of sixteen films and three film projectors. After investigation by Wang Chen, chief of the foreign affairs section, the case has been solved. The three main culprits are soldiers named Howard, Johnass, and Eddie. After interrogation, they confessed to the theft. The stolen goods had been sold to Holange, a 48-year-old Russian barber living at 921 Linsen Road, and Gudali, an engineer living at Room 104, 490 Albert Road, for a total of US$300 and US$500. The sales took place in front of the Bund Water Front Hotel. The three US soldiers have been handed over to the US military police for questioning. The two Russians will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office today on charges of receiving stolen goods.

### Ticket Seller Arrested for Wounding a Police Officer · British No. 12 Trolley Workers Go on Strike

[Report from this newspaper] Trolley No. 350, which runs from Jing'an Temple to Zhongshan Garden on Yuyuan Road, was driving near Zhongshan Garden at about 8 pm last night. The passengers were extremely crowded, and they were scrambling to board the car. Three inspectors from the Changning Road Sub-bureau, Zhang Desen, Wang Jigang, and Liu Qiyun, were all in plain clothes and also boarded the car with the crowd. Zhang and Wang got on first, and when Liu Qiyun was about to step onto the car, the driver Teng Lisheng (No. 960) closed the iron door. Inspector Zhang told him that there was still one person and asked him to open it. Unexpectedly, the ticket seller Wang Guohua (No. 1185) opened and closed the door, crushing Liu's ankle, which caused a verbal dispute. The ticket seller Wang Guohua used the iron pliers for punching tickets to stab Liu's left eyebrow, piercing two holes. Zhang Desen was also stabbed in the arm by him with the iron pliers, taking off a piece of flesh. The three inspectors took the driver Teng Lisheng and the ticket seller Wang Guohua to the bureau for questioning. Afterwards, other No. 12 trolley workers went on strike upon hearing the news.

### German Spy Suspect Detained in Prison · Trial Opens in Defamation Case Against US Reporter

[Report from this newspaper] The United Press International (UPI) once published the war crimes committed by 22 German citizens and other Nazis in China, including Shen Ke. Shen Ke, who is being tried in a US military court for espionage, is currently detained in a Shanghai prison. This person recently filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai District Court, accusing Randall, the director of UPI's China branch, of intentional defamation. The District Court held a hearing at 4 pm yesterday. Yao, the attorney representing Shen, told Judge Wang Jiazhu that Randall had defamed his client's reputation by issuing a special article to Shanghai and foreign newspapers through UPI on April 16, which was published in the Shanghai China Press. Shen and Xin newspapers also carried this news. It stated that Shen Ke was sent to Chongqing by the secret activities of the Nazi Supreme Command to spy on the activities of underground workers in Chongqing in coastal cities, as well as the routes by which Americans and other United Nations personnel infiltrated free China. Attorney Yao claimed that his client could not only refute these accusations, but also prove that the news released by the defendant was groundless. He believes that Randall violated Articles 310, paragraph 1 and 2 of the Chinese Criminal Law. (Note: Articles 310, paragraph 1 and 2 stipulate a sentence of imprisonment of not less than two years, or a fine of not more than 1,000 legal tender.) Attorney Yao then presented a document, which he claimed was written by Chen Jie, the former Chinese ambassador to Germany and the current ambassador to Latin America, which recognized Shen Ke as a friend of China. He also said that he could present written or oral evidence from Jiang Bocheng and Wu Shaoshu, the leaders of the Chinese underground workers in the Shanghai area during the Japanese occupation, stating that Jiang and Wu had met with Shen Ke and discussed the situation at the time. At this point, Randall defended himself, saying that it was an insult to the court and himself that a national of a country that was hostile to both China and the United States dared to file a lawsuit in prison because an American reporter reported the official announcement of a US Army investigator. Randall presented an announcement issued by the US Army Memorial Department on April 15, which stated that Shen Ke ostensibly disguised himself as an anti-Hitler and pro-China journalist, but in fact he was a well-trained secret agent of the German Supreme Command. He exchanged information about the Japanese with some Chinese people for information about the distribution of Chinese troops. The fierce bombing of Chongqing was closely related to the reports provided to the Japanese by these Germans who were "loyal to both sides." Randall also presented another piece of evidence, a document issued by the Public Relations Group of the US Army Command in China, which pointed out that between May 8 and August 15, 1945, Shen Ke spied in Shanghai on US and Allied military operations and reported to the Japanese army. Randall asked the court to dismiss the case, but Judge Wang Jiazhu did not allow it and announced that the trial would be adjourned to September 23. Randall pointed out that the US military court will open the trial of Nazi secret activists next Monday, and he believes that Shen Ke may not be able to appear in court on September 23.

### News from the Meeting

Zhong Yuliang, the district head of District 31, was the most eye-catching and amusing figure in the council. This gentleman was bald, sported a Japanese-style mustache, wore a Hong Kong shirt and shorts, and his voice was so loud it could truly be described as "earth-shattering." Moreover, he was full of expression and gestures, looking left and right while speaking, sometimes tense, sometimes grinning. One moment he was shouting, the next he was whispering. It would be hard to find many people in the audience who didn't laugh. His speech was also extremely humorous. He said that there were so many engineers, yet they couldn't even fix a ferry. Weren't there many different titles for engineers, such as chief engineer, deputy engineer, assistant engineer, trainee engineer, engineer with a hat, engineer without a hat, and so on?

Ma Shaoquan said that he had good intentions to help solve the housing shortage and invested a lot of capital, preparing to build houses, but the Public Works Bureau delayed issuing a permit for six weeks. He asked the Public Utilities Bureau to connect tap water to the factory, but there was still no news after two months. Ma repeatedly said, "I'm unlucky." He said there were probably two reasons for the Bureau's delay: (1) it was intentional, in which case "national currency must pave the way," (2) there were not enough technical personnel.

The Public Works Bureau was very attentive and meticulous in distributing documents to the councilors. The most valuable of these was a copy of the latest Shanghai City Map for each person. This map was still rare in post-war Shanghai, measuring seven feet one inch in height and five feet in width. When opened, it resembled a large bedsheet.

Yesterday, at the Yiyuan venue, the electric fan on the right side malfunctioned, making it unbearably hot. Those seated on the right side all held various paper fans and waved them incessantly.

Over the five days of the meeting, Lu Huimin was the first female councilor to speak on the podium. Ms. Lu is a lawyer, so it's no wonder her speech was clear, organized, and composed.

When Councilor Zhai asked Zhao Zengjue, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, to explain why the telephone bill was initially set at 100 yuan per call and then increased by 200 yuan, Zhao repeatedly said, "Good, good, good, good, good!"

Zhao Yangxiong, the first person from the Public Works Bureau questioned yesterday morning, spoke fluent Mandarin. The second person, Jin Hongxiang, spoke standard Pudong dialect. Both were equally pleasing to the ear. One was fat, and the other was thin, creating a contrasting and amusing sight. Both received applause from the entire audience after their speeches.

### Xie Guansheng Discusses the Postponement of the Amnesty Case, the Reported Case of He Dehui Has Not Reached the Stage for Announcement, and the Transfer of Convicted Traitors from Various Places to Shanghai Facilitates Management, Expressing Satisfaction with Recent Inspections

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, when a reporter inquired with Minister of Judicial Administration Xie Guansheng about the case of He Dehui being reported as a suspected traitor, he replied that the Shanghai Municipal Government had solid evidence that the Ministry of Judicial Administration had conducted a detailed investigation of the case. However, he was not at liberty to say whether the case would be announced soon. He also stated that his trip had nothing to do with the He case. He had intended to come to Shanghai in March, but it had been delayed until now due to a lack of time because of official duties. Regarding the amnesty, Minister Xie stated that the Legislative Yuan had passed it, but it was currently postponed. The Ministry of Judicial Administration was awaiting orders and would proceed accordingly once received.

The reporter also asked Minister Xie for clarification on the phrase "one portion of the family's necessary living expenses must be retained" from the confiscated property of traitors. According to him, this was not a numerical issue, but rather a matter of circumstances. The court would consider the local social conditions and the number of family members of the offender when handling the matter.

Regarding the issue of transferring convicted traitors from Nanjing, Suzhou, and other places to Shanghai prisons for execution, Minister Xie stated that it was because Shanghai prisons were better equipped than those in other counties, making them easier to manage. The Ministry of Judicial Administration had already issued orders, and it would be implemented in the near future.

[Another Report] Minister of Judicial Administration Xie Guansheng, accompanied by Chief Advisor Chen Gumin and Advisor Ni Zhenyu of the ministry, continued to inspect the High Procuratorate on West Aixiangs Road, the District Procuratorate on Xuehuali Road, and the detention center of the District Court on Masinan Road at 10:00 AM yesterday. President of the District Court Cha Liangjian, Chief Prosecutor of the District Procuratorate Huang Liang, Chief Clerk Quan Tao, Chief Prosecutor of the High Procuratorate Du Baoqi, Warden of the Detention Center Tian Lixun, and Acting Warden Wang Mingxian accompanied him. Minister Xie inquired in detail about the recent work of each department, paying particular attention to the health and hygiene of the detainees. He left at 12:00 PM. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, he went to inspect the Shanghai Prison at Tilanqiao, accompanied by President of the High Court Guo Yunguan and Warden Xu Chongwen, touring the Zhong Jian (Loyalty Section), hospital, workshops, and women's prison. Later, he went to the First Criminal Division of the High Court, where Judge Cao Jun was hearing the case of Jiang Weicheng, suspected of being a traitor. After the Chief Prosecutor of the High Procuratorate, Du Baoqi, welcomed him to the temporary office, he rested briefly before leaving at 4:45 PM.

Yesterday, when the reporter asked Minister Xie about his impressions of inspecting the various judicial organs in Shanghai over the past two days, he replied that the prison facilities were very good, especially the old ones, and only needed to be further supplemented. He also said that the management and personnel aspects were still fairly satisfactory.

Minister Xie will inspect the military court and the Japanese war criminal detention center at 10:00 AM today. He will leave Shanghai tomorrow and travel to Suzhou to inspect the local legal organs. He will return to Shanghai on Monday and then go to Hangzhou.

### The District Court is Moving to the Former French Barracks; Negotiations with the French Side Are Underway

[Our Report] The Shanghai District Court currently shares an office with the High Court on North Zhejiang Road. Due to the limited space, which is insufficient, a request was previously made to the Executive Yuan to designate the Huangpu Police Branch Building as the new site for the District Court. However, due to many difficulties, this was not realized. Now, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has designated the former French barracks on Fuli Road as the new site for the District Court and the District Procuratorate. The current site on North Zhejiang Road will be used exclusively by the High Court and the High Procuratorate. At a little past 10:00 AM yesterday, Minister of Judicial Administration Xie Guansheng made a special trip to the French barracks to inspect them. The property rights belong to the former French Municipal Council, and according to the law, it should be taken over by the Municipal Government, but the French Consul-General in Shanghai is obstructing this in various ways, and negotiations are currently underway.

### The Manager of Yutong Salt Manufacturing Company Embezzles Funds; Accepts Over 20 Million Yuan in Payment for Goods and Uses it Privately for Lending and Purchasing Houses; He Will Be Handed Over to the District Procuratorate for Questioning Today

[Our Report] Li Xiaozhong, a retired Lieutenant General of the Army, 58 years old, from Shandong Province, residing at No. 356 Wusong Road, was introduced by a friend in March of this year to order 2,000 dan of edible salt from Yutong Salt Manufacturing Company at No. 2, Lane 335, Yanping Road. The price of the salt, including freight, tariffs, and miscellaneous items, totaled 25.8 million yuan. After both parties signed the contract, Li paid the full amount to Wu Gengxin (also known as Zhi Mei, 52 years old, from Anhui Province), the manager of the company. Wu, seeing the money, had ulterior motives and privately deposited the money in the bank to earn interest and purchased a building at No. 24 Zhianfang, North Sichuan Road. He claimed that he had sent employee Zhou Dihua to the salt-producing areas of Xuzhou and Haizhou to purchase the salt in batches. When the contract expired, he forged letters and telegrams, saying that the situation in the area was unstable, causing the shipment to be delayed. Later, due to the long delay, he forged another letter, claiming that the salt had been shipped to Hankou and instructed Li to send someone to escort it to Shanghai. When Li sent someone to Hankou, he suddenly claimed that it was still in Xuzhou. After such back and forth, it all turned out to be false. Li, unable to bear it any longer, seriously negotiated with Wu, who still made excuses to request an extension and returned a deposit slip from the Tongrun Qianzhuang for 4.8 million yuan. Afterwards, he avoided meeting Li. At this point, Li knew he had been deceived and reported the information to the police, who sent investigator Zhang Changgui to No. 24 Zhianfang, North Sichuan Road, to arrest Wu. They confiscated bank deposit checks, anti-counterfeiting letters, seals, and other items. However, Wu's statement to the police still insisted that he had indeed sent an employee with 16 million yuan to Xuzhou and Haizhou to purchase salt, but the employee had fled to the Communist area, resulting in the inability to deliver the goods on time. After the police showed him the original copies of the forged letters and seals, he was speechless and admitted to the fraud. As for the defrauded funds, in addition to 4 million yuan spent on purchasing the house, 3.1 million yuan was lent out, 1.3 million yuan was lent out in the Yangzhou countryside, 600,000 yuan was deposited in the Continental Bank, and the rest of the money had been spent. However, after investigation by the police, it was discovered that 2 million yuan had been borrowed from Li Xinwu at No. 3 Songyun Villa, Shanyin Road. The case has now been investigated and will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for interrogation today.

### The "Private Prostitute Concentration Camp" Presents a Wonderful Performance at the Laozha Branch; A Hero Saves a "Beauty" in a Scene on the Stealing Chicken Bridge

[Our Special Feature] The "Pickpocketing Brigade" is scheduled to have a grand parade this morning, but yesterday, the Laozha Branch unexpectedly had a wonderful performance of a "Private Prostitute Concentration Camp!"

Everyone knows that the area around the New World on Xizang Road has the most private prostitutes in Shanghai. Before the sun even sets, it is filled with countless demons and monsters mixed with powder and rouge, becoming one of the wonders of this largest international city in the Far East. These areas are under the jurisdiction of the Laozha Branch. Shi Sijian, the head of the branch, finally made the determination to take action and clear them out. 111 unlicensed private prostitutes were seized in July, and the number suddenly increased to 280 in August. From September 1st to 12th, another 81 were seized, bringing the total to around 500, while the total number of registered prostitutes in the city is only 965.

Police Officer Du Huiting, No. 3225, was ordered by Branch Head Shi to specialize in the task of clearing out "ladies of the night." On the night of September 12th, he went to Stealing Chicken Bridge on Zhifu Road in plain clothes, bringing three plainclothes officers with him. They caught four "wild chickens." Just as they were preparing to take the "chickens" back to the station, a jeep suddenly sped over, and four strong men in air force uniforms jumped out and helped them by drawing their knives to prevent them from catching "chickens" at Stealing Chicken Bridge. They tried to drag Du Huiting onto the jeep, and Du Huiting's three officers stepped forward to resist. The situation became tense, and a major battle was about to break out. Du Huiting blew his whistle, and police officers swarmed the area. The jeep quickly made a strategic retreat, and two of the four strong men failed to escape. One was named Mao Yutian, and the other's name is unknown; he can be said to be an "unsung hero." This matter may just be a misunderstanding, but why would a hero need to righteously save "beauty" when the police are "catching chickens?" After investigation, it turned out that one of the four arrested "beauties" was a confidante of one of the four "heroes"—let's hope that after this little comedy, the "heroes and beauties" will finally be reunited. Since he is a warm-hearted man, how can he bear to let the woman he loves live a life of "eating wind and dew?"

Yesterday, Branch Head Shi summoned forty or fifty old and young private prostitutes who were detained at the Laozha Branch and earnestly advised them not to engage in this most bitter profession in the future.

In fact, who in the world would willingly live such a life!

### Emergency Meeting of the Shipping Industry; Report on Improving Water Transport Methods for the Military; The Content of the Discussion Resolved to Urge the General Administration to Disclose Materials Awaiting Transport

The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association held an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 3:00 PM yesterday on the third floor of the Bank of Communications on Hankou Road, Bund, to discuss various important issues facing the shipping industry. All directors and supervisors, including Qian Yongming and Lin Xisheng, attended. Chairman Yang Guanbei first invited Secretary-General Li Yunliang to report on the joint meeting with Hu Shiyuan, Deputy General Manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Liu Yaohan, Director of the Shanghai Water Military Transport Office, who went to Beijing to negotiate with Xi Enshui, Director of the Transportation Department of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, to improve water transport methods for the military and adjust the difference in fees. It was stated that most of the outline of the Shanghai shipping industry's proposed measures to improve water transport methods for the military had been adopted by the government. In the future, the rental of ships for military transport will be in accordance with ordinary ship rental methods, with contracts established in advance. All ships designated by the government to perform special tasks, such as ships specifically transporting relief supplies, scheduled ships operating on fixed routes to maintain traffic, will be rented. Military supplies and scattered troops will be transported using consignment methods. Military supplies will be charged at 80% of the commercial freight rate, and soldiers will be charged at 60% of ordinary ticket prices. Regarding the difference in rent, it was also agreed that the rate for the Sichuan River would be increased to 12 times the base rate, that is, three times the price, and the rate for other routes would be increased to eight times the base rate, that is, twice the original price. In order to ensure the proper dispatch of rented and consigned ships, the Joint Logistics Department decided to establish a water transport liaison group, with one representative each from the Shanghai Water Military Transport Office, the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, and the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to maintain regular contact. In addition to the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company having appointed Lin Huanting as its representative, the association also appointed Jiang Weiquan, the head of the association's business group, to participate in the liaison group. The group's office is located at No. 97 Hankou Road and can begin work immediately. Next, concrete measures for various shipping companies to assist in operating all the ships of the General Administration to facilitate the transportation of relief supplies were discussed. It was decided to gather the strength of state-run and private companies to act as agents for all ships of the General Administration and to do their best.

[Another Report] The Shipping Industry Association made a solemn resolution yesterday to urge the General Administration's Storage and Transportation Department to disclose the quantity and destination of relief supplies stored in Shanghai awaiting transport, in order to be responsible for allocating and loading them for shipment. The shallow water season on the Yangtze River will begin soon. The industry hopes to take advantage of all available ship tonnage to complete the transport before the shallow water season, with a monthly transport volume of at least 100,000 tons. It is also reported that there are only 20,000 tons of materials stored in Shanghai awaiting transport to Hankou, and the ships that have sailed to Hankou in the past few days, including Hongda, Dada, Jiangning, and Luxing, will be able to clear them out. There is absolutely no problem with the transportation of relief supplies.

### The Situation of Inland River Shipping Needs to be Rectified; Freight Rates Are Not Unified, Schedules Are Irregular, Passengers Are Few, and Equipment on Each Vessel is Deteriorating

(Our Newspaper) This reporter recently met with Mr. Wang Jianping of the Jiangzhe Inland River Shipping Company and asked him about the organization of inland river ships and the current situation after the victory. He replied one by one, saying that there were 31 companies before the war, with 84 small boats, totaling 260 tons, and 358 tugboats, approximately 7,800 tons, operating on 15 routes. The industry suffered greatly during the war, and the old companies were unable to operate.

After the victory, the association reorganized them. Currently, there are 19 companies: Yuantong Shipping Bureau, Tongren Shipping Company, Shanghai Yuanhong Shipping Bureau, Dali Joint Venture Company affiliated Pinghu Shipping Bureau, Shanghai Qingji Shipping Bureau, Minnan Xieji Inland River Shipping Company, Songhu Shipping Company, Faji Shipping Bureau, Dajiangnan Transportation Bureau, Gongmao Shipping Bureau, Huada Enterprise Joint Venture Company, Shanghai Xingchang Shipping Bureau, Lixing Xinji Shipping Bureau, Lixing Yingji Shipping Bureau, Ning Shaoshengsheng Transportation Bureau, Zhengchang Hangji Shipping Bureau, Xingji Chang Transportation Company, Heji Transportation Bureau, and Xiexing Inland River Shipping Company. This is a decrease of four-tenths compared to before the war. Among them, only Yuan!. Yuanshi, Faji, Lixing, Gongmao and other five are old companies. All of their ships were lost, so they were unable to resume operations for a time. The ships of the new companies were even more numerous than before the war, approximately eight-tenths, totaling more than 140, but most of the equipment was incomplete. In particular, the ships with engines converted from automobile engines and those fueled by "command oil" are even more dangerous. Firefighting equipment is mostly lacking. The authorities do not pay attention, and the association cannot rectify them. There are currently only seven routes: Shenxi Chang, Shenhu (Huzhou), Shenping (Pinghu), Shenyu (Changshu), Shensha (Shaxi), Shenhang (Hangzhou), and Shensu (Suzhou), a decrease of eight routes compared to before the war. The business situation is still acceptable. The routes are not fixed and only change depending on the prosperity of the cargo transportation. For example, if there is a lot of cargo on the Shenhu route, most of the ships will operate on the Shenhu route. If there is a lot of cargo on the Shensu route, everyone will operate on the Shensu route. There are no unified freight rates either. They increase or decrease freely depending on the amount of cargo. Compared to ordinary freight rates, it is indeed cheaper, at 10,000 yuan per ton and only 500 yuan per dan. Passenger only seek rapid delivery to the destination, even if it costs 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per item, they are willing to pay, so there is only increase in freight rates, definitely no decrease. As for passenger ticket prices, it is said that there are few passengers because highways and railways are convenient, time can be shortened, and costs are more economical. Unless they have bulky luggage that is inconvenient to carry by highway or railway, they will never change to small boats. Before the war, the companies competed for business, reducing ticket prices again and again. The poor sought cheapness, regardless of time, and rode small boats. Now, the situation is the opposite of what it was before the war, so there are no passengers at all. The companies also do not pay attention to passenger seats. The equipment on each boat has gradually deteriorated. When asked how things could be put back on track in the future, Mr. Wang shook his head and said that there was little hope. Now, the only hope is that the authorities must use strict legal means to rectify the situation according to the law. There is still hope for the future. He then bid farewell and left.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Line Ship Schedule Confirmed

[Report from our Newspaper] Since the resumption of services on the Yangtze River, North and South Ocean lines, shipping schedules have been disrupted by military and government transport demands. This has caused inconvenience for commercial transport and passengers. According to those familiar with shipping operations, various companies are keen to establish fixed schedules, but due to the demands of official duties, it is feared that fixed schedules will be difficult to implement in the short term. However, the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping line (i.e., Shanghai to Ningbo) schedule can now be confirmed. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiangya" ship is scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Ningbo every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The Ping An Shipping Bureau's "Dahua" ship will depart from Shanghai to Ningbo every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

### Yu Xiangyan Cries Out in Prison, Still Insisting on Her Innocence

[Special Report from our Newspaper] The trial for the Road Bureau Materials Department corruption case will begin around the 20th in the local court. Yesterday, in the detention center, the female protagonist, Yu Xiangyan, continued to insist to reporters that she was "wrongfully implicated." According to her, her husband, "Mr. Zhang" (Zhang Hongtu, director of the Materials Department), is also "absolutely innocent of corruption." In short, she puts the blame on Bureau Chief Chen Bozhuang.

She said: Her husband, "Mr. Zhang," is a "scholar" and is being wronged. "To say that a woman like me could direct a major corruption case, isn't that a joke?"

Despite her energetic claims, her hands and mouth trembled incessantly. Despite her tireless efforts to defend her husband, the indictment states that she is guilty, and she has not been able to provide any concrete evidence of Bureau Chief Chen's "corruption."

This thirty-one-year-old "Mrs. Director," a graduate of the law department of Great China University, wore a short-sleeved cheongsam with a lake green background and white circles yesterday.

When asked about life in prison, she shook her head with a bitter smile and said two words: "Painful!"

### Basketball Game: Air Force Performance Greatly Improved, War and Shan Team Tie - 51 Points Each in the First Half

[Report from our Newspaper] The Nanjing Air Force basketball team played its third visiting game in Shanghai last night, facing off against the Shan team at 8:00 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium. The Air Force team has improved rapidly. As a result of last night's fierce battle, they ultimately drew, with 20 points each in the first half and a total of 51 points each. After discussions, both sides shook hands and made peace.

Key Player Absent

The Shan team was still able to display its inherent style in yesterday's game, performing quickly, but due to the absence of Ma Jiexi, there was no one to direct, which meant that it could not be fast and stable, and it was less impressive. This is why they failed to win. The shooting of newcomer Liu Jingxing was easy to watch. Chen Qingjiang and Lin Weicong's shots were not smooth, which was also abnormal.

Visiting Team Gets Points

In this game, the Air Force was able to successfully utilize the man-to-man marking tactic, and use obstruction methods to penetrate deep into the paint, which was especially valuable. In defense and offense, they were on top of the game, and Qin Xunze and Liu Zhenyuan were agile and had satisfactory performances.

A Close Match

The two teams took the court on time. The Shan team started with He Lide, Chen Qingjiang, Liu Jingxing, Cai Yanxiong, and Ji Nankang. The visiting team had Qin Xunze, Liu Zhenyuan, Ge Kezhifeng, Wang Helin, and Li Xianyue as guards. After the start, the Shan team took the lead with a score of 5 to 1. The visiting team took a timeout and chased back to 5 points each. The situation remained tense, and the score was tied for a long time. The first half ended with 20 points each. In the second half, the Shan team took the lead again. The visiting team worked hard to catch up, and the score was always one or two points apart. When the score was 33 to 29, Cai Yanxiong of the Shan team was injured and left the court, which had an impact. After that, both sides committed many fouls. Until the end of the game, the score was 51 points each. Both sides agreed not to extend the game.

### Yarn Allocation Fully Distributed According to Quota, But Spinning and Weaving Factory's Listing Remains Unchanged, Yarn Stores Still Lament Being Left Out, Actual Sales Activity Stops Price Decline and Causes Rebound, Factories Actively Rectify Selling of Warehouse Receipts

(Reported by this newspaper) Yesterday, the yarn market turned around. The Hunan and Hubei merchants showed great interest, and customers from the mainland of Beijing and Anhui also purchased enthusiastically. Therefore, prices stopped falling and rebounded. 20-count yarn rose by about 10,000 to 20,000. In the market, the "Golden Rooster" brand of 420-pound special yarn was transacted at 2.55 million, comparable to the price of the "Special Double Horse" brand. However, the 400-pound standard yarn approved and sold by the Joint Allocation Committee, such as the "Golden Rooster" brand in stock, although quoted at 1.36-1.37 million, lacked buyers, showing the general unpopularity of lightweight goods. 41-count yarn was purchased by a cloth factory yesterday, approaching the 2.3 million mark again, an increase of about 50,000 compared to the previous day. At 10:00 AM, the Spinning and Weaving Factory listed prices as usual, maintaining the levels before the foreign exchange adjustment. However, only factories were allocated, and yarn stores were not allowed to participate at all. At 11:00 AM, the Spinning and Weaving Factory opened sales of ten-day futures. Everything was in accordance with the joint allocation method. Yesterday, the company opened sales of 23 types, including "Blue Phoenix" and other brands. 42-count "Bao Guang" was priced at 1.89 million, and 20-count "Blue Phoenix" was priced at 1.6 million, mostly allocated to dyeing and weaving factories. 32-count "Five Color Star" and other brands were allocated to other cotton manufacturing industries, priced 30,000 lower than the previous period. Yarn stores have not received any allocation for three weeks, causing considerable anxiety. The yarn industry association is actively rectifying the market while appealing for allocations. However, no allocation was made yesterday, which yarn industry insiders deeply regretted, hoping that the Spinning and Weaving Factory can improve the situation in future yarn allocations. As for the practical factories, they are also closely monitoring and actively rectifying the selling of warehouse receipts by a few manufacturers.

The Yarn Factory Joint Allocation Committee held a regular meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. It was decided on the spot to open sales of 5.645 pieces of 20-count cotton yarn (of which the Spinning and Weaving Factory accounted for 2,263 pieces), with full allocation according to the application amount. The selling price will be based on 1.3 million per piece of 400-pound 20-count "Double Horse" yarn. The next opening date was set for the 16th.

The cloth market was flat. "Dragon Head" fine cloth, due to the Spinning and Weaving Factory not opening sales for four or five times, was still quoted at 67,000 yuan. Serge, having not opened sales for three times, was quoted at 63,500 yuan, without much change. The "Blue V" brand was once quoted at an additional 7,000 yuan, but eventually fell to 6,000 yuan. Unbranded fine cloth was mostly sold at the original Spinning and Weaving Factory price. This type of fine cloth, compared to the "Eagle Camel" brand from Changzhou and the "Tianma" brand from Shanghai, is of slightly firmer quality and is very popular with dyeing factories. General merchants do not need much, so there are few applicants.

### Gold Price Slightly Decreases, US Dollar Slightly Increases

Smelted gold was mediocre yesterday. It opened at 2.155 million in the morning. The Central Bank slightly supplied, then immediately announced the lower price. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 72 bars, priced at 2.1425 million. After 10:00 AM, it was even more peaceful. At noon, it fell again below 2.14 million, and trading was limited. The market was quiet. In the afternoon, it first fell to 2.133 million, then rebounded to around 2.145 million. As a result, it closed down slightly by about 20,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry gold slightly decreased to 22,700. Silver ingots were flat, while silver dollars slightly increased. The underground money market was balanced, with interest rates around 15%.

Foreign currencies were also mediocre. The US dollar opened at 3,380 yuan and was sold, but trading was also limited. There was little change in the process. At noon, it began to weaken to 3,350 yuan. In the afternoon, it first fell to 3,340 yuan, and finally rose slightly to 3,380 yuan due to the influence of arbitrage buying. As a result, it closed up slightly by 5 yuan compared to the previous close. The exchange rate against gold was slightly reduced to 6,353 per ten taels. The Hong Kong dollar was affected by the contraction of the Hong Kong Shenbao and rose by 10 yuan, as did the Hong Kong exchange rate, from 695 yuan to 705 yuan. Indian exchange rate was from 840 yuan to 850 yuan, and the British exchange rate was offered at 11,400 yuan, with the US exchange rate hovering around the listed price.

### Chinese Stocks Turn from Steady to Weak

Except for a few unpopular small stocks that occasionally surged, the remaining Chinese stocks generally felt weak and retreated slightly. Each stock turned from steady to weak. Hot stocks slightly rebounded mid-session, but were still slightly soft near noon. Trading was quiet, with large investors watching. As a result, Yong Yarn, American Asiatic, Jingfu, New Light, and Qinxing continued to decline slightly compared to the previous close. Medium-sized stocks among the less popular stocks declined significantly. Among the small stocks, except for China-France and New Asia, which made slight progress, the remaining stocks also declined slightly, and the veteran Yin had no strength to advance.

Foreign stocks stopped falling and rose slightly yesterday. Each stock had scattered buyers, showing a stable situation. Trading was not yet smooth. As a result, Asiatic Petroleum and Jardine Matheson were flat compared to the previous close, and the remaining stocks slightly rebounded.

### Public Bond Trading is Not Smooth

The public bond market continued to hover, with people's attitudes undecided, and trading was not smooth. The unified bond opened at 2,300 yuan in the morning, rising to a high of 2,450 yuan, but soon fell back to 2,210 yuan, and finally hovered around 2,250 yuan. As a result, it closed up slightly by 20 yuan compared to the previous close. Types A and B also rose by 50 yuan, the unified Ding was flat, and the unified E fell by 70 yuan.

### Construction Red Tea Is Vigorously Bought

The red and green tea varieties are still being sold continuously in the shops and banks of this street and in the Suzhou and Wuxi area. Export companies are also showing increasing interest. Because the sailing date of this month's 20th has been changed to the 23rd, it is said, each company is rushing to make up for the insufficient amount, especially Fujian black tea, which is most vigorously bought, with each dan rising by more than 2,000 yuan compared to the previous price.

### Sugar Price Falls Sharply and Then Recovers Slightly

Yesterday, the sugar market, due to continuous price drops, had already hit the company's allocated price, so it showed a sign of sharp decline followed by a slight recovery. The association set the price of medium-grade white sugar on the morning of the 20th at 143,000 yuan, then rose by 3,500 yuan, then 4,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, 6,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it even rose to 7,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts were 142,000 yuan, raw sugar 112,000, 4,000 yuan, 6,000 yuan, an increase of 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Four-and-a-half-vehicle white sugar was 200,000 yuan, three-and-a-half-vehicle white sugar was 180,000 yuan, refined green was quoted at 125,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan, cotton red was 133,000 yuan, with a slight amount of transactions.

### Spring and Quanzhou Longan Try New Markets

The new crop of Quanzhou big-bubble dried longan is harvesting very well this year, so the prices are high. The calculations show that the profit margins are not adequate. Therefore, a small amount has been shipped to Shanghai to test the market and will soon be available.

### Tung Oil Shipped to America

[Reported by this newspaper] The Finklecliffe, managed by Shun Heng Foreign Company, set sail for America this morning, carrying 274 boxes of tung oil, 219 boxes of tea, 191 boxes of wool, and more than 180 pieces of pig bristles.

### Waterproof Cloth Decline

The woolen textile market maintains stable prices, and transactions are still quite active. However, the prices of all brands of waterproof cloth are declining. First-class is quoted at only 5,000 yuan per yard, second-class at 4,700 yuan, and third-class at 4,000 yuan. The quantity needed by buyers has decreased because the peak sales season has gradually passed, and it has also been affected by the low price of glass raincoats. Furthermore, formally produced waterproof cloth of various types can now be ordered. These three factors have created the current situation of abundant goods in the market.

### Allocation Is Insufficient to Meet Factory Needs, Rayon Jumps Greatly Again Yesterday, Italian Silk Will Be Unloaded Within Days

Rayon, which had been weak for several days, rebounded yesterday. 120 Tianqiao bright rayon was first traded at 6.24 million in the morning and, in the blink of an eye, rose to 6.8 million at closing. The afternoon was even better, with transactions at 7.2 million and sellers quoting 7.5 million, a sharp increase of 150,000 yuan compared to the previous afternoon. Various brands of miscellaneous rayon were also driven up by 130,000 to 140,000 yuan. This is because China Textile has expressed its determination to stop allocating goods to rayon stores, and the goods allocated to silk factories do not match their sales needs and are very small in quantity. Therefore, they still have to buy from the black market, leading to a situation where the black market first declines and then rises. Rayon stores have booked an Italian rayon that has already arrived in port and is said to be declared for customs and taxed today, with each case requiring about 700,000 yuan in taxes. The goods can be unloaded in two or three days, and the market price may be slightly reduced at that time. However, the stock of 120 bright rayon is dwindling daily, with only about 200 cases on order, including some dull rayon, so it will be difficult to suppress the price in the short term. However, the silk goods market is afraid that the difference between raw materials is too great. Manufacturers in this environment have a feeling of both laughter and tears.

### Spinning and Weaving Factory Requests Termination

The Enemy Property Administration entrusted the China Textile Construction Corporation to sell enemy property rayon, and more than 3,000 cases have been sold. Only a few cases remain, and the inventory counting and sales procedures are troublesome. Moreover, this work is very labor-intensive. The company not only makes no profit but also has to subsidize expenses every month. According to Jiang Dixian, the deputy director of the business department of the company, the work of selling rayon has been requested to be terminated to the Enemy Property Administration, hoping to change the sales method.

### Japanese Goods Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon

The monthly demand for rayon in various silk factories in this city is 2,000 cases. Although the Spinning and Weaving Factory has allocations, the number is small. Therefore, in the past week, the price of rayon has soared. The China Trust Bureau will ship 40,000 cases of rayon from Japan to Shanghai, and various silk factories hope that the allocation volume can be increased at that time.

### The Formal Auction Date of the Stock Exchange Will Be Determined by Today's Board of Directors, The Alternative Method of Guarantee Deposit Has Been Approved

The Stock Exchange continued to practice trading yesterday morning; in the afternoon, it practiced the reconciliation procedures for the entire exchange. The results were very good; each account was also reconciled accurately. However, in order to ensure that the procedures are smooth, the final exercise will be held today (the 14th). It is also rumored that the exchange is scheduled to hold the first joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 4:00 PM today (the 14th) to discuss important matters. The opening date of the auction will also be decided by this meeting.

The alternative method for Securities Gold substitutes, which had been submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, temporarily replaced with written guarantees from the firm, has now been approved by order. The Central Bank will designate several member banks in the Shanghai market, and brokers will contact them to provide written guarantees in lieu of substitutes to be submitted to the Central Bank. Each broker is ordered to exchange this guarantee for a substitute within one month from the opening date of the stock exchange. The exchange has contacted the Central Bank and sent letters to each broker to comply, so as to comply with the opening date decided by the Board of Directors. It is also rumored that the method of collecting the transaction tax by the exchange is still under review by the Ministry, and the exchange authorities hope to receive instructions before the scheduled opening date, so as not to affect the opening date.

### Rice Industry Corrects Rice Measures, Uniform Implementation Tomorrow

The rice measures used by the bean and rice industry in this city have been inspected for accuracy by the industry association in consultation with the Bureau of Weights and Measures, and will be implemented uniformly from the 15th. The Rice Measure Industry Workers' Union has been instructed to uniformly level the measures and not allow excessive or insufficient measurements. If there is any deliberate violation, it will be dealt with according to law. The industry association has notified each of its members to comply.

### Rice Market Source Is Very Strong, Japonica, Indica, and Glutinous Rice All Decline

The rice market is flooded with goods and sales are slow, weak and difficult to stabilize. New japonica and indica rice both declined by a small 1,000 or 2,000 yuan. Old japonica and old indica rice are in sluggish demand and are gradually declining by 4,000 or 5,000 yuan. The total registration of customers and goods in the north and south markets reached more than 10,000 stones. Flour sales are not smooth and continue to decline by a small 300 or 400 yuan. Wheat from Fujian, Ningbo, and Qingdao is dull and has fallen by another 500 to 1,000 yuan. Broad beans have an inverted production and sales ratio, with fewer goods arriving, and raw kernels have declined by 1,000 yuan. Soybeans continue to rise. The digestion of soybean and vegetable oil in the oil market has become sluggish and has declined by 1,000 yuan. Raw oil is scarce and has slightly softened.

### Production, Sales, Transportation, and Sales, Different Tax Exemptions for Commercial Business Tax

[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently received a letter from the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau, roughly stating that since salt has been changed to free transportation, it is no different from ordinary commerce, and should be taxed or exempted according to the provisions of the Business Tax Law, according to the following conditions for each producer, transporter, and seller: (1) Producers should be exempt from business tax, (2) Transporters, if they are engaged in the transportation business and transport goods for others, should be taxed on the transportation business tax on the freight they receive. This business tax should not be added to the salt price for transfer by the transporter. If they are purchasing and transporting the goods themselves, they should still be exempt from business tax. (3) Sellers, after purchasing salt from salt warehouses or salt fields, whether they sell it locally or transport it to other areas for sale, regardless of whether they are engaged in exclusive or concurrent business, should be taxed on the total amount of business income in accordance with the Business Tax Law. This business tax should not be included in the salt price when selling salt. However, the business of peddlers carrying goods on their shoulders should still be exempt. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to the Salt Industry Association of this city to inform all members accordingly.

### White Coal Soars

The coal market has no hope for the arrival of white coal screened lumps, and the coal reserves in Shanghai are decreasing. Although the asking price is frequently high, the supply is still scarce. Those in urgent need can only find and purchase at high prices. It is said that the highest transaction price is 600,000 yuan, a huge increase of 100,000 yuan compared to the previous price. White coal fines and bituminous coal, thanks to the appropriate allocation by the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, have no price fluctuations in the market.

### False Reserve Deposits Will Be Returned in Shanghai

[Reported by this newspaper] It is learned that the liquidation office of the false Central Reserve Bank has sorted out the total amount of ordinary deposits of the false bank, which is about 500 million yuan in legal tender, and has submitted it to the Ministry of Finance for review, and it is expected to be returned in the near future. It is now said that although there are as many as eight liquidation offices, they have now been concentrated in Shanghai. Therefore, when returning deposits in the future, they will also be concentrated in Shanghai. Deposits in other locations will be refunded by mail.

### Seafood Market Stagnant

The seafood market is declining like a river flowing downwards. Shrimp tails from various places continue to arrive, and customers are watching and waiting. Although the inventory of thousand-layered winter shiitake mushrooms is thin, the sales are stagnant and they are also declining. Mussels and prayer vegetables are ignored. Xiangshu wood ears continue to arrive and sell actively, and after falling, they have turned firm. Fins, sea cucumbers, and fish skins are stable, but dried seaweed and rice kernels, which are seasonal goods, are still firm. Seaweed is shipped from both Ningbo and Ou, and the actions of the Cantonese and Sichuan gangs are shifting. New South Dates are available, but due to the age of the trees, large ones are few and far between. Other goods, due to tight monetary conditions during the festive season, will probably be difficult to improve for a while.

### Zhongyi Securities Firm Opens

Shanghai Stock Exchange No. 175 Zhongyi Securities Firm, managed by Yu Banhou, deputy manager Ni Wenshen, specializing in securities trading, located at Room 406 to 407, 103 Jiujiang Road, telephone 15934 and other five lines.

### Pre-War Deposit Compensated Thousand-Fold Case, Appeal Letter of the Four Banks Savings Association

[Reported by this newspaper] Pre-war bank deposits, the Shanghai court ruled that the payment should be made at a thousand-fold, causing great shock in the national financial community. The Shanghai branch of the Four Banks Savings Association expressed its disapproval of the Shanghai District Court's ruling that the association should pay the depositor Chen Jilin 2,000 yuan for the deposit in 1940, according to one thousand times the amount. They have submitted detailed reasons to the High Court. The indictment letter has been delivered to the District Court yesterday afternoon for forwarding to the High Court. We specially transcribe its original text as follows:

For supplementing the reasons. I, the appellant, in the case of the civil judgment No. 1610 in the 35th year of the Shanghai District Court, have already declared an appeal within the statutory period. After reviewing the reasons of the original trial, it is neither constrained by the form of legal texts. It is based on the inference of imagination as the basis of the judgment, which is difficult to convince. Now, I would like to supplement the reasons as follows.

According to the application of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits after Restoration, there must be four essential conditions, and none can be missing. (1) Limited to before the effect of the legal act disappears after its establishment. (2) The event is not attributable to the parties. (3) It is not foreseeable by the parties. (4) Its effect is obviously unfair. The change of circumstances is a significant and common phenomenon, but the decline in currency value is an inevitable result of the war. It is not attributable to the appellant. Moreover, the appellee's deposit was made in 1940, three or four years after the outbreak of the war. The National Government had already moved to Chongqing and announced a long-term war of resistance policy. The price increase was a fact known to everyone. Then, the inevitable trend of the daily depreciation of the currency could be considered unforeseeable by the appellee. Since there is no event attributable to the appellant, and the appellee has the consequence that the rich can foresee, the prerequisite for applying this article no longer exists. Taking a step back, the legislative intent of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits after Restoration and the Interpretation No. 3018 of the Judicial Yuan is to seek the fairness of payment, not simply to pursue the price index. Therefore, it is stated "... the court should fairly weigh the increase or decrease in payment ..." In other words, the rights and interests of gain and loss are inherently opposed and should take into account the economic status and actual situation of both parties for the fair weighing of increasing or decreasing payments. In the case, the appellant has been affected by the currency system since 1940 and has repeatedly changed the total amount, from two to one to two hundred to one. Therefore, the 2,000 yuan deposited by the appellee was once forced by the environment to be exchanged for 1,000 yuan of puppet currency. According to this, and then converted into legal currency in accordance with laws and regulations, only 5 yuan remained. During the period when the enemy and puppets were entrenched, it was forbidden to forcibly use puppet currency and use legal currency, and once discovered, there was an unpredictable danger. Now, not only the appellant is required to restore the original deposit amount, but also to increase it by a thousand times for payment. That is, the appellee's deposit of 5 yuan requires a compensation of 2 million yuan, which is equivalent to increasing the appellant's debt of 400,000 times. It must be known that the application of the above regulations is not exclusively enjoyed by the creditor. Then, because of events not attributable to the appellant, the situation has changed, why should the appellant alone bear the foreseeable effect at that time. And calculated at 400,000 times, it is universally applied to all depositors. How can the appellant's financial resources bear it? Using the price index alone as a standard, favoring one party's interests, is a loss of the legislative fairness of the original intent. This is the first thing that I do not agree with.

Furthermore, the original trial reasoned that the appellant, after receiving savings deposits, did indeed use a portion of the deposits as working capital, and the remaining deposits were either used to purchase public bonds and other bonds as collateral or invested in real estate ... "I, the appellant, am referred to as:" Four Banks Savings Association ". According to Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Savings Bank Law, the deposit is received by the compound interest method and should be" regarded as a savings bank ". According to Article 4 of the same law, the appellant shall not engage in other businesses other than operating deposits and accepting deposit agency sales. I do not know what the original trial relied on when it claimed to have invested in real estate. Since it recognizes that the public bonds purchased by the appellant and the collateral deposited in the central government "suffered considerable losses due to the impact of the Ministry of Finance's face value repayment method", it is inferred that the appellant "has greatly increased the amount of currency in other aspects of investment", regardless of the actual situation and only seeking fairness in imagination. Cover what is called investment has no basis, and it is hasty to say that investment is only profitable and not harmful, especially it is ignorant of commercial sentiment. Moreover, the appellant is under the strict supervision of the Ministry of Finance, and its business is subject to its supervision, and its finance is subject to its inspection. How can it be allowed to engage in investment outside of the legal business? As for the use of funds, it is also aimed at lending. Recalling the time when the victory was realized last autumn, at the beginning of restoration and takeover, the unification of the currency system and the ratio of conversion and redemption have been on the rise. Therefore, debtors rushed to compete for repayment with pseudo-savings certificates. What the appellant received back was fake currency, which was regarded as one for two hundred. That is, the amount of currency has suffered a loss of two hundred times, and it is not the increase in the number of currencies as claimed by the original judgment. "This is the second thing that I do not agree with.

Based on the above reasons, the original trial was not fair in law and reason. Therefore, I would like to ask the court to review and judge, and humbly approve the abandonment of the original judgment, reject the appellee's request for increased payment in the first instance, and order the burden of litigation costs for both trials, which is a matter of great convenience.

### "The Whisper of Angels"

— Ping Qi

The poet Scott's impression of music is: "So sweet, so gentle, so ethereal, like the whisper of angels." Music leads us into a new realm. If this realm is described in Chinese poetry, I think Gong Zizhen's "Is it fairy, is it illusion, is it gentleness" might say some of it.

What world is this! After a whole day of painstakingly dodging and fending off, let's have some music.

It's not about escaping. It's just that the bowstring can't be taut forever, we should occasionally relax a bit. Music, it temporarily brings us closer to the distant homeland, it relives our childhood dreams.

We are grateful that there are still people like Toscanini in this world, whose magic wand leads us closer to the quiet streams in Beethoven's pastoral heart, the occasional lark flying by; this magic wand also leads us into Schubert's helpless melancholy; Tchaikovsky's sea-deep despair.

Today, we devoutly introduce Toscanini and Stokowski to our readers. They do not belong to any one country, they are the glory of all mankind!

### Toscanini, the Greatest Maestro in the World Today

Spring and Autumn

### Reclusion

— A Brief Overview

After Emperor Zhenzong of Song performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices, he found a recluse named Zhou Pu and forcibly summoned him to court. Zhou Pu vehemently denied being able to write poetry. Zhenzong asked him if anyone had written poems to see him off when he was being summoned. He said that only an old janitor had written one. The poem said, "No more indulging in wine in a disheveled state, nor should you recklessly love to write poetry. Now that you've been seized and taken to the government, this time it will be the end of your old skin!" Zhenzong laughed heartily upon hearing this and had no choice but to let him return home.

Being conscripted into service for reclusion has always been considered the most honorable thing, but he considered it being captured by the government and thought it would be the end of his skin. This is truly the greatest accusation against politics. The idea of reclusion probably originated in the Warring States period, stemming from Boyi and Shuqi. This is a passive resistance to politics or a doctrine of non-recognition, "The world cannot make him a subject, the lords cannot make him a friend," truly placing oneself outside the realm of politics. The theory of reclusion was largely completed in the hands of Zhuangzi.

This thought has had a tremendous effect on politics in our country. It gives politics only a relative effect, and the ruler only a relative authority. No matter what, one cannot do whatever one wants. Violence is certainly restricted, but violence cannot last. Under the doctrine of non-recognition, it must be eliminated as soon as possible.

Under thousands of years of autocracy, the Chinese nation ultimately obtained a spiritual safe zone through the idea of reclusion.

Since the people have become masters of the country, the idea of reclusion can no longer exist, let alone the reality of reclusion, but violence can still exist. To deal with violence, according to Tao Yuanming, "The virtuous avoid their generation," meaning only the virtuous know how to escape. Ordinary people have no way to escape but to risk their lives and take the final path.

### A Glimpse into "Shi Tao's Paintings and Sayings" (Part 1)

— Zheng Wei

If one attempts to gain a glimpse into the life of a great artist in history by merely relying on the works he has left behind for inference, I believe the conclusion will not exceed an assessment along the lines of "the great are great," which is to say, it is in vain. The artwork itself is arguably the essence of the artist's life, but in terms of the development of his spirit and mind, it is merely equivalent to excretion, even dross. Although it can provide some nourishment to others, it cannot be used as primary data for studying his creative process. The discovery of truth in things often lies in obtaining clues from corresponding things, and the wider and denser the range of its connection with other things, the greater its inherent value.

Researchers should adopt this approach for every in-depth and extensive study of Shi Tao. The author dares not ignore the various issues related to Shi Tao and uses these relationships as a way to glimpse the magnificent and bizarre nature of Shi Tao's entire mind. I have often heard people say that Shi Tao's work originated from imitation, while others say that Shi Tao was a genius who completely opened up his own realm. These superficial views, regardless of whether they come from those who want to speak for themselves, do not even understand the simplest structure of the universe and are far from the subject of this article, so I do not intend to criticize them.

Shi Tao's Paintings and Sayings is not only a meticulous work for Shi Tao but can also be said to be an unparalleled masterpiece among theoretical painting treatises throughout history. It not only provides the best explanation for his own works but also lays the highest aesthetic standards for thousands of years of Eastern art.

An artist who highly values "veneration and acceptance" will not obliterate the benefits left by many predecessors. However, the extent of broad integration makes it difficult for us to glimpse the resources he absorbed at the time. At the same time, there is no need to adopt the attitude of saying that Shi Tao gained from so-and-so but lost from so-and-so. In the chapter on Veneration and Acceptance:

"It is valuable to respect and obtain its acceptance, and not to abandon oneself."

"Clinging to the ancient without transformation is a limitation of knowledge. Knowledge limited to similarity is not broad, so the gentleman only uses the ancient to serve the present." (Lao Tzu: Grasping the ways of the past to manage the things of the present, knowing the origins of the past is called the principle of Dao). In the chapter on Change:

"The supreme person has no law, not that there is no law, but having no law is the supreme law. In all things, there is principle and expediency, and with law, there must be transformation. Knowing one principle immediately changes, knowing one law immediately transforms."

These are all tight annotations for acceptance. Therefore, when talking about Shi Tao's acceptance, it is more appropriate to say that he is faithful to the feelings of nature than to say that he is faithful to the legacy of his predecessors. Nature is the location of the artist's pulse, just as merchants value their property. The difference is that one guards his narrow possessions (enslaved by things), while there is no such thing as possession and concealment with nature. Zhuangzi's hiding the world in the world is enough to show this open attitude. The reason is not that the artist's concern for nature is not like the merchant's concern for property, but that he himself is aware that he belongs to nature, and nature belongs to him. He can never be separated from nature, and nature can never leave him. Chapter on Mountains and Rivers:

"Mountains and rivers make me speak for mountains and rivers, mountains and rivers are born from me, and I am born from mountains and rivers."

In such a process of integration and acceptance, one can reflect on a question—"I," which is the existence of what is called individuality in art. The "I" that can be entrusted with a task has a large extension in meaning, because who in the universe is not being entrusted? Who is not being accepted? Chapter on Endowment:

"Viewing it from the perspective of fortune, it is to receive the task of nurturing. Viewing it from the perspective of management, it is to receive the task of life. Viewing it from the perspective of mountains and rivers, it is to receive the task of embryonic bones. Viewing it from the perspective of neighboring waves, it is to receive the task of painting transformation. Viewing it from the perspective of the vast sea, it is to receive the task of heaven and earth. Viewing it from the perspective of a small hall, it is to receive the task of a moment. Viewing it from the perspective of non-action, it is to receive the task of action. Viewing it from the perspective of a single stroke, it is to receive the task of ten thousand forms. Viewing it from the perspective of an empty wrist, it is to love the task of brush-tip freedom."

Ten thousand kinds of objects have unique self-expression, and ten thousand kinds of unique self-expression converge into an inseparable and integrated greater self (nature). What is the reason for this? The chapter on Endowment has several paragraphs:

"First, endow what is to be endowed."

"If it is not on this case to perform its task, then how can it travel the mountains and rivers of the world and connect the bloodlines of the world?"

"The ancient and the modern are not confused, and the brush and ink remain forever, because they are thoroughly imbued with this task."

"Task" is the root of the integration of "I" and all things, and it is also what makes "I" "I." Only by mutually endowing can the "I" of each individual be realized, and only by enriching thousands of individual "I" can the so-called Dao (the ever-changing nature) be abundant. The Book of Changes says, "The myriad things are endowed with origins," from which it can be said that "task," which is matched with righteousness and Dao, is the heavenly task.

How to exercise this "heavenly task"? Paintings and Sayings tells us about "nurturing and life," which Shi Tao valued very much and which is also mentioned the most in Paintings and Sayings. The reason why Shi Tao is so brilliant in the history of art and why his works are so profound and transcendent is that he understood "task" and made it Shi Tao's worldview. "Nurturing and life" nourished Shi Tao's wisdom. Chapter on Endowment:

"If the mountain does not entrust water, it is not enough to see its circulation. If the water does not entrust the mountain, it is not enough to see its embrace. If the task of mountains and rivers is not obvious, then there is no way for circulation and embrace. If circulation and embrace are not obvious, then there is no way for nurturing and life. If nurturing and life are managed, then circulation and embrace have a reason, and if circulation and embrace have a reason, then the task of mountains and rivers ceases."

"Thus, this task is truly the principle of nurturing and life, using one to govern ten thousand, and using ten thousand to govern one." Also, in the chapter on Brush and Ink, it says:

"The specifics of mountains, rivers, and all things have reverse and correct, oblique and askew, gathering and scattering, near and far, inside and outside, virtual and real, broken and continuous, layers, peeling, delicate, and clumsy. This is the great end of life. Therefore, the spirit of mountains, rivers, and all things resides in people, because they control this power of nurturing and life. If it is not so, how can there be embryos and bones, connections and unions, substance and use, form and body, arches and stands, squats and jumps, lurking, rushing to the sky, masculine, majestic, towering, steep, and dangerous under the brush and ink? Draw its spirit one by one and fulfill its divinity."

Because people (individuals) control this power of nurturing and life, in their eyes, nature is no longer lifeless stones and blocks of wood but things full of shape and state, embryo and bones, spirit and divinity.

At this point, we might as well close our eyes and think about it. From this realm of having embryos and bones, having spirit and divinity, when Shi Tao, who came out of it, picked up his brush and sucked ink, I ask: To what extent would Shi Tao value the methods of the ancients? Would he think about following or not following a certain family? Would he think about any "rules" or "three folds"? Regarding this point, the chapter on Change has a clear indication:

"It is the great law of exhausting all changes in the world, the essence of the shapes and forms of mountains and rivers, the shaping of all things in ancient and modern times, and the flow of yin and yang. Borrowing brush and ink to write about heaven and earth and all things and immersing myself in them. People today do not understand this and always say: 'So-and-so's few points can stand, and without so-and-so's landscape, it cannot be passed down for long. So-and-so's purity can establish character, and without so-and-so's ingenuity, it is only enough to please people.' This is me being used by so-and-so, not so-and-so being used by me. Even if I force myself to be like so-and-so, I am only eating so-and-so's leftovers. What is there to me? Or some say to me: 'So-and-so is broad, so-and-so is concise, which door should I enter, which level should I be, which comparison should I make, which effect should I verify, which point should I apply, which form should I use, so that I can be ancient and the ancient can be me?' Those who are like this only know that there is the ancient but do not know that there is me. My being me has its own 'I' in me. The eyebrows of the ancient cannot grow on my eyebrows. Even if I sometimes touch upon a certain family, it is that certain family approaching me, not me deliberately being like a certain family. It is naturally bestowed, and what ancient teacher do I have that I cannot transform?"

All rules are only there to be "obstacles." Therefore, if it is "naturally bestowed," then there is no obstacle to speak of. Without obstacles, there are no rules to speak of. Shi Tao said, "Painting comes from the heart, and obstacles are far away." Coming from the heart means following the rules without exceeding them (Confucius had the idea of following his heart's desire without exceeding the bounds), but how can these be understood by superficial and incompetent craftsmen? Therefore, Shi Tao exclaimed:

"The world knows there are rules but does not know the meaning of heaven's rotation and earth's turning."

The operation of heaven and earth follows nature, so how can there be any rules? Because there are no obstacles, all movements become compliant with the rules. This is the realm of the integration of heaven and man, "transforming without transforming, doing without doing." Furthermore, as he talks about brush and ink:

"The ink is used richly, and the brush is used skillfully with spirit. Ink is not spiritual without nurturing, and the brush is not divine without life." 引法章:

"The painter, shapes heaven and earth and all things, if one get rid of brush and ink, how shall one shape the world. The ink receives from heaven, thick and light, dry and moist, follows it, the brush is controlled by man, outlines, smears, and dyes follows it." Chapter on Change:

"Borrowing brush and ink to write about heaven and earth and all things and immersing myself in them."

"In the sea of ink, determine the spirit, under the tip of the brush, decide on life, on the foot of the ruler, change the fur and bones, in the chaos, release the light. Even if the brush is not a brush, the ink is not ink, I myself exist." (If the brush is a brush, the ink is ink, where do I reside and stand? It is in the space between the brush not being a brush and the ink not being ink that I obtain the interaction of great nature - to be considered.)

"Have you gone to school?" W asked again.

"..." Little Tiger seemed to have swallowed a stone egg whole and was unable to chew it.

"He's been to some," Yaoqun replied with a smile. "I asked him, he's been in their village for more than half a year, so I know something: he's probably read a "Three Character Classic," a "Hundred Family Surnames," a "Four-Character Primer," and a "Youth's Primer," and two "Four Books," probably the Analects. Later, I taught him a book of elementary school common sense, a little history and geography. Since the September 18th Incident and the fall of the provincial capital, the textbooks have all been changed, and I can't buy suitable textbooks for a while... As long as Little Tiger is with me often, I think I should take some responsibility..."

"That's great." I and W blurted out this sentence at the same time. W then said, "Right now, I don't think the two of you will be separated for work... I really want to, because the matter in Tongzhou is very urgent... I want to ask Miss Yaoqun to..." W didn't know Little Tiger's name yet.

"His formal name is Huchen," Yaoqun interjected, "Later, he changed the 'chen' of 'junchen' (ruler and subject) to the 'cheng' of 'city'."

"Yes," W nodded, "I want to ask you two to go to our office tomorrow to complete some procedures, and then, maybe rest there for a day, and go to Tongzhou the day after tomorrow..."

"That's great." Yaoqun also stood up, feeling a little excited, her bright eyes shining with a light. "Since the matter in Tongzhou is so urgent, if you're not afraid of being bothered... if it's possible... could we go to report tonight, right now, complete the procedures, and then we can get on the road early tomorrow morning?" A blush appeared on her slightly tanned cheeks as she spoke.

Since I met W, I have seen emotions on his face, unlike the so-called "poker" faces of general intelligence workers—impassive—but at the same time, he has an indescribable calmness. At this time, he heard Yaoqun's request, and of course, he understood that Yaoqun was not impetuous or superficial, vying to take office immediately, but wanted to seize the "time" factor, so he pondered for a moment and immediately nodded:

"Okay, it's just that you two will be a little tired... Also, are you two familiar with Tongzhou?"

"We have people over there too," Little Tiger couldn't hold back; but he was a little incoherent or didn't answer the question.

"I've been there a few times," Yaoqun took over the conversation. "People in the village often go there, especially Little Tiger, although he's small, he won't get lost inside or outside the customs... His memory is particularly scientific, whether it's people, places, or things, he'll never forget it once he's seen it; and even in the dark, when you can't see your hand in front of your face, he can recognize the direction." Yaoqun explained another of Little Tiger's strengths.

"Good!" W stood up and looked at his watch, "Need to pack up a bit..." he said, glancing around the room.

I also stood up; "We can wait in the car"? Thinking that Yaoqun and the others might need to tidy up their clothes and supplies or something.

"There's nothing to tidy up," Yaoqun said with a smile, "We're always prepared, ready to go. Everyone is familiar with each other, just a greeting!"

Before she finished speaking, Little Tiger had already opened the wardrobe, took out a small leather suitcase and a cloth bag, and held them in his hands. His movements were clean and neat, extremely fast; in the light flowing from his big round eyes, there was an unspeakable smile. (End of Chapter 3)

We have decided to send these 1,284 votes, along with the complete original envelopes with postmarks, to the Municipal Council for reference this morning by a special person. We believe that the Municipal Council will not ignore the opinions expressed in this vote when discussing this case.

However, there is one flaw. In the questions we prepared at the time, we did not more specifically solicit "whether the opposition to or support for horse racing is unconditional or conditional." For example, what about holding it in Jiangwan or Yinxiang Port? This is a regrettable thing. Fortunately, the Council will discuss this case soon. The many gentlemen and talented people will certainly have brilliant and perfect solutions.

### The Horse Racing Ban Should Not Be Lifted —The People's Opinions—

— Weng Zhengping

If the horse racing ban is lifted, it has nothing to do with us low-level staff. We simply don't have the "leisure" to talk about horse racing. As for those who are bankrupted by horse racing, they are ultimately the self-inflicted results of the "leisure class," and we don't need to sympathize with them. At the same time, it can give some unemployed staff in the horse racing association a chance to be "reinstated." On the one hand, the municipal government's tax revenue can increase to 300 to 500 million, which is a win-win situation. Why not do it?

But then again, if horse racing has so many good reasons, why was it banned when the banner of victory fluttered to Shanghai in the first place? Is it because it was one time then and another time now? As for saying that this is legitimate entertainment, then why does the capital ban dancing? After all, dancing does not have gambling properties. I wonder if the gentlemen who are advocating for the opening of the horse racing ban have considered this point and have a self-justifying place?

If the government has the responsibility to lead the people, then what benefits will horse racing bring to people? Is it true that this piece of land is useless except for horse racing? I really don't understand! President Chiang Kai-shek said: "The governance and chaos of the country, and the rise and fall of the nation, often depend on the social atmosphere. The social atmosphere of our China has been affected by unequal treaties, rooted in the concessions, and manifested as 'bad habits.' Now that the unequal treaties have been abolished and the concessions no longer exist, then whose hands will the responsibility of shifting the social atmosphere be in?" Here is a very clear indication for us, which is the responsibility of the people themselves. The government has the responsibility to lead the people, so if the horse racing ban is lifted, will the social atmosphere shift? If it can't be shifted, if it is considered a matter of course, we can ask the government to restore massage parlors and singing girl guide societies, because there is also a group of unemployed people there, and there is also a lot of tax revenue!

Fortunately, the Municipal Council has opened, and as representatives of the citizens, they can make great speeches. Whether or not to open the horse racing ban, we small people once voted for you!

To repeat: The horse racing ban should not be lifted, this is the people's request!

### Regarding the Racecourse

— Jin Sheng

Regarding the racecourse, I have the following opinions: (1) The concession was recovered long ago with the victory, and the sovereignty of the racecourse should be managed by the Chinese. All the few Westerners who are indispensable can only participate as consultants. (2) Considering that in civilized cities around the world, there are no racecourses located in the downtown area, once the competition stirs up dust, it will greatly harm the health of the citizens. Moreover, the gains and losses are quite large, which can easily foster an immoral atmosphere. (3) If the policy of prohibition through taxation is implemented and the horse racing ban is lifted, a new location can be found in the suburbs of Shanghai. "There is also a racecourse east of Jiangwan," and someone once advocated a plan to revitalize "New Shanghai." I think there are also many open spaces there that can be used, so that the "bourgeoisie" have four-wheeled "cars" and it doesn't matter if it's farther away. The so-called distance of ten feet keeps the eyes clear.

### Child Talk, Mother

— Wu Xiaotian

"Mother boiled coffee and brewed a cup for everyone. She put more sugar in Dad's cup each time than in mine. I clamored to have the same amount of sugar as Dad's cup, and she said to me, 'Eating too much sugar will hurt your teeth.'"

"Why doesn't it hurt Dad's teeth when he puts more sugar in his cup?" I thought to myself, but seeing that there was less sugar in Mom's cup than in mine, I didn't say anything." This is what a most intelligent six-year-old child said.

### A Casual Discussion on Suicide

— Zhengfan

Suicide in Shanghai is an old problem, but this problem has never been cured.

This shows the instability of society.

The reason why these suicides hurt themselves is that the vast majority are due to difficulties in making a living, followed by family discord, love suicides, and mental disorders.

In addition to these reasons, in the past, many people committed suicide out of grief and indignation over national affairs. More than ten years ago, She Yi, a supervisor of the Supervisory Yuan, drowned himself in Xuanwu Lake, and countless patriotic people committed suicide after the May Thirtieth Massacre, hoping to awaken the people, and in 1936, Zhou Zixin, a 14-year-old elementary school student, committed suicide by swallowing nitric acid water. All belong to this category.

In suicide cases, there are many questions worth studying for general psychologists. To give an example: Ten years ago, Guan Zhenduo, a Manchu from Beiping, usually liked to read novels such as Dream of the Red Chamber and Flowers in the Mirror. One night, while attending to his great-grandmother's illness, he couldn't sleep, and suddenly had a strange idea and hanged himself. After his death, people from all sides speculated on the reason, but ultimately could not find an appropriate explanation.

But no matter what the reason, suicides are not worthy of sympathy. Legally, suicide is a crime, but it cannot be enforced.

According to statistics, Switzerland has the highest suicide rate in European countries. The reason is that most patients are recuperating in Switzerland, and often when they find that they cannot recover their health, they simply commit suicide. In Asia, Japan is clearly the "most suicidal nation." Their "seppuku" and "jumping into volcanoes" are unique suicide methods handed down from their ancestors.

Suicide Nations

There used to be a "Suicide Society" in Tokyo. The society stipulated that if a member committed suicide first, other members should be notified immediately, and the second member had to commit suicide within six months. The secret must not be revealed until all members have committed suicide. But later, the local police station found a copy of the society's constitution next to a suicide member and began to investigate and ban it.

Atami, Japan, is a famous suicide city. The seaside there has beautiful scenery, and at least twenty people commit suicide by jumping into the sea every day and night, mostly due to love deaths.

Dr. Keogh Clarke of England once statistically analyzed the suicide methods used by men and women in Europe over a period of twenty years. The conclusion was that men most often committed suicide by hanging, followed by shooting and placing themselves on the railway; women most often committed suicide by drowning, followed by taking poison and being crushed to death. However, Clarke's statistics were many years ago. Today, the most common means of suicide is taking poison, accounting for more than 70% of cases. Swallowing lysol, bedbug powder, opium, sleeping pills, DDT "insecticides"... there are many names, too many to list in detail. This can also be taken as evidence of the development of urban science (? ) Research on Suicide

The age at which people are most likely to commit suicide is between 20 and 30 years old. According to statistics, May is the month with the most suicides, and suicides occur most often around 10:00 PM. Usually, there are more male suicides than female suicides.

Suicide is also closely related to the weather. According to the research results of mental hygienists, a tragedy of suicide is most likely to occur when the humidity is between 65 and 80 degrees, the air pressure is between 754 mm and 767 mm, and the temperature is between 20 and 23 degrees Celsius.

Finally, I would like to point out in particular that the suffering of suicides is caused by the shortcomings of society. To get rid of this suffering, the only way is to stand up and engage in the work of transforming society. Seeking relief from suicide is the most cowardly and foolish inferior strategy!

### Li Mo'an, the Scholar General

— Jin Xia

The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the First Pacification Zone, Lieutenant General Li Mo'an, who is responsible for ensuring the security of the entire Jiangsu Province and parts of Zhejiang and Anhui, is a typical "scholar general."

Rich Experience

He is from Changsha, Hunan Province, a graduate of the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy and the second class of the Army University's General Class. He is forty-two years old, but has more than twenty years of experience in military administration and combat. During his tenure as "Director of Education at the Southwest Cadre Training Class," he trained more than 8,000 junior and middle-level cadres. He also taught for a period of time. He is the author of six works, including: "National Defense Speeches," "A Consistent Theory of Military Administration and Combat," "Military Education and Youth Training," "Problems in Military Education," and "Essentials of the Officers Corps," all of which are valuable military writings.

The General's experience: In March of the fourteenth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1925], he was just a second lieutenant platoon leader, but due to his military exploits, he was successively promoted to company, battalion, and regimental commander. By December of the twenty-eighth year [i.e., 1939], he was honorably appointed as the Lieutenant General Commander-in-Chief of the Xiang-E Border Area Advance Army. In September of the thirty-first year [i.e., 1942], he was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Thirty-second Army Group. In July of this year, he assumed the post of Lieutenant General Commander-in-Chief of the First Pacification Zone.

British King Awards Medal

He has successively been awarded the Third Class Shih Ting Medal, the Third Class Yun Hui Medal, the Loyalty and Diligence Medal, the First Class Grade A Medal of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the First Class Kan Cheng Medal by the National Government. In the thirty-fourth year of the Republic [i.e., 1945], he was awarded the C.B.E. (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) Medal by King George VI of England. These many special honors are proof of his loyalty and meritorious service.

Li's military administration is very strict, emphasizing discipline. He also pays attention to regularity in his private life, and it is said that he does not become arrogant despite his important position. He most enjoys appreciating music and calligraphy, and in his spare time, he loves to study and read books, newspapers, and magazines. He has a lot of experience in organizing materials. His favorite sports are horseback riding and playing tennis.

His wife, Madam Gu Xiuling, can be described as a virtuous helper. They have three sons and five daughters, all of whom are studying in primary and secondary schools. The family always maintains due harmony.

Amiable Demeanor

Li's personality can be measured from an interesting anecdote. When he was a brigade commander, he once went to the theater with a friend. The orderly bought the tickets, and the friend and the orderly entered first. Li was slightly behind and was stopped by the ticket collector. He explained that the tickets had been bought by the soldier in front of him. Because Li was wearing a long gown that day and was of short stature, resembling a small businessman, the guard stationed in the theater thought that Li was trying to see the show for free under false pretenses, so he used his rifle to drive Li away, a very embarrassing situation. Later, the orderly came out to look for his master and, seeing this situation, stepped forward to scold the reckless guard. Although Li was insulted, he was not angry and comforted the flustered guard with a smile, saying that his anger was his duty and there was no fault. At the same time, he stopped his own orderly from hitting anyone. We feel that this kind of situation is most needed for soldiers; otherwise, it will be difficult to integrate the military and the people, and officers and subordinates.

In today's world where military vehicles run rampant, soldiers are arrogant, and everyone looks askance, one cannot help but miss the demeanor of this scholar general, a truly exemplary soldier!
