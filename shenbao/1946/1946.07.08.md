In the future, our compatriots across the country must use the spirit of perseverance and fortitude from the early days of the War of Resistance, work together with one heart and one mind, and strive to implement the Three Principles of the People and build our Republic of China into a prosperous, strong, healthy and happy modern nation, able to survive permanently in the world with freedom, independence, and honor.

### Chairman's Memorial Text to the Military and Civilians Who Died in the War

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Chairman Chiang's memorial text to the military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance is as follows: On July 7th, the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government, respectfully offers incense, flowers, and clear wine to the spirits in heaven of the military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance, saying: The Lugou Bridge incident was the serious opening, leading soldiers to share the same hatred. Pitying soldiers in a righteous battle is the path to victory. Accumulating centuries of shame, we hope to wash it away together. Stirred by righteous anger, the military and civilians became one. Going through fire and water, we must fight for every inch of land. Our spirit forms fortresses, and our flesh and blood form walls. The flames of the enemy were rampant, and the disparity in strength was great. We were never expected to contain voracious boars and long snakes. The vast Central Plains were filled with haze, and fertile land and famous cities became dens of bandits. We fought one battle after another, with those in the front falling and those in the rear rising. Cutting open our intestines and severing our throats, we pitied our blue blood and green compassion. We pushed back thousands of men, and crushed tens of thousands of cavalry. We charged and fought ten times, seizing flags and planting our own. We galloped south and north, across rivers and mountains. The mountains were strange and lured the enemy, with mountains so short that they appeared as dragons. When silent, we hid our swords, and when moving, we were as sharp as an awl. Weak rain and smoke cleared, and the light of swords flashed. All of our comrades, in their battle gowns, valued death more than tying their helmets' straps. One sleep lasts for eternity, and their imposing spirit still lives on. Hermits inspired their ideals, like a gentle breeze. Wang Qi wielded his spear, even at a young age. Pure women maintained their chastity, as pure as white snow. They refused to be defiled by righteousness, and fulfilled their great integrity. Their integrity was multifaceted, and their difficulties were manifold. The Kunlun Mountains were ablaze, and jade and stone were broken together. They sought peace of mind with their inherent goodness. They exchanged life for death, so how could we call it a hundred difficulties? Changshan had a tongue, and Suiyang had teeth. One heart and one mind, antiquity had never seen this. Those who gain the Way receive much help, and the soldiers unite in alliance. We accepted the surrender overseas, and captured the capital from the bandits. The jade candle has been re-adjusted, and the golden goblet is without flaw. We will forever remember the merits of the revival of the nation with the spirits of the former martyrs. Soldiers rest at Zhongling, and the stone city is tall and strong. I report to the nine netherworlds, using cloth to express my grief. I will lie down and remember Du Yu, and beat the drum and think of Zai Jiang. Transforming into a thousand million bodies, may you be your son’s advisor. With yellow bananas and red lychees, I offer clear wine. If your spirit is not dim, please acknowledge this sincerity. Alas! I hope...

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 7th] After the army rested, the Communist Army that attacked the national army at Mashan, Jimo, launched fierce attacks for days without success. On the morning of the 5th, they collapsed and retreated on their own, and their main force of 20,000 people fled towards Lancun.

### The Communist Party Insists on the Original Proposal for the Issue of Troop Stationing, Only Allowing Withdrawal from Harbin

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] According to a source from the Communist Party: The results of the three talks of the Five-Person Meeting have been reported to the headquarters of the Communist Party, but there is no response yet. As for the issue of troop stationing, the Communist Party has no new opinions on the withdrawal of troops from northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and Rehe, and insists on the original conditions. The only place that the Communist Party can withdraw from is Harbin, and it only allows the government to send 5,000 security troops to be stationed there. Local administration will be organized by people's elections and form a coalition government, but this is only the opinion of the Communist Party.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The Five-Person Meeting of the government and Communist Party representatives is taking a break today. It is heard that due to the Communist Party's unwillingness to withdraw from northern Jiangsu and its objections to withdrawing from Rehe and Jiaodong, the issue of the administrative power of the Communist Army's stationed areas and the Communist Army's occupied areas has not achieved significant results. The government representatives have now reported the progress of the talks to Chairman Chiang through Shao Lizi. News tonight is that the Five-Person Meeting is still planning to continue, and it is said that it will still be held at Chen Cheng's residence or Shao Lizi's residence on Langya Road at 9:00 tomorrow morning, but the notice has not yet been issued as of midnight tonight.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] According to qualified observers, although what is being discussed at the Five-Person Meeting is a local political issue related to military affairs, if it proceeds smoothly, it will be of great benefit to the negotiation of other issues. At present, due to the Communist Party's lack of sincerity, the progress of the talks is slow, resulting in dull news. The people of the country are mostly anxious and hope that the Communist Party will quickly negotiate with the government in good faith, and it is best to implement some possible solutions, such as the withdrawal of the Communist Army from Harbin City, Rehe, and northern Jiangsu, without further delay, so that the people can alleviate their suffering, which is also beneficial to the Communist Party, because any political party that sings highly of democracy can never ignore the suffering of the people for long and act recklessly by harming the people.

[United Press, Nanjing, 7th] According to extremely well-informed sources, today's report to the United Press reporter that General Chen Cheng had stated that most of the main issues of troop reduction had been resolved yesterday is not true. The above-mentioned person also confirmed that the issue of the National Assembly was discussed yesterday.

### Vietnamese Defeated Soldiers Near Lang Son Loot Our Supply Convoy, Our Escorting Officers Dispatch Teams to Pursue Them

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 6th] The armed conflict between the Viet Minh and the Vietnamese Nationalist Party has stopped in several areas. However, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party troops are still concentrated in Anbai awaiting assistance. The Viet Minh is also preparing for future battles. The future depends on whether the mediation of the Vietnamese Democratic Party can take effect. In mid-last month, the 2nd Honor Division of the Chinese Army had equipment transported from Kunming to supplement the division's deployment to Japan. Part of it was looted between Dongdeng and Lang Son. The division reported that the Viet Minh and the Vietnamese Nationalist Party frequently clashed between Dongdeng and Lang Son. Before the military supplies passed through, the French military authorities in northern Vietnam were requested to send troops to protect them. However, the French side's response was delayed by two days compared to our planned transportation date. When our escorting troops escorted the military supplies through the conflict area on time, the defeated soldiers of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party, who had been defeated by the Viet Minh, were retreating towards the Chinese border. They encountered our supply convoy on the way, and two vehicles full of ammunition were parked for engine repairs. They were looted by these defeated soldiers. Our escorting officers have dispatched teams to pursue them. Details of the losses are still under investigation.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 7th and met with reporters from the Central News Agency at his residence. Regarding the recent domestic cotton supply situation, he said that according to the Ministry's investigation, the cotton supply is and will be very abundant. As of the end of July this year, the estimated stock of imported cotton in China, including post-war relief cotton, is about 800,000 bales. According to the usual domestic stock in previous years, it was only 300,000 bales, which is more than 500,000 bales more than the usual stock. In addition, domestic new cotton will be available in September. Although this year's output still needs to be determined by the weather, experts estimate that it will be about 500,000 to 800,000 bales, which, together with the above-mentioned stock, is enough to meet the needs of domestic yarn factories for one year. Minister Wang also said that from the time of Japan's surrender to the end of July this year, the estimated import of cotton required by domestic yarn factories was 450,000 bales, but the actual import has reached 1,250,000 bales. Compared with the annual import of only 300,000 bales from the pre-war Republic of China years 23 to 25, there is absolutely no shortage of cotton supply in the country.

US military personnel are generally not allowed to go out at night, movies and other gatherings have been suspended, all soldiers have been issued mosquito nets, and DDT pesticide has been thoroughly sprayed. According to military doctors, the disease is caused by mosquito bites, or possibly by human contact.

### Editorial: Why is China Subjected to Such Humiliation?

Yesterday, our fellow countrymen, amidst the painful memories of the "July 7th" War of Resistance Memorial, felt an indescribable humiliation in our international standing! And this unexpected humiliation came from our ally – the Soviet Union – with whom we have strived for amity for eighty-nine years, truly making the 450 million people of China feel extremely surprised!

The matter is as follows: The Foreign Ministers' Conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union decided to convene a twenty-one-nation peace conference on July 29th to discuss draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov suddenly insisted that China should not be invited as a convening nation of the peace conference. United States Secretary of State Byrnes immediately refuted this, considering that this act was tantamount to insulting China. British Foreign Secretary Bevin proposed several suggestions to establish an agreement on the method of invitation, but all were blocked by Molotov. Finally, the Soviet opinion was accepted, with only the four powers – the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union – acting as inviting nations. Later, due to unresolved discussions on the conference procedures, invitations have not yet been sent. Our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued an important statement the day before yesterday, advocating that the Paris Peace Conference should be convened by all members of the "Foreign Ministers' Council," otherwise, the Chinese government would consider it a violation of the Moscow Agreement. Regarding this matter, we believe that Byrnes's statement that it is "tantamount to insulting China" is not an exaggeration. Whether the Soviet Union intended it or not, it will somewhat affect the Chinese people's feelings of friendship towards the Soviet Union over the years. This is very regrettable.

How to convene the twenty-one-nation peace conference to discuss the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, and which country should invite the participating nations, originally seemed like not a significant issue. But why do we attach so much importance to it? This is a matter of etiquette in the international arena, and also a matter of the effectiveness of resolutions passed at international conferences. If everyone speaks of trust and amity, yet can deliberately disregard allies, and if everyone solemnly agrees to a meeting, yet can erase resolutions, how can there be a harmonious and peaceful atmosphere in the international community in the future? According to the announcement of the Potsdam Conference by the three great powers – the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union – on August 2, 1945, the "Foreign Ministers' Council" was to be formed by the five nations of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, responsible for discussing and concluding peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, and proposing solutions to territorial issues that became common outstanding matters after the European war. Furthermore, according to the Moscow Agreement of the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the three nations – the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union – on December 24 of the same year, this peace treaty should be drafted by the representatives of the four foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, and the peace conference to discuss this draft peace treaty should be convened by the "Foreign Ministers' Council" consisting of the five nations of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. According to the announcements of these two international conferences, China should undoubtedly be one of the inviting nations for the twenty-one-nation peace conference. Why did the Soviet Foreign Minister insist on changing the content of the invitation to "The French government, in accordance with the decision of the Foreign Ministers' Council on July 4th, has the honor to invite (so and so) to attend the peace conference on behalf of the Four Foreign Ministers' Council," deliberately excluding China from the convening nations of the peace conference? This is not only an insult to the status of China, which fought alongside them during World War II, but also the beginning of arbitrarily abandoning existing international agreements. "Treading on frost leads to hard ice," which is indeed worth our vigilance!

Although China, in this World War, due to geographical constraints, could not directly participate in the European theater and fight against Nazi Germany and its vassals, it consistently held back more than a million of the Japanese enemy's troops, causing them to be mired in China and unable to provide effective assistance to Germany and Italy, which cannot but be said to be China's contribution. Especially for the Soviet Union, during the German-Soviet war, the reason it did not have to face enemies on two fronts and Japan consistently maintained a delicate friendly relationship with the Soviet Union, one cannot fail to recognize that this was due to China's efforts in resisting Japan. Moreover, looking back, throughout the entire course of this war, China was at the forefront of anti-aggression, the vanguard of safeguarding world peace, which cannot be denied by any country. The United Kingdom and the United States, which fought alongside China in the Far East, naturally understand China's heavy burden in the war, and even the Soviet Union knows in its heart that China's resistance against Japan in the Far East is equivalent to the Soviet Union's resistance against Germany in Europe, and is in no way inferior. But why does Molotov despise China so much today? Any Chinese person with a bit of conscience, if their innate goodness has not been extinguished, should deeply reflect!

Let us further examine our country's diplomacy during and after the war. In any international conference, we have consistently adopted an impartial and detached attitude. When there are irreconcilable disputes, we often act as mediators, resolving difficulties, hoping that the international community can "unite" rather than "divide." Even between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States, we always try to be their bridge, facilitating communication and cooperation, preventing them from going their separate ways. The reason why our country does this is not only because we value friendship with the Soviet Union, but also because we deeply feel the importance of creating world peace and dare not take it lightly. Moreover, in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, China even seeks the permanent consolidation of Sino-Soviet amity with a great spirit of self-sacrifice. We truly do not know why the Soviet Foreign Minister wants to insult China's international status to such an extent!

We remember a prominent figure in the Soviet Communist Party once said: "The Soviet Union must strengthen itself, then it can avoid being humiliated by others." Conversely, Molotov's humiliation of China this time is meant to give us Chinese people a shocking new lesson, which is tantamount to saying that China is a weak country and not a strong country. If China were truly as strong as the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Molotov would definitely not deliberately make us uncomfortable. Because of this, it is no wonder that the United States, wishing to see China become a strong, unified, and democratic China, is striving to provide military aid to China, assisting us in reorganizing and training our troops, while the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists are increasingly opposed to American aid to China, advocating that American troops withdraw from China. We firmly demand that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must argue reasonably, ensuring that the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union abide by the Potsdam Declaration and the Moscow Agreement, and respect China's status as an inviting nation to the peace conference. At the same time, we must awaken our compatriots to recognize the true nature of the international situation, distinguish the true value of allied friendship, and work together towards the goal of "Nation First, People First," strengthening ourselves and washing away external humiliation!

### Letter of Correction

I recently read the "Suzhou Quick Report: Qin Lianggong Commits Suicide by Slitting Throat" news item in the "Local Dispatches" section of your newspaper on the 4th of this month, which caused me great surprise. After investigation, Qin Nigong Lianggong had previously been sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment with parole by the Jiangsu High Court. Due to overcrowding in the High Court detention center, it was approved to transfer the first-instance judgment of the Han traitor to our prison for detention as a means of relief. The said traitor was transferred to our prison for detention on May 14th of this year. On July 3rd, we received the Jiang Su High Court Prosecutor's Office, Su Jian Zi No. 6889, instruction to send the written order of execution and other documents, and we will comply with the order to carry out the sentence. After investigation, said traitor Qin Lianggong has not engaged in any illegal activities since entering the prison. The suicide news reported by your newspaper is likely based on mistaken rumors. This matter concerns the reputation of our prison. I am writing to inform you accordingly, hoping you will investigate and make a correction. Thank you!

### Four Foreign Ministers Hold Lengthy Discussions; No Agreement Reached on Conference Procedures; Soviet Representative Again Obstructs

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, July 7th Broadcast: At the beginning of this week, the future of the Peace Conference is still uncertain. British Undersecretary of State Jebb proposed inviting Egypt and Austria to attend the Peace Conference. Egypt has a close relationship with the disposal of North African Italian colonies, and Italy will have the right to express its opinions. The three undersecretaries of state have agreed to consider Jebb's proposal.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, July 6th Electric] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference continued today to discuss the principles and procedures that should be followed at the Peace Conference on the 29th of this month. After four hours, no agreement was reached. The agenda proposed by the chairman, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, included three items: (1) Rules of procedure for the Peace Conference, (2) Reparations issues, (3) German issues. The first item alone took four hours. According to the above three items, the first and second items were drafted by the French delegation in April of this year, while the third item was recently proposed by the Soviet delegation.

[Reuters, Paris, July 6th Electric] The Four Powers Foreign Ministers continued to meet this afternoon to discuss the question of which country should be the inviting country for the 21-nation Peace Conference. The issue was discussed for several hours yesterday, without result, due to the inability to agree on whether China should be a convener of the Peace Conference together with the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. Under protest, Byrnes and Bevin had once accepted Molotov's request to agree that only the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France should be the conveners, but the Peace Conference invitations must be issued immediately and must not contain any insult to China. Unexpectedly, Molotov again obstructed, resolutely insisting that the Peace Conference procedural law must be drafted before the invitations are issued. Regarding this point, the other foreign ministers expressed that they could not accept it, so the determination of the convening countries of the Peace Conference and the drafting of procedural laws will continue to be discussed this afternoon.

[Associated Press, Washington, July 7th Electric] According to private predictions by diplomatic authorities here: Although the Four Foreign Ministers Conference has made progress on the work of the draft peace treaty, the Soviet Union will still try to prolong the period to keep its troops stationed in Eastern Europe. Otherwise, there will be a major change in Soviet foreign policy, and the tension between the great powers will also be greatly eased. The early withdrawal of occupying troops stationed in Europe is one of the goals of United States Secretary of State Byrnes. According to news received here, the issue of occupying troops has gradually become concrete. Byrnes advocates that the powers establish an agreement stipulating that troops should be withdrawn approximately three months after the signing of the peace treaty. Molotov, on the other hand, proposes that the date of withdrawal be decided on the date of ratification of the peace treaty. However, the period from the signing of the peace treaty to its ratification can take months or even years. If Molotov's proposal is accepted, then Soviet troops can remain stationed for a long time, which is contrary to the United States' intention to restore peace as soon as possible. There are at least 1.53 million Soviet troops stationed in Europe. There are approximately 600,000 Soviet troops in Germany, 350,000 in Poland, over 150,000 in Austria, and approximately 530,000 in the Balkans. As for Soviet military operations in Yugoslavia and Albania, they are even the subject of various rumors, but there are no official reports to date.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, July 7th Electric] Approximately 20,000 Italian citizens held a group demonstration in the People's Square here last night, protesting the Four Foreign Ministers Conference's decisions unfavorable to Italy. This demonstration has an anti-United Nations nature. When Fivola, chairman of the Italian War Veterans Association, gave a speech, the crowds responded with cries of "Down with England" and "Down with France." Fivola said, "France does not have an individual dictator like our Mussolini, but we have recently suffered from French slander and the entire French people should be held responsible." When Fivola referred to France as our "Latin sister country," his voice was interrupted by the crowd's shouts and boos, who yelled, "Shitty sister is not a Latin sister." Afterwards, the crowds marched in the streets, and when passing by buildings requisitioned by the French military authorities, the demonstrators showed contempt for the French flag and spat on it.

[Associated Press, Trieste Port, July 6th Electric] After the Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference decided to make Trieste an international free port, anti-United Nations demonstrations broke out here tonight. British troops used batons and tear gas to disperse the crowds. Hundreds of Italian youths threw bricks and stones at the huge building where most of the United Nations military government personnel reside, retreating and advancing like a tide.

### Anglo-Soviet Relations Improve; Soviet Press Focuses Attacks on the U.S.

[Reuters, Moscow, 6th] Moscow observers feel that the international outlook today is better than it has been for months. Moscow diplomats believe the outcome of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference has definitely improved the political atmosphere. Although observers believe this is a temporary phenomenon, with many difficulties remaining unsolved, any reduction in anxiety is still a partial victory. The Soviet people feel the success of the Foreign Ministers' Conference is due to the concessions and suggestions of the Soviet delegation. Recently, the target of attacks in the Soviet newspapers seems to have shifted from Britain to the United States, with the atomic bomb, Pan-Americanism, attempts to establish bases worldwide, and interference in China all being targeted. The future of Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations appears brighter, with the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan requiring various machines, which can be acquired from Britain in exchange for its surplus timber.

### The Inside and Out of British Politics

— Special Correspondent Xueyan, June 15th Airmail

Recently, British newspapers have rarely published news about China. It is said that one of the reasons is that after the Chinese government returned to Nanjing, the telecommunications between London and Nanjing/Shanghai have not yet returned to normal. Many important news items, when inquired about by the Chinese agencies in London, were often directly denied because they could not be verified. By the time they were confirmed, they had lost their news value.

General Public Opinion on China

Here's an example: regarding the partial reorganization of the Executive Yuan, only "The Times" published it, but the evidence was obviously not solid. Some time later, "The Observer" also mentioned it briefly, but other newspapers did not mention it at all. Also, only "The Times" reported on the National Army's entry into Changchun, while other newspapers did not publish it. However, although these news items were reported sparingly, they did not escape the attention of those concerned about Chinese affairs. The day after "The Times" published the news of the National Army entering Changchun and advancing towards Harbin (May 29th), it published a commentary stating that the prestige of the Central Government had been enhanced as a result, and that a compromise could be expected to be reached. It also said that although the true reason for not including the Three Eastern Provinces in the truce agreement between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was unknown, it may have been because the Central Government trusted the Sino-Soviet Treaty and believed that the recovery of the Three Eastern Provinces was not a problem based on legal rights; while the Communist Party was confident in its local strength, so it refused the entry of the Central Army and issued provocative remarks. But now the facts prove that resorting to force is not necessarily a one-sided privilege. Now the Communist Party is enthusiastic about the truce issue and has abandoned provocative remarks, while the Central Government has also stated that it is willing to resolve the Northeast issue peacefully. It is hoped that General Marshall's efforts to mediate will not be in vain.

Currently, British newspapers' opinions on China are very inconsistent, perhaps reflecting the uncertainty of the British people's attitude and policy towards China. In the several international conferences since the surrender of Germany and Japan, the trend of maintaining a balance of power and power diplomacy has become increasingly prevalent. Britain has enormous rights in the Far East. What will the relationship between China and Britain be in the future under the circumstances of great powers confronting each other? It is difficult to predict. If China is united and strong, Britain's relationship with China will naturally improve, and many problems will be easier to solve. If China remains divided and chaotic, just like before the war, and becomes prey for the great powers, then Britain, in the scramble for power and profit, has always been at the forefront and will never lag behind. Around the time of Japan's surrender, the British government and public seemed to expect that China might be an emerging nation in the world, so its policy towards China seemed to be willing to establish a new relationship on a certain degree of concession. But soon it saw China in a crisis of division, followed by endless disputes over the Three Eastern Provinces, and in the coastal areas, the newly recovered territories were in chaotic order, and the receiving personnel once again displayed ugly behavior. British public opinion then changed again. Although the newspapers often carried news about China, they were always contemptuous. The implication was that now that the war was over, China was once again embarking on the old path of division and corruption. Now that Changchun has been recovered, if peaceful unification succeeds, British public opinion can be expected to change again. In the diplomatic application after the war, it should not be a problem for Britain to find a Far Eastern country to establish a friendly cooperative relationship. Currently, the most likely one is naturally China. The so-called "China is the stabilizing force in the Far East" is of course attracting everyone's attention. But if China does not revitalize itself, and Japan's order is quickly restored, then at least Britain's attention can still be shifted to Japan.

The Golden Age of the Labour Party

Although former British Prime Minister Churchill is now out of office, his respect among the people seems to be growing stronger over time. Wherever he goes, he receives a warm welcome from the public, and his speeches and actions are often published in prominent positions in newspapers. Today in Edinburgh, the citizens gave him a new title; tomorrow in Manchester, the people gave him another new title. The people are very generous in bestowing on him all possible human honors. But strangely enough, despite enjoying such great fame and honor, the party he leads cannot win in elections, and its strength in local council re-elections is declining. Therefore, the most resounding slogan in the Conservative Party's advertisements for young party members is simply to ask them to look to the future. In fact, if we pay attention to the policies of the Conservative Party and the Labour Party, we will know that the Conservative Party's failure is not accidental. The characteristic of the Labour Party's policy is the nationalization of large enterprises, seeking the greatest welfare for the middle and lower classes of society. It goes without saying that major mineral products, heavy industrial factories, and railway companies will all be acquired by the state; even some professions related to public welfare, such as medical services, will also be run by the state. For a few owners, it is true that they have lost their family inheritance for generations; but for general consumers and hard-working workers, nationalization is much more reasonable after all. The Conservative Party does not have a clear policy to counter this. It only knows how to make things difficult for the government everywhere. Whenever the government wants to implement a plan, the Conservative Party always opposes it in Parliament. The policy of the opposition party seems to have only one opposition policy. Now, because of the disparity in numbers and the unequal strength of the two sides, opposition cannot succeed, so it can only adopt delaying tactics at most, delaying the implementation of government policies as much as possible. The general public has a rather negative impression of it. Therefore, even with Churchill's achievements and fame, it cannot save the Conservative Party's decline. The British people today, on the one hand, spare no effort to bestow various honors on Churchill, and on the other hand, do not allow his party to rule. This is not a contradiction, but because the people's level of political knowledge is very high. They distinguish between rewarding virtue and making use of it, and do not confuse the two. Churchill made great contributions to the country in the past, so the people added honors to show that they are not ungrateful. But his party's policies are useless today, so they do not harm the government because of a person. Only when the people's level of knowledge reaches this level can politics be clear and progressive.

There is no doubt that the Labour Party is now in its golden age. Every bill proposed by the government can be passed in Parliament. Even if there are occasional vacancies due to the death of old members, most of those elected in by-elections are Labour Party members. But whether such good times can last is another question. The Labour Party is in its golden age, and many policies advocated by the Labour Party have also been implemented. It is naturally impossible for the people to think that this is ideal and that no further progress should be sought. For example, the nationalization policy is originally a gradual form of socialism. The purpose is to transfer private enterprises to public ownership, but compensation is still given to the old owners. But the problem lies here. Many young and radical people have expressed dissatisfaction with this, advocating unconditional nationalization. At the very least, the value of compensation should not be set so high, which would only allow those with good fathers and mothers to sit back and eat. Especially like railway companies, because they lost money during the war, the government plans to buy them. It must first raise the price of tickets to pay off the old debts before setting a price for acquisition. It makes people feel that the rich are risk-free, and the losses are only shared by the public. They can steadily climb into their old capital. Today, those who have this kind of thinking are naturally still a minority, but among young people, some have already said that if the Conservative Party can cooperate with the Communist Party, it can win the next election. At present, this is of course a joke, but in the future, those who can overthrow the Labour Party government must have policies that are more progressive and more active than the Labour Party, which is quite accurate.

The Food Minister's Sorrow

Currently, there is a global famine, and food is scarce everywhere. Britain is a small island nation with a large population. Two-thirds of its food needs to be shipped from overseas, so it naturally feels even more difficult. Former Food Minister Smith happened to be in this position and was faced with this difficult situation, and he felt that his efforts were not appreciated. Since last winter, the grievances of the people who were dissatisfied with the current diet have all been directed at him alone. The newspapers of the opposition party even identified him as a good target for attacking the government and opened fire on him. In addition, there was a severe food shortage in the British occupied zone in Germany, and the amount of distribution was far from comparable to the American and Soviet military zones. He was forced to go to the United States to discuss the matter, but the result seemed to be unsuccessful. He could only further reduce the allocation of bread and fat in Britain to help Germany in an emergency. But this also aroused the resentment of the British people, so speculation that he was uneasy in his position had already spread. However, on the one hand, three important ministers of the cabinet were in India, Bevin was busy attending the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, and Morrison also had a trip to the United States. Only the Prime Minister was in charge in the cabinet, so the announcement of the change of ministers was slightly delayed, at least waiting for Bevin and Morrison to return home. Secondly, the difficulty of British food is not just a matter of personal talent. Without external assistance, a clever woman cannot cook without rice. Even if Smith stepped down, it would be difficult for others to succeed him. Until recently, Morrison returned from the United States and had a solution to the food problem. The aid to the occupied zone in Germany no longer needs to rely on the rationing of the British people, so it was time to announce the change of food minister (May 27th). Smith's parting words were that he regretted that he could not improve the people's menu during his tenure and hoped that his successor would not be as unfortunate as he was. The new Food Minister is Strachey, who was originally the Undersecretary of the Air Force and has always been regarded as a promising talent among rising stars. In his first reception of reporters after taking office, he said that he would strive to improve the menu so that it would not be as monotonous as it is now and hoped to purchase and sell fruits.

The Subtle Relationship Between Britain and Spain

The Franco regime has become an object of curses today. Many countries want to take advantage of the newly won power of democracy to overthrow him in one fell swoop and eliminate the remnants of this fascist inferior species. But when this issue was truly brought to the Security Council of the United Nations, and action was proposed, although no one openly opposed it, implementation was unexpectedly difficult. To understand the key to this, the problem lies again with Britain. In August of last year, after the Potsdam Conference ended, the three powers' resolution condemning the Franco regime was announced, and the British Labour Cabinet was also newly formed. Foreign Secretary Bevin explained the new cabinet's foreign policy in the House of Commons, and when he mentioned the Franco regime, he said that he had no goodwill towards the Franco regime and hoped that the Spanish people would automatically rise up and correct this mistake. But at the same time, he also stated that Britain was unwilling to participate in the use of external force to interfere in Spain's internal affairs, because once there was external interference, it would provoke the national emotions of the Spanish people and unanimously support Franco, and the Franco regime might become even more consolidated as a result. This theory has always been prevailing in the Security Council. No one sympathizes with Franco, but any proposal that can truly shake the Franco regime has the risk of arousing Spanish national emotions, which is also the risk of obtaining the opposite result, so they are all opposed. The implication is that the Security Council can only help Franco, and the Franco regime has a chance to diminish. Britain and Australia sang, the United States echoed, and many other countries followed. The Franco regime was thus preserved and stabilized under this subtle argument. Everyone knows this trick, but the question is why Britain wants to protect Franco? Politically speaking, maintaining the balance of power in Europe is of course the main reason. Regardless of whether Nazism can be revived in the future, there is no immediate danger of it rising again in the short term. On the contrary, the opposition between Eastern and Western democracies is very sharp. There are already too many countries in Europe that are close to the Soviet Union. Franco, regardless of his past, is still a mainstay in the midst of the left-leaning transformation of many countries. Why should he be overthrown? After Germany and Italy were defeated, Spain's foreign trade has all shifted to the hands of Britain and the United States. As far as Britain is concerned, in the spring of 1938, the spring of the last year before the war, Britain's total foreign trade was valued at over 208.5 million pounds, of which trade with Spain accounted for over 2.4 million pounds. This year, in the same quarter, Britain's total foreign trade was over 203.2 million pounds, and the total amount still cannot catch up with the pre-war level, which is naturally because many factories have not fully recovered to their original state; but trade with Spain has more than doubled compared to that year, amounting to over 5.9 million pounds, and there is still hope for an increase in the future. Considering this deal, Britain also hopes that Spain's internal stability will not change again. It is no wonder that the French trade union is asking the government to block the French-Spanish border, while at the same time studying countermeasures on how to maintain France's trade with Spain, so that it will not be entirely taken away by Britain due to the border blockade. Franco is of course also very aware of this subtle relationship and is trying to use the opportunity to change British public opinion. It is said that he spent a lot of money on public relations in London, creating luxurious clubs and the like to celebrate with the British government and public, and hired Professor Baxter, a Spanish professor at the University of London, to preside over the design. It is believed that there will be some results in the future.

### The Mournful Wind and Rain Commemorate the Fallen: More Than Two Thousand People from All Walks of Life Participate in the Memorial Service for Martyrs and Civilians. General He Yingqin Attends and Delivers a Speech. The Assembly Presents Souvenirs to the Families of the Deceased and the Allied Forces Stationed in Shanghai

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday was the first July 7th Memorial Day after the victory. At 9:00 AM, people from all walks of life in the city held a memorial service for the military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance at the Tianchan Theater. Those who attended included Chairman Wu Guozhen, Xuan Tiewu, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Wu Shaoshu, Zhou Xuexiang, Qian Jianqiu, and other representatives from all walks of life, totaling more than two thousand people. General He Yingqin, head of the military delegation that is about to go to the United States, also attended the event. The venue was decorated solemnly and solemnly, with elegiac couplets and eulogies hanging all over the walls. The horizontal area of the spiritual platform was inscribed with "Eternal Glory of China", with the "Killing to Become Benevolent and Righteousness Survives for All Time, Vowing to Serve the Country with Great Righteousness for Thousands of Autumns" from the Association of Martyrs' Comrades and other elegiac couplets on both sides. The memorial tablet was painted with red silk, and the portrait of the Premier was hung in front. The red silk was bright, and the stage was full of wreaths. Around the flower building were hung

More than 30 portraits of martyrs who died in this city, and the scene was tragic. At half past nine, mourning music was played, and after the ceremony, the whole hall was silent for three minutes. Then, wreaths were presented, the assembly read the eulogy (see below), and presented souvenirs to the families of the martyrs.

Chairman Wu Guozhen delivered a speech, briefly saying: Today, we mourn the military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance, and we have mixed feelings. Looking back to the beginning of the War of Resistance, the Battle of Shanghai made the international community recognize the bravery of our military and civilians. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, soldiers sacrificed their flesh and blood, and the people endured hardships and hardships, and were displaced. Finally, relying on consistent efforts and the assistance of the Allied nations, we achieved the final victory. Now, the future of nation-building is still in a difficult stage, and I hope that the people will continue to work hard with the spirit of struggle they had before. After the mayor's speech, the presidium read a telegram of thanks to US President Truman and reported on the presentation of souvenirs such as signed booklets of the US military in Shanghai. Finally, He Yingqin delivered a speech. Mr. He wore a military uniform, with the rank of general and a chest full of medals. At the beginning of his speech, he said: Today, to commemorate July 7th, we should pay tribute to the supreme leader and express our gratitude to the spirit of the Father of the Nation and the military and civilians who died in the war. Then, he put forward six points of thought: Our country has been weak for a hundred years, which has led to the enemy's invasion. The reason for this lies in the general people's lack of the concept of a national state. After eight years of the War of Resistance, we should have a deep awareness of this. The final victory of the War of Resistance was due to the wise leadership of the leader and the concentration of the people's will, so we should strengthen unity and consolidate unity in the future. In the eight years of the War of Resistance, there were 22 major battles, 1,117 important battles, and 38,931 minor battles. More than 1.31 million officers and soldiers were killed in battle, and more than 1.8 million were missing. The number of civilians who died is even countless. This great sacrifice is enough to show that the victory was extremely difficult to obtain, so we must work harder to ensure victory and not miss the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build the country. The enemy Japan also suffered extremely heavy casualties and losses. This is certainly the aggressor's own retribution, and it is also enough to teach the world that countries and people must treat each other with sincerity and morality. Our country's science is backward, and there is a lack of talent, which affects all work in a non-trivial way, so we must promote the development of science and heavy industry in the future. The Allied nations, especially the United States, provided the most assistance to our country during the War of Resistance. Today, to commemorate July 7th, we should express our deep gratitude. He also reported on the repatriation of Japanese prisoners and the receipt of weapons after the victory, with a total of more than 1.25 million prisoners, more than 780,000 enemy nationals (excluding the Northeast), more than 680,000 rifles, more than 29,000 machine guns, more than 12,400 artillery pieces, 383 tanks, 5 armored vehicles, more than 15,700 trucks, more than 74,000 horses, 1,068 aircraft, and 1,400 ships. Finally, He also emphasized that all our people should take the interests of the nation and the country as the premise to promote unity and to achieve the goal of nation-building. After the speech, music was played and the meeting was adjourned.

Eulogy of the Assembly

"On July 7th, the 35th year of the Republic of China, Wu Guozhen, Chairman of the Memorial Service for the Military and Civilians Who Died in the War of Resistance from all walks of life in Shanghai, and representatives from all walks of life, respectfully offer clear wine and humble offerings to the spirits of the military and civilian martyrs, saying: In the vast land of China, originating from Kunlun, the Chinese people have worked hard and exhausted their intelligence and ability, opening up territories and expanding the land, with fields and ridges crisscrossing, rivers and mountains forming belts, abundant cultural relics, and a flourishing nation; In modern times, the country is weak and the people are poor, and the tigers and wolves are coveting, launching an invasion, entering our empty house and occupying our cities; Killing our compatriots and hindering our survival. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, it was even more difficult. The brave soldiers fell forward and followed each other, the people of insight and benevolence rose up, their blood was red and bright, and they promoted righteousness. With sincerity, they completed the victory and should build the country in accordance with the principles. We only tell the heroic souls, and we hope that they will be relieved. The fragrance of pepper wine will be enjoyed forever. May you accept our offering."

Souvenirs Presented

### City Party Headquarters and Six Other Units Commemorate Martyred Comrades, Relatives' Representatives Present Four Hopes

The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters and six other organizations jointly hosted a memorial service for the Shanghai anti-Japanese war martyrs. The service was held at the Youth Hall yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, with over two hundred family members of the deceased comrades and martyrs, as well as representatives from various organizations and guests, in attendance. A banner with Chairman's inscription reading "Heroic Spirit Lives Forever" was hung in the center of the venue. The surroundings were filled with elegiac couplets and wreaths, along with over a hundred portraits of the martyrs. Above the altar were the memorial tablets for one hundred and fifteen martyrs, including Guo Dawei, Ping Zuren, and Du Gang. The meeting started punctually with the performance of ceremonial rites, followed by the reading of a eulogy by the chief celebrant, Li Shizeng. The eulogy read: "On this seventh day of July in the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, the China Seamen's Special Party Headquarters, the Special Party Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, the Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League, and the Shanghai Association of Comrades Who Perished During the Anti-Japanese War, respectfully offer incense and libations to the spirits of all the martyred comrades who died during the Anti-Japanese War. In the vast universe, among the myriad beings coming and going, wise men arise, and heroes emerge. With the outbreak of war, eight years of turmoil ensued, disasters flowed, and the Central Plains were shaken. Our patriots, long known for their integrity, shared hardships together and vowed eternal loyalty. You became national martyrs, unyielding and indomitable, achieving your aspirations, leaving behind lasting renown. Heaven blesses China; the enemy's ambitions were thwarted. They surrendered and submitted, and the wicked were warned. Alas, our martyrs, with the intention to achieve benevolence, witnessed this bright future, and righteous indignation was unleashed. Having perished in the line of duty, we who came after you feel ashamed. Remembering your noble deeds, sorrow rises. A bundle of hay and three rounds of turbid wine are offered. Pouring the libation and laying down the sacrifice, we pay our respects to your heroic spirits. Accept our humble offering." Next, members of the presidium and guests, including Central Committee Member Li Shizeng, Chairman Wu Shaoshu of the City Party Headquarters, Pan Gongzhan, Liu Weizhi, Fang Zhi, and Gu Zhengding, delivered speeches. Finally, Mrs. Yuan Qiongying, the widow of martyr Su Jiarong, spoke on behalf of the relatives of the deceased, stating, in brief, that she was deeply grateful for the memorial service held by various organizations and for their promise to assist the relatives of the deceased. However, she noted that the state, in managing affairs of state, might not be able to fully provide for the needs of the martyrs' families. Therefore, today, she represented the relatives of the deceased in presenting four hopes and requests: 1. The remains of the comrades should be given public burial by the government. 2. Traitors and war criminals should be severely punished. 3. The central government should be petitioned to educate the children of the deceased. 4. A monument to the martyrs should be erected. The ceremony concluded at 3:50 PM.

### More Twists and Turns Than a Detective Novel: The Whole Story of Rong Desheng's Kidnapping Comes to Light; Bandits Divided into Shanghai and Sheng County Gangs; Both Leaders Captured; Ransom Reached a Total of US$395,000

The kidnapping of flour and cotton magnate Rong Desheng, an event that has drawn national attention, has been subject to much public speculation since the victim was released. It has been learned that in addition to the two key criminals, Song Ersheng and Zheng Liantang, who were captured by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the main culprit, Luo Wenqing (also known as Luo Daqing, Uncle Luo), the leader of the Shanghai gang, and Yuan Zhongzhu (also known as Yuan Zhongshu), the leader of the Sheng County gang, have been arrested by personnel dispatched by the First Pacification Area Headquarters. In addition, Huang Shaoqin, Zhao Shaozong, Wu Zhigang, Liu Ruibiao, Yuan Zhengfei, Gu Chushi and six other individuals were also arrested. Together with the confession and stolen goods, they were transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters yesterday afternoon for joint interrogation. The process of solving the case was extremely tortuous and bizarre. Our reporter recently learned the details from relevant sources. The details are as follows:

Helping Catch Traitors, Unknowingly Fooled

After the Rong case occurred, Tang, the commander of the First Pacification Area, instructed Mao Sen, the director of the Second Division of the headquarters, to fully assist in the investigation. At the end of May, Director Mao received a report from his staff stationed in Shanghai, stating that the main culprits in the Rong case were Luo Wenqing and Yuan Zhongshu. Yuan and others were notorious bandits with a very tight organization and many informants. Moreover, after the bandits obtained the loot, most of them had already fled. If one wanted to catch them all in one swoop, it would be very difficult.

The headquarters mobilized dozens of experienced personnel, led by Director Mao himself, to be stationed in Shanghai to handle the case. On the 21st of last month, Huang Shaoqin, a key suspect, was secretly arrested. On the 23rd, Liu Ruibiao, a bandit who participated in the Rong case, was arrested in western Zhejiang. Under interrogation, the truth began to emerge. Liu confessed that he had been fooled, believing that he was helping to catch traitors. He regretted it too late after realizing the truth. At the same time, he provided detailed descriptions of the appearances of the major bandits who participated in the kidnapping, such as Uncle Luo, Zhao Shaozong, and Huang A'da. That evening, Yuan, the section chief of the headquarters, found Zhao's residence, and Zhao was captured that night. After the two criminals were confronted, the case gradually became clear. Based on the confessions of the three criminals, the headquarters made further deployments, hoping to capture the bandit leaders. Personnel were dispatched according to the relationships and positions of the bandits to arrest them separately. It was learned that Yuan Zhongzhu, one of the main culprits in the Rong case, had already left Shanghai, leaving only an old woman, Gu Chushi, to guard the bandit's den.

With a Mind to Take a Chance, a Major Culprit is Caught

The personnel of the headquarters had no choice but to enter Yuan's residence and carry out surveillance, strictly preventing any leakage of information. At that time, the Shanghai newspapers published news that the Rong case had been solved and that many of the main culprits in the Rong case had been arrested. Luo Wenqing, the Shanghai gang leader of the Rong case, believed that the report was untrue and, with a mind to take a chance and get to the bottom of things, went to Yuan's residence to visit on the morning of the 25th of last month. Unexpectedly, after entering Yuan's residence, he found that all the people on the mezzanine stairs were strangers, and the situation was unusual. He jumped out of the building, hoping to escape. Lu Zhiling, a member of the Sixth Squad of the Disciplinary Corps of the headquarters, saw the situation and knew that he was a key criminal. In order to capture him, he bravely jumped down, too. Both were injured from the fall. After a long struggle, Luo was captured and confessed to being Uncle Luo. Luo confessed that he had disappeared from Yuan's residence after Rong Desheng's ransom was paid. If it were not for the news report, he would not have gone there. It can be seen that the capture of this major culprit was greatly assisted by the media's reporting. However, the major culprit was extremely cunning and untruthful in many of his statements. It was very difficult to obtain clues about the other main culprit, Yuan, from Luo's mouth. Coincidentally, Huang, the section chief sent by the headquarters to Hangzhou, captured Yuan Zhongzhu, another bandit leader, on the night of February 24 and escorted him to Shanghai on the 25th. At this point, both major leaders of the Rong case kidnappers were captured.

By Chance, a Key Lead is Found

According to Huang's report, Yuan had left Shanghai with his entire family and traveled to other places after kidnapping Rong. The headquarters determined, based on various intelligence reports, that Yuan was hiding in the Hangzhou-Shaoxing area. On the morning of the 24th, Huang was sent to Hangzhou to investigate and arrest him. After arriving in Hangzhou, Huang first paid attention to the major hotels along the West Lake. That night was unusually hot. Huang and others sat for a while in the ice room. Coincidentally, he caught a glimpse of two young women sitting next to him. One of them resembled Yuan's wife. He followed them out and tailed them along the Lakeside area all night. One of the women eventually entered the Xintai Hotel and was lost. Huang then checked the guest registration book and found a person named Yuan Zhengfei. Although the age was quite different, it was remarkably homophonic. After further meticulous investigation, it was revealed that it was Yuan Zhongzhu. After discovering the key criminal, Huang made arrangements that night and, with the assistance of Lin, the captain of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Hangzhou Police Bureau, used the pretext of checking the hotel at 4:00 AM on the 25th to capture the major bandit Yuan Zhongzhu and three others in one fell swoop. He was escorted to Shanghai that day, and the case was finally brought to light.

Presenting a Fake Certificate to Help Rong Onto the Car

As for the kidnapping of Rong Desheng, according to the confessions of the bandits, Luo Wenqing, the Shanghai gang leader of the Rong case, and Yuan Zhongzhu, the Sheng County gang leader, cooperated. Luo first received a report from his accomplice Zou Liantang, saying that Rong Desheng was the richest man in Shanghai and that kidnapping him would be very easy. They then discussed it with Yuan Zhongzhu. After the two bandits discussed, they had an insider spy on the entrance to Rong's residence and Rong's appearance. On April 21, Luo and his accomplices Zhang Shaoqing and Huang A'hu and others drove the car borrowed from Wu Zhigang to the vicinity of Rong's residence to kidnap him, waiting for half an hour without success. At 9:00 AM on the 24th of the same month, kidnapper Liu Ruibiao joined them again. They drove the original car and fabricated a similar red arrest warrant and went to wait again. After about ten minutes, they saw Rong's car drive out. Zhang Shaoqing ordered Rong's car to stop for inspection. Huang A'hu briefly showed the red certificate and then forcibly took Rong onto the car. They drove west at high speed, passing through Zhongshan Park (formerly Zhaoti Park) and Zhongshan Road to the vicinity of the power plant north of Caojiadu. They got off the car at Xiaobangbian and helped Rong onto a civilian boat that had been prepared in advance. Three days later, he was moved into a tile house next to the railway in Zhongshan Park. Zheng Liantang then negotiated the ransom, which totaled US$395,000, which was divided into sixteen and a half shares. The Shanghai gang got eight shares, and the Sheng County gang got eight and a half shares. Rong was then released. According to Wu Zhigang, the owner of the car, he received a share of US$30,000.

The First Pacification Area ordered that since the case was clear, the eight suspects in the case, Luo Wenqing, Yuan Zhongzhu, Huang Shaoqin, Zhao Shaozong, Wu Zhigang, Liu Ruibiao, Yuan Zhengfei, and Gu Chushi, along with eight confessions, US$58,910 in stolen money, 119.09 taels of gold, 10,613,800 legal tender, two gold watches, two gold watch chains, and five guns, as well as a list of stolen goods, were all transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters yesterday afternoon for inventory and joint interrogation.

### Jianghai Customs Sets Up Light Buoy off the Coast of Songkou

The sea routes of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are the only way to travel for both Chinese and foreign ships. However, they often suffer from losing their direction during hurricanes and heavy fog, leading to dangers such as reefs and grounding. The General Tax Office of Jianghai Customs, in view of this, has set up eight-foot-diameter Agate coal gas light buoys at the Baoshan buoy (i.e. the buoy indicating navigation), the Qiao buoy, and the eastern entrance buoy of the Baimaisha South Channel, which are located in the area from Wusongkou to Yaojiangzui, to start emitting light, so as to facilitate navigation.

### Planning to Overcome the Difficulties of the Lean Season; Nanjing and Shanghai Plan to Implement a Public Grain Sales System; Minister Xu Published an Important Speech Yesterday; Levying of Grain in Kind Can Enable the Government to Control Grain Prices

Minister of Food Xu Kan met with reporters at his private residence at 9:00 AM yesterday to clarify issues related to the grain supply in this city, the levying of grain in kind, and the public sale of grain. He first stated: "When I came to Shanghai last week, I discussed the issue of public food with President Zhu and Mayor Wu and reached a concrete plan. We can rest easy about the grain supply for this month. This time, I came to Shanghai again to discuss how to safely overcome the lean season and plan to implement a public grain sales system. For the former, the principle is to ensure that supply and demand are equal, to replenish reserves, and to facilitate the flow of sources. In the past, I have made efforts in this regard, and I am confident that there are about 150,000 tons of foreign rice being shipped to China. This time, I will further divert Gan rice to Shanghai to make up for the shortfall. In terms of Sichuan transportation,

I have agreed on a solution with Mr. Lu Zuofu this morning to allocate most of the company's tonnage to grain transportation. President Song also agreed to allocate five landing craft to jointly transport with the company. China Merchants Bureau will then add fifteen landing craft to join. In this way, more than 300,000 dans of Sichuan grain can come to Shanghai after the middle of this month. It is also estimated that more than 200,000 dans of Gan rice will come from Nanchang, Poyang Lake and Jiujiang to Shanghai every month. In addition to a very small portion being used as military grain, the rest will be used for civilian food." Xu also added: "The French economic representative Mokes has recently arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong and is scheduled to meet with President Song at 11:00 AM this morning to discuss the sale of Saigon rice to enemy countries." Xu also said: "Shanghai is a purely consumer area. If legitimate rice merchants freely transport and supply rice to make up for the shortfall, they should be supported and encouraged. On the contrary, illegal merchants should be severely punished and cracked down on." At this point, Xu believed that the food control methods recently implemented by Mayor Wu were a combination of politics and economics and were very appropriate. The achievements in the future will be very considerable. Implementing public sales can solve the problem of adequate food. This was Xu's opening remark in response to the public sale of food. He went on to say that in accordance with President Chiang's personal instruction and instructions, it was decided to implement it after the autumn harvest, starting with Nanjing and Shanghai, and then promoting it to major cities across the country. However, preparations must be made in advance, such as clearing household registration, balancing supply, how to allocate and sell, and the qualifications and experience of managers, so as to cooperate with national policy and habits and avoid doing things blindly. Since last month, the police in Nanjing and Shanghai have received instructions from the President to allocate five pecks of rice per person.

Anhui Grain is Not Exploiting Farmers

Regarding the issue of levying grain in kind, Xu replied: "The levy of grain under this system is directly levied from landlords and does not exploit farmers, and it eliminates any other apportionments. If the currency system stabilizes in the future, the method of levying currency will be restored. In addition, each county will set up a levy supervision committee and invite local well-known figures to participate in supervision."

Kept Silent on the Grain Loan Case

When reporters asked for his opinion on the grain loan case, Xu remained silent. He briefly said: "Before holding the grain loan, the principles have been carefully considered and the regulations are very strict. The list of grain loan merchants is submitted by the Examination Committee. The points such as the fact that the grain loan cannot be used for other purposes and the cost of imported goods have been reviewed are perfect. However, whether there is any corruption by the executor is being reviewed by the military law and judicial departments, and a correct announcement will be made in the future." Regarding the full text of the response to the impeachment book of Inspector Cheng Zhongxing, Xu promised to publish it tomorrow morning.

### Inflated Rice Prices, Another Rice Shop Owner Detained

### Coal Ball King, Shen Jinzhou, Manager of Yitaixing, Suspected of Serious Charges of Colluding with the Enemy, Prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office

[Our Dispatch] Shen Jinzhou, manager of Yitaixing Coal Shop, known as the "Coal Ball King," colluded with a small number of coal industry outcasts during the enemy puppet period and was instructed by the enemy's "Asia Development Board" and the enemy's puppet "Embassy" to organize the so-called "Dazhong Lian Coal Shop." Shen Jinzhou served as "Chairman" and implemented coal catty control on behalf of the enemy, planned to supply coal catties to the enemy army, and used vile means to promote the so-called "two-currency system" of military tickets and puppet currency for the enemy. Furthermore, he used the power of the enemy puppets to oppress his peers. Therefore, people in the coal industry deeply hated his behavior. After the victory, the coal industry colleagues, following the Li Ze case, jointly reported him by 127 companies, collected 33 pieces of evidence, and stated nine major crimes. They submitted a report to the Shanghai Higher Court Inspection Office and the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Commission. Shen Mianzhou could not hide and was finally arrested and imprisoned on May 2 of this year. After several investigations by the High Prosecutor's Office, it was confirmed that Shen Jinzhou had the crime of being a traitor, so he was formally prosecuted a few days ago and sent to the High Court for legal prosecution. In addition, the case of Mao Tiemei's suspicion of being a traitor was also prosecuted at the same time and will be publicly tried in the Tilanqiao High Court in the near future. In addition, the case of Xu Ganfang's suspicion of being a traitor was not prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office due to insufficient evidence.

### Bitter Winds and Hard Rains See Off Returning People: Northeastern Refugees Return to Their Hometowns

Amidst the dreary wind and rain, this reporter visited the Northeastern refugees in Shanghai who are about to return to their distant hometowns.

The Fengtian-class ocean liner has already docked in the Huangpu River, quietly waiting for them to board at 2:30 PM today. Tomorrow morning, it will set sail, braving the wind and waves towards Husa Island. It is expected that in six days, they will be safely returned to their homeland, which they have been separated from for over a decade, never again to be homeless and never again to sleep in the open – at least, that is my hope.

Wandering, Wandering

There are over two hundred and seventy of them together, men, women, old people, and children, all refugees who fled to avoid living under the enemy's iron heel. They wandered and wandered, enduring countless hardships until today, the day of victory. Now they have only one wish: to go home! "We want to go home, go home—no matter how fragmented the Northeast is, we want to go back and see!" They told me this in low, but firm tones, when I visited yesterday despite the slanting wind and drizzle.

The "Northeastern Compatriot Reception Center" is a dilapidated house with no doors or windows. Amidst the war-torn ruins of the Nanshi district, it appears even more desolate and dilapidated. Upon entering, one sees simple beds placed on the damp ground. Upstairs—in a dilapidated building with bare walls—Japanese-style "tatami" mats are spread on the floor, where Northeastern refugees are lying in twos and threes.

Rushing up to greet the reporter was a burly man named Lan, and an old Mr. Zhao who had graduated from "Army University" and served as a chief of staff. "Most of us are from Liaoning and Jilin," said Mr. Lan, "some of us have been out for seven or eight years, some for three or five years." He then pointed to old Mr. Zhao and said, "He retreated with the Northeastern Army back in the September 18th Incident."

Most of them are public educators and demobilized soldiers. Some had fought in Southern Shandong with the late General Yu Xuezhong; others had wandered around the front lines of the Central Plains and Taihang Mountains. Several soldiers had died in battle, and their widowed wives and orphaned children had come here with the rest. The reporter casually mentioned the grandmother of the Young Marshal Zhang Xueliang, asking, "Does she also live here?" They confirmed it, but said it was the Young Marshal's maternal grandmother.

Thinking of Home

Every one of them longs for their hometown. "Our hometown has soybeans as fat as little fingers and sorghum as thick as a person." They recounted the richness of the Northeast, the vastness of the land, and the scarcity of the population. "We all have homes, and our homes are still there, but we couldn't bear the enemy's invasion, so we fled into the interior. Before, we braved artillery fire, running and escaping, enduring hardships willingly, but now that we have won, there seems to be no need to wander anymore—we want to return home."

But returning home also has difficulties. Transportation and travel expenses are the biggest problems. Mr. Xu, the person in charge here (at the Northeastern Compatriot Reception Center), told me that they are the first group sent back by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (行總). Compatriots with money have already left on their own. To help the refugees return home, the first Northeastern Shanghai Compatriot Association was established in March of this year. Ding Guitang, born in Liaoning, has devoted his utmost enthusiasm, and he has been working tirelessly to solve their food and accommodation problems.

Pride prevents the Northeastern compatriots from uttering words of begging, but a glimpse into the kitchen allows one to imagine that the coarse, yellow food they eat every day is not very palatable. Several people have fallen ill (because the inside is dirty and there are too many flies). They quietly go out to find a cheap doctor. But what surprised me the most was when a woman told me: "This used to be a funeral parlor of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall, where coffins were kept!" Is that so? No wonder there still seems to be a suffocating atmosphere – but they have stayed here for over forty days after all.

Efforts to Build

The reporter wanted to know what they would be willing to do after returning home. Old Mr. Zhao said, "We are willing to do our bit to help the government build the Northeast." What exactly will they do? Up until last night, they were still discussing with Mr. Mo Dehui, who promised to help them settle down.

The rain stopped a bit, and they saw me out the door, saying as they walked, "We can board the ship tomorrow, but there are still over ten thousand fellow refugees from various places in Xuzhou coming. We hope that you can advocate for them, and it would be best if they didn't have to live in this unclean house." Only those in suffering understand how to help others. Fellow suffering compatriots, may you cherish your future journey! (Zhongshi)

### Major Embezzlement Case at the Two Railway Bureaus: District Prosecutor's Office to Investigate Today; Expresses Regret Over Delayed Transfer by the Railway Bureau

[Reported by this newspaper] The District Prosecutor's Office has scheduled the first investigation of the embezzlement case at the Two Railway Bureaus for 10:00 AM today, to be conducted by Prosecutor Quan. All of the defendants will be interrogated at that time. Chen Jingyin, Yu Peien, and He Zu'en, who have not yet been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office, all wrote "confessions" during their interrogation by the police. However, Prosecutor Quan stated that he has not yet received these documents. The Railway Police Bureau's independent investigation of this case has lasted as long as ten days, which is already inappropriate. Furthermore, after the transfer to the District Prosecutor's Office, there are missing documents and no comprehensive investigative report, which is affecting the speed of the investigation. The Prosecutor's Office expressed regret about this; however, they hope that the accomplices and documents that have not yet been transferred to their office will be transferred as soon as possible.

### Shortening Electricity Restriction Time: French-Operated Water and Electricity Company Complies

The National Industry Association of China, Shanghai Branch, previously reported that the French-operated Water and Electricity Company in Shanghai, in order to ensure the company's power generation capacity, had stipulated that industrial electricity use of motor power would be suspended daily from 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM. The association believed that this measure by the French-operated Water and Electricity Company was hindering the overall efficiency of industrial production. Therefore, on June 6, it submitted a report to the relevant municipal authorities, ordering the company to cancel the ban on the use of motor power, or to change the suspension time, taking into account the actual situation, to 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM daily. This method has been accepted by the Public Utilities Bureau, and the French-operated Water and Electricity Company has been ordered to comply.

### Post-War Construction Advancement Association: Preparing to Organize Shanghai Branch

### Guangxi University Resumes Classes in Guilin After Relocation from Liuzhou

Recruiting New Students in Late August

[Central News Agency, Guilin, May 5] National Guangxi University, upon orders, has relocated from Liuzhou to its original site in Guilin to resume classes. The fourth year has already started classes on the 20th of last month, and the second and third years are scheduled to start classes on the 8th of this month. This year, it plans to recruit 510 new students, which will be held around late August. Principal Chen Jianzhong said: Hiring professors is the most difficult task. The Ministry of Education has promised to allocate 700 million yuan, but it is still insufficient.

[This newspaper, Guilin] After the resignation of former Principal Li of Guangxi University, Chen Jianzhong took over and arrived at the school on March 9 of this year, establishing a relocation committee to take charge of the matter. In order to improve the Agricultural College, the school decided to move back to the old site of Liangfeng in Guilin from the Zhenjiang River in Liuzhou, in order to utilize the nearby open space to develop agriculture, forestry, nurseries, horticulture, etc. The remaining buildings will be used for the first-year students of each department to attend classes together in Liangfeng. The school was repeatedly relocated due to the impact of the Xiang-Gui War two years ago. Last August, it suffered severe losses in the mountain flood disaster in Rongjiang, Guizhou. Later, it was located in the extremely simple Zhenjiang River in a remote rural area, prompting repeated requests for relocation. After the turmoil, some students went to Wu. After Principal Chen arrived at the school, he made every effort to solve the students' difficulties and held the first term examinations of the 34th academic year in Guilin, Liuzhou, and Wu. First-year students and preparatory classes only had small exams due to the short number of class days. From the end of the exams, students in the third year and below were suspended from classes for five weeks, and fourth-year students were suspended from classes for one week, and then relocated to Guilin to resume classes. The three weeks of courses missing in the first term of the 34th academic year will be made up in the second semester. (An)

It is said that the complete restoration of various universities is difficult due to insufficient ships and vehicles, and the transportation is difficult.

Although Miss Brough lost in the singles final, she teamed up with Miss Osborne in the doubles final to defeat Miss Betz and Miss Hart 6-3, 2-6, 6-3. Miss Betz suffered from a disadvantage due to her weaker physical condition. Competing in both singles and doubles made her appear quite fatigued, while Brough became more and more courageous.

### The World's Number One Swimmer, Tarzan the Ape Man, Weissmuller, Once Swept All World Swimming Records, His 100-Yard Freestyle Record Remains Unbroken

[United Press, Hollywood, 6th] "Tarzan the Ape Man" Weissmuller was once the world's number one swimmer. Although Weissmuller has given up swimming for many years, his world swimming records have not yet been completely broken. In the history of world swimming records, there was a time when Weissmuller held all swimming records from 50 yards to 440 yards. Even today, his 51-second 100-yard freestyle record remains unbroken. This record has recently been threatened by Yale University athlete Ford, but Ford and no one else has been able to create a record under 50 seconds. Weissmuller created a record of 49.8 seconds in 1927, which was unbelievable to everyone, but this record was not officially recognized as a world record because it was created in a 20-yard swimming pool, which did not meet the rules. Weissmuller is 42 years old this year and feels like swimming is passing him by. He now mainly enjoys playing golf, but he plans to swim twice a week for the next year. Last year, his 100-yard record was 53 seconds, and today, only a few people can create this record. Since Weissmuller retired from public swimming competitions 15 years ago, he has seen all of his swimming records broken, except for the 100-yard freestyle record, which he believes he can maintain for a considerable time. According to Weissmuller, "Today's swimming talents are trained by university coaches. These coaches overemphasize calisthenics, not knowing that excessive exercise outside the water and muscle development are counterproductive."

### Answers to Questions Regarding Household Registration

Question: I am a Shanghai resident and have already registered my household with the district office in this district. Now I want to go to Nanjing to do business. How should I register? As a local resident, I definitely don't have a "native place." If you are going to Nanjing to do business temporarily and don't intend to stay there for a long time, meaning you are "moving out of the original household registration jurisdiction" but don't want to "change your original affiliation," you only need to complete a move-out registration.

Question: What if I want to live in Nanjing for a long time?

Answer: This needs to be discussed in two ways: If you intend to live in Nanjing for a long time and decide to remove your native place from this city, then you can apply for cancellation of registration in this city and apply for registration in Nanjing at the same time. If you want to live in Nanjing permanently but, because your ancestral home is here or for other reasons, you don't want to remove your native place from this city, then you still maintain your native place in this city, and you need to follow the steps. If you have not stayed for a month, you need to report to the head of the original residence for floating population registration. If you have stayed for a month, you need to report for migration registration. After one year, you can apply for establishment of a temporary residence according to Article 18, paragraph 2 of the New Household Registration Law, which states that "those who already have a native place but have a residence or have lived in another county for more than one year shall take that county as their temporary residence."

Question: What is a "native place"?

Answer: The so-called "native place" is what determines the relationship between a person and where they live, and recognizes the standard by which a person is assigned rights and obligations in the area where they live. Shanghai residents exercise rights and fulfill obligations in Shanghai, while Nanjing residents exercise rights and fulfill obligations in Nanjing.

Question: What is a "temporary residence"?

Answer: The so-called "temporary residence" was originally intended to alleviate the shortcomings of "native place." If a person has lived in their current residence for a certain amount of time, they will be quite familiar with the situation there. If all rights and obligations must be exercised and fulfilled in their native place, it would be difficult in practice. Therefore, it is stipulated that people from other places can apply for the establishment of a temporary residence after living for a certain period of time.

Question: Are there any differences between "native place" residents and "temporary residence" residents in this city in exercising rights and fulfilling obligations?

Answer: According to the interpretation order Yu Hu Zi No. 0143 issued by the Ministry of Interior on February 18, 1943, "The regulation of temporary residence is to alleviate the shortcomings of native place. If you have already lived in the place of temporary residence, you should exercise your rights and fulfill your obligations there, but if the laws and regulations by which rights and obligations are granted stipulate otherwise, then follow those regulations." So, in principle, there is no significant difference.

### Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Household Registration Law (8)

1.  Registration of Category: Those who establish or cancel registration due to obtaining, recovering, or losing nationality.

2.  Recognition Registration: Those who are recognized according to a will.

3.  Adoption Registration: Those who were not raised as children from a young age.

4.  Marriage Registration: Those whose marriage requires the consent of a legal representative, and those whose registration is revoked due to invalid or canceled marriage.

5.  Divorce Registration.

6.  Death Declaration Registration and Those who Revoke Death Declarations.

7.  Those who change, correct, or cancel registration due to a confirmed judgment.

(Article 24) After receiving the registration application, the township office should review it to ensure it is correct and register it in the main household registration book. The original application form should be given a cover and bound as a separate volume of the household registration book. A copy of the application form should be transcribed and submitted to the county government at the end of each month for registration in the duplicate household registration book, and still bound as a separate volume. Both should be marked with the type of registration: category registration, identity registration, or migration registration.

(Article 25) Registered items should be recorded in the registration reason column of the household registration book or within the relevant household. Establishing registration, moving in, or creating a new household should be recorded on a new page of the registration book in the appropriate order. Cancellation of registration, death, and death declaration should be marked with a red line, stating the date and reason.

For those who use cards for registration, the registration should be recorded on the original card, and new cards should be added or replaced. All household registration books with fully canceled pages and canceled cards should be classified and preserved. (Article 26) When non-native residents perform category or identity registration, with the exception of category registration and migration registration being handled at the same time and requiring applications in both places, the township office that accepts the application should notify the township office in the applicant's native region with a copy of the application form for registration, but if there is no notification in the applicant's native region, notification may not be required.

### The Taiwan Sugar Corporation is Illegal: Sugar Industry Association Resolutely Opposes It. Monopoly...Price Gouging...Profit-Seeking...These are the Main Reasons

[Report from Our Newspaper] Before the war, Taiwan's sugar mainly came from Taikoo, Java, and Dongbai. After the victory, the sources were cut off, and all reliance was placed on Taiwan Sugar for supply. There were a total of forty-two sugar factories throughout Taiwan Province. After being taken over, it is said that no more than seventeen can still operate. However, due to the province's suitability for three rice crops a year, while sugarcane is planted only once a year, and the cost of fertilizer is not low, since the military takeover, most of the fields have been abandoned. Due to limited raw materials, factories have been starting and stopping again. The sugar produced totals 90,000 tons, plus 150,000 tons of stored sugar taken over. This is the only source of sugar after the victory. As for the resumption of sugar factory operations, it is said that it will take eighteen months because the stored sugar is limited and the supply is still far off.

The Origin of the Company's Organization

Therefore, the Resources Committee and the Taiwan Governor-General's Office jointly formed the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, which was announced in May. The reason, of course, is to regulate supply and demand, maintain the market, and revive Taiwan Province's sugar industry. However, since its establishment, it has only been a little over a month, and the price of sugar has doubled, causing great attention in society, especially in the sugar industry.

Reasons for Opposing the Company

The reasons are:

1. The company's exclusive control over the transportation and sale of Taiwan sugar is a monopoly.

2. The organization is illegal. The so-called joint-stock company, it is unknown who the directors and supervisors are and what the capital is.

3. Raising the selling price is equivalent to leading price increases.

4. Selling directly to retail merchants is no different from cutting off the livelihood of sugar merchants.

5. The fundamental issues of Taiwan's sugar manufacturing and sugarcane cultivation have not seen any improvements.

6. Sugar manufacturing belongs to light industry and should not be nationalized, competing with merchants for profit.

Planned Steps for Vigorous Advocacy

Based on the above reasons, the industry has decided:

(1) Prepare a document and submit it to President Chiang of the National Government, Premier Zhu of the Executive Yuan, and the Jiangsu Inspector, Mayor Wu of Shanghai, and Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting the prompt revocation of the company's establishment.

(2) Organize a petition group to go to Beijing to petition the Supreme National Defense Council, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Control Yuan.

(3) Urgently request the support of the National Chamber of Commerce Joint Federation and other committees, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and various industry associations, and not stop until the goal is achieved.

It is said that the sign at the entrance of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation is "Taiwan Sugar Corporation," but the letterhead is signed "Sugar Industry Company jointly organized by the Resources Committee of the Executive Yuan and the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Governor's Office." The industry believes that it is neither fish nor fowl, and since its establishment a month ago, it has not joined the association as required, so it is determined to oppose it. The following is an excerpt from its petition.

Excerpt of Key Points from the Original Petition

It is known that Taiwan is famous for sugar production. After many years of operation by the Japanese, the production was quite abundant. In addition to meeting Japan's needs, the surplus was dumped in our country. However, since the restoration of Taiwan Province, many vast sugarcane fields have been left barren, and manufacturing equipment has been allowed to be discarded. The remaining sugar is only 200,000 tons. Future production is a major question. The sugar merchants affiliated with the association, because of the influx of foreign sugar in 1933, contracted with six sugar factories established in Guangdong Province to undertake sales, responsible for operation, and promoting sugarcane crops, which greatly increased sugar production. Furthermore, they united with colleagues from various places to organize the National Domestic Sugar Production and Sales Association, competing with foreign sugar, and achieved significant results. Therefore, with the aim of , the association contacted the Taiwan provincial authorities to discuss production and sales cooperation, and following the example of Guangdong sugar, only took commissions and did not engage in speculation. The production and sales parties, considering the domestic market conditions, negotiated the selling price. They would not sell foreign sugar unless Taiwan sugar stopped supplying, so that domestic sugar would gradually develop and the economy would move towards health. An agreement had been reached and efforts were about to be made in a timely manner. Unexpectedly, the Resources Committee encompassed the stored sugar in Taiwan Province and established the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, monopolizing operations and competing with merchants for profit. On May 22 of this year, the company was established and announced publicly. The target of sugar sales is not limited to sugar merchants, replacement and exclusion are clearly revealed. From May 24 to June 14, in a two-week period, sugar was sold four times, the price gradually increased, and the goods were secretly reduced. The existence or non-existence of transactions was determined by the closeness of relationships, using brokers as intermediaries, breeding corruption and chaos. Furthermore, domestic associations were utilized to sell in stages, causing the price of sugar to jump nearly double. Coupled with the increase in miscellaneous fees and numerous transfers, the market price became more expensive. Not only was there hoarding and speculation, but also arbitrary manipulation, so that the long-stable price of sugar, within half a month, jumped from about 50,000 yuan per picul to over 100,000 yuan, the market situation fell into chaos, and merchants were at a loss. The Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property Management in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions, since December of last year, has entrusted the association to sell sugar received from Taiwan to colleagues through auction, and there has never been any manipulation. In half a year, the selling price has always hovered around 50,000 yuan, with a total volume of more than 120,000 . The value exceeded 6 billion yuan. Even with the prices of various commodities rising, the price of sugar has always been stable, which has won social praise. It was not easy, but it was completely destroyed by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation within two weeks. Monopoly and high prices have caused panic. Even foreigners are worried. The Resources Committee is the highest national organization, responsible for defense industry and heavy industry. Following the first-stage economic construction principles set by the Supreme National Defense Council, private commercial operations are by no means the committee's responsibility. Even if we take a step back and recognize that Taiwan Province's refining industry cannot be improved without the committee's efforts, it can only engage in matters related to refining and provide funding for the transition. Now, taking advantage of its advantages, it violates the principles of economic construction and brazenly establishes the Taiwan Sugar Corporation to compete with merchants for profit. Its handling has not even been a month, and hundreds of problems have arisen. It even intends to establish branches in important commercial ports to further destroy sugar merchants across the country. What is its intention? Currently, there is a shortage in the country, and the Taiwan Sugar Corporation can still manipulate . One day, foreign sugar arrives and dumps , if the government cannot establish its position, the hearts of merchants will be more than enough to turn it around. Therefore, the Resources Committee's competition with merchants for profit is more unwise than killing the chicken to get the eggs. The authorities should promptly revoke the establishment of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation and allow the association to continue the joint operation method of food sugar production and sales cooperation with the Taiwan Provincial authorities, so that the future price of sugar will naturally be negotiated fairly by the production and sales parties, considering the market situation, under the guidance of the local government, so as to implement the established national policy and satisfy the public.

### Zoned Rice Distribution: Rice Shops Have Begun to Register

Then, the representatives of each district will report the requested quantity of each rice shop to the Rice Shops Association as a basis for distribution.

### British-owned Jardine Matheson and Taikoo Steamship Companies to Reorganize as Chinese Companies to Continue Coastal and Inland River Shipping Rights

Recently, there has been speculation that foreign steamship companies will change to Chinese names and continue to operate as usual. According to sources, the Chinese company organized by Taikoo will be nominally headed by a former employee of the foreign firm. Jardine Matheson will organize the Anhe Company, nominally a Sino-foreign joint venture, including a former employee of the foreign firm and a certain Sichuan bank. All of Jardine Matheson's ships, large and small, will be gradually transferred to Anhe, flying the Chinese flag and operating on inland rivers and coastal routes.

### Canada Raises Currency Value, Controls Prices, and Restricts Imports to Counter U.S. Inflation

(Reuters, Ottawa, 6th) The Canadian government today fixed the value of the Canadian dollar to be equal to the U.S. dollar and strengthened price controls to counter recent U.S. price increases and reduce inflationary pressure. Finance Minister Ilsley told the House of Commons that he hoped the steps taken by the government would "permanently guarantee Canada's immunity from adverse external conditions and reduce inflationary pressures." The agent banks designated by the Foreign Exchange Control Board will buy U.S. dollars at a value of one Canadian dollar instead of buying at 1.10 Canadian dollars, and sell at 1.005 Canadian dollars instead of the previous 1.105 Canadian dollars. As for the pound sterling, it is fixed at a value of 4.02 Canadian dollars per pound instead of the previous 4.43 Canadian dollars, and sold at 4.04 Canadian dollars instead of 4.45 Canadian dollars. The government also announced a long list of items that will remain under control, and imports will be strictly controlled. At the same time, subsidy measures will remain in place.

(United Press, New York, 6th) Regarding the devaluation of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar, it is generally interpreted here as a result of Canada's accumulation of a large amount of U.S. dollars. By the end of 1945, Canada held gold and U.S. dollars worth more than 1.5 billion Canadian dollars.

### The Authorities Dispatch Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate the Speculative Behavior of Securities Firms

According to news from the financial industry, the highest financial authorities, in view of the strong speculative atmosphere in the city's financial sector, have recently been affected by the sharp decline in bonds. The financial strength of various commercial firms has suddenly become short, resulting in many cases of disturbance. Special personnel have been dispatched to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the business conditions of various firms (including trust companies), and the Central Bank will assist in selectively checking the accounts of those suspected of engaging in speculation.

It is also learned that some commercial firms currently use client collateral as collateral, which is in violation of the law and will be strictly investigated.

Letter to the Editor

### The Pudong Bank

Declares it has not experienced difficulties and has not borrowed from other banks. Regarding the article "No Problems in Finance" in the commercial news section of your newspaper on July 7, which stated, "such as the Pudong Bank, etc., have temporarily resolved difficulties, and other banks have provided support," this is not true. Since the sudden tightening of credit at the end of June, our bank has not experienced any difficulties. The clearing house statements can prove the facts, and we have not recently borrowed from other banks. Fearing that there may be false rumors, we hereby solemnly state the facts and request correction to avoid misunderstandings.

### U.S. Standard of Living to Peak This Year

(United Press, New York, 6th)

The famous American economist Dr. Sisco predicts that the rising curve of the U.S. standard of living will peak this year, probably at the end of this year.

### Industrial and Commercial Registration Statistics: Over 700 Foreign-owned Businesses Registered

(Our News) Since the Social Affairs Bureau began industrial and commercial registration last year, as of the end of June this year, a total of 14,881 commercial registrations were recorded, including 14,766 new registrations, 115 change registrations, and 18 cancellation registrations. A total of 1,018 industrial registrations were recorded. Over 700 foreign-owned stores have registered. Foreign companies in Shanghai must also register with the bureau in accordance with the new Company Law. As for those with headquarters abroad and only having offices in Shanghai, they only need to file and submit their original licenses. It is also learned that 115 new American companies have been established in Shanghai, some of which have ties with the Chinese government and commercial firms.

### China Petroleum Corporation Inspects the Kaohsiung Oil Field

[Report from Our Newspaper] The petroleum production of the Kaohsiung Oil Field in Taiwan played a very important role during the Japanese war of aggression. It was heavily bombed by American aircraft and production was suspended. Since the end of the war, production has come to a standstill. It is said that the China Petroleum Corporation, under the Resources Committee, attaches great importance to the value of the fields and plans to send personnel to the area in the near future to conduct exploration work, inspect the extent of the damage to the oil field, prepare for construction and repairs, and order new equipment from the United States in order to restore production. It is said that the quality of petroleum produced in Kaohsiung is also very good. If handled properly, its future prospects are very promising, even better than the Gansu oil mines, and will be of great importance to China's oil and stone industry in the future.

### Past and Present of the Woolen Fabric Industry

The woolen fabric trade in Shanghai dates back more than thirty years before the founding of the Republic of China, but at that time there were no formal shops selling them. Since the first year of the Republic of China, the woolen fabric and Western clothing trades gradually emerged. Later, due to clothing reforms, the sales of woolen fabrics became widespread, and the number of shops opening increased rapidly. Therefore, an association was formed. During the years 1924-1926, Western suits and overcoats became increasingly popular, and the demand from this street and from out-of-town merchants also increased day by day. Chinese clothing materials also mostly selected woolen fabrics, and the power of the Dalu gang on Qipan Street exceeded that of the shipping gang in Hongkou. Therefore, the Tongying Association also moved from Hongkou to the Shanghai district. Afterwards, the sales of woolen fabrics in various provinces and cities increased year by year, and the number of stores opened by colleagues increased rapidly. Today, the breadth of sales has exceeded the limits of those doing silk, satin, and foreign goods. Most of them undoubtedly sell woolen goods, and the number of stores of this type has gradually increased. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, the Woolen Fabric Association had about forty member stores, seventy-five stores in 1933, ninety-four stores before the war in 1937, one hundred and nine stores in 1940, three hundred and forty-one stores in 1942, and four hundred and seventeen stores before the victory in 1945. On March 1 of this year, after reorganization and takeover, the official number of members was one hundred and sixty-seven. According to the records of 1942 and 1945, due to enemy and puppet control, woolen fabric sales of more than twenty yards had to be stamped with a transport permit, and those forced to join numbered . At the same time, due to the special nature of silk fabrics in this city, many outsiders entered the field. After the victory, due to currency issues, the number of new members was delayed. Later, due to frequent price increases, increased capital and bonuses, and higher opening costs, business became difficult, and many merged or closed down. Thirdly, after joining the association, the public and private expenses became a heavy burden, and the obligations were often greater than the rights, so many hesitated to observe. This is the real reason why the number of members has decreased recently. （　）

### Printing and Dyeing Raw Materials and Pigment Chemistry

— Zhang Bo'an

Since Perkin discovered mauve, the world's dye industry has undergone a major revolution. All colors of the rainbow can be separated from Coal tar in one room and fulfill its desires. The duty-based natural pigments have fallen, never to rise again for thousands of years. Not only that, but high-grade explosives, combustion products, gas, and valuable medicines also come from coal tar. The power of life and death is truly in the hands of this industry. In this sense, the dye industry is a major part of the people's livelihood industry in peacetime, and it is the lifeline of the country in wartime. Isn't it great?

The use of coal tar in dyes is very precise. It is usually separated into benzene, toluene, xylene, cumene, phenol, benzene, phenanthrene, anthracene, etc. according to the height of its separation temperature and the height of its specific gravity. Phenol is a light oil, xylene and below are medium oil, and anthracene and phenanthrene are heavy oil. After the tar is separated, it is combined with intermediate compounds to become colorful dyes.

The German coal tar industry is particularly developed, and most inventions were started by Germans. The progress of German dry distillation of lignite has been praised by countries all over the world, so pigment chemistry is also dominant in the world. It is not surprising that Germans use coal tar so widely. Before the European War, due to the fear that coal resources would be exhausted, all coal-based organisms were resolved with hydroelectric power according to the molecular formula of C.H., which was an unparalleled masterpiece.

From the perspective of organic chemistry principles, the synthesis of mineral oxides is not impossible, and the Germans have realized it one by one. Observe the German synthesis of phenol to the synthesis of acetic acid and formaldehyde, which are made from hydroelectricity. In the manufacturing process, only the steam furnace emits a large amount of steam. This steam passes through a red copper tube, and the copper tube contains porous iron sponge with ammonia. After the steam passes through the red copper tube, the oxygen in the water is excluded due to radiation, leaving oxygen. Oxygen is introduced into a gas mixing ball, which is equipped with two arc carbon electrodes. When current is applied, the two hydrogen atoms and two carbon electrodes in the water react to form C H gas. The ethyne gas is then introduced into a red-hot tube, where polymerization occurs to become C H , which is benzene. Continuing down this path, propylene, formaldehyde, and even methylanthracene, are all possible, and the quality of synthetic products does not need to be tested and is the purest. It is said that the Germans used benzene produced by this method for aviation fuel during the European War, which is another page in the history of scientific development that cannot be erased. Aviation fuel requires octane, which has extinguishing properties, so ordinary gasoline originally contained benzene as an extinguishing agent.

The above is the source of dyes. However, there are indirect dyes and direct dyes among the dyes. Direct dyes will not be mentioned for the time being. Now let's talk about indirect dyes. Indirect dyeing relies on chemical reactions, among which the most important are Anthracene and Indanthrene.

### Striving for Peace and Construction: Please Revisit the Eight Years of Arduous Resistance War (Conclusion)

……Our Newspaper's Archives……

After the fall of Nanjing, the enemy's second military objective in China was to capture Xuzhou, the center of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway.

Due to Han Fuqu's hesitant inaction, the enemy on the northern Tianjin-Pukou Railway took advantage of this momentum and captured Jinan on December 27th, Yanzhou on January 4th, and Jining and Zou County on the 11th. They then turned west to take Jiaxiang, in order to move towards Jining and cut off the Hai (Lianyungang)-Tai'an Railway, encircling Xuzhou. However, by this time, our military situation had been readjusted. In early February, our army counterattacked Jining, and it was not until late February that the enemy managed to occupy Jiaxiang. The enemy advancing south from Zou County to attack Teng County also encountered strong resistance from the Sichuan Army under Wang Mingzhang. They only managed to occupy Teng County in mid-March, and General Wang Mingzhang also died in battle in this campaign. Another enemy offensive in Shandong was to advance from Qingdao along the highway through Zhucheng and Ju County, and then take Yishui in the west, in order to put pressure on the right flank of our army in Linyi. Their purpose was still to threaten Xuzhou. Therefore, in mid-March, there was also a bloody battle at Linyi, but the enemy did not succeed.

Unable to capture Linyi, the enemy turned from the front of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to attack Zaozhuang and Yixian, directly pressing on Taierzhuang. However, in the Battle of Taierzhuang, our army, using mobile offensive defense, achieved an unprecedented victory since the start of the war, annihilating two enemy divisions. In late April, the enemy reinforced their troops and attacked Linyi and Taierzhuang again, and captured Pi County and Tancheng. However, our mobile troops were intertwined with them, holding back their advance and retreat.

In order to complete the encirclement of Xuzhou, the enemy reinforced their troops in northern Jiangsu (Su Bei), namely Dongtai and Yancheng, while also attacking Mengcheng and Yongcheng from Bengbu and Linhuai Pass. At the same time, the enemy troops in southern Shandong advanced southward in three routes. However, the our army in Xuzhou, after exhausting the enemy, retreated across the Guo River under the threat of enemy heavy artillery and aircraft.

The Battle of Xuzhou was actually a strategic victory.

After Xuzhou fell, the enemy captured Kaifeng on June 4th, and on the 12th, the Yellow River was breached. The Japanese army withdrew and then turned south, attacking Shucheng from Hefei, capturing Taihu, and then capturing Susong and Huangmei from Taihu, taking Guangji, Qishui, and Huangpi. Another route went from Shucheng to Liu'an and then to Gushi, and on October 12th, captured Xinyang, Liulin on the Ping-Han Railway front, advancing south along the highway to encircle the northern part of Wuhan. At the same time, the enemy forces on the Yangtze River captured Anqing on June 13th, Hukou on July 4th, and Jiujiang on July 26th, advancing westward. By October, the three-pronged encirclement was complete. However, our army, following the experience of the Battle of Xuzhou, mainly focused on exhausting the enemy, with flanking operations taking precedence over frontal resistance. After holding out for several months, and as the enemy formed an encirclement, our army withdrew from Wuhan on October 25th.

Earlier, the enemy suffered repeated defeats in the Battle of Wuhan, and seeing the weak attitude of Britain and France, they resolutely launched the war in South China, landing in Daya Bay, Huizhou on October 12th. Our army was unprepared, and Guangzhou fell two days before Wuhan.

The retreat from Wuhan, followed by the Battle of Nanchang and the retreat from Nanchang by March of the following year, marked the end of the first phase of the War of Resistance. As the enemy penetrated to a considerable extent, the allocation of their forces gradually reached saturation with the extension of the battle line, and they could no longer spare any effort to launch large-scale offensives. Although we lost a large amount of territory, our main forces were not lost, and the war situation reached a stalemate. During this period, our main task militarily was to stabilize our own strength, strive for the initiative, and drag the enemy into the mud. Politically, it was to purify our own camp and consolidate unity.

Therefore, after the withdrawal from Wuhan, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek reiterated the consistent policy of resistance: "First, protracted war; second, total war; and third, striving for the initiative." Hence, "The key to the military victory or defeat of the War of Resistance does not lie in the gains or losses of Wuhan, but in maintaining our enduring power of resistance." At the Nanyue Military Conference held on November 27th of the same year, the Chairman's instruction emphasized that the task of the second phase of the War of Resistance was to turn defense into offense, to turn defeat into victory, and that it would inevitably be doubly arduous, and therefore require double the effort.

On December 19th, Wang Jingwei suddenly left his post and flew to Kunming. On the 22nd, Konoe Fumimaro issued his outrageous declaration to "establish a new order in East Asia." On the 26th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek refuted Konoe's declaration, and on the 29th, Wang Jingwei published his "traitorous telegram." This was an ugly scene of domestic defeatists being purged from the resistance camp after the withdrawal from Wuhan, but the resistance camp became purer and more solid as a result. In particular, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's stern words stated: "Everyone should be aware that his so-called new China is to eliminate an independent China and create a slave China, subject to its domination for generations. This 'new order' is based on China becoming a slave state and being closely linked with Japan and its created 'Manchukuo', with what purpose? In the name of preventing the red peril, to control China's military; in the name of upholding Eastern civilization, to eliminate China's national culture; in the name of eliminating economic barriers, to exclude European and American forces, monopolize the Pacific, and then use the tool of the 'Japan-Manchuria-China economic unit' or 'economic group' to control the lifeline of China's economy."

On January 1, the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang resolved to expel Wang Jingwei from the party, and on June 8, the National Government issued an order to arrest Wang Jingwei.

Although the second phase of the war had basically reached a stalemate, due to the inadequacy of our own strength, we could not stand in an active position, and the enemy was still able to launch its local offensives in a rampant manner.

In May of the 28th year [1939], the enemy troops in Wuhan, feeling threatened by our troops in northern Hubei, launched the so-called "Suizao Campaign." The enemy, detouring north from the east bank of the Xiang River, successively captured Zaoyang, Xinye, and Tanghe, while the enemy invading west from Xinyang also captured Tongbai. However, by the end of May, our army reinforced and counterattacked, successively recovering various places and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

In September of the same year, the enemy in Nanchang joined forces with the enemy on the Yangtze River in southern Hubei, attempting to jointly attack Changsha. After more than a month, our army counterattacked in early October, and the enemy forces were greatly routed, with more than 40,000 casualties. This was the so-called First Battle of Changsha.

However, in November, the enemy landed again in Beihai, successively capturing Fangcheng and Qin County, and on the 24th, captured Yongning. At the same time, in northern Guangdong, the enemy also captured Baijiang, Yingde, Gaotian, Xinfeng, Wengyuan and other places, supporting each other. In January of the following year, our army counterattacked, successively recovering Zengcheng, Yingde, Gaotian, Baijiang, and Huaxian, but Yongning ultimately fell into enemy hands.

This was the main situation in the stalemate phase. Although our side did not yet have the strength to completely stop the enemy's offensive, so that the enemy could continue to act within our various battlefields, the enemy's offensive was obviously not as sharp and powerful as in the first phase. They often prepared for several months to launch an offensive, perhaps temporarily occupying certain key points, but once we counterattacked, the entire line would shake. Therefore, the result of almost every battle was that the enemy failed. In the Battle of Yichang in the 29th year [1940], the enemy went upstream along the Yangtze River on one side, knocking on the gateway to Yichang, and on the other side, captured Changyang from Jingmen, attacking the rear of Yichang. Although Yichang was lost, the enemy was never able to cross the county seat by a single step to the west. In the Zaohe Battle of the same year, although General Zhang Zizhong died for his country, the enemy was limited to the Funiu Mountains in the north, blocked by the Han River in the west, obstructed by the Dabie Mountains in the east, and obstructed by the Dahong Mountains in the south. Our army waited for an opportunity to counterattack, and was victorious in all directions. In the 30th year [1941], the enemy launched two offensives against Changsha, both of which ended in failure. In particular, the Second Battle of Changsha in September set the highest record of victory for our army in the second phase of the war. In the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign in April of the 31st year [1942], the enemy attempted to connect the entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, advancing westward from Xiaoshan and Zhuji on one side, and attacking eastward from Jiujiang and Nanchang on the other, with the two armies meeting in Guixi and Dongxiang. After the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line was opened, the enemy became even more complacent and divided their troops southward from Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Jinhua. Xianju, Yongkang, Songyang, and Lishui successively fell. However, by mid-July, our army launched a full-scale counterattack, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy between Suichang, Xuanping, and Yongkang, and successively recovered eastern Zhejiang and northern Jiangxi. In May of the 32nd year [1943], the enemy troops in northern Anhui advanced north from Anqing, capturing Tongcheng and occupying Lihuang, but were repelled by our army in less than half a year. In November of the same year, the enemy troops in Hunan advanced from Shuixi, capturing Jinshi, Li County, and Shimen, crossed the river south to take Linli and Cili, directly threatening Changde, and crossed the Yuan River from Zoushi, closely encircling Changde. Our army fought fiercely with them, with Changde being lost and regained three times. Finally, our main force reinforced the troops and repelled the enemy, causing the enemy's dream of attacking the wartime capital to vanish.

However, by this point, the stalemate between the enemy and us had lasted for a full four years. The enemy was undoubtedly becoming more and more exhausted, but our army's efforts were insufficient, and we had never been able to complete the strategic tasks of the stalemate phase, so-called striving for the initiative, turning defense into offense, and even unable to stop the enemy's continued offensive. In the spring of the 33rd year [1944], the enemy, because of their repeated defeats in the Pacific War, and their million-strong army isolated overseas unable to return home by sea, had no choice but to devote all their strength to make one last offensive, in an attempt to open up the traffic lines of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and the Ping-Han Railway, so that their overseas troops could withdraw from the mainland. On April 17th, the enemy strongly crossed the flooded area west of Zhongmu and launched the Central Plains Campaign, and on April 22nd, occupied Zhengzhou, and on May 15th, occupied Luoyang. When their westward advance was blocked at Lianggu Pass, they turned south along the Ping-Han Railway. At the same time, the enemy troops in Wuhan also went north to meet them at Zhumadian, opening up the Ping-Han Railway. In mid-June, the enemy captured Changsha and attacked Hengyang along the railway. Our army fought hard for two months, and finally withdrew on August 8th. After Hengyang fell, the enemy captured Weiyang to the south on the 20th. At the same time, the enemy troops in northern Guangdong also went north along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, successively capturing Qingyuan, Yingde, and Qujiang, and joined forces with the enemy advancing south. At this point, both the Ping-Han and Guangdong-Hankou Railways were opened up, and the enemy's arrogance was high and invincible. They then invaded Guangxi along the Hunan-Guangxi Railway, occupying Guilin on November 10th. The enemy troops in Guangdong also followed the West River into Guangxi, and Cangwu and Liuzhou successively fell. In December, the enemy in Guangxi took advantage of the victory to invade Guizhou, and on the 5th, captured Dushan. However, it was soon counterattacked and recovered by our army, and the enemy on the border of Guizhou was wiped out. The enemy's momentum of long-drive and direct entry was finally stopped.

### General He Jifeng Discusses the Lugou Bridge Incident

Our Newspaper's Special Dispatch from Beiping on the 6th, Special Correspondent Zhang Jianmei

General He Jifeng, currently the Deputy Commander of the 7th Pacification Zone of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, was the Commander of the 110th Brigade of the 29th Army at the time of the July 7th Incident, and personally commanded the Battle of Lugou Bridge. When the reporter visited Lugou Bridge on the 2nd of this month, I happened to meet General He at Wenyu Mountain. Mr. He was taking a walk at this old battlefield from nine years ago, the place where his old friend General Zhao Dengyu resisted the enemy. Mr. He recounted the details of the July 7th Incident as follows: Before the July 7th Incident, the 29th Army knew that the Japanese army was preparing for war very urgently, and that war was almost inevitable. Therefore, under the pretext of vacating barracks for students receiving military training, the 119th and 230th Regiments of Xiyuan were moved to the Lugou Bridge and Changxindian area. The Japanese army in Fengtai also used the pretext of exercises to reconnoiter the terrain in the Yongding River area. On July 5th, the Japanese army even passed through Wanping City and Lugou Bridge to the west of the river for exercises, and the defending army did not stop them. On July 6th, the Japanese army held exercises again. Our army had learned in advance that the Japanese army was carrying more bullets than usual this time, and must have had ulterior motives. Therefore, the gates of Wanping City were tightly closed, refusing them passage through the city. The Japanese army then turned back. However, in the evening, they again used the excuse that a soldier had been lost during the exercise yesterday, and requested to enter the city to search for him. Our army refused again. On the 7th, the Japanese army resolutely launched an invasion war. At dawn, the first battalion of the Mutaguchi Regiment approached Dajing Village, advanced towards Wanping and the Ping-Han Railway Bridge on the Yongding River in battle formation, and began shelling. After dawn, they approached Wanping City, and at 11 o'clock occupied the railway bridge. Both groups of defending soldiers died on the bridge. At 10 o'clock in the morning, our army rushed from Xiyuan to the brigade headquarters in Babaoshan and immediately issued three orders, ordering Regiment Commander Ji Xingwen to recapture the railway bridge before sunset. Regiment Commander Ji then selected a dare-to-die squad of 200 men to charge with broadswords, and finally completed the mission before sunset. The Japanese army left many corpses behind. Therefore, the enemy army proposed a truce on the 8th, which our side agreed to. The Japanese army then sent a military envoy with a white flag to transport more than a thousand corpses on the river bank, in the river, and on the bridge to Fengtai in large trucks. On the 9th, he went to Changxindian to pay respects to the fallen officers and soldiers. When he returned, guns and cannons were roaring east of the river. The Japanese army's formal offensive had already begun. Our side immediately added a regiment from Xiyuan. On the 10th, Dajing Village, Xiaojing Village, and Dawayao were recaptured. The Japanese army was discouraged. Therefore, on the 11th and 12th, they negotiated on one hand and transferred the Kawabe Brigade from Tianjin on the other hand. Our side also added six regiments, intending to recapture Fengtai. At noon on the 13th, the authorities in Beiping temporarily instructed that there should be no counterattack, so it was stopped. On the 15th, the enemy shelled Wanping again, and Ji Xingwen was wounded in the Longwang Temple, the regimental headquarters. On the 16th, Japanese Lieutenant General Tashiro personally supervised the battle, determined to capture Wanping. He was killed by our stray bullets at the Dajing Village station at noon. The Japanese claimed that Tashiro committed suicide by disembowelment. On the 12th, some houses in Wanping were set on fire by enemy shelling. In retaliation for Dajing Village, we shelled Yantai, but were then ordered to stop shelling. From the 17th to the 26th, there were only minor conflicts. On the 27th, the enemy attacked Nanyuan. We also planned to drive the enemy east of Lugou Bridge back and attacked Xiaojing Village. Soldiers climbed onto the roofs and fought enemy tanks, and captured Fengtai. The enemy retreated to the barracks. On the evening of the 28th, Tong and Zhao died in battle. The situation in Nanyuan was over. On the 29th, the defending army of Wanping City continued to defend for one day, covering the transfer of the main force to Mentougou. On the 30th, the mission was completed, and the defending army sadly abandoned Wanping and Lugou Bridge, which they had firmly defended for 24 days.

### A Historical Tragic Role Player: The Traitor Case

A Statistic; Individual Punishment

With the arrival of victory, the work of eliminating traitors has been enthusiastically launched throughout the country. However, unable to withstand the washing away of time, these old wounds seem to have been gradually forgotten! To this day, there are quite a few reports, trials, and cases concerning enemy puppets. Settling years of blood debts in one fell swoop is truly a gratifying move. Here is a statistic of the past trials of traitors and enemy criminals, so that everyone knows the role of the players in this historical tragedy, which is expected by the people of the country. However, due to the long time, many involved, and the vast scope of enemy puppet activities, omissions in the record are inevitable.

Shanghai: Up to the end of June this year, Shanghai has already concluded 121 traitor cases involving 136 people. In addition, there are more fugitives, those being wanted, or under investigation, which are not within the scope of this article. Among the 121 cases that have been judged include: economic traitors Chen Riping, Li Ze, Tang Shoumin, Yuan Ludeng and other five people; cultural traitors Tao Kangde, Zhang Ke, Liu Yusheng, Gan Deyun and other four people; political traitors Hu Zewu, Liang Hongzhi, Liu Xingchen, Cai Meiyao, Xu Weizhen, Zhao Yutang, Liu Weijun, Zhang Deqin, Tang Huimin, Tang Liangli and other forty people; Yang Jichang, Zou Wenxian, Fang Zude, Wang Shiliang and other thirty-eight people who served as enemy constitutional officials and special agents; military and police traitors Zhao Riguang, Su Huaide, Shi Huiyao and other thirty-eight people; enemy-supporting merchants Chuan Guangyao, Hui Wenyuan, Xu Zuiren and other five people; Zhou Yi, Jiang Yougen, Zuo Ming, Cai Yunxi and other four people who recruited workers for the enemy. Among them, only the political traitor Liang Hongzhi was sentenced to death, while Chen Riping, Tang Shoumin, Yuan Ludeng, Yang Jichang and other fourteen people were sentenced to life imprisonment. The rest were all sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of less than fifteen years, and the lightest sentence was one year and three months. When the "Three Olds" Yuan, Wen, and Lin were tried, the gallery was packed, and some even had no seats.

Jiangsu: In early June, Sun Honglin, President of the Suzhou Higher Court, told reporters: Regarding traitor cases, the Higher Procuratorate received 1,906 traitor cases from January 34th year of the Republic to the end of May 35th year of the Republic. 804 cases have been submitted to the High Court for trial. 379 people have been finalized by the High Court, including 9 people sentenced to death, 22 people sentenced to life imprisonment, 197 people sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment, 141 people acquitted, 10 people deemed inadmissible, and the remaining 425 people are still under trial. Among the nine people sentenced to death, in addition to the number one traitor Chen Gongbo, chairman of the puppet government, and Miao Bin, vice president of the puppet Legislative Yuan, who have already been executed, there are still seven people including Chu Minyi and Zhang Beisheng. The twenty-two people sentenced to life imprisonment include Chen Bijun, a member of the puppet Central Committee, Shen Wenjie, president of the puppet Jiangsu High Court, and Yu Lun, a traitor from Changshu. When the three major traitors Chen, Chu, and others were publicly tried in Suzhou, the entire city of Suzhou was in an uproar. Hotels and stations were crowded with distant guests from all over. They did not hesitate to travel long distances to see the true face of the contemporary traitors, which shows the eagerness of our people to punish traitors!

Nanjing: In the capital's "traitor trials," "ministers" in several puppet organizations, such as Mei Siping and Lin Bosheng, were sentenced to death. Li Shengwu's sentence was reduced to twelve years imprisonment due to his meritorious service in implementing an amnesty during his tenure as the puppet Minister of Judicial Administration. Yang Kuiyi, Ling _, and Hu Yukun, three military officers during the puppet government period, were all sentenced to death by the Military Law Department and were executed by firing squad in late June. It is worth noting that Wang Ni's second son, Wenti, who once served as a puppet lieutenant, was sentenced to one and a half years of imprisonment with a five-year suspended sentence. The judge admonished him in court to "learn from your father's early life, do not learn from your father's later life, and start anew," which can be said to be meaningful.

Zhejiang: As of now, Zhejiang Province has concluded 43 traitor cases, including the president of the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce Wang Wuquan, Hangzhou enemy constitutional secret agent Li Shihe, Zheng Yaochun and other three people sentenced to death; Zhang Juansheng, the false Zhejiang Minister of Civil Affairs and other three people sentenced to life imprisonment, the false Zhejiang Minister of Finance Lu Shanshi sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment, the false Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee Director Sun Xuelu sentenced to seven years imprisonment, and He Zhiping, editor-in-chief of the false Zhejiang Daily, is the first cultural traitor in Zhejiang Province to be sentenced to imprisonment, with a term of three years and six months.

Anhui: Wu Wuhu's traitorous merchant Wang Shancheng, during the enemy puppet period, searched for military grain for the enemy, taking advantage of his power and doing all kinds of evil, and was recently sentenced to death. The people of Anhui Province were very pleased. Xu Xiandao and Xu Wenbin, two major traitors from Anqing, were also sentenced to death. Chen Jibo, the "Magistrate of Hefei County," was sentenced to life imprisonment, Wang Pingbo, the "President of the Hefei Chamber of Commerce," was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, the "Jiashan Daily" editor was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Bao Zuoting, the "Chief of the Wuhu Police Bureau," was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment. In addition, many people, including the directors of various tax bureaus in Hefei and Qu Disheng, the deputy captain of the Fengyang Security Team, have been sentenced.

Hubei: According to a telegram from Hankou on the sixth of June: The Hubei High Court handled traitor cases in April of this year, including three death sentences, eleven life sentences, sixty-two fixed-term sentences, and thirty-eight acquittals. Shi Xingchuan, the puppet mayor of Hankou, and Zhang Yufang, the editor-in-chief of the puppet "Da Chu Bao," were both sentenced to death, making them the first cultural traitors to receive the heaviest sentences. Liu Yangran, the editor of the newspaper, was sentenced to six years, and the reporter Zhang Bingsan was sentenced to three years. Huang Dazhong, the puppet Hubei Provincial Education Director, Fang Zhongyuan, the puppet High Court Director, and Ouyang Honglie, a member of the puppet Provincial Party Committee, were all sentenced to life imprisonment.

Guangdong: Guangdong Province once published a list of wanted traitors who were at large, totaling more than 200 people, which shows that traitors in Guangdong Province are mostly at large. However, once a trial is conducted and the crime is verified, the sentence is quite severe. Those that have been published in newspapers, such as Li Chaoqun, the president of the puppet Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Team, Tou Yingru, the puppet Minister of Civil Affairs, Luo Jun _, the president of the puppet Zhongshan Daily, and the female spy Huang Meili, were all sentenced to death. Huang Gongjie, the head of the enemy constitutional special service in Macau, who was once rampant, was shot and killed by guards while escaping from prison.

Fujian: From December of last year to the end of April this year, the Fujian High Court accepted 60 traitor cases and concluded 43 cases, including 16 imprisonment cases, 13 cases of fugitives being wanted, and the rest were all acquitted. Li Sibao, the puppet mayor of Xiamen, was sentenced to death.

Hebei: Hebei Province, including Pingjin, has concluded 18 traitor cases, among which the most noteworthy is the actor Li Wanchun, who was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment for treason, and the cultural female traitor, Yin Meibo, the principal of Qingqing Girls' High School, was sentenced to five years imprisonment. As for Wang Kemin, the number one major traitor in North China, he has died of illness in prison. A group of other major traitors from the "North China Political Affairs Committee," due to the seriousness of their crimes, were transported from Beiping to the capital by plane in mid-June and are being tried one after another.

Shanxi: Among the traitors tried in Shanxi Province, eight people, including Li Yangwen, the puppet Magistrate of Fenxi County and the puppet Head of the Shanxi Anti-Communist Self-Defense Corps, were sentenced to death, Rong Furui was sentenced to life imprisonment, and five people were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment.

Qingdao: Yao Zuobin, the puppet mayor of Qingdao, and Xue Congzhi, the deputy commander of the security team, were both sentenced to death.

Guangxi: Zhou Weishan, a traitor in Guangxi Province, was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment for treason and acting as a guide, and Wang Shigou was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment for treason and supplying rice.

### Social Services: Answering Readers

Medical and Health

(1) Wang Renshan asks: I have suffered from nasal congestion for several years. [Sometimes in the morning, it is slightly clear, and I can smell fragrances.] Upon closer inspection of the inside of the nasal cavity, there does not seem to be any polyp-like substances. When I try to breathe with my mouth closed, the air enters directly without obstruction when inhaling, but when exhaling, there is a bubble (about the size of a bean) that then swells and blocks the nasal passage. Please advise on how to treat this condition?

[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin]: I am afraid it is a nasal polyp. Please consult a nasal specialist to perform an excision.

(2) Chen Minggong asks: My father is fifty years old. Recently, he has suffered from a lump in his lower right abdomen that Traditional Chinese Medicine calls a "fish product" type of nodule, about the size of a chicken egg. It swells and hurts after labor, making it difficult to walk. When pressed firmly after sleeping at night, it descends and disappears, as if it were an air pocket. It reappears the next afternoon. This has been happening for three or four months. Initially, I took Amber Powder, but it was ineffective. There are no symptoms of chills or fever. I do not know what medicine can be used to treat it, and what dangers are there?

[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin]: I am afraid it is a inguinal hernia Herrua and must be diagnosed and treated by a surgical specialist. As for the risk, it depends on the condition.

[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin]: (1) It is unlikely that your hands will be numb in the future. (2) There is no medicine that can cure this condition completely. You can try X-ray treatment. (3) Consult a dermatologist to treat this condition.

### Qingxia Elder's Orphan and Widow Relief Fund

Seven applications, three approved

Since the news of the Qingxia Elder's relief for orphans, widows, and the poor and sick was published, the first batch of applicants included seven people. Among them, Shen Yaozong, Zheng Wen, Yulu, and Wu Yaozu did not meet the requirements because they had no shop guarantor or neighborhood head's certification. It was decided to postpone the decision. Yan Shi was approved for 100,000 yuan, Sha Xiumu was approved for 40,000 yuan, and Kong Xiangui was approved for 40,000 yuan. Please prepare a receipt with the original seals of the applicant, shop guarantor, and neighborhood head, and present it to our office for verification before receiving the money. Excerpts from the letters are as follows:

(1) Applicant Yan Shi, from Wujin, is 73 years old. She lives at 19 Taipingfang, Kangding Road, in this city. Her husband died early, leaving behind a son named Zhong, who served in the military. During the early stages of the War of Resistance, he followed the national army to the west, fighting on the battlefield. He just returned to Shanghai this spring, but died of a serious illness due to the hardships of the journey. Mrs. Yan suffered this tragedy and was heartbroken. In addition, she is old and weak and unable to engage in production. She has no way to borrow money and her livelihood is worrying! I recently read in your newspaper that Qingxia Elder has generously helped orphans, widows, and the poor and sick. I dare to take the liberty to request relief in the letter, so as to avoid becoming a ghost in a foreign land. Then the elder's merit will be immeasurable (the shop guarantor and neighborhood head have both affixed their seals and the procedures are complete).

(2) Applicant Sha Xiumu, alone and destitute, is in dire straits. Moreover, he is too old to work. With the rising cost of living, the day when he will starve to death is not far away. I recently heard that Qingxia Elder has allocated funds to help orphans, widows, and the poor and sick. I was overjoyed and specially wrote a letter to apply for relief. If you agree, I will be very fortunate.

(3) To whom it may concern: There is a resident of the seventh household in this neighborhood, Kong Xiangui, from Tianjin, who works as a peddler. His family of three depends on it for a living. Recently, his wife contracted an epidemic. Kong spent all his capital, but she has not recovered. Moreover, since he is not engaged in production, the livelihood of the family of three is in jeopardy! The above are all true facts. I recently heard that Qingxia Elder has contributed funds to help the poor and relieve the widowed. I specially wrote a letter to apply for relief for Kong Xiangui, and I pray that you will approve it so that he can resume production. I am very grateful. Respectfully, Li Wenrong, Neighborhood Head of the Fourth District, Tenth Bao, Fourth Jia, Shanghai

### On National Painting

— He Tianjian

Discussions on the principles and methods of painting are always monotonous; they are not only tiresome for the viewers and listeners but also for the speakers themselves; thus, those accustomed to discussing painting seem reluctant to do so, even unwilling. I have not written about painting for many years; now I will discuss it again. Here, I should propose a few points as an introduction:

First: We Chinese have painting!

Second: Our Chinese painting is like this!

Third: In the world, there are two types of painting: Western painting and Chinese painting!

Fourth: Foreigners also want to see Chinese national paintings!

Fifth: We Chinese should promote Chinese national paintings!

The first point expresses that we, a nation often considered inferior, actually have our own original painting. We have not simply adopted other people's painting as our own, and it has even been taken by others (Japan) as their own. This point seems to deserve a bit of self-praise!

The second point expresses that our Chinese painting has a history of thousands of years and has already established its form and status. Its strength and value should not be casually dismissed. It has a spiritual and personalized, surreal and supernatural advocacy, and its basic material is nourished by "reading ten thousand books and traveling ten thousand miles." Moreover, Western painting emphasizes biology, while our so-called landscape painting has not yet reached that point. Although there are landscape paintings such as plein-air sketches, they are merely a kind of imitation of nature and a depiction of work. Our landscape painting is indeed astonishing and noticed by the world's art scene, and it has progressed from the depiction of natural objects to the realm of "expressing the hills and valleys in the chest" and "creation in hand," and even to writing "unrestrained spirit in the chest" and cultivating breath.

A kind of painting that only has substantial skill, without breath and inspiration, cannot be called beautiful. Our national painting (landscape painting) possesses this!

The third point proves that our Chinese national painting and Western painting each hold the ear of the ox in the Eastern and Western hemispheres of the art world. It has its character, and I have my character. It represents the spirit and culture of the West, and I represent the spirit and culture of the East. To reiterate: our Chinese national painting especially represents the spirit and character of us Chinese because it is something produced in the spirit of our descendants of the Yellow Emperor.

The fourth point is that painting is a kind of cultural feature, like a flower: each flower has its color, fragrance, and form. However, the comparison of people to flowers is certainly not that simple, just as a person can immediately perceive the fragrance, color, and form of a flower. Whether a person can paint or not cannot be known unless they demonstrate it. In recent years, England and the United States have collected our national paintings for exhibition, which is an example of this; if you have any fragrance, you should let me smell it as well, and everyone should appreciate each other. This is an expression of friendly affection. At this time, we should all strive to produce some good works and exhibit them in friendly countries so that people know what kind of cultural nation we are.

The fifth point is that people of any country certainly do not necessarily only paint their own paintings, but can also paint paintings that are not their own; the goodness of art has no limit, and they are free to learn. However, to cultivate other people's fields and abandon one's own territory is to let down one's ancestors, descendants, and oneself. This is a very serious responsibility, and they should strive to learn and promote it. Passing on the torch from generation to generation, such as the brilliant era of the Song and Yuan dynasties, formed a "glorious" record in the history of civilization. How valuable it is, we should also step onto the path of our predecessors.

It seems like I have finished speaking, but thinking about it, there are still a few words to say. Recently, the supplements of various newspapers often publish comments or narrations on national paintings, some wanting to transform it, some wanting to maintain it, some wanting to abolish it, and some wanting to promote it. They are extremely enthusiastic, but just as a doctor cannot prescribe medicine without understanding the source and pathology of the disease, in this situation, the patient's anxiety is useless, and the doctor's anxiety is also useless. Someone watching a play says that the actors on stage are not performing well, and someone says why don't you go up and do it? The watcher cannot do it, but they can say whether it is good or not, which does not help the matter. It is easy to watch things but difficult to do them, which has always been the case. Our Chinese national painting: to tell the truth, it cannot be said that it is not promising now; it is certainly too early to say progress, but landscape painting is much better than it was twenty years ago. What kind of painting was it twenty years ago? It was the Little Four Wang school at the end of its rope; speaking of brushwork, the brush could not stand up; speaking of ink, the ink could not be dyed with ink color. The mountains were ash heaps, and the trees were broomsticks. You should know that national painting does not disregard likeness; its major premise is that drawing people should resemble people, and drawing mountains should resemble mountains; otherwise, there is no need to have the names of figures and landscapes. After likeness, then discuss other things, such as brush and ink, artistic conception, charm, and breath, all packed into it. If you draw mountains that resemble mountains but people that do not resemble people, a complete mess, even if you want to pack in the many things mentioned above, you cannot pack them in; even if you want to support it or protect it, even if it is literati painting or said to be unrestrained or divine, like Zhang Tianshi's talisman: it can exorcise ghosts, and people do not care what it looks like; this is a matter of function. Painting is not like that; it must ultimately resemble something. As for Su Dongpo's claim that "discussing painting based on likeness is the view of a child," it is a fragmentary and one-sided view. My meaning is that it is not appropriate to judge other people's paintings based only on likeness or solely on likeness; you should also add and consider other things (the several types mentioned above) in order to obtain a fair judgment. If you also view Dongpo's saying in this way, then Dongpo has been wronged by you; at the same time, you have misled the painting world. Therefore, the titles of divine, unrestrained, and literati paintings should be added on the basis of likeness, which is a complete and comprehensive criticism.

Twenty years ago, my deceased friend Jiang Xiaoyu saw me writing about painting and said that you are a painter and should not also be a critic. In Europe, such as France, there are art theorists and artists; you should not violate this rule. I felt that it was not reasonable, and I protested, saying that someone without artistic cultivation and artistic practice experience would not know the "bitterness and sweetness of it," and would certainly "scratch an itch from outside the boot," like "a monk Zhang Er touching his head." The saying "It is difficult to know until you have experienced it" is absolutely correct! I firmly insisted that art theorists must be artists, and he had no choice but to let me do it. Unexpectedly, after I did it, social interactions became more and more busy day by day. Why? People who wanted me to write promotional articles said that your power is greater than ours in writing promotional articles; I asked them why, and they said because you are a painter! Later, after thinking about it carefully, I realized that I should not do this anymore because human relations are irresistible; if right and wrong are reversed and good and bad are not distinguished, how can I tolerate it? So I stopped writing such articles. After a long time, a good friend of mine said to me: Tianjian: You should not abandon your position as a critic because without power and position, you will be manipulated by others. I said I don't care about them; anyway, I will definitely not be affected by their good intentions; right and wrong are natural laws, and why should temporary praise or blame be important? If you value temporary popularity, then I am sorry, the powerful cannot lack your presence, and you cannot miss the lively scene. Business relationships and advertising expenses should be included in the capital, and you must use your mind and skills! However, if you are not careful, I am sorry, those who were in the limelight during the puppet regime will now have the label of colluding with the enemy and relying on power added to them! In fact, such people will definitely not be afraid because there are precedents such as Zhao Mengfu, Zhang Ruitu, and Wang Duo for them to follow, and it is just as valuable to curse them out as to praise them out, and it is easier to become famous by cursing than by praising! So an old friend laughed at me and said that you are still a fool; well, I am willing to be a fool for life. However, I will still write about the theory of painting, but I will never write articles that praise or curse people; I myself do not want to be in the limelight and overwhelm everything now. The titles of some great master or other, no matter what, I want to return them to Zhao. I have said too much, and I am about to go beyond the scope of the topic, but in fact, I am right in the center of the garden. You must know that the current environment and internal situation of national painting are related to what I have said above; the conclusion of this article is that critics should be faithful and wise in their criticism; if they do not understand, they should never interfere. The author themselves should honestly continue to study and stick to their position, and not care about everything else. Fulfill my duty. You must know that we Chinese have our own painting! People want to see yours!

### Famous Paintings and Famous Artists

— Liu Shi

One: The Pastoral Painter Millet and His Representative Works

Millet (Jean Francois Millet, 1814-1875) was a fiery general in the Barbizon school of French pastoral painters. He was the son of a farmer in a cold village near the Norman coast. He had a kind and capable grandmother who managed the entire household. His parents worked in the fields all day long, and Millet, like other farmers' sons, helped his parents in the fields every day; at the same time, he followed his parents in daily morning and evening prayers in the fields. His grandmother was also an old religious woman, so the paintings he had been accustomed to seeing since childhood were all religious propaganda paintings, and he used these paintings as models, repeatedly copying them. At the same time, a slate pencil and slate became his inseparable treasures. These actions slowly attracted the attention of his grandmother. So she said, "Francois has the qualities to succeed as a painter."

The name Francois in Millet's name was obtained by his grandmother from the church (derived from the name of the saint of Assisi, "Francis"). He also had an uncle who was a local missionary, who also discovered Millet's talent and believed that he must be educated. So he taught him Latin and taught him to read the Gospel of Mark, which he did not dislike and worked hard at. On days when it rained and he could not go out, he would scribble on the walls of the house, using the things he saw every day as subjects. One day, while walking on the road, he saw an old woman slowly walking towards him from afar, and he suddenly became very interested, hurriedly took a charcoal stick from his pocket, and quickly sketched the old woman's form on the wall. The villagers nearby were all shocked, and the old woman's expression was painted vividly, marveling at it as a miracle of the world! This news reached his father's ears, and he decided to send him to Paris.

In Paris, he entered the studio of the Romantic writer Delaroche. Because of his rural background, he inevitably suffered the ridicule and teasing of Parisian students upon arriving in the bustling capital, but his grades were outstanding, and he finally overcame his enemies and became a leader in the painting.

Soon, he held a wedding with a fellow villager, and to make a living, he made illustrations for various city magazines and painted nudes. He received a great deal of criticism, and after being stimulated by this, he resolutely left Paris and went to live in the village of Barbizon near Fontainebleau. So the man who came from the fields returned to the fields, and from then on, he devoted himself to depicting the scenes of the fields.

In 1849, Millet was thirty years old, and finally, "The Sower" was selected for the Paris Salon exhibition, attracting the attention of critics. The Parisian art world, which had always taken aristocratic life—wealth and glory—as its subject matter, suddenly discovered such a common painting, and naturally, not many people sympathized with it. Some even scolded him for being "vulgar," "low-class," and "ugly."

Strictly speaking, Millet was not the first to depict pastoral scenes. As early as the seventeenth century, the Netherlands already had them. At that time, the subjects of the so-called pastoral paintings were really only to expose the ugliness and weaknesses of the peasants—laughing, eating a lot, being stupid, and being wild. Millet's works were different. He used skilled and delicate techniques to depict the daily faithful and tireless sacred work of the blue-white and amiable peasants, from scattering the seeds in the fields, sweating, and using their strength, finally obtaining the hard-earned harvest. "The Gleaners" and "The Angelus" are masterpieces after "The Sower." Although he suffered ridicule and sarcasm at the time, they have now become world-famous works.

In addition, works such as "The Woodcutter," "Evening Bell," and "The Reapers" are also his representative works, leaving a brilliant page in the history of art. "Art Going to the Countryside," Millet was the first and most successful one. He never painted a portrait of a celebrity in his life, nor did he act as an accomplice for the wealthy and powerful. Born in poverty, he left behind only a few pastoral paintings after his death.

### Flying Together (78)

— Zhao Qingge

After finishing his cigarette, Shi Yulou stared blankly at the firefly-like light bulb, tears glistening in the gray gloom.

"Yulou, what's wrong with you? Are you not feeling well?" Madam Weng Er asked him in surprise, feeling uneasy in her heart.

"Nothing. Maybe I'm just tired," Shi Yulou said insincerely.

"Then you should rest and not exhaust yourself, so you can get better," Madam Weng Er said, tucking him in.

"Yes, it's time to rest!" Shi Yulou said meaningfully and secretly shed two tears.

Madam Weng Er did not realize the double meaning of Shi Yulou's words at the time. She went back to washing her clothes. After washing her clothes, she looked at Shi Yulou and saw no movement, only occasional coughs, so she thought that Shi Yulou was really tired and could not help but worry about his health. If she didn't let him sing anymore, they would have no way to make a living. "If Liyun were as successful as Lihua, wouldn't all the problems be solved?" Thinking of this, Madam Weng Er could not help but feel wronged for herself! She originally thought that marrying Shi Yulou would bring her a happy life, but who knew that everything would be so unsatisfactory. Madam Weng Er's fate could be considered bad enough! She had no more hope, only hoping that Shi Yulou's illness would get better soon. As long as Shi Yulou was by her side, she would be willing no matter how hard life was! She still loved Shi Yulou as much as she did in Jingzhou. Although she was old and Shi Yulou was old, her heart had not changed; in her eyes, Shi Yulou was still as beautiful as he was in those years!

However, Madam Weng Er's only hope was finally shattered again! The next morning, Madam Weng Er woke up and opened her eyes to see that Shi Yulou was no longer in bed. She hurriedly got up and went to Madam Mo's room and everywhere else to look for him, but there was no sign of Shi Yulou. So she panicked! Because Shi Yulou had never gotten up so early before, and thinking about the situation last night, she was even more panicked, and she had a premonition that the greatest misfortune was about to befall her!

Sure enough, it was not until the afternoon that someone found Shi Yulou in Beihai Park in the Central Park, but he had already closed his eyes. He had left this world in such a complaint and exhaustion, resting forever.

Madam Weng Er was going crazy! She hugged Shi Yulou's cold corpse and cried out and wept wildly!

This tragic scene deeply stimulated Lihua's soul! She seemed to feel that the dead person was not Shi Yulou, but herself—a future self! So she mourned for herself at the same time! Mourning for a future self who was learning from Shi Yulou's footsteps!

Madam Mo and Shi Yulou's colleagues were busy taking care of the affairs of this fallen actor. At this time, no one thought that on the same night, Madam Weng Er also followed Shi Yulou, using the money she had saved for washing clothes to buy two liang of opium to eat (she never dreamed that this opium paste, which she had originally planned to buy for Shi Yulou to relieve his cough, would be used as a tool for suicide). So Madam Mo and the others continued to take care of the second funeral.

Shi Yulou should have closed his eyes in peace! In this floating world, he finally felt that there was still a Madam Weng Er who had not abandoned him.

### Appreciation of Music

— Song Shouchang

Among the sister arts, music has the most profound relationship with human life and the most universal relationship with the public. Everyone has the most direct instrument for expressing emotions—the voice. When the heart feels something, it can be expressed as a song and become music, unlike other arts that require materials and tools, making it troublesome to express emotions. Because music is directly expressed from the heart, its power to guide people is great and profound. In terms of the effect of music: it can regulate our fatigue, please our spirit, and increase the efficiency of our work. Music is indeed an essential nutrient for spiritual life.

Music art is loved by the public, almost everyone likes to listen to music, and everyone can sing, with the exception of special sensory cases. However, only a few can understand music. Just listen to the music that is generally sung, and you can know. These songs mostly lack variation in melody, simple rhythm, and rich harmony, such as ordinary ballads, movie songs, dance music, and marches. If they hear profound and mysterious music, they will feel tired and uninterested, which is clear evidence of a lack of musical literacy.

Then how can music be understood? This step requires cultivating the ability to appreciate it. Regardless of what kind of art, the appreciation aspect is very important. Music is deeply hidden in art, unlike other works of art that exist in space with shapes, colors, or words. Such as paintings, handicrafts can be seen. Poetry can be read. Music is connected by empty and broad sounds, is an abstract art. Appreciation depends entirely on our hearing and imagination, from the invisible to appreciate its interest, so appreciating music is more difficult than appreciating other works of art, and understanding music is even more difficult.

Appreciating music is not just about using our senses. We hear pleasant tones and have a sense of pleasure, which is just the sensory beauty of music. Just like we see the beauty of nature and feel happy. Music is a product of reason, and emphasizes the beauty of musical structure. In addition to sensory appreciation, we must further appreciate and use our reason to study the structure and form of the music, so that we can taste more profound interest.

Although music is a direct expression of emotion, it uses various sounds that suggest emotions to guide people's hearts and arouse feelings of joy or sadness. Therefore, in order to appreciate music, in addition to the beauty of feeling and the beauty of reason, in order to obtain the effect of appreciating music, we must appreciate the emotion of music. Use the foundation of reason. Cultivate a rich memory, and use a keen imagination to understand. We must understand the emotion of the music and explore the personality and environment of the author.

In summary: appreciating music requires feeling, rational, and emotional, to appreciate music you must prepare the ability to appreciate music, which needs to be gradually cultivated through considerable time of training.

Special Production and Construction Edition

### Chinese Agricultural Tools and Machinery (2)

— Translated by Zhong Deqi

According to accurate statistics, the cost of using agricultural tools and machinery in the United States is 20% of the value of the tools. Interest rates on capital in China are also much higher than in the United States, and the tools are not as durable. The investment interest rate for agricultural tools in China calculated above is 20%, which is slightly lower than the current interest rates in various places. In short, the average cost per mu of agricultural tools is affected by the number of mu worked.

A practical and simple method for calculating the cost of using agricultural tools is to multiply the market price of the tools by the production loan interest rate. The depreciation rate of agricultural tools can be calculated as the reciprocal of the tool's lifespan in years. For example, if the lifespan is 20 years, then the annual depreciation rate is 5%. Add to this the total annual repair and operating costs (such as oil) to obtain the usage cost. When the investment interest, depreciation costs, and operating costs are added together, the result is the cost of using the agricultural tools. The cost per crop mu can be obtained by dividing the total cost by the number of crop mu. (Table 1) If an agricultural tool is rented or borrowed, it must be calculated separately.

(Unit: Yuan)

Estimated value of agricultural tools (27.70 yuan) 5.54

Depreciation (5%) 2.40

Operating costs (including repairs) 3.45

Total operating cost of agricultural tools per farm 11.39

Operating cost of agricultural tools per crop mu 0.365 (11.39 yuan divided by 31.2 crop mu)

Estimated value of agricultural tools per crop mu 0.89 (27.70 yuan divided by 31.2 crop mu)

Percentage of total operating cost of agricultural tools to the estimated value of agricultural tools 41 (0.365 yuan divided by 0.89 yuan)

Table 1. Average annual cost of using agricultural tools per farm in the Central and Eastern Provinces of China in 1935 (Note 1)

This method can be used to compare the costs of using various different agricultural tools and machinery. The total cost of any farm operation can be obtained. For example, for plowing, it is necessary to add the cost of labor and power (draft animals or machinery). A comparative study of operating the same operation with various different agricultural tools in China can reveal the relationship between the cost and profit of each tool. In 1935, the cost of hoeing per mu was 0.26 yuan, while using a tractor was only 0.07 yuan. The cost of harvesting per mu with a sickle was 0.192 yuan, while using a [threshing machine, likely] was only 0.06 yuan.

New-style Machinery

The following comparative calculations were made on a farm near Nanjing: using a water buffalo to pull a plow and using a tractor; using [hand flails, likely] to thresh and using a threshing machine (Table 2). According to these results, the cost of the tractor was more than twice that of the water buffalo. If the tractor tilled the soil better and produced a larger yield, then the labor cost increased due to the increased production should be deducted from the estimated cost of the tractor.

Table 2. Comparison of the Cost of Plowing with a Water Buffalo and a Tractor

Cost of Plowing with a Water Buffalo (1925, Nanjing)

Water Buffalo (Plowing 3 mu per day)

Cost of Using a Tractor (1925, Nanjing)

Tractor (Plowing 30 mu (5 acres) per day, 30 days plowing 900 mu (150 acres) as a standard)

Unit (Yuan)

Interest on investment in tractor (original price 2300 yuan, interest rate 12%, calculated based on half the time used) 138.00

Depreciation (20% of the original price, minus half used for other purposes) 230.00

Repair costs (5% of the original value, minus half used for other purposes) 57.50

Fuel (0.5 gallons per mu or 3 gallons per acre) 81.00

Lubricating oil (0.03 gallons per mu or 0.18 gallons per acre) 29.70

Tractor accident expenses 2% (minus half used for other purposes) 23.00

Total 559.20 (yuan)

Plow

Interest on investment per plow (original value 300 yuan, interest rate 12%)

Depreciation cost of two plows 10% 30.00

Repair cost of two plows 2% 6.00

Total 72.00 (yuan)

Labor

One laborer, daily wage 1.5 yuan, 30 days wages 45.00

Housing

Half the cost of plows and tractors 13.00

Total 689.20 (yuan)

Average cost per mu for 900 mu 0.75 (yuan)

Average cost per acre for 150 acres 4.59 (yuan) or (1.37 US dollars)

Comparing threshing machines with tractors, although the former can only be used for 15 days a year, vegetable oil in China is more cost-effective than tractors. The results of using a small threshing machine at Jinling University show that it is as economical as using a sickle and obtains pure products. The cost per 23 and one-third pounds is 0.54 yuan, which is close to the 0.55 yuan for a sickle. However, another difficulty in using new machinery is that the straw is not as stiff as that cut with a sickle, making it unsuitable for roofing. In southern China, there must also be roads that can move the threshing machine (translator's note: the fields in the south are narrow). However, the threshing machine can save time during the busy farming season and can combine the threshing and harvesting operations into one, thereby saving labor in addition to harvesting and reducing grain loss.

In irrigated areas downstream of the Yangtze River, the introduction of irrigation machines is a successful example of the use of new agricultural tools. Rice requires a lot of water, so in areas far from water, manual irrigation is not enough.

The possibility of introducing modern agricultural machinery is based not only on economic principles but also on the arrangement of the farm. If the fields are too small and irregular, and the roads are too narrow, the machinery cannot be used advantageously. It is possible to expand farms if arable land is reorganized or re-zoned. Recently, the United States has reduced the size of machinery. If its price can be reduced significantly, some machinery may be usable in China. (To be continued)

### Introduction to Business Administration

— Xu Baiyi

The following issues should be discussed in terms of production organizations: factory buildings, personnel, raw materials, manufacturing, and transportation. The point about factory buildings has already been discussed above, and now it may be worthwhile to discuss the other points in turn.

Personnel

The personnel referred to here is limited to the allocation of personnel, not personnel management, because personnel management will be discussed in detail after the production organization.

From the time we initiate to the establishment of the company and the construction of the factory building, the allocation of important staff should also be arranged properly. No matter what the matter, it is to be done by people, so the allocation of personnel has a great relationship with the success or failure of the business.

The allocation of personnel referred to here is discussed from the standpoint of production. Ordinary businesses do not have production work. The organization is relatively simple. Under a manager, there are several departments such as purchasing, sales, and accounting, which can handle daily affairs very smoothly.

The greatest purpose of personnel allocation is to clarify the responsibilities of each person, and the second is to make the work proceed smoothly. With an organization, a budget can be prepared by each department.

Simply speaking, the main parts of a company are nothing more than production, sales, and business. Now it may be worthwhile to discuss these aspects:

(A) Regarding the management part: Under normal circumstances, the highest officer of a company is the general manager (in a limited liability company, then the highest level in the form is the shareholders' meeting, below which is the board of directors, and below which is the general manager. The general manager is sometimes concurrently held by the chairman of the board, the managing director, or a director. If there is only one person, then there is no need to use the title of general manager, but the title of manager).

### Where Did the Rice Go?

— Shaofu

I ran all over seven or eight rice shops on North Sichuan Road and couldn't buy a dou of rice. We have never encountered such an embarrassing situation, even in the rear during the War of Resistance. What kind of world is this? What kind of vampires, what kind of demons are at work?

The grain loan case has gradually subsided, and we want to pursue its sequel. Before the truth comes out, it seems that Shanghai has become a city without rice. It is obvious that someone is manipulating this, showing their "colors."

The newspapers publish every day that thousands of dan have arrived, and thousands of dan have been allocated. What Annam rice, Brazil rice, Jiangxi brown rice, God knows, I ran seven or eight rice shops, and I didn't buy a single grain.

Every rice shop is open, and the clerks are smoking and enjoying the street scene, while the rice bags and rice cabinets are empty.

"Isn't there allocated rice to be sold to you?" I asked.

"We applied four or five days ago, and it hasn't been allocated yet," the clerk replied.

"Hey! I don't care about the price, you say it."

"Sir, there really isn't any. If there were, why wouldn't we sell it?"

"Then what are you opening the door for!" I was a little angry.

"If we don't open the door, our license will be revoked. We can't help it!"

"Hey, where can I buy it, friend, please help me!"

"Tianhougong Bridge, Zilaihuo Street, Qiujiang Road, there are porters, there are stalls, they are all selling."

Another clerk smiled triumphantly and then said: "Rice shops are also playing guerrilla warfare."

The above is an account of my rice buying experience yesterday. I faithfully record it here. I believe this is definitely not a situation that I have encountered alone.

### The First Time

— Denghui

"The First Time" is the name of a demon. Since mankind has had "unease" in their "conscience," it has quietly descended into the world. When "The First Time" had not yet come, mankind's "conscience" was as calm as the water in an ancient well; therefore, mankind was confused—did "The First Time" bring the unease of conscience? Or did the unease of conscience bring "The First Time"? This question is as inexplicable as whether the chicken came first or the egg.

In principle, it is now the atomic age! A demon like "The First Time" should have disappeared upon hearing about the atom. However, no, "The First Time" has laid such a solid foundation in the conscience of mankind. Its tricks have made the conscience of mankind change from hating it to sympathizing with it, from disliking it to understanding it.

Now, the network of influence of "The First Time" has spread throughout the entire human world. What kind of face has this world been made into by "The First Time"! Look!

Someone is using violent hands to defile a young girl. The girl can't struggle, and her virginity is destroyed! For him, it's the first time.

Someone is using a third hand to reach into other people's bags, drawers, safes... the first time.

Someone is openly taking weapons and moving your property away in a grand manner.

Someone's family has only six people, but they have more than a hundred dan of white rice piled up at home, and there's more! There's more in the warehouse!

Someone's speculation failed, but the gold bars increased by dozens.

Enough! Enough! I'm just picking these little things to prove the relationship between "The First Time" and human conscience!

When these people, who have been demonized by "The First Time" and whose consciences are uneasy, when their unease is confirmed and made public, listen to what they say: "Please forgive me for 'The First Time'! I really committed it for 'The First Time'!" So, people buy the ghostly face of "The First Time" and do a "consideration of the first offense due to ignorance, and leniency in sentencing." Or even think it's innocent, and just scold them verbally: "No matter what, you can't be fooled by 'The Second Time'!" So, those uneasy consciences calm down again; and "The First Time" becomes even more rampant!

Let me simply reveal the ambition of "The First Time"! It adopts a kind of "offensive strategy," a "demonization policy"! It wants to turn the conscience of the entire human race into the evil heart of a demon, it wants to turn the entire human world into a demon's world!

Most of the human world has been changed from its original appearance of truth, goodness, and beauty. If this continues, what is the future destiny of mankind? You think about it!

Putting aside your own generation and saying: "Would you want your children and grandchildren to live in a desolate, dark, terrifying, and cruel demon world?"

"Good words of persuasion" can no longer save the crisis of this era!

"Knowing one's mistakes and correcting them" is simply a luxury for these people who have been demonized by "The First Time"!

Warn all just people in the world! We must never forgive the demon "The First Time" again! We must mercilessly eliminate the "consciences" that do evil in the name of "The First Time"! At the same time, you—one of mankind—must more actively prevent "The First Time" from sneaking into your precious and innocent heart!

### Starting from Relief Supplies

— Chen Zhongxun

The earliest relief supplies seen in the newspapers were raisins and jackfruit. The relief supply that has recently become famous in the newspaper is milk powder. There is no relief rice among them, probably because the United States does not produce rice? I seem to have heard of flour, but in reality, milk powder has taken the lead.

Raisins, jackfruit, and milk powder are all top-quality items; the relief authorities must have put a lot of thought into providing relief to us. They intentionally want to raise the living standards of the Chinese people and make us truly one of the four great powers.

Relief and dumping cannot be mentioned in the same breath. Dumping is low-priced sales. Therefore, after Carnation milk powder was dumped, Huimin milk powder withdrew from the market and went into seclusion. But relief doesn't cost a penny. Dumped goods can defeat domestic products, and since relief goods don't cost a penny, they will definitely defeat dumped goods. As for the relationship between relief goods and domestic products? I feel a little confused for a moment.

The US Department of Commerce budgets US$2.5 billion annually for export advertising. I wonder when American advertising goods will come to China? Have they already come? However, relief goods should not be advertising goods, right? If compatriots don't understand very well, they can only ask our benefactor.

Milk powder is a relief item, and tofu soy milk is a domestic product. As the saying goes, "It can only relieve the emergency, but not poverty." It can be seen that relief items are not permanent. If we have already become addicted to milk powder before the relief stops, then after the relief stops, will we still eat dumped milk powder, or will we eat domestic tofu soy milk? I don't think we will be able to eat tofu soy milk. First, the tofu shop has already changed its business to a milk powder distributor, and second, once we are used to eating milk powder, we won't be used to eating tofu soy milk.

I think it's best to refuse to eat milk powder now and continue to eat tofu soy milk, because once you get addicted to milk powder, and the milk powder is no longer dumped and the supply is cut off, you will be forced to Liangshan Mountain and eat stockpiled goods.

Good heavens, the topic is relief supplies, but I have written about stockpiled goods. Isn't that irrelevant and inhumane!

### What I Saw in the Park

— Chimo

Going to the park to sit or walk is best done in the morning, but I say morning not because the air is fresh in the morning, but because there are special close-up shots to be seen everywhere in the park in the morning. If this time has passed, then everything in the park seems plain, and all the flowers and trees are as silent as chairs. Therefore, the park in the morning is full of vigorous vitality, so my time to go to the park is set in the morning.

The rules and regulations at the entrance of the park clearly prohibit kicking a ball in the park. I remember that in the days of the patrol room, when the patrolman saw a tourist carrying a ball, he would confiscate it without asking if you were going to kick it. Now, it is said to be democracy, so it can't be forbidden. Therefore, small soccer balls are kicked to large soccer balls, and there are also people playing badminton. If some children are unlucky, they will be hit by stray "balls." Of course, their noses and eyes will be swollen, and sometimes they will even bleed on the spot. In the period when "Dogs and Chinese are not allowed in," this kind of unfortunate event never happened.

Perhaps there are more and more unemployed actors and singers every day. They can't sing in harmony, so they have fled to the park, taking in a group of apprentices, and the money for room and board is also settled. In the past, there was only one group that danced knives and clubs in the park (taking Gujiazhai Park as an example) every morning, but now, a large group of people is gathered around watching fist fights, and there is also a large circle watching single spears breaking double knives in the west, and there is also one in the south, and also one in the north, there is one over there, and there is also one over here, there are probably many, and there are both men and women. The audience is surrounded by people, and some people even climb trees and watch from a high position. When each program is finished, the audience is very polite and always applauds for a while.

### The Three-Person Conference Is Too Serious

— Feng Yi

During the three-person conference, everyone sat around a very ordinary long table. Marshall sat in the center, the government representative sat on the right, and the CCP representative sat on the left. It seems to give us a very clear concept that one side is "left" and one side is "right," while Marshall is neither left nor right.

Every time the conference is held, Marshall never prepares a "political banquet." He doesn't wait until the conference is over, and everyone eats their own meal. Therefore, some people suspect that this is one of the factors that make it difficult to talk well. Because Chinese people are most likely to have a very speculative conversation while eating; if it is possible to use finger-guessing games to help liven things up in the "political banquet," and everyone extends their thumbs and shouts loudly "Good brothers," you guess how energetic this is. Maybe the two brothers will really get along from then on! But, unfortunately; Marshall is an American after all, and he doesn't understand the art of Chinese people eating. Three or two glasses of Shaoxing wine and two shouts of "Good brothers" often have wonderful uses beyond the conference.

So that's what I think: If Marshall really came up with a table of "reunion wine," brought two bottles of whiskey to cheer things up, and brought a few glasses of Shaoxing wine to moisten his throat, and had Marshall set up a "general pass," and everyone shouted with all their might a few times of "Family Happiness" and "Good Brothers," and then had Shao Lizi or Wang Shijie and Zhou Enlai come for a "grab three," and everyone made the sound as loud as possible, taking the opportunity to let out a breath of suffocation, and Marshall at this time—after three rounds of wine, if he shouted out another "Good Brothers," I believe everyone would definitely not put on a cold face and say sarcastic things. Maybe everyone will really get along from then on, then wouldn't you and I, the little common people, be "blessed as a family"!

Finally, my "idea" is that Marshall should also change his style. Only eating some "sand leak water" during the conference not only cannot raise interest, but also really becomes "cold in the heart."

### Words of a Drinker

— Fang Jun

My friends all advise me to quit drinking.

They all say: A person who makes a living solely from medicine pots and tea stoves, yet cannot give up alcohol, is no different from committing slow suicide.

Suicide, I don't have that kind of courage. If I did, I would have committed suicide more than a decade ago, why wait until today? I know alcohol can harm life, but alcohol has been my friend for over twenty years, yet it hasn't demonstrably harmed my life. On the contrary, when I am without alcohol, I find life sad; once I have a glass in my hand, I feel light and carefree, seeing vitality and joy everywhere. Even when I'm full of sorrow, and "raising a glass to drown my sorrows only increases them," I can still see meaning in life through the glass, and it's not just a gray haze like it is when I haven't been drinking.

Over the years, I've discovered that alcohol doesn't give me something like the commonly perceived toxin, but rather a pure stimulant for life; it can inspire me to be a person, and encourage me to struggle for life. It pulls me out of depression, sends me much warmth from the cold, and gives me a glimpse into the diversity of life, and that the world is a multifaceted and complex place. The world, to put it on a small scale, is a chessboard, and countries and nations are the chess pieces vying on the board. The struggle of the chess pieces is governed, and being governed means there will be victory and defeat, survival and extinction. However, through drowsy, drunken eyes, it truly is multifaceted and complex! Only in the drowsy, drunken eyes does one come to understand the truth of it. Over the years, I've received a lot of help from alcohol.

Who says alcohol "harms life?"

But alcohol makes people take risks, risks to the point where they are not afraid of death. This is probably what is meant by "harming life!" However, that is not the original intention of alcohol! It just wants people to see that the dangers before them are not dangers at all. Therefore, proving it from this perspective, it can indeed lead you to overcome crises and save your life from them. That's my understanding.

However, alcohol sometimes brings me a bit of annoyance, because it gives me too much courage, making me too reckless; being too reckless leads to regret, but that only comes after waking up. If one is still in a drunken stupor, that regret will never truly become regret.

Alcohol gives a person a sense that his life is not dangerous, but an adventure; this is why alcohol is so endearing.

When I first started drinking, I always adhered to the precept of "unlimited alcohol, but not to the point of chaos." I would drink a pound or half a pound until my face turned like a pig's liver, and then happily ponder the true meaning of life, and consider myself satisfied. Later, it wasn't that my alcohol tolerance had reached its limit, but that my personality gradually became much more unrestrained, so a pound or half a pound was no longer enough to satisfy me. Thus, the taste of life I experienced from alcohol became even deeper. Sometimes, unable to restrain myself, I would use alcohol to scold the audience.

Scolding the audience is indeed a delightful thing! "Truth comes out after drinking," the person being scolded always has something to be scolded for, and it's something that must be scolded. Only then can I thoroughly and completely scold to my heart's content "after drinking." However, this is always where I offend people, if the person being scolded doesn't reflect on themselves. Later, I accepted my friends' advice and gave up much of this, but the amount of alcohol I drank still increased, and this was by no means due to a large capacity, but because I wanted to drink more.

To drink more means to get drunk. Only when drunk is life truly lived.

However, this only applies to Shaoxing wine. When I moved to Hong Kong, I didn't dare to drink a pound at a time. This is because double-distilled liquor isn't as mild as rice wine, and double-distilled liquor tastes spicy when it enters the mouth.

Some people describe drinking double-distilled liquor as "swallowing razor blades," but I never acknowledge that it "harms life."

However, drinking double-distilled liquor to the point of drunkenness means it takes more than half a day to wake up, and after waking up, one always wears a deathly pale face. Since I'm often sick, wearing this deathly pale face makes me even more frightening.

Because it's frightening, my friends often advise me to quit drinking.

Quitting drinking isn't difficult, but after quitting drinking, the pleasure of life will also disappear, at least for me, that's how it is.

However, how can I betray the good intentions of my friends? In the past month or so, I've accepted my friends' advice and put quitting drinking into practice.

After I quit drinking, my wife immediately unfurled her perpetually furrowed brow, because, in the midst of "poverty-stricken couples experiencing grief in everything," she had one less alcohol expense to arrange for each day.

But I feel a sense of emptiness in everything, in this past month or so, after quitting drinking.

### Poems of an Eastern Journey

— Gu Yiqiao

Difficult to hold Yokosuka by quietly sneaking in,
To jump into the sea and burn the body is also futile;
The divine wind of September cannot reach,
The surrender ship is docked in Tokyo Bay. (Yokosuka Port)

The bleak wind and snow over Etajima,
The Japanese dwarfs who buried in the sea lost their hegemonic ambitions;
I do not believe the Qin King ever sent envoys,
The port of Kansai sealed Wu long ago. (Kure Port)

A hundred years of deluded dreams, revealing military uniforms,
Hiroshima became ruins in a single bomb blast;
The country is broken, the family is dead, the ruler is humiliated,
Red faces and white hair depend on each other after the disaster. (Hiroshima)

Not yet ascended to the Empathy Pavilion,
Kobe happily gazes upon the writings of the Father of the Nation;
Waiting to visit the surviving elders on the seashore,
The night tide has already reported the waxing and waning of the moon. (Kobe)

Osaka's heroic posture remains in the ancient fortress,
Exhausting soldiers and destroying armor, nothing remains;
Pitifully, in the ashes after the disaster,
The spring rain still reports the souls of those who died later. (Osaka)

Where does the spiritual light shine at Magu?
The Kiyomizu Temple is a secluded old imperial capital;
Occasionally a guest on the shores of Lake Biwa,
The price of paper in Luoyang will soar in the Immortal Assembly Picture. (Kyoto)

The Imperial Garden and Shrine are not to be visited,
The verdant pines and cypresses are leisurely and long;
Still the top of Mount Fuji is white,
A returning boat in the wind and rain, a seagull on the sea. (Tokyo)

### Glass Battleship

— Zou Shangchang

The road is bustling with noise, with groups of people here and there, all whispering and discussing. It is said that an American glass battleship will come to Shanghai this afternoon.

Although it is a very hot day, with a fiery sun high in the sky, the Huangpu River is crowded with people, all there to see the American glass battleship. Everyone is waiting patiently, and two or three hours pass. The battleship still doesn't even show a shadow. Suddenly, someone yells, "The glass battleship is here! The glass battleship is here!" Then, millions of eyes all look towards the river. Those in the back who can't see lift their feet and stretch their necks to look at the river. All that can be seen is a great wind blowing in the river, making it impossible for those on the shore to open their eyes. The wind and waves are strong, creating a truly overwhelming momentum. Before long, the wind subsides, the waves calm, and the smoke and clouds dissipate. The people of Shanghai have added another legend. In the end, the glass battleship has come after all.

The people of Shanghai are, as always, sensitive.

### The Mystery of Rice?

— Wuling Ren

The Huangpu District police alarm has been installed. Some say that from now on, the Huangpu District police should forget about catching any robbers. The reasoning is very simple: after the installation of the alarm, aren't the robbers all scared away?

Or it is said that playing poker requires patience, while at the same time requiring ruthless hands and a hard heart. If you can cheat, you should cheat. If the wind changes, it is better to shrink back. In short, you need to adapt to all sorts of changes and be on guard at all times. Therefore, those who are inexperienced in the world should not enter the game. On the other hand, those who are skilled in this way must already be rich in worldly experience. However, adapting to circumstances is indeed a necessary condition for living in the world. As for success or failure, it all depends on fate. If fate is not on your side, all efforts are in vain.

"Secrets should not be told to those who love to drink." This saying is not necessarily reliable. Haven't many of the traitors who were recently tried leaked the secret of "communicating with the central government" in court? I don't believe that all these traitors are drunkards.

The Father of the Nation died in Gu Weijun's residence in Beiping. There was a white marble stone monument inlaid on the wall with the inscription in gold lettering. Before the Japanese invasion, an old man who was guarding the house plastered it over with whitewash, so it remained intact. The old man's whereabouts are now unknown. It is a pity that Chu Minyi did not know about this, otherwise, he could have used it to present to the court as a reason to request a reduced sentence, which would have been a much stronger piece of evidence than the non-existent "preserving the Prime Minister's..."

Not being able to buy rice at home, a colleague said this was not true. The rice shops are full of rice, they just don't want to sell it. However, when I went back the next day, I actually investigated all the nearby rice shops. Apart from the shop assistants eating a large pot of cooked rice for dinner, I truly couldn't see a single grain of rice in the rice buckets. This proves that what my colleague said was the truth, and that the rice merchants were deceiving me.
