### Chairman Will Soon Leave Shanghai for Nanjing to Attend Military Demobilization Conference; Cordial and Free Press Conference

[Central News Agency, this city] The arrival of Chairman Chiang and his wife in Shanghai was met with wild jubilation by the entire city's residents. Yesterday, stores and households throughout the city continued to display flags to show their welcome and admiration. The consecutive days of clear weather and warm sunshine further symbolized the enthusiastic and excited emotions of the Shanghai citizens in welcoming their head of state. People from all walks of life, after eight years of separation, were eager to see the Chairman's demeanor and receive his instructions. In particular, both Chinese and foreign journalists flocked to the Chairman's private residence on Dongping Road, seeking interviews in an endless stream. Due to their busy official duties, the Chairman and his wife were unable to meet with everyone individually. Therefore, they made time at 11:00 AM yesterday to hold their first press conference in Shanghai since the War of Resistance. The Shanghai Office of the Central Propaganda Department invited reporters from various Chinese and foreign newspapers in the city to attend. Before 10:30 AM, the seating in the Shanghai Municipal Government conference room was already full, with about seventy people, all waiting excitedly and pleasantly for the arrival of the Chairman and his wife.

At 11:05 AM, the Chairman and his wife, accompanied by Chairman Zhang Daofan and Mayor Qian Dajun, gracefully arrived, and the entire room stood up to pay their respects. Chinese and foreign photographers busily captured these invaluable moments of the Chairman and his wife. The Chairman wore a special-grade general's uniform of khaki wool, looking radiant and kind. Madame Chiang wore a purple silk cheongsam with a chestnut-colored velvet coat, her face full of smiles, approachable and amiable. After the Chairman took his seat, he repeatedly nodded and smiled, inviting everyone to sit down, and the press conference began. First, Chairman Zhang Daofan stood up and announced: "Today, as the Chairman still has other important matters to attend to, the press conference is limited to twenty minutes. If you have any questions, please complete them within twenty minutes. To help the Chairman and Madame Chiang get to know everyone, please state your name and the name of the newspaper you represent before asking your questions."

The Chairman then declared, "If you have any opinions, please feel free to ask." After Secretary Shen Changhuan translated into English, Chinese and foreign reporters freely raised various questions, and the Chairman personally answered them one by one. For those that could not be answered in detail on the spot, he indicated, "Please submit written inquiries, so that I can provide written replies." Madame Chiang also interjected from the side, helping to convey messages. For example, when a foreign reporter asked about "rumors that China and the Soviet Union are conducting secret negotiations," mistakenly saying "rumors that the United States and the Soviet Union," Madame Chiang immediately corrected him. Also, when the Chairman answered a reporter's question about the date of returning the capital, saying "The government's return to the capital will be before May, but it has not yet been decided," Secretary Shen omitted "before May" when translating into English, and Madame Chiang immediately corrected him. Secretary Shen then apologized.

The Chairman answered a total of fifteen questions. More questions were raised by foreign reporters, and the content included domestic affairs, diplomacy, economics, and other aspects. The atmosphere in the venue was very free and harmonious, without any restraint, fully demonstrating the Chairman's utmost respect for public opinion and freedom. When the press conference had already exceeded the time by five minutes, Secretary Shen announced its conclusion, but the Chairman still smilingly declared, "It is okay to extend it for a few more minutes, please continue to raise one or two more questions," which proved that the Chairman was very happy to talk with reporters and listen to the opinions of the press. The press conference concluded at 11:35 AM, lasting a total of thirty minutes. After the meeting, at the request of a foreign female reporter, the Chairman stood side by side with her for a photo before leaving the venue with his wife. The original words of the Chairman's answers to the reporters' questions are recorded below:

### Answers to Various Important Questions

Reporter (1): It is rumored that China and the Soviet Union are conducting secret negotiations. It is said that the United States government is requesting China and the Soviet Union to fully inform the United States government of the negotiation situation. Is there such a thing?

Chairman's Answer: Regarding this matter, I have already explained it to reporters in Chongqing. There are no formal negotiations between China and the Soviet Union at present. However, informal discussions on economic cooperation are ongoing from time to time, but there is nothing that cannot be disclosed. If the United States government has this desire, then we can inform them at any time.

Question (2): By what date will the Soviet army completely withdraw from the nine northeastern provinces of China? What is the agreement between the Soviet Union and the Chinese government?

Answer: This matter has already been announced. The Soviet army originally intended to withdraw from the Northeast before February 1st. Regarding the detailed situation in the Northeast, there is no time to tell you in detail today. If you have any questions, you can submit them in writing, and I can give you a written reply in the future.

Question (3): Negotiations between China and France have been going on for a long time. I wonder if there are any difficulties in the progress, and when can a new treaty be signed?

Answer: Negotiations between China and France are still in progress, and the results will be announced soon.

Question (4): Last Sunday, Chongqing citizens celebrated the success of the Political Consultative Conference, and a fight broke out. I wonder who should be responsible?

Answer: I have not received a report on this matter yet.

Question (5): Since the Chairman's arrival in Shanghai, prices here have fallen sharply, indicating that there is speculation by unscrupulous merchants. I wonder if the government can take effective steps to deal with prices in the future?

Answer: The government will naturally take effective measures to deal with prices.

Question (6): How much time will it take for General Marshall to complete his mission in China?

Answer: It will take a considerable amount of time.

Question (7): When will the National Assembly be held, when will the government return to the capital, and is there any plan to move the capital elsewhere?

Answer: The government has decided that the National Assembly will be held in Nanjing on May 5th, so the government's return to the capital will be before May, but it has not yet been decided. As for the relocation of the capital, there is no such saying in the government.

Question (8): Will the Chairman go to Nanjing to attend the military demobilization conference convened by the Army Headquarters in Nanjing?

Answer: I will go to Nanjing to attend the meeting.

Question (9): The government has made major concessions in the Political Consultative Conference. Does the CCP guarantee that it can truly abandon its private army?

Answer: I and the people of the whole country believe that the Chinese Communist Party's private army will certainly be returned to the state, because if the CCP cannot abandon its private army, then all the efforts of this Political Consultative Conference will be invalid, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference will be equivalent to empty words.

Question (10): It is said that there are still some German Nazis in China who have not been sent to concentration camps. I wonder if the Chairman paid attention to this during his visit to Shanghai?

Answer: The government treats all German Nazis in China as prisoners of war and deals with them accordingly. However, genuine German businessmen who have no political ties should be treated differently.

Question (11): When can political prisoners be released?

Answer: The Political Consultative Conference has already made a resolution on the release of political prisoners, and the government has announced this a long time ago, and it is now being implemented.

Question (12): Chinese newspapers widely report that the government is about to be reorganized, and there are various speculations about the candidates for ministers of the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan. Is this true?

Answer: The government reorganization will be implemented after the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, so all issues must be decided by the Second Plenary Session. All the rumors outside are speculation.

Question (13): Before the Chairman goes to Nanjing, will he return to his hometown of Fenghua for a trip?

Answer: I have no time for that at the moment.

Question (14): Is China preparing to try Japanese war criminals in China, and what are your opinions on the re-education of Japan?

Answer: China will also try Japanese war criminals in China in the same way as other countries, and it can be done at any time. Regarding the re-education of Japan, I generally agree with General MacArthur's approach.

Question (15): Will China send troops to participate in the occupation of Japan?

Answer: The government is considering this matter and will decide soon.

Zhang Guogan, Ye Gongchuo, Chen Taoyi, Zhao Zhiyou, Yan Huiyu, and Tang Wenzhi were unable to attend due to illness. Chairman Chiang and his wife arrived at 4:20 PM and were introduced to each attendee by Mayor Qian, Chairman Wu, and others, shaking hands with each person. The Chairman's attitude was kind, and his genuine emotions were fully revealed, offering sincere comfort to the attendees, showing utmost cordiality. Among them were many who were acquainted with the Chairman and his wife. The Chairman and his wife inquired about the situation over the past eight years with earnest concern, deeply moving all the attendees. They then took their seats, and after light refreshments, the Chairman stood up to deliver a speech, extending his sincere comfort to the elderly gentry and citizens of Shanghai. The entire room responded with warm applause. Next, Mr. Yen Hui-ching delivered a reply on behalf of the elderly gentry. Finally, Mr. Li Denghui firmly requested Madame Chiang to deliver a speech. As there were many American church members present, Madame Chiang spoke in English. Although her words were brief, her emotions were sincere, and everyone applauded repeatedly to express their gratitude. The tea party ended at around 5:00 PM, and the attendees once again shook hands with the Chairman and his wife to say goodbye. After a brief rest, the Chairman and his wife also departed. At that time, Talas Road was already packed with people, vying to catch a glimpse of the demeanor of the Chairman and his wife. When the Chairman and his wife left in a car, cheers thundered, as if everyone was drunk or in a dream. The speeches of Chairman Chiang and Yen Hui-ching are recorded below:

Chairman Chiang's Speech

I have been separated from the elders and compatriots of Shanghai for more than eight years. During these eight years, the elders and compatriots of Shanghai have suffered from the oppression and trampling of the enemy and puppets, but they have all struggled hard and jointly strived for victory. Today, meeting here is like a family reunion, harmonious and happy. I am filled with emotions, and a wave of enthusiasm that cannot be expressed in words. Shanghai is our country's largest city and should be a model for the whole country. I hope that all the elders will carry forward the spirit of hard struggle and work together to build a new country, so as not to betray the results obtained from bearing hardships and enduring humiliation for eight years. I extend my sincere wishes, wish you all good health, and jointly complete the great cause of national construction.

Yen Hui-ching's Speech

Briefly stated: Listening to the Chairman's instructions and comfort fully demonstrates his concern for the citizens of Shanghai, which is inspiring. I have been in Shanghai for four or five years, coming from Hong Kong via Chongqing, so I am more familiar with the situation in Shanghai and can briefly report to the Chairman. Recalling the beginning of the Japanese surrender, I, Hui-ching, was instructed by Mr. Jiang Bocheng to convey the Chairman's message to comfort the British and American僑民 in the concentration camps. At that time, I told them that the physical suffering in the concentration camps was not the real suffering. The most painful thing was the lack of opportunity to serve the motherland during the War of Resistance. The British and American僑民 were very moved by these words. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, Shanghai was actually a large concentration camp. The physical suffering of the citizens of Shanghai was not worth mentioning, but their spirits were very painful because they could not work as hard for the War of Resistance as their compatriots in the interior. After the victory of the War of Resistance, many compatriots in the interior did not understand the difficult situation of the citizens of Shanghai, but among the three million citizens of Shanghai, although there were a few scum, the majority loved the country and could contribute money and effort to run charitable and educational undertakings. In recent months, compatriots in the interior have clearly understood the citizens of Shanghai. Everyone is of one heart and one mind, working together to promote the prosperity of Shanghai. In the past eight years, Shanghai's municipal administration has been abandoned, roads have not been repaired, sewers have not been unblocked, and wharves have been damaged, all of which need to be repaired urgently. However, a large amount of money is needed, which is beyond the capabilities of the Shanghai Municipal Government. I dare to ask the Chairman to pay special attention to it. Last time the Chairman went to Peiping but did not visit Shanghai, the citizens of Shanghai were all disappointed. Yesterday, the Chairman and his wife suddenly arrived, and the citizens of the whole city were overjoyed and enthusiastic, all from sincerity. This scene is like orphans seeing their parents. I only represent the elders of the city to pay respects to the Chairman and his wife.

Madame Chiang's Speech

Briefly stated: I am very happy to see many old friends during this trip to Shanghai with the Chairman. Just now, Mr. Yen said that the compatriots in the interior do not understand the situation of the citizens of Shanghai very well, which is not entirely true. I can tell you a story. Last month, I went to the Northeast. According to a friend, when the Japanese army occupied the Northeast, they forced the compatriots in the Northeast to pray for the Japanese Emperor every morning. The compatriots in the Northeast did pray, but not for the Japanese Emperor, but for the National Government. The Chairman and I are convinced that Shanghai is also the same. The citizens of Shanghai, except for a few scum, are all loyal to their country. As early as the War of Resistance, the compatriots in the interior struggled for the country with force, while the citizens of Shanghai promoted the national spirit and gave spiritual encouragement to the whole country. What I must express my gratitude for is that the citizens of Shanghai did their best to donate money during the War of Resistance, so that wounded soldiers, orphans, and the families of anti-Japanese soldiers could get financial assistance. Now that the War of Resistance has victoriously ended, the occupied areas and the free areas are like a large family, without distinction between each other. The so-called "within the four seas, all are brothers."

### Over a Hundred Letters of Petition Received from the People

[Central News Agency, this city] Chairman Chiang's first visit to Shanghai after the victory of the War of Resistance shows his great concern for the sufferings of the people. He has specially set up a secretariat in the headquarters to accept petitions from the people. It is reported that the secretariat received more than 180 letters yesterday, of which more than 120 were accusation letters. It is said that most of the accusation letters are accusations against traitors, and some also involve administrative officials.

### Commander-in-Chief Personally Receives Representatives of Comrades Who Suffered; Ten-Minute Speech Greatly Encourages

[This City News] After the press conference, the Chairman went to the Secretary-General's office and, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief, received fifty representatives of comrades who suffered, including Mrs. Jiang Bocheng, Wu Kaixian, Dai Jimin, Tao Guangchuan, Fei Yimin, Jiang Menglin, Wang Weijun, Qian Jianqiu, Wan Molin, Lü Entan, Mao Zipei, Chen Baohua, Ji Zhenchang, Luo Yaxi, Zhu Wen, Wen Tiansheng, Lu Huimin, and Mrs. Zhang Xiaotong. He greatly encouraged the comrades for their hard struggle in the past eight years and hoped that they would continue their efforts in the future. After a ten-minute speech, he took a group photo with all the representatives of the comrades who suffered in front of the Municipal Government to commemorate the occasion. At the same time, the comrades who suffered presented the Commander-in-Chief with a written request for five items, including severely punishing traitors, establishing schools for the children of comrades who suffered, and providing relief to the families of martyred comrades. The Commander-in-Chief repeatedly said about the point of severely punishing traitors: "It should be, it should be."

### Chairman Visits U.S. Flagship Yesterday; Inspects Chinese Naval Vessels and Trained Soldiers; Beforehand, Appears on Municipal Government Balcony to Meet Welcoming Crowds

[Central News Agency, this city] Yesterday morning, the Chairman summoned Chairman Pan Gongzhan and Jiangsu Inspector Cheng Cangbo at the official residence to hear reports on the general situation in the city. Mr. Cheng also reported on his inspection of Jiangsu Province, and they left after half an hour. At 11:00 AM, the Chairman and his wife attended a press conference at the Municipal Government and summoned representatives of the comrades who suffered. An hour earlier, thousands of people had gathered near the Municipal Government, vying to see the demeanor of the Chairman and Madame Chiang. When the car carrying the Chairman and his wife arrived at the gate of the Municipal Government at exactly 11:00 AM, the crowd cheered enthusiastically. Later, more and more crowds gathered, causing traffic congestion nearby. After receiving the representatives of the comrades who suffered, the Chairman, because of the people's unanimous request to see him and their unwavering gathering, unable to suppress their enthusiasm, accompanied his wife to the balcony on the upper floor of the main entrance of the Municipal Government, appearing before tens of thousands of people, waving to meet the crowds. At this time, tens of thousands of people unanimously cheered enthusiastically, and the cheers thundered, shaking the clouds, lasting for a long time. The reporter also walked onto the balcony at this time, looking down and seeing a sea of people in front of the Municipal Government, waving their hats and hands, expressing their highest respect to the Chairman and his wife. The sincerity of their emotions cannot be described in words. The Chairman and his wife also smiled and waved frequently in response, lasting for three minutes before coming down from the balcony. Because the crowds in front of the Municipal Government had not dispersed at this time, and vehicles could not pass, they drove away from the side door of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road. At 11:15 AM, at the invitation of Admiral Cooke, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy in China, the Chairman and his wife went to the U.S. Seventh Fleet flagship "Estes." When the Chairman and Madame Chiang arrived at the Jianghai Customs Wharf, the crowds waiting in front of and on the roof of the Customs Inspection Office shouted "Long Live!" and applauded enthusiastically. The Chairman slowly walked towards the river, waving frequently to the cheering crowds. Rear Admiral Ponner, Chief of Staff of the Seventh Fleet, was already waiting at the wharf to greet them. The Chairman and his wife boarded a small motorboat specially prepared for the reception and sailed to the flagship. The officers and men on the ship stood on the deck and saluted as the motorboat approached. When the boat approached the flagship, the Chairman and his wife were the first to board the ship, followed by General Wedemeyer, Mayor Qian, Director Yu, Director Dai, Director Zhou Zhirou, Deputy Director Zhou Xianzhang, and others. When the Chairman arrived on the deck, the ship played the Chinese national anthem to pay tribute. Then, Admiral Cooke, Commander of the Seventh Fleet, greeted them into the living room and served them refreshments, talking happily for fifteen minutes. Admiral Cooke then invited the Chairman and his wife to take a photo on the deck to leave a glorious souvenir for the ship. After leaving the ship, the motorboat carrying the Chairman circled around the ships of the fleet anchored in the Huangpu River. Each ship hung the Chinese national flag to pay tribute, and the officers and men stood on the deck to salute. The Chairman stood at the stern of the boat and returned the salute one by one, and his wife also smiled and waved frequently. The British warships in the river also hung our national flag, and the officers and men stood on the deck to salute. After landing, the Chairman and his entourage took a car to the Huishan Wharf to inspect the Chinese Navy landing craft and inspect the sailors who were being trained, encouraging them to take on the important task of rebuilding the Chinese Navy. At 4:00 PM, the Chairman and his wife attended the historic tea party for the provincial gentry of the city at Talas Road, which ended at 5:22 PM. The Chairman and his wife heard that Ye Chucang, Special Envoy for Comforting the Southeast Region and Chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, was seriously ill and was receiving treatment at the Municipal Sanatorium on Daxilu Road. They were accompanied by Chairman Wu Shaoshu of the City Party Committee to visit and offer comfort. They then returned to the official residence at 5:40 PM. Today, the Chairman will come to the racecourse at 3:00 PM to receive a grand welcome from more than 100,000 people and deliver a speech to comfort the citizens of the city who have suffered hardships for the past eight years. At 5:30 PM, the Chairman and his wife will host a tea party for Argentine Ambassador to China Eck and his wife at the official residence.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 13th] The New York Times correspondent stated that the famine in India is indeed a very serious problem at present, but even if all the wheat produced in the world were poured into Madras, Indians would still starve to death. Indian people only know rice as food, and do not know that meat is better than rice. There are no less than 170 million cattle and sheep in India, enjoying themselves without fear of slaughter. Indians would rather starve to death than eat beef. The various political parties in India are still unwilling to cooperate in dealing with this serious famine problem. The National Congress Party is willing to let the Indian government solve this problem, hoping that the food crisis can promote the establishment of a people's government. Although the Muslim League is willing to assist the current Indian government, it does not want to join the people's government. Internal conflicts are the fatal wound of India.

[United Press, London, 12th] The British Parliamentary India Investigation Team returned to the country today. According to the team's 沙累遜, "There seems to be a possibility of cooperation between the major political parties in India." General-Major Rowe also said that the representatives were deeply impressed by the changes in the mood of the people after investigating in India for three weeks. Governor-General Wavell is working to resolve India's internal problems based on cooperation between the major parties in India. The team is scheduled to submit a report to Prime Minister Attlee tomorrow.

### Muslims Demonstrate in Bombay and Calcutta

[United Press, Bombay, 12th] Muslim groups gathered in the streets here today to hold demonstrations, protesting to the British government against the seven-year sentence of Indian National Army Muslim officer Captain Rashid. This kind of organized action under the independent leadership of Muslims is the first time since 1921. In recent years, most of the demonstrations against the British and the government have been handled by the All-India Parliament. Today's demonstration is mainly Muslim, which started in Calcutta yesterday. Martial law has now been declared in Calcutta. British troops and light tanks are patrolling the streets to suppress the demonstrations.

### New York Fuel Panic After Nine Days of Tugboat Workers' Strike; Industrial, Commercial, and Entertainment Venues Ordered to Close; World Metropolis Now Lifeless

[United Press, New York, 12th] The New York tugboat workers' strike has been going on for nine days, and the situation is urgent due to the lack of fuel in winter. The mayor has taken strict measures. This world's third largest metropolis is lifeless today, an unprecedented phenomenon. Industrial, commercial, and entertainment venues are completely shut down, Broadway is dark, and shops and windows are closed. The city is unable to obtain coal or oil from the New Jersey train station due to the North River, so all industries, except those necessary to maintain operations, were ordered to shut down by the mayor one minute before midnight on Sunday, which is an unprecedented event in peacetime. Certain restaurants and public service agencies that are necessary to maintain the health and welfare of citizens are not subject to this shutdown order. According to the mayor, this order has had a direct effect and will continue indefinitely. However, the tugboat strike still has no hope of being resolved soon due to disputes over wages and working hours. The businesses that are currently closed include department stores, schools, libraries, museums, theaters, nightclubs, and various gathering places. Only public utilities, transportation, newspapers, nurseries, nursing homes, and hospitals are exempt from restrictions.

### China Will Add Consulates in Malaya

### South Korea's Economy in Chaos as Japan Trends Towards Democracy; MacArthur Issues Second Report

[United Press, Washington, 13th] In his second report on the military governments of Japan and South Korea, MacArthur declared today: "The Japanese people are accepting the country's plan to eliminate military power and trend towards democratization with a promising attitude. There is no serious food problem in Japan. Its main difficulty lies in the distribution of food reserves." MacArthur warned that South Korea is experiencing the severe pain of economic chaos. The current situation in the country has become more serious due to the artificial boundary of the 38th parallel. Since the beginning of the occupation of Japan, the command has taken steps to strictly prohibit the production of war materials, and the control of Japan's war potential has been "fully ensured".

### Blood Stains Vietnam, Tears Sprinkle Siam! Overseas Chinese Became Living Targets; Professor Lian Qiuai, Returned From The South Seas, Relates Horrifying Events

In various parts of the South Seas after the victory, there are recurring events of anti-Chinese sentiment, from personal insults to group losses of life and property. We cannot help but wonder, did the motherland not achieve victory in this war? Why is it that our British and French allies, standing on the same victory line, have a subtle and tortuous attitude towards these unending anti-Chinese incidents?

The day before yesterday afternoon, our reporter had the accidental opportunity to have a long conversation with Professor Lian Qiuai, who had just flown in from the South Seas. Here are the contents of the conversation.

### 法越衝突　華僑處境困難

The Difficult Situation of Overseas Chinese Amidst the Franco-Vietnamese Conflict

Professor Shu taught in Beiping in the past. After the July 7th Incident, he moved to Hong Kong, teaching economic history at Lingnan University. When the Pacific War broke out, he crossed the sea to Vietnam, changed his name, and lived in seclusion in the countryside more than 200 miles from Saigon. He spent four years of hardship teaching and translating. After Japan surrendered, he went to Saigon and witnessed the suffering of the overseas Chinese in their real lives. He repeatedly represented them in negotiations with the local authorities. Later, he went to Bangkok and saw the situation of the overseas Chinese in Siam. His words were full of blood and tears, and his tone was filled with grief and indignation.

He said that the official Franco-Vietnamese conflict began on September 23rd of last year. Most of the overseas Chinese in Saigon lived in the Xidi area. After the direct conflict began, the damage in Xidi was quite severe. In early October, the British authorities intervened to mediate. Afterward, batches of French soldiers arrived one after another, and the negotiations failed. From then on, the French shot Vietnamese when they saw them, and the Vietnamese also killed French when they saw them. The situation of the overseas Chinese was quite difficult. The Vietnamese demanded that the overseas Chinese close their shops, and after the overseas Chinese agreed, the French blamed them. In mid-October, misfortune finally befell the overseas Chinese in Saigon. At that time, a batch of British-Indian troops arrived and carried out rape and pillage. I was chosen as a representative to negotiate with the British authorities. The British authorities initially denied it, but later said they wanted evidence. When evidence was presented, there was no concrete solution.

At this point, Lian Guangsheng gave an example.

### 西堤華女　橫遭輪姦悲劇

The Tragedy of an Overseas Chinese Woman in Xidi Violently Gang-raped

He said that one night, in an overseas Chinese concentrated area in Xidi, Vietnam, several British-Indian soldiers suddenly broke in and began to gang-rape an overseas Chinese woman. Her husband went out to call for help, and by chance, an Annamite (Vietnamese) passed by and ran in, shooting and killing one of the British-Indian soldiers. The others rushed back to their unit to report, and a squad of soldiers was immediately sent. They insisted that there were Viet Minh in the area, so they set fire to hundreds of houses. While the houses were burning, they forbade anyone from rescuing them. The displaced refugees in the disaster area, with no homes to return to, gathered at the local overseas Chinese organization, the Seven Prefectures Association. Although representatives were sent to negotiate, nothing came of it.

Soon, the French arrived at the embankment (Xidi) to suppress the Viet Minh party members. Viet Minh members retaliated by throwing hand grenades. The French opened fire with heavy machine guns, turning the overseas Chinese area into a living target! Naturally, there was another round of deaths, injuries, and losses!

In December, the French looting intensified. On the evening of the 25th, French soldiers, filling three trucks, arrived at the overseas Chinese area. Ostensibly, they were searching for Viet Minh members, but in reality, they searched house by house, robbing and looting. If they saw a woman, they raped and insulted her. If they saw a man, they beat and scolded him. If they saw money or jewelry, they pocketed it. They even stole a piece of bread left on the table. Throughout the long, dark night, a curfew was strictly enforced everywhere. The overseas Chinese could not take a single step beyond the permitted area. They had no way to call for help. They could only let the French soldiers take whatever they wanted, without any resistance. The next day, the overseas Chinese representatives negotiated with the French authorities, but the French authorities, as always, demanded evidence, and the matter ended inconclusively.

As a result of such plunder, an average of ten overseas Chinese died every day, and the daily loss of property reached one million Vietnamese dollars (one Vietnamese dollar is approximately equal to fifty Chinese legal tender yuan). For months, business has been unable to resume, and the indirect intangible losses are countless!

Economically speaking, the overseas Chinese in Vietnam were also being squeezed out everywhere. On November 18th of last year, the French authorities issued an order declaring all 500-yuan banknotes issued by the French-owned Banque de l'Indochine invalid.

### 鈔券作廢　五百元等於零

Banknotes Declared Invalid: 500 Yuan Equals Zero

Eighty percent of these banknotes are now in the hands of the overseas Chinese, especially those engaged in small businesses, who exchanged their money for large denomination banknotes for convenience when taking out their funds during air raids. With the issuance of this invalidation order, the overseas Chinese small people suffered a fatal blow, and the overseas Chinese property was declared bankrupt! As a result of the negotiations, the French authorities finally agreed to redeem the 500-yuan banknotes issued by the bank during the French colonial period at 70% of their face value. However, they fundamentally refused to recognize those issued during the Japanese occupation. A French newspaper "Justice" was closed by the French authorities for criticizing the "500 yuan equals zero" measure.

### 暹京排華　交涉竟無下文

Anti-Chinese Sentiment in Siam: Negotiations Lead to No Resolution

At this point, our conversation shifted to the recent anti-Chinese incidents in Siam. Mr. Lian had just flown from Siam to Manila, and he knew the inside story of this incident very well. He spoke at length, first mentioning the Siamese national character, which is full of inferiority complex. The characteristic of inferiority complex is that on the one hand, it wants to be a vassal state of a major power, and on the other hand, it wants to use the power of a major power to oppress other countries. In the past, there were ten slogans circulating in Siam, saying: "It is better to be a cow or a horse for the British than to be friends with the overseas Chinese." During the Japanese occupation, the Siamese went to the extreme in oppressing the overseas Chinese, and shamelessly said: "In the Far East, Japan is number one, and Siam is number two!" Killing one or two overseas Chinese is not a big deal. If you sue in court, the Siamese always win, and the overseas Chinese always go to jail!

This time, when the news of the motherland's final victory reached Siam, the overseas Chinese, who had endured years of silence, hung up the national flag everywhere, regardless of everything. The Siamese interfered, insisting that only the Siamese flag could be hung to celebrate the victory, and a conflict broke out. Although the overseas Chinese were unarmed, their morale was very high, but they suffered a massacre by the local military and police. Afterward, the overseas Chinese representatives negotiated with the authorities, but there was no follow-up, and the situation continued to escalate.

Although Siam is a small country, its diplomatic skills are quite high. On January 4th of this year, Mr. Xing Senzhou, a special envoy from the Central Overseas Department, arrived in Bangkok, and the Siamese government sent a special car to welcome him. On January 9th, Mr. Li Tiezheng and his party of eight, members of the Chinese delegation to Siam, also arrived in Bangkok. The Siamese government's hospitality was quite enthusiastic. On January 24th, Special Envoy Xing visited and inspected Wanbang without any accidents. However, on January 27th, when Director Li and his party went to the countryside to visit, unfortunately, there was trouble, and many overseas Chinese were killed and injured. Afterward, Director Li lodged a serious protest with the Siamese government. The Siamese government promised to be responsible for investigating the losses, but again there was no follow-up.

As for the draft Sino-Siamese treaty, although it has been signed recently, the Siamese insist on two points: (1) Nationality issue: According to Siamese law, all overseas Chinese born in Siam are considered Siamese. If this law cannot be amended, then many overseas Chinese will only be adding to the population and wealth of the Siamese. (2) Overseas Chinese education: As a result of the delegation's forceful argument, the Siamese government only allowed the stipulation that one-third of the school curriculum should be taught in Chinese, and the rest of the time should be taught purely in Siamese. This has a very serious impact on the national education of the overseas Chinese!

The poison of fascism is still deep. True friendship will require at least ten years, and the first condition is to see the motherland establish its external strength. The overseas Chinese have realized that only the unity and prosperity of the motherland can restore their lost status overseas and achieve the motherland's overall and ultimate victory!

Editorial

### 投機漲價誰負其責？

Who is Responsible for Speculation and Rising Prices?

On the day the Chairman arrived in Shanghai, the price of gold and US dollars suddenly plunged after rising. People were fortunate that these speculators might be aware of the need to restrain themselves and ease up a bit, so that the common people could catch their breath amidst the rising prices. Who knew that in the past two days, they reverted to their old ways, raising the price of gold to 14,000 yuan and the price of US dollars to 2,000 yuan, which caused general prices to skyrocket as well. People generally want to exchange legal tender for goods, but those who live on salaries may suffocate and die in the fierce flames of speculation and hoarding! This is the most pressing and painful issue for Shanghai citizens today.

Shanghai has always been the number one city in the country. Today, the speculative capital and habitual speculation in Shanghai will inevitably lead the major cities throughout the country to follow suit and compete with each other. Therefore, Chongqing and Kunming during the war are like a small witch seeing a great witch compared to today's Shanghai. Therefore, the skyrocketing gold prices and soaring commodity prices in Shanghai today will inevitably cause gold prices and commodity prices to rise in the north and south, and the livelihoods of ordinary people across the country will feel tremendous pressure. It can be seen that the recent unusual agitation in the Shanghai market is not only considered the most important issue by the citizens of Shanghai, but also a top priority for the people of the whole country!

But even though the situation is urgent and the problem is like a rampant flood, how many people are truly worried and eager to put out the flames and save the tide? Apart from Chairman Jiang's concern for the people's suffering and his repeated orders to the chief officials to find ways to curb it, we have not seen the responsible authorities come up with any concrete measures to this day. What is valuable in a government is to face reality, to have the spirit of taking care of the people as if they were one's own children, and to relieve the suffering of the majority of the people. What is valuable in a politician is to have foresight and decisiveness, to do what should be done, without hesitation. The most incomprehensible question we have today is that the illegal speculative behavior in the Shanghai market has never stopped since the victory, five or six months ago. Why has the authorities turned a blind eye? Whether the government's gold policy is going to change or not, whether the new exchange rate is going to be fixed or not, they say this today and spread that tomorrow, allowing the speculators in the market to spread rumors, while the responsible officials turn a deaf ear. They even fabricate telegrams to stir up trouble, saying that "Sun" notes are going to be issued from Nanjing, or that the city celebration will set the US exchange rate at 2,000 yuan from Hong Kong. Even the Hong Kong authorities can't help but investigate, but the chief officials in Shanghai, the capital of the Republic, are calmly acting as if nothing is happening. The most ridiculous thing is that they are using the national bonds issued by the state as chips for their speculative gambling, speculating that "Sun" notes will be used to repay the principal and interest, and using this as an excuse to raise prices, while the chief officials remain silent. In short, the Shanghai market as a whole has lost its way, galloping wildly and rampaging, and in six months, we have not seen the responsible authorities take any action. Are they incompetent? Or are they deliberately ignoring it?

Leaving aside speculative trading, let's examine the rise in general prices. The main reasons are the expansion of currency and the lack of materials. But we should not forget that prices once fell universally at the beginning of the victory. And why have they risen four or five times in five or six months? Even in the recovered areas, the enemy and puppet factories and materials received by the government, all industries, cannot be said to be small. Except for the Northeast, which still has special obstacles, can the various places make full use of these materials to stabilize prices? The Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau has a number of items that are said to be sold at low prices, but they are mostly handled in batches and sold at 20% off. As a result, when the market price rises, the low price also rises, and when the low price rises, the market price rises again, in a cyclical manner. What effect is achieved! Even more strangely, the China Weaving and Construction Company sold yarn and cloth, and raised prices first. As the official price of yarn and cloth rose, the market followed suit. Those with such a narrow vision, who think that it is a good idea to earn more money for the public on yarn and cloth, do not know that the increase in prices stimulates the rise of general prices. Not to mention the increased suffering of the common people, the increase in all government expenditures will be thousands of times greater than this number. By extension, after the factories are taken over, they are either investigated, returned, or evaluated and auctioned, with layers of procedures and restrictions, with agencies competing for power, and the government and the people competing for profits. Documents are exchanged, and debates are endless, and most of the factories remain closed, and the leakage and waste of materials continues as before. Since it is clear that there are already few materials, they are willing to listen to the factories not making the best use of them. Since it is clear that there are not many factories in China, they do not make intensive efforts to promote the start of work in the factories. They do not have a large amount of capital and full momentum to nationalize them all decisively, but they are unwilling to let go and let everyone quickly privatize them. Whether it is nationalized or privatized, the people only hope to start work and production as soon as possible to increase materials, but today the road to this goal is still very long. Everyone sees that the factories are not opening their doors, and the materials are gradually being used up, coupled with the rapid wind of speculation, and naturally tend to buy goods quickly. Then, who should be responsible for the rising prices caused by this psychology? It is not difficult to "think more than half."

Speaking of the currency issue, we cannot deny that it is already in the process of expansion, and the vicious expansion should be stopped. If the financial authorities have policies and are responsible, they should have come up with concrete and effective measures long ago. If we do not quickly tighten the currency and stabilize the value of the currency, the country's economic future will have infinite disasters! And there are many ways to stabilize and tighten, but the main thing is the four words "internal first, external second." An economist once advocated that the purchasing power of legal currency should first be stabilized and then increased domestically, and then the exchange rate can be reset. Regardless of whether the new exchange rate should be high or low, and whether the timing of resetting the exchange rate should be early or late, if legal currency is allowed to depreciate in the eyes of the general public for a long time, and they look down on legal currency and only value goods, then the financial authorities will be at fault, and the entire government will suffer greatly. To stabilize the value of the currency, we must tighten the currency. To tighten the currency, we must increase revenue and reduce expenditure. This is a cliché, but it is still an immutable truth. We want to ask: What expenditure has the government reduced in the past few months? What revenue has it increased? We only hear about meetings being held today and matters being discussed tomorrow, an office being set up today and an association being set up tomorrow. We also hear that the government is about to be reorganized, the number of commissioners is to be increased, and the number of government offices is to be increased. This party is divided into several departments, and that faction occupies several positions. The number of agencies is numerous, and they are stacked on top of each other. Despite the fact that civil servants are said to be poor, the number of civil servants is increasing. On the surface, they say they are downsizing the army and reducing the staff, but in some places, the armed forces are recruiting militiamen and expanding their strength in order to be downsized first. In this way, there are many officials, many staff, many generals, and many soldiers. How can expenditures be saved? As for increasing revenue, has there been an increase in new taxes? Have we stopped embezzlement? Have we, in addition to printing more banknotes, considered raising public bonds and using frozen foreign exchange? Have we paid attention to subsidizing industrial and commercial enterprises, fostering the people's strength, and increasing the source of taxes? The authorities must understand the principle that to eat eggs, we cannot kill the chicken. Have the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy worked together to actively implement effective measures to support the development of national industry and international trade? If we continue to ask questions by drawing silk from cocoons, the reason why revenue cannot be increased quickly and expenditure cannot be reduced quickly is the main reason why the currency cannot be tightened. If the currency is not tightened, the value of the currency will not be stable. From this, who is responsible for the soaring prices can be understood without further explanation.

Spring and Autumn criticize the virtuous. Although we know that speculation and manipulation are common crimes, and hoarding and cornering the market are prohibited by law, we cannot remain silent about the responsible officials turning a blind eye, being complacent, and bearing the chairman's earnest supervision and the people's expectations. For the sake of the country and the people's livelihood, we cannot remain silent.

### 請撥市區敵產收入　充復興本市經費　市政諮議會昨日通過　將呈請中央予以照准

Request to Allocate Revenue from Enemy Property in the City to Fund the Rejuvenation of the City: Municipal Advisory Council Passed Yesterday, Will Submit Request to the Central Government for Approval

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Advisory Council passed the proposal of Commissioner Pan Xulun at the meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m. The recommendations are as follows:

Numerous Tasks Await, Limited by Financial Resources

"Since the recovery of the city, numerous tasks await us, and the revitalization and reconstruction are urgent. Whether it is the dredging of the Huangpu River, the repair of wharves, the improvement of roads and bridges, or public health, all require huge sums of money. However, the city's financial revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, and the monthly deficit is very large. After several discussions, the authorities felt that there was no way to make up for it. Since revenue and expenditure cannot be offset, let alone revitalize and reconstruct. Considering that the government has obtained a great deal of income from the handling of enemy and puppet property, it is proposed to request the central government to allocate a portion of the income from the handling of enemy and puppet property within the Shanghai urban area to the local revitalization and reconstruction funds of the city.

Reconstruction is Urgent

The reasons are divided into five points: (1) According to the principles of finance, if the central tax source comes from the local area, the right to collect taxes belongs to the central government, but a portion of the tax revenue is still allocated to the local area for use. The enemy and puppet property in the Shanghai urban area also has a local nature, and it should also be allocated to a portion for local revitalization and reconstruction in accordance with the principles of taxation. (2) All the original public buildings in the city have been in disrepair for many years or have even been damaged due to the war. Now that the War of Resistance Against Japan has been won, revitalization and reconstruction should be the top priority. It is extremely logical to use a portion of the income from the victory to repair the damage caused by the war. (3) Shanghai is the largest city in China, and the revitalization and prosperity of Shanghai will affect the entire country. For example, dredging the Huangpu River and building wharves are all related to the revitalization and reconstruction of our country. Shanghai can be said to be a city with both local and national characteristics, and its revitalization and reconstruction are even more urgent.

Extremely Fair to Use in This City

(4) Although the enemy and puppet property in Shanghai comes from all over the country, Shanghai has suffered the greatest threat of war and the greatest risk of destruction. Therefore, it is fair to use the income from the handling of enemy and puppet property for this city. (5) It was previously reported that when Chairman Jiang was in Beiping, he expressed to representatives from all walks of life that he could allocate a portion of the income from the handling of enemy and puppet property in the area for local revitalization and reconstruction. The three seats clearly understood everything and did not forget to give favors. This time, when he comes to this city, he must have the same virtues.

It is reported that this proposal will be initiated by the Municipal Advisory Council and jointly submitted by the city's public organizations to the municipal government and then to the central government for approval.

### 本市道路僑梁　積極整修

Active Repair of Roads and Bridges in This City

[Reported by this newspaper] Many of the city's roads were damaged during the eight years of enemy and puppet rule. According to statistics from the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, a total of 340,000 square meters of road surface should be repaired. The bureau has now completed more than 150,000 square meters, accounting for 45% of the total number to be repaired. The main ones are Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, Xizang North Road, Nan Road, Linsen West Road, and Qiujiang Wharf. Regarding the repair of bridges in the city, the bureau's statistics show that more than 70% of the 200 bridges in the city should be repaired. The main bridges currently under repair include Caojiadu Bridge, Xinzha Bridge, and Huangxing Road Bridge, all of which will be completed soon.

Widen Roads, Construct Sequentially

The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works has formulated a comprehensive improvement plan for all roads in Shanghai. The first phase of the project is the gradual improvement of each road. It is learned that the road improvement projects of the bureau are as follows: (1) The road surface on Nanjing West Road, north of the Racecourse, will be widened to 20 meters, with 328 meters of open ditches filled and drainage pipes installed. The entire project commenced on January 8 of this year and is expected to be completed in early March. (2) Tianmu Road is the main thoroughfare from the North Railway Station to the city center. It has been planned to widen it to 25 meters, with sidewalks to 35 meters wide, a median platform, and fast and slow lanes on both sides. Construction will begin in early March and is expected to be completed by the end of June. (3) Zhenning Road, which runs north and south from Fanhongdu Road through Yuyuan Road, Xuanhua Road to Zhongzheng West Road, will begin construction in mid-March and is expected to be completed in late June. (4) At the intersection of Xujiahui Road, Xizang South Road, Zhizaoju Road, Fangxie Road, and Lujiabang Road, a small garden roundabout will be set up. Construction will begin in mid-March and is expected to be completed by the end of March.

### 本市整編保甲完竣　計七十萬餘戶

Reorganization of Baojia in This City Completed: Totaling Over 700,000 Households

The reorganization of the Baojia in this city, which began on January 15 and ended at the end of January, has been completely completed. According to the announcement of the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, the city is divided into 29 districts, 1,030 Bao, 23,300 Jia, and 700,530 households. However, the unreceived areas are excluded, and the Baojia of boat households on the water are currently being planned and organized, and are not included in the above-mentioned Baojia household numbers. As for the city's population, gender, education level, and occupation, it will be necessary to wait until the household registration is completed on the 16th, and the total statistics can be published in early March.

### 電力工潮圓滿解決　勞資雙方昨簽字　吳開先希望雙方合作

Electricity Workers' Strike Resolved Successfully: Labor and Management Signed Yesterday, Wu Kaixian Hopes for Cooperation Between Both Sides

### Authorities Suppress Rice Prices by Releasing Large Quantities of Rice

Since the Lunar New Year, rice prices in the city have fluctuated with commodity prices, soaring upwards, with the most intense price increases occurring last weekend. In order to regulate the food supply for the people and stabilize rice prices, the grain administration authorities have taken effective measures to suppress rice prices by releasing a large quantity of low-quality indica rice, totaling over 10,000 stones in the past two days. The prices are all about 2,000 yuan per stone lower than the market price, and the market trend has turned downwards. At the same time, the grain merchants are also taken into consideration, striving to stabilize prices reasonably, avoid drastic rises and falls, affect supply sources, and support transportation by giving priority convenience, as well as granting loans to rice merchants for maximum procurement. Shanghai has a current population of over 4 million, and excluding those who consume flour and miscellaneous grains, the average daily rice consumption is 600,000 to 700,000 stones. The source is mostly from the Su, Chang, Kun, Xi, and Wuhu areas. Although the number is staggering, last year's harvest was abundant, and according to precise investigations, only about 30% of the production area has been sold to date. In the past, the enemy controlled and seized supplies, but at this time, the grain reserves in various places are already less than half. Before the victory, there were only 200 rice merchants in the city, but now there are as many as 1,600 or 1,700, which shows their activity. It is also learned that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will soon ship 200,000 tons (equivalent to 275 dan) of rice to Shanghai from overseas. If unscrupulous individuals who take the opportunity to spread rumors and raise market prices, and speculation for purchasing national collections can be effectively eliminated, then the future of rice prices can be stabilized.

### Bunkers and Iron Fences Completely Removed

All bunkers in various districts have also been completely removed.

### Enemy and Puppet Forced Occupation of Land Will Be Investigated and Returned

During the enemy and puppet regime in the city, many real estate properties were forcibly requisitioned. The Municipal Land Administration Bureau is mindful of the citizens who own real estate and have been ravaged for eight years, and in accordance with the "Measures for Clearing Land Rights in Recovered Areas" formulated and promulgated by the Executive Yuan, it has formulated the "Shanghai Land Rights Clearing Measures" to clear them. It is heard that all land forcibly occupied or requisitioned by the enemy and puppets must be investigated and returned. If government agencies or troops are still using it, the protection of the owner's property rights should be the priority. The actual need should be considered and requisition procedures should be handled by the government according to the law. The bureau has accepted the request from citizens Zhu ChunGui and others to return the 36.36 mu of land forcibly requisitioned in the Yinxiang district. After summoning and verifying the documents, it was confirmed that the land was requisitioned by the enemy and puppet Hengchan Company. According to Article 5 of the Implementing Rules of the Land Rights Clearing Measures, "Land collected by enemy and puppet organizations at a price, unless there is a significant public need, should still be temporarily kept by the government and requisition procedures should be corrected. The original owner may present documents and redeem it by paying the price." However, since the Hengchan Company was taken over by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, a public letter was sent to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau yesterday for verification and processing.

### Readers Advocate for a Thousand Yuan National Construction Donation Movement, This Column Will Collect Donations and We Hope Everyone Will Promote It

Editor: I am a professional youth who contributed nothing to the country during the war. Now that I share the glory of victory, I feel ashamed. Although the war has been won, national construction is still in its infancy. This is still an opportunity to serve the country. My strength is weak, so I will first donate 1,000 yuan in national currency as a "National Construction Donation." I know that the amount is small and will not help much. If your newspaper can make a loud appeal, then if each of our 450 million compatriots donates 1,000 yuan, there will be 45 million yuan, which can greatly benefit the progress of national construction. Some say that the poor cannot afford to donate. However, the rich, in addition to themselves, may wish to donate on behalf of ten, a hundred, or even a thousand or ten thousand poor people. If you are afraid that the vast area of ​​the country may not make everyone aware of the "Thousand Yuan National Construction Donation Movement," then you can imitate the chain transmission method of the "Jesus Blessing Letter," that is, after one person donates the "National Construction Donation," they will write ten letters of persuasion to relatives and friends, and their relatives and friends will also follow the same method after receiving the letter. In this way, one person transmits to ten, ten to a hundred, a hundred to a thousand, and a thousand to ten thousand, which will definitely have a great effect. I sincerely hope that this movement can achieve its expected goal as soon as possible and fulfill my wish. This depends entirely on the support of your newspaper, the assistance of public opinion, the cooperation of the banking industry in collecting money, and the enthusiastic response of compatriots. Reader Wang Zhelun respectfully bows.

### Gold, Paper Money, and Securities are Rising, Hidden Interest Reaches 18% of a Corner, Many People Scrambling for US Dollars

Yesterday, because of purchases by the Northern Gang and foreign merchants, U.S. dollars were extremely scarce. The U.S. dollar side had a lot of assistance. Although there was a mid-way rally, speculative merchants relapsed, and speculative funds scrambled to buy when they saw the opportunity, making it easy to pull up the price. The general mentality towards the listing issue changed from suspicion to more certainty, and sellers almost disappeared. From 1,285,000, it gradually competed for glory. Near noon, before the separation, it floated in the air to make up for the difference, and the noon close ended at a high price of 1,395,000, a sharp increase of 147,000 compared to the previous close. In the afternoon, it broke through another major level, standing firm, and people's hearts were more cheerful. Overnight delivery was very prosperous, opening at 1,430,000, the highest at 1,458,000. The credit was extremely tight, and the hidden interest reached 18% of a corner. Some people sold out when the price was high, once falling back to 1,395,000. Finally, it was around 1,410,000. Gold was listed at 153,000, silver at 1,400, and silver dollars at over 800 yuan. The dark split was from 12% to 18% due to the tightening of credit.

Yesterday, the U.S. dollar was still due to the U.S. cotton order, and the settlement amount was huge. General foreign merchants also came to replenish their positions, and calls for higher prices rose again. It opened at 1,860 yuan in the morning, the lowest at 1,850 yuan. Manufacturers and general yarn and cloth gangs scrambled to settle. After that, it hovered and rose. In the afternoon, it rose to 1,970 yuan, then slightly fell back. The result was an increase of 90 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar rose because it was reported that the Shenchao in the area had mistakenly reported the U.S. exchange rate at 2,000 to one in the name of someone buying the United Association, causing a slump. This matter is now being investigated by the Hong Kong government and there is news that it has recovered. The market was flat, but the old goods suddenly had a large number of buyers due to the advance printing of cotton by large yarn and flower merchants. The result was extremely prosperous, and it rose another 20 yuan compared to the previous close. The new goods also rose by 7 yuan.

Public bonds were very stable yesterday. Type C opened in the morning and rose to 2,010 yuan. In the industry, due to credit, people sold out one after another when the price was high, so it gradually fell back from 2,060 yuan. During the period, it was seen at 1,880 yuan, hovering around 1,950 yuan at noon. The result of the noon close was 100 yuan better for Types A and B, 160 yuan for Type C, 150 yuan for Type D, and 110 yuan for Type E compared to the previous close.

Hua stocks continued to be firm yesterday. There was a slight hesitation after the high point. The asking price after closing was slightly lower. In the afternoon, stimulated by the gold market, it rose again. Zhaoyong Yarn opened at 2,550 yuan in the morning, the high price was 2,680 yuan, and the noon close was around 2,600 yuan. The high price of Meiya was 2,150 yuan, and the low price was 1,950 yuan. Many yarn factories entered Meiya to hedge. The noon close still rose to 2,100 yuan. Jingfu rose from 124 yuan in the morning to 140 yuan. The noon close was around 137 yuan. Compared with the previous close, Yong yarn rose by 100 yuan, Xinhe rose by 90 yuan, Meiya rose by 300 yuan, Jingfu rose by 18 yuan, Xinguang rose by 13 yuan, and Qinxing rose by 10 yuan. The unpopular stocks each rose by about half a percent.

Foreign stocks rose sharply compared to the previous close as soon as the market opened. The demand was twice as stable. After selling Hua stocks, securities firms saw the gold market rebound and also came to replenish their positions in foreign stocks. The process was extremely enthusiastic, rising all the way. The result was that large stocks rose by less than 10% compared to the previous close, while small stocks rose by more than 10%. British United was the hottest, jumping by 15% alone.

### Rice Rises by a Thousand Yuan, Oil Rises by Three or Four Thousand

Due to the rise in gold prices, the rice market is very strong. The average price of japonica and indica rice increased by 600 to 700 yuan to nearly 1,000 yuan. At noon, due to the continued issuance of flat-price rice by the Grain Administration Bureau, the stores were stunned and slightly declined. Soybean sales are still okay, and the price rose by 200 to 300 yuan. Raw peanuts rose sharply by 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran rose by 200 yuan. Bean cake also increased by more than 200 yuan. Flour also rose by 300 to 400 yuan. The oil market rose sharply by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan as prices for other commodities rose and people's hearts firmed up, but it was difficult to grasp due to the sudden ups and downs.

### Yarn, Flowers, and Cloth All Rise

Yesterday, the yarn market rebounded sharply. From the opening to the closing, the market was always shrouded in buying interest. Green customers came in droves, and weaving factories were also busy with additional allocation. For example, 900,000 20s blue phoenix yarn were traded, an increase of 100,000 compared to the previous day. All other brands rose sharply, especially 42s double-strand and 40s single yarn, which rose sharply by 200,000. Because the Textile Construction Company has no supply of various brands that are popular in the market, only cone yarn is available for professional manufacturers of knitting and dyeing for their own use. The yarn industry peers have no right to purchase, and the sales chips are even more lacking.

Yesterday, spot cotton trading was also smooth. Because gold and yarn prices soared, factories made a lot of profits by buying flowers and spinning yarn. The Textile Construction Company purchased a lot of fine velvet flowers. The fine velvet flowers in the Great Central Collection were as high as 101,000 yuan, and the Sanyuzhen flowers were as high as 93,000 yuan, an increase of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

The cloth market was quite smooth under the search of the Jing, Hu, Huhu, Hangyong, Jiangxi and Hankou gangs. Colored cloth was pretty, and yuanbai poplin and shirt poplin were also favored by customers. Since the beginning of spring, yuanbai poplin has been so pretty, all because the weaving factory carefully manufactures 12-pound white raw fine cloth, which is very profitable, and there is no time for this reason.

### Let the Children Use Their Hands!

— Du Yun

In Shanghai, children from ordinary families are generally pampered, with food brought to their mouths and clothes put on for them. This seems to have become the general custom of Shanghai society. When children are three to five years old, their parents say that they are still too young and cannot use their hands. From eight or nine to thirteen or fourteen years old, children can use their hands and like to use their hands, but their parents are unwilling to let them use their hands, thinking that having children do household chores would be looked down upon by the neighbors and would be detrimental to their image. When they are fourteen or fifteen years old or older, their parents want them to use their hands, but they have already developed the habit of viewing using their hands as troublesome and thinking of it as a hard task. Some even consider themselves too good to do such things, thinking that these are originally the duties of servants and are not worth doing. As a result, when they become adults, they not only lack the ability to handle household details but also lack the knowledge to manage servants, allowing the servants to be wasteful and lazy and to do things improperly, and they can only listen to them. Moreover, they develop a vain sense of self-esteem, with an arrogant attitude, looking down on servants, ordering them around, and despising the laboring class and so-called "lower occupations." They can never understand the true reality of this complex society, and even when they hold political office, they are unable to understand the suffering of the people.

In ancient Chinese education, primary schools emphasized sweeping and responding, starting with learning to do things themselves, which was indeed practical. A new-era parent will allow children to develop their abilities, not constantly do things for them, and cultivate their independent and active spirit. They also often encourage them to do miscellaneous chores and give them the experience of doing things. For example, when sweeping the floor, do not just sweep the center; when wiping a table, spread out the cloth, do not twist it into a ball; when washing dishes and chopsticks, dry them; when making tea, make sure the tea flavor is extracted and the leaves do not float on top; when tidying up a room, how to place things properly; what are the tricks to starting a coal stove; how to use soap when washing clothes and what the procedures are; how much water to use when cooking rice; how to cook a delicious side dish. In short, they should be able to do all kinds of common household chores. Girls should learn cooking and tailoring from an early age. This is not to say that women should return to the kitchen. With experience, they can manage servants. If servants are unable to do certain things, they can serve as a role model or teach them. In particular, taking care of younger siblings from an early age, learning some experience in infant care from the mother's methods, is much more valuable than adopting theories from books!

The author was born into a farming family. My late father treated his children by letting us use our hands and do everything. Needless to say, we had to do all the ordinary household chores, and we were allowed to learn everything else that we could. At the age of five, we had to herd cattle, and at the age of six or seven, we had to go up the mountains. Later, when we went to the city to study, there was work waiting for us to do every time we returned home for holidays. Weeding and watering were minor tasks, and we also had to participate in rice harvesting, firewood chopping, boat handling, and fish catching. As a result, I have experienced everything and know the hardship of "sweat dripping on the soil under the rice stalks." I know the danger of handling boats, so I learned to swim; the effort of chopping firewood; and how to be a vendor and sell things. I can even do all the work that farmers do, such as making rope, splitting bamboo, making straw sandals, rowing boats, and growing vegetables. After forty years of life, it is more than enough for me to apply what I have learned. I am truly grateful to my late father for his cultivation of us. Now, I would like to contribute the practical benefits I have gained to all parents as a lesson. Let me say one more thing: "Let the children use their hands!"

### Sending Children to Daycare Centers

— Zhu Qi

In Chongqing, the things that needed to be done were endless, from morning to midnight. The child was only two years old. If I tried to take care of him, I couldn't get anything done all day. If I didn't take care of him, he had nowhere to play and would fall countless times and bump his head many times a day. Before the scars on his face had healed, new ones would appear. When he played at the door, he learned many bad habits, such as hitting and scolding people. I hired a maid to take care of him, but she was always wanting to eat and take things. She behaved well in front of the masters, but when the masters were not around, she would beat the child at the slightest provocation. While I was working, I had to constantly pay attention to the child, watching to see if the maid had taken the child to the crowded and dirty hotel across the street again, or if she had bought sesame candy covered in dust for the child to eat again. Moreover, the maid would be difficult. If I said a few words to her for doing something wrong, she would immediately want to leave. When I first arrived in Chongqing, I had wanted to send the child to a daycare center, but at that time, the ladies and wives who heard my idea unanimously opposed it, thinking that only they themselves could take good care of their own children. I myself had also seen children who had contracted pinkeye from daycare centers. At that time, the child was still very young and fell ill every few days, so I gave up the idea. Now, after being angered by the maid, I thought of daycare centers again.

At this time, the Chongqing YWCA was about to establish a daycare center, and the person in charge was Ms. Bian Xusun, who had previously been in charge of the workers' daycare center at the Shanghai YWCA. I had great faith in her, and the daycare center was located near my home, so I decided to send the child there.

Before entering the center, a physical examination was required. If a child had a contagious disease, he could not enter. He could start attending the center after three days. During these three days, I had to prepare a small quilt for him to use for his midday nap at the daycare center, a large white bib, mend his torn clothes and pants, and embroider the child's name on every handkerchief, towel, sheet, clothes, pants, and bib with colored thread. It really felt like preparing a dowry.

On the day of enrollment, I had put the clothes the child was going to wear, the clothes, quilt, towel, and washed cloth shoes he was going to take with him in separate packages the night before. I got up early in the morning, washed the child clean, had him go to the toilet, changed his clothes, shoes, and socks, and pinned a handkerchief with his name embroidered on it to his collar. I took him to the daycare center, and he was the first to arrive.

In addition to the director, Ms. Cao, there was also a nurse, two teachers, two nannies, and one male and one female servant in the daycare center. Because it was newly established, there were only fifteen or sixteen children aged two to four, so they were taken care of very well.

After the children arrived at the center, they first had a health checkup. If they were found to have a fever, they were made to sleep in the isolation room. If the fever increased, their family members were notified to pick them up. After the checkup, they ate breakfast and started a day of games and learning, until after dinner before returning home. The children ate soy milk and bread for breakfast, and lunch and dinner consisted of one dish and one soup, usually pork liver, eggs, and vegetables, which was more nutritious than what they ate at home. There was also a snack in the afternoon. They ate so well, and there were many toys and sanitary facilities that were not available at home. The monthly fee was also a little cheaper than the salary of a maid, not including what she ate, stole, and the bad influence on the child.

After sending the child to the daycare center, the house was much quieter, but I always felt empty and lonely, and I seemed to feel sorry for the child. Relatives and friends who knew about it also blamed me. However, after two weeks, the child, who originally needed someone to coax him to eat a bowl of rice, now ate on his own and could eat a bowl of soup, a bowl of rice, and a plate of vegetables at each meal, and he ate very quickly. Originally, he needed someone to hold him to sleep, but now he climbed into bed and slept on his own, and he no longer woke up in the middle of the night. He had gained a lot of weight. His speech had improved quickly, and he had also learned to sing. I only had to pick up and drop off the child every day and give him a bath once, and the rest of the time I could concentrate on doing things. Relatives and friends also agreed with my idea, because a well-managed daycare center had convinced them of their prejudices with facts.

### Female Warrior Huai

— Zhang Peng

A shadow that cannot be erased often hovers in my mind. A shadow that cannot be chased away constantly flickers in my eyelashes. This tenacious shadow is my respected friend, Miss Yang Huimin.

It has been eight years since I last met her. It has been more than five months since the victory of the War of Resistance, and I have been looking forward to her return to Shanghai every day, paying attention to newspapers and inquiring from relatives and friends, but I have been disappointed and have not been able to find out any news about her whereabouts.

"Peng, let me introduce you," I was burying my head in editing the "Current Affairs Bulletin," when a Boy Scout, Cheng Renhou, jumped to my desk with innocent joy. Standing next to him was a tall and strong Girl Scout, her face also full of smiles, her eyes sparkling with lovely light: "This is Yang Huimin." Following his respectful attitude, she also bowed her healthy waist and nodded her head: "Mr. Peng, I am young and don't know much. Please teach me often!"

"Yang Huimin?" What a familiar name! Could she be the female hero Yang Xianmin who sneaked into the Sihang Warehouse to present the flag? I pondered for a moment, then my mind immediately answered me. Her heroic posture in front of me enlightened me. "It's her; it's her, she is indeed the patriotic daughter who risked her life to present the flag." I immediately put down my pen, my eyes shining with respect and admiration, and jumped up: "This is Miss Hui, who presented the flag!"

"Presenting the flag is not worthy of glory," she smiled coyly: "I hope that I can do more practical and beneficial work for the country in distress. Now that the national crisis has befallen every person, every person should serve the country and sacrifice himself for the country, whether male or female, and should take on the responsibility of a citizen to resist the enemy."

Her brave attitude and heroic words made me deeply respectful and admire her infinitely!

Later, as time passed, I became very familiar with her, and I knew everything about her very well. Her personality was like that of a heroic warrior. Her thoughts were like those of a modern woman. Her actions were similar to those of men. When she spoke, her voice was crisp and strong. When she walked, her posture was agile and vigorous. Although her face was not very beautiful (she had abolished the use of makeup), it was still very moving. Her clothes, although a yellow uniform, were very neat and simple. However, her hair was permed, loose and curly; when she ran, it added to her agility and vitality.

The environment in Shanghai became increasingly difficult. The current situation there did not allow her to carry out her brave mission. She had no choice but to leave Shanghai, bid farewell to her friends, and, with tears in her eyes and suppressing her sadness, flew far away to the rear.

On the eve of her departure, she showed no trace of sadness, and still jumped to my front: "Mr. Peng, I'm leaving!" A commemorative booklet was sent from her slender hand to the table: "Write a few lines for me, so that I can keep a memento when I get to the interior!"

"I can't write anything, please forgive me!" I wanted to say this, but I didn't say it; I couldn't say that to her. A female warrior whom I deeply admired was about to leave me, how could I not give her a minimal memento! So, without hesitation, I nodded my head and said: "Okay! You are the one who is leaving, I will write something for you."

"Mr. Peng, I'm leaving!" She also showed a tragic sentiment, forcing herself to endure it. Her voice was filled with grief: "When I get there, I will send you a letter. Don't worry about me."

I did not see her off, I just shook her hand tightly at the door, without saying any words of praise, silently; silently, I focused my emotional gaze on her sad cheeks, and when she walked far away, when I realized that she was no longer there, my frozen sadness quickly dissipated; scattered in my heart, my heart ached, and tears involuntarily rolled down my face.

Now it has been eight years, and I have not received any news from her. Although I learned from friends that she had been to the United States, and that she had made great and meaningful missions in the United States, we, her old friends in Shanghai, were deeply comforted, but it is still not as pleasant as the scene of shaking hands and talking happily!

I hope she will return soon and have a long talk with me to soothe my deep longing.

### Ms. Zhou Deqing Presides Over the Student Economic Cafeteria

— Xu Baiyi

Low prices and substantial nutrition; difficult to sustain; hoping for donations from all sectors.

For students and office workers who work in public offices, lunch is indeed a serious problem. For the past four or five years, the Sichuan Road YMCA has been running a student economic cafeteria, under the responsibility of Ms. Zhou Deqing. Ms. Zhou graduated from Wallace University in the United States, majoring in home economics, and has special research in cooking and nutrition.

The establishment of that cafeteria was due to a donation of 15,000 yuan from the American Student Relief Association. Therefore, the YMCA jointly established a student economic cafeteria, with the English name Students Relief Economic Restaurant. At the beginning, Ms. Zhou was invited to take charge. It was established on September 10th of the 30th year of the Republic (1941).

One or two years ago, the author went there for lunch once, but because it was a treat, the food was different from what was served daily. Although the price of the food served in the cafeteria was unbelievably low, it fully considered the nutritional components and was planned by nutrition expert Dr. Hou Xiangchuan.

The working method is most democratic. Anyone who wants to eat there just buys a ticket and exchanges the ticket for food, tableware. After eating, they return the tableware themselves, so it is very quick and easy. From the beginning to December 31st of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), the total number of customers served was 500,000.

The current prices are very low, divided into 20 yuan and 40 yuan. For 20 yuan, you can get two bowls of adzuki bean rice and a bowl of vegetable soup (a mixture of vegetables and soup), which would cost at least 100 yuan outside. For 40 yuan, you can get two bowls of white rice, one vegetable dish, and one soup, which would cost at least 180 yuan outside.

Since the cafeteria received the initial 15,000 yuan, it has not solicited any donations from the outside world, relying on that fund to operate. Since the beginning to the present, it has gone through several waves of rising prices, so the difficulty of maintaining it can be imagined.

Everyone will sympathize with such an economic cafeteria that truly serves the community. At present, it really needs assistance from all sectors, because the cafeteria's only remaining inventory has been used up. Therefore, it is hoped that all sectors can donate some flour, rice, sugar, or coal. It would be best to have milk so that the cafeteria can continue to provide young people with adequate nutrition at low prices.

These few days, they are repairing the stove, preparing to resume normal supply from February 18th.

### Electric Eye Mouse Trap

— Wei Lin

A certain electrical company in New York rents out a highly effective scientific mousetrap for a monthly fee of thirty-five yuan. The device is made using the psychology that mice have a long-standing fear of blocked passages; it is a drawer-shaped wooden box with through-holes at both ends. The front is in the shape of the character 口 [kou - mouth/opening], with an electric eye installed in the passageway, and a small hole leads to the adjacent compartment.

When a mouse enters the passageway and touches the electric eye, doors at both ends immediately fall, blocking the front and rear, leaving it in a predicament. Only a small hole similar to a "fire exit" guides it into the compartment. The compartment is electrified, forcing it to climb into the upper corner "execution platform" to be electrocuted, and its corpse immediately falls into the corpse basket below. At the same time, the doors at both ends of the wooden box reopen, waiting for another patron to visit.

The entire rat-killing process takes only about three minutes. It is said that dozens of mice can be caught all night long.
