[Report from our Shenyang Office on the 25th] The National Army in the Northeast, with Shenyang as its core, is advancing on three fronts: east, south, and north. They have successively reached their predetermined destinations and are currently continuing to advance and expand their defense zones. The trains between Shenyang and Tieling, and between Shenyang and Lushun, are now running smoothly. Ji Ruolan, the director of the Shenyang branch of the China Changchun Railway, along with Soviet technicians, went to Sujiatun on the 25th to inspect the damaged bridges in order to expedite repairs.

[Reuter's Report from Chongqing on the 25th] Today, Chinese newspapers here reported that fierce fighting has broken out again in the Northeast. The National Army is fanning out from Jinzhou and Shenyang to take over areas evacuated by Soviet troops, clashing with Communist forces attempting to hold these cities. Yan'an announced today that the 2nd and 25th Divisions of the 52nd Army were repelled on March 21st while advancing eastward along both sides of the canal toward the Fushun coal mines. At the same time, the 14th Division of the New 6th Army fanned out westward from Shenyang, clashing with the so-called "Northeast Democratic Allied Army."

After disembarking, Gao Hai immediately went to the Communist Army headquarters for secret talks with Zhou Enlai. Neither side is willing to announce the content, but it is only known that it is related to the situation in the Northeast.

### The Two Chairmen Depart from Beiping for Jinzhou; Zheng Dongguo Appointed Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security Command

### Joint Passenger and Freight Transport on the Tianjin-Pukou and Beijing-Shanghai Railways to be Realized Soon; Fare Increases Under Serious Consideration

[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 25th] According to the Ministry of Communications, Minister Yu is seriously considering the matter of increasing train fares, and a decision has been made to increase airfares, which will be implemented at the beginning of next month.

If this continues, it will be difficult to bear the losses.

[Report from our Jinan Office on the 25th] The recent traffic situation in Shandong Province is summarized as follows: With Jinan as the center, northbound trains run to Yancheng, and eastbound trains run to Gaomi, but tickets can only be sold to Zhangdian. Only work trains run or operate between Zhangdian and Gaomi, a distance of 130 kilometers, and ticket sales have not yet begun. The railway is open from Gaomi to Qingdao. Southbound, the railway is open to Tai'an. On the highway, buses run between Jinan and Dezhou, and between Jinan and Qingdao, once a day, and the route is relatively safe. However, each trip from Jinan to Qingdao requires four military inspections along the way, taking as long as a day.

[Report from our Beiping Office on the 25th] The Chongqing Military Affairs Bureau recently instructed the Executive Headquarters that the restoration of railway repairs should be prioritized in transportation restoration work.

[Central News Agency Report from Chongqing on the 25th] The People's Political Council held its ninth general assembly at 8:20 a.m. on the 25th.

After a ten-minute break, Minister of Food Xu Kan reported on the grain policy.

Council members submitted 42 written inquiries and 12 oral inquiries on grain policy. After the written inquiries were read, it was time to adjourn. It was decided that oral inquiries would continue at the general assembly on the 26th.

### The Scar of Shenyang

— Special Correspondent in Northeast for This Newspaper, Han Qingtao

The New Has Been Destroyed

The materials of Shenyang were emptied. Those that couldn't be moved were destroyed. Among the large buildings, except for the Municipal Government, the Post Office, the Telecommunications Bureau, the Yamato Hotel, the Northeast Hotel, etc., it is difficult to find one that is intact. If there are any, they are just facades, while the interiors have been swept clean.

The chimneys of the factories in the Tiexi District stood in rows, but none of them were smoking. The machines inside were moved away, and it's hard to find any remnants that survived. They are truly like travelers in a sea of sand, pitifully lonely and weak. Many factory buildings have become fields of broken tiles, while others stand with their outer shells remaining incomplete.

However, the ancient castles and houses are safe and sound. The East and West Transfer Gates, the Golden Pillars, the palaces of the Qing Dynasty emperors, the old streets, the old city areas, and the four passes to the east, south, west, and north remain the same. The people only live and breathe within the ancient circle!

Two Power Sources

After the Soviet army withdrew, Shenyang turned into a dark world. The electric lights went out, and the tap water stopped flowing because the three major power sources in the Northeast were controlled by the Communist army. When the Soviet army withdrew, the Communist army stopped supplying electricity. Another reason is that some of the machinery at the two power sources, the Yalu River and the Songhua River, were moved away, so there may be problems with power generation now.

The locations of the three hydropower sources are: one is the Shuifeng Dam near Andong on the Yalu River, which can generate 700,000 KW, supplying electricity to large and small cities and towns on both sides of the Andong and Liao Rivers, as well as the Jinzhou area. The second is the Fengman Dam on the Songhua River, which generates 600,000 KW, supplying users in the Changchun and Harbin areas. The third is Jingpo Lake, which generates 60,000 KW, supplying users in the Jiamusi area. The three power grids are interconnected and can be used interchangeably. If there is an obstacle to one power source, another power source can send electricity to that area, so there can be sufficient power usage everywhere in the Northeast, and at the same time, each power source has a large surplus.

Today, more than two million people in Shenyang are living in darkness. Matches and candles are soaring in price. Because there is no electricity, tap water also cannot come, and the people are suffering. Later, news came from Fushun that electricity could be supplied from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day. During this time, the lights could indeed be turned on, but most people need electricity from 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM. But sometimes there is electricity in the second half of the night, which truly gives people a feeling of "mixed feelings of laughter and tears." Mayor Dong Wenqi said: "We are currently repairing the thermal power source of the arsenal that has not been destroyed, and it can be repaired in half a month, generating about 4,000 KW, in order to solve the urgent needs at hand."

Three Hundred Thousand Workers

According to statistics, there are 4,510 factories of various sizes in Shenyang City with three or more workers. Among them, there are more than 940 factories with more than one hundred workers. The total number of workers is estimated to be more than 300,000. The factories have been destroyed, and those that have not been destroyed have not started work, which has created a serious phenomenon of worker unemployment.

The reporter asked Mayor Dong about this issue, and Mayor Dong said: "It is more difficult to revive heavy industry, but it is easier and more necessary to restore light industry because light industry mostly manufactures daily necessities for the people. The previous inventory will be exhausted, thus stimulating rising prices, and the people feel distressed. Therefore, factories that can start work should start work immediately."

"The strength of the municipal government is limited, and I hope that the relevant departments will send people to handle it quickly, without hesitation or delay. There will be good results if it is handled, which will not only help some of the unemployed workers but also stabilize people's livelihood. As for the workers in heavy industry, I also hope that the government will quickly find ways to utilize them."

Major Educational Issues

Generally, people see that the Japanese elementary schools in Shenyang City are still attending classes as usual in difficult times, intensifying education work, and they feel scared and have emotions. The reason is that our schools are still suspended. Although elementary schools started on February 16th, everything was problematic. They barely had classes for a few days, and then were interrupted again because of the plague.

Shenyang City originally had 49 elementary schools run by the city, and another 21 secondary schools run by the province. There were about 40,000 elementary school students who received pseudo-Manchukuo education and also learned Japanese. This is not very scary, because generally speaking, in family education, there is still some hint of the atmosphere of the motherland.

The municipal government once organized a ten-day spiritual training for teachers in this regard. Secondary schools have established 11 educational guidance centers, with one hundred classes of students in class for four hours each day, mostly reviewing lessons or making up for new courses. Textbooks, teachers, and funding are currently the biggest problems. On this point, I hope that educators in the country and bookstore owners will extend an urgent helping hand!

The Urban Area Needs to be Rectified

According to the survey in January of this year, the population of Shenyang City is 2,166,000. At that time, the situation was complicated, and there was a large degree of mobility, so it is not necessarily very accurate. Now, generally speaking, life is still quite stable, but because everyone is scrambling to throw away Red Army currency, it has evolved into a phenomenon of soaring prices, which needs to be dealt with quickly.

The city's transportation originally had a dozen or so streetcars, but they cannot run without electricity. Many cars have also been taken away, so people have to take horse-drawn carriages, so it is a world of horse-drawn carriages. There are also many pedicabs. In addition to some made of leather, like elsewhere, others are made of steel pipes welded into a frame, with three boards placed on top as seats. People generally call them "big board carts," and two or one horse pulls them around everywhere. There are too many of these carts, and they are still being manufactured in large quantities.

The weather is getting warmer, and the city is full of thawed mud soup, plus a lot of horse manure, making the environmental hygiene a mess. Cars and horse-drawn carriages splash mud everywhere, posing a great threat to people. The only hope now is that the ice and mud reduce. The municipal government is trying to purchase transportation vehicles and reduce the number of horse-drawn carriages in the city. Otherwise, there will be serious impacts on hygiene and the city's appearance.

The city of Shenyang has not yet recovered its former appearance. When it gets dark, there is hardly anyone moving on the streets except for the armed brothers and police on guard duty. Coupled with the darkness without electric lights, it appears unusually deserted. Everyone is eagerly awaiting the light that comes with the arrival of the troops! (March 20th in Shenyang)

Dong Wenqi, Mayor of Shenyang

### Three Hours Before the Opening of the Security Council, Iran and the Soviet Army Announce Withdrawal; Britain Demands Disclosure of the Soviet-Iranian Agreement

[Report from this newspaper] Broadcasting from San Francisco on the 26th: The Security Council is scheduled to hold its second session this afternoon, but three hours before the meeting, the Soviet Union took a surprising action again. The Iranian authorities officially confirmed that the Soviet army has begun to withdraw from Iran. However, it is unknown whether the Security Council will immediately suspend discussion of this case. According to Moscow Radio, the Soviet Union and Iran have reached an agreement, and the British side has formally requested the Iranian side to disclose the contents of the agreement.

[Reuters, London, 24th] Moscow Radio broadcast today that the Soviet troops stationed in Iran "can be completely withdrawn within five to six weeks if there are no unexpected events." Moscow Radio also broadcast that, according to the treaty signed with Iran during the war, the troops of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States should withdraw from Iran on March 2nd. The British and American troops have withdrawn as scheduled. The Soviet Union had previously announced that it would withdraw its troops by March 31st. The Soviet troops in the Meshik-Sharut and Sannan areas began to withdraw on March 2nd and have been completed. The remaining Soviet troops will begin to withdraw on March 24th according to the Soviet-Iranian agreement. The news of this troop withdrawal has shocked all circles in London.

[Reuters, New York, 25th] An editorial in "The New York Times" recently commented on the Soviet Union's announcement that the Red Army has begun to withdraw from Iran, saying: Moscow's announcement of this matter proves that Stalin himself has admitted that his strategy of violating treaty obligations has fallen into a position of being unworthy of praise.

### Guo Taiqi as Chairman, the Security Council Meets; Britain and the United States Decide to Still Propose Discussion of the Iranian Issue

[United Press, New York, 25th] When the United Nations Security Council meets at 2:30 PM today, it will be chaired by the Chinese representative Guo Taiqi. The representatives of various countries attending the meeting were all turning from sadness to joy because of the news of the Soviet army's withdrawal from Iran. However, the United States has decided to propose discussion of the issue and advocate that any solution to the Soviet-Iranian issue should be approved by the Council. The representatives all hope that the Moscow Radio announcement will reach a satisfactory solution, and that the Council will approve it. However, before this happens, US Secretary of State Byrnes will insist on the following points: (1) The Council should listen to the full report of Iran and the Soviet Union regarding the details of the solution; (2) All reports should convince the representatives of all countries that the agreement reached between the two countries is out of mutual sincerity, and not out of threats; (3) The Soviet Union's report to the Council should be regarded as the same as the agreement established with the United Nations organization and Iran.

[United Press, London, 24th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said today: Regardless of what action the Soviet Union takes to resume direct negotiations with the Iranian government, Britain will raise the issue of the Soviet army in Iran to the United Nations Security Council. The spokesman said: "Although Britain welcomes direct negotiations between Iran and the Soviet Union, which was approved by the last meeting of the Security Council, the main dispute remains unresolved."

[Reuters, New York, 25th] After the opening of the Security Council today, since the report of the Rules Committee and the report of the Military Staff Committee that should be discussed cannot be submitted until several days later, after holding the opening ceremony, it will discuss the Iranian issue. If the Soviet chief representative Gromyko suddenly announces today that Iran and the Soviet Union have established a direct agreement or that the Soviet army is gradually withdrawing, then according to the procedure, the Iranian issue must not be immediately abandoned or postponed for discussion. At that time, the British and American representatives will definitely inquire about the exact date of the Soviet army's withdrawal, and whether the Soviet army has left behind military equipment, which can be used by those who sympathize with the Soviet Union to forcibly establish the autonomous Azerbaijan.

[TASS, Moscow, 24th] The Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Gromyko, has recently been appointed by the Soviet Council of Ministers as the permanent representative of the Soviet Union to the Security Council of the United Nations organization.

### The Draft Peace Treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland Have Not Been Prepared Yet

[Reuters, London, 25th] Another week has passed, but there has been no progress on the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland, and the date of the Paris Conference of 21 countries on May 1st is gradually approaching. Therefore, some people have moved to temporarily not discuss the draft treaties at that time, but to focus on peace negotiations. The United States will support this proposal, because the Americans deeply desire that the former enemy countries can restore their stable foundation of political and economic independence, and then they are willing to hand over the drafting of the treaty to the general meeting so that there can be some success.

### Military Representatives of the Five Powers Discuss the International Army Plan; The Use of Atomic Bombs is also Within the Scope

[Reuters, New York, 25th] Military representatives of the five countries of China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France will meet at the New York Hotel today to discuss the plan to establish an international army.

[United Press, New York, 25th] Senior officials of the United Nations Staff Department today denied that any discussion will be held on the number and composition of the United Nations armed forces. The rumor that the international army will have around two million people has no factual basis. The "Five Powers" Committee will begin discussing this issue in absolute secrecy tomorrow. From the use of atomic bombs to the deployment of the international army, all are within the scope of discussion, so that this army can assist the Security Council in maintaining world peace.

[United Press, New York, 24th] According to the resolution obtained in the preliminary discussion of the United Nations Military Staff Committee: The United Nations organization will set up an international army of two million people to maintain world peace. The committee passed: One million of these troops should be supplied by the five powers, and the remaining one million should be supplied by the other 46 countries. The navy and air force will be contributed by Britain and the United States, but based on political reasons, the military equipment contributed by the United States will not include atomic weapons. According to news from the New York Times: The United Nations organization may require the United States to supply two to five divisions of ground troops, ten to twenty squadrons of air force, and two aircraft carrier fleets. The newspaper pointed out: Britain and the United States have aircraft with land bases that can perform long-distance bombing, and are the only major powers with powerful navies. Therefore, the ground troops that China, the Soviet Union, and France need to supply will be more than those of Britain and the United States.

According to the treaty, Britain may establish at least two air force bases one hour's flying time from the Iranian-Soviet occupied area. Al-Suwaidi also said that the recent Kurdish riots have not been discovered in Iraq. There is no Kurdish problem in Iraq. The Kurds are quite supportive of Iraq's unity.

### Hong Kong Population Surges: Streets and Alleys Constantly Crowded, Food and Lodging Become Major Problems

[United Press, Hong Kong, 24th] The population here is increasing daily due to the continuous influx of Chinese people. British authorities estimate it to be around 1.25 million. The population growth rate is now approximately 60,000 per month, mainly because of the poor economic situation in Guangdong, which leads a large number of people to flock to Hong Kong, hoping for a better life. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is packed with travelers coming to Hong Kong every day. When the "Foshan" steamer first sailed from Guangdong to Hong Kong, it carried 1,000 passengers, but when it returned to Guangdong from Hong Kong, it carried less than 500. Chinese people in rural clothing, carrying suitcases, miscellaneous items, or poultry, can often be seen on the waterfront. Hong Kong's population has never been as large as it is today, with the exception of the years 1929 to 1931. At that time, the Japanese army occupied South China, forcing hundreds of thousands of Chinese to take refuge here, until Hong Kong fell, when they were forced back to the Chinese free areas. Since the Japanese surrender, the population increase has been evident to anyone who has witnessed Hong Kong's revival from the dead. On the sidewalks of major streets, people are constantly crowded, and in the smaller alleys, where rice shops and eateries are lined up, customers often stand shoulder to shoulder. Beggars and vagrants lying on the sidewalks, in alleyways, or in window recesses are everywhere. Often four or five people share an old quilt or a piece of burlap to sleep, with their feet stretched out into the walkway, posing a tripping hazard for drunken passersby. The Hong Kong government, through various charitable organizations, provides relief to these poor people, reaching a maximum of 40,000 people per day.

For those continuously arriving here, accommodation and food have become major problems. Those with relatives here can still borrow a spare room or a space to temporarily live in. Renting a house requires a "key money" payment, which can be as high as HK$500, but rent is still frozen at the prices set in 1930. The authorities have recently issued stricter rules to prevent landlords from circumventing the rent control ordinances. People's rice rations have recently been reduced, and the official price of rice, subsidized by the government, is set at HK$0.10 per catty. However, to obtain high-quality white rice, one must purchase it on the black market, where it costs more than HK$1.00 per catty. Recently, in one week, the black market price of high-quality "New Territories" rice jumped from HK$0.95 to HK$1.40. The prices of other major items fluctuate during the week, depending on supply. However, the cost of living, based on the prices of major items, is estimated to be at least three times higher than before the war. Civil servants and most employees of commercial firms receive a cost-of-living allowance in addition to their salaries. The government also has special canteens to provide meals to so-called "essential workers." However, ordinary low-wage earners are struggling to make ends meet. A day laborer who could earn HK$0.75 per day before the war now only earns HK$2.00 per day. The price of a rickshaw is HK$0.30 per ten minutes. If a passenger actually paid the rickshaw driver according to this rate, the rickshaw puller would probably hit him over the head with the rickshaw shaft.

American Flying Car

This new type of flying car can have its wings and tail removed in five minutes, transforming it from an airplane into a car. This flying car can seat two people, has one front wheel, two rear wheels, and a wingspan of 310 feet. In the air, it can fly at a maximum speed of 128 miles per hour.

Editorial

### The New Solidarity of Journalists

Shanghai has had journalists' organizations for a long time, but today's establishment of the Shanghai Journalists Association represents a new kind of unity and symbolizes a new kind of power, which is particularly meaningful. The organization of the Journalists Association existed in Shanghai even before the War of Resistance and made valuable contributions. Since the National Army withdrew to the west and Shanghai became an isolated island, Shanghai's journalists upheld the righteous spirit of the nation, adhered to a strict position, and were not swayed by power or tempted by profit, fulfilling their duties as human beings. Some even sacrificed their lives, such as Hua Lin of *Ben Bao* and Zhu Xingse of *Da Mei Evening News*, whose heroic deaths are worthy of being praised in history and are models for our journalists. Since the attack on Pearl Harbor, this isolated island was even more shrouded in darkness, and the power of the enemy and puppets increased. The freedom of our journalists was further restricted, and many who were unwilling to serve the enemy resigned and left, either going far to Chongqing or changing their professions. Their unwavering patriotism is worthy of admiration. However, there was also an uneven quality of integrity, and there were those who willingly became slaves. Especially after the fall of Shanghai's foreign concessions after the Pearl Harbor attack, those who were eager to jump on the bandwagon engaged in rampant activities. With the victory of the War of Resistance and the restoration of our territory, the original journalists' organizations should naturally be reorganized. On the occasion of the reorganized Shanghai Journalists Association announcing its establishment, I would like to offer a few words of encouragement and congratulations.

(1) Establish a Sound and Responsible Public Opinion: With the victory of the War of Resistance, the nation is entering a stage of nation-building. This is truly a major turning point for our nation. Building on the past and opening up the future, the future direction of our country is not only related to the rise and fall of our nation but also to the fate of all mankind. At this historical juncture, journalists bear an especially heavy responsibility. The soundness of a country's politics is based on a sound news industry, and a sound news industry begins with responsible public opinion, the so-called "Responsible Press." In the past, journalists had a saying, "Record everything you hear," but this is not the attitude that responsible public opinion should have. It should not be used again today, without saying more. However, in today's world, abandoning "Record everything you hear" is not enough. In order to assist the nation's nation-building efforts, we must establish responsible public opinion, responsible to the journalist, responsible to the newspaper, responsible to society, and responsible to the nation. Freedom of speech is a right granted to the people by the state, and journalists should not abuse this right. Moreover, freedom is relative and should be based on not infringing on the freedom and rights of others. Britain and the United States value individual freedom, and even if journalists do not entirely agree with the opinions and propositions of the ruling authorities, they do not make excessive remarks, and their newspapers do not publish excessive descriptions. This is a model of responsible public opinion. Responsible public opinion is about having self-awareness of this "degree."

(2) Launch a News Purification Movement: News purification has two meanings: purification in advertising and purification in editing. Journalists often have a saying, "Human interest first," which means that what is published in the newspaper should be based on "human interest." However, "human interest" has many aspects, and one cannot use so-called low-level interests as the only standard. "Yellow journalism" is not a name that one can be proud of, even abroad. Today, Shanghai newspapers do not often include "yellow journalism" in their pages due to limited paper. When the situation improves in the future, we must prevent the resurgence of "yellow journalism." We must keep the pages of our newspapers clean, both in advertising and in editing. Even now, some small newspapers specialize in catering to low-level interests, which is harmful to society. Now that the Journalists Association has been established in Shanghai, it is hoped that it can launch this news purification movement and open up a new path for the Chinese news industry.

(3) Promote Journalistic Academic Research: The Journalists Association is a professional organization, not an academic and cultural organization. However, the news industry abroad is making rapid progress, and we should not be content to lag behind. We must catch up. The news industry is a business that combines industry and commerce. Printing a newspaper is a specialized technology. When the United Nations organization was established in London last year, the New York Times could be distributed to all the representatives attending the meeting that day. This was not an airmail newspaper delivered by plane but a new printing invention using wireless telephotography. Newspapers abroad are all mechanized, while our newspapers are still stuck in a handicraft stage. If foreigners had not come up with the machines for casting type and the methods for typesetting, our newspapers would still be in a more primitive stage. To promote the development of the Chinese news industry, we must promote the research of journalistic academics.

Journalists are called "uncrowned kings," which shows how much they are valued by the world. All of us journalists should be aware of the heavy responsibilities we bear and encourage ourselves. Shanghai is the center of China's news industry, and its position is no less than that of London in England or New York in the United States. Everything it does is enough to affect the whole country. How to seek the protection of the professional rights and interests of our journalists and how to seek the future development of the Chinese news industry, now that the Shanghai Journalists Association has announced its establishment, it is particularly hoped that it can take the lead in advocating and setting a good example for the whole country. The future of the nation depends on it.

### Site of Security Council Meeting: The Bronx; Signer of the American Declaration of Independence Once Suggested Building the Capital There

[U.S. News Service, New York, 24th] The *New York Times Magazine* recently published an article describing a part of New York City, namely the Bronx, where the United Nations Security Council will hold its meeting at Hunter College. The name of this place originated from a man named Bronck, who owned 500 acres of land there more than 300 years ago. The *Times* stated that New York is not as completely built up as commonly imagined. There are still 43 farms in the Bronx, totaling 144 acres. More than 400,000 Bronx residents work in Manhattan, New York's primary financial and commercial district. Seventy percent of the Bronx's residential areas are apartment buildings. The Bronx's educational institutions include Fordham University, Hunter College, Manhattan College, New York University, and the Salvation Army College. The poet Alan Poe once lived in the Bronx. The *Times* stated that 175,000 people who served in the U.S. armed forces during the war came from the Bronx. The famous Bronx Zoo is also located there. The *Times* also said that the Bronx almost became the capital of the United States. Morris, one of the signers of the American Declaration of Independence, suggested in 1790 that the Bronx be the site of the Capitol, but Washington was eventually chosen.

### War Can Still Be Avoided: East Indies Troops Withdraw from Bandung; Set Fire to Important Buildings Before Retreating

[Our News] London, 26th Broadcast: Indonesian troops withdrew from the Bandung area, but before retreating, they set fire to many warehouses and other important buildings. Most of the city has been burned and is still burning.

[Reuters, Batavia, 25th] The British military authorities have rejected the request from the Indonesian side and have decided to implement the ultimatum previously issued to the Indonesian side, ordering the Indonesian extremists in the Bandung area to lay down their weapons and withdraw from the area by midnight yesterday. The deadline will not be extended for ten days. The British army will now begin to clear this "nest of terrorists." The British military authorities have taken necessary measures to prevent British troops from taking hostages with them into the mountains when they withdraw. The Dutch News Agency said that the British army has decided to launch a sweep at midnight this morning. The authorities have been using loudspeakers all day yesterday to instruct residents in the area to remain calm and not panic. It is reported that there have been no shooting incidents in the area for four days.

[Reuters, Batavia, 25th] A special correspondent of this agency said that during the negotiations between the Indonesian and Dutch sides on Saturday, a copy of the agreement previously signed between the French government and the Vietnamese Viet Minh government was presented. It is expected that the terms of this agreement will be the basis for the agreement in the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations.

### Where is the Majesty of Yore! Japan's Top War Criminals Pray to God in Prison

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] MacArthur Headquarters Legal Division announced that in the past two weeks, another group of war suspects has been detained in Sugamo Prison, including Lieutenant Colonel Ito, Captain Kawasaki, and Navy Lieutenant Commander Suzuki, totaling 41 people.

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] Japanese military and political war criminals, who were once prominent figures, are now prisoners in Sugamo Prison, awaiting trial. There is a "New Prayer Room" in the prison, where prayers are held twice a week. War criminals of all ranks participate equally. It is learned that today is another day for prayers. Before the service, the prisoners line up outside their small cell doors and then enter in single file, with the line stretching from seventy to eighty people. Prison guards monitor the line from the front and back. After entering the prayer room, the prisoners sit down where they are standing. Therefore, the top war criminals and some privates often share the same room, without any distinction. Former Prime Minister Tojo might stand next to Prince Nashimoto or sit with an ordinary soldier. Although it has been rumored that Tojo has lost weight, he does not appear to be particularly frail. Prince Nashimoto wears a khaki uniform but without shoulder boards. He is calm and has the same graceful demeanor as in the past. The above information about the lives of Japanese war criminals in Sugamo Prison was revealed by Professor Haruyama of Tokyo Imperial University. Haruyama is a devout Buddhist who teaches Indian philosophy at the university. Haruyama is the only outsider who knows the situation inside Sugamo Prison.

### Rampant Black Marketing in Japan Turns Trains into Hell

Traffic Morality Vanishes

[Reconstruction Daily, Tokyo, 25th] In Japan recently, black marketing is rampant, and trains are extremely crowded. Traffic morality has vanished, and the Japanese call it a "train hell." It is reported that the Japanese authorities have obtained the understanding of the Allied forces, and starting today, more police officers will be stationed at each station to strictly crack down. Anyone who disrupts traffic order, whether Japanese or foreign, will be severely punished.

### Emperor of Japan Inspects; Petty Official Stops Car to Offer Advice

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] Emperor Hirohito of Japan made his third inspection tour today, visiting hospitals, silk mills, factories, and local government offices. The people shouted "Banzai" when they saw him. A Japanese petty official rushed to the side of the Emperor's car, bowed deeply, and presented his land plan. Just as the station opened, the door hit his forehead, causing blood to stream down his face. The Emperor's chauffeur and attendants immediately administered first aid. The petty official, deeply grateful, endured the pain and told the Emperor about his work plan, how to plant wheat and sweet potatoes on the airfield. This time, the Emperor's inspection location was about forty miles from Tokyo. He first arrived there by train and then switched to a car amid the crowd's shouts of "Banzai." U.S. military police led the way in jeeps, going directly to the hospital to comfort the sick soldiers returning from overseas.

It is now learned that the procuratorate has been ordered to exhume the remains, and the chief prosecutor has telegraphed the Higher Procuratorate to report the details of the exhumation. It is up to the Higher Procuratorate to instruct whether to continue exhuming the remains of another foreigner buried elsewhere.

Hangzhou

Gradual Progress in Water and Land Transportation

Since Zhejiang's recovery, there has been gradual progress in water and land transportation. The details are as follows: The operating routes include Hangzhou to Fuyang, Hangzhou to Pinghu, Jiangshan to Pucheng, Lishui to Pucheng, Xiaoshan to Ningbo, Ningbo to Fenghua Xikou, Jinhua to Yongkang, Yongkang to Wu Yi County, Jiangshan to Chun'an, and Zhuji to Jiangshan.

Suzhou

Director of the Military Postal Bureau Embezzles Public Funds

Liu Renjie, director of the Military Postal Bureau of the Rear Service Headquarters, embezzled 600,000 yuan of public funds during his tenure. Liu had served in military organizations in his early years, traveling to Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Myanmar, and suffered from severe malaria, which recurred from time to time. Recently, he resigned due to illness and resided at the home of his father-in-law, Xue, at No. 25 Hulong Street in this city. After an investigation by the supervisors, a document has been prepared to sue the local court, ordering him to pay back the arrears.

Wuxi

Unlawful Salt Police Detained and Imprisoned by the Court

At the end of the lunar year last year, Ji Keyou and others sold two boats of salt, totaling 72 piculs. Due to suspected smuggling, the local court seized the salt and handed the salt boats over to Xu Renjin, the head of the 15th Tu, for safekeeping. Recently, the court ruled that the salt sold by Ji Keyou and others could not be considered smuggled salt because there was no tax collection agency in Guoyi at the time. They only needed to pay the tax and claim the salt boats to close the case. Unexpectedly, yesterday, two salt police officers, Zheng Yongsheng and Zheng Mingfu, under the orders of Tang Kaiyuan, the director of the Salt Affairs Branch Bureau stationed in Wuxi, and Shou Peiliang, the head of the salt police detachment, forcibly dragged the two salt boats to the river bank of the Salt Branch Bureau. Xu Renjin, the head of the Tu, reported the information to the procuratorate, which sent bailiffs and armed police to the Salt Branch Bureau, arrested the two unlawful salt police officers, Zheng, and detained them after interrogation, pending legal action.

Jiangyin

Eight People Drown at Baimao Kou

Zhou Alin, the owner of a Nanwai wave boat with a capacity of 25 tons, leased it to Zhong Longsheng, a Beiwai resident. On the 14th of this month, Tang Haiyun and others loaded 130 live pigs to be transported to Shanghai to be sold at Ji Yunbao's place. On the 15th, when sailing through Baimao Kou, they suddenly encountered a storm and capsized. All eight crew members and passengers drowned. Only Tang Haiyun, who was skilled in swimming, drifted with the waves for more than ten miles to Gaopu Kou, where he was rescued. On the 22nd, he returned to Cheng and reported to Zhong Longsheng, the lessee. Because the boat owner, Zhou Alin, had to compensate for the boat, which was difficult to resolve, he is reporting to the county government for relief.

Jintan

Missing Groom; Suspect Apprehended

Fan Haibao, 21, an employee of the Minfeng Rice Mill outside Xiaonanmen, met You Shuzhen, the eldest daughter of the Hongxing Sugar Shop on Dananmen Street, last year. You Shuzhen is 19 years old. With the consent of their parents, they made a vow of lifelong love. They chose March 14 to hold their wedding. At that time, relatives and friends filled the door to witness the grand ceremony. However, good things often have setbacks. Just as they were about to begin the wedding ceremony, the groom suddenly went missing. It has been ten days since then, and there has been no news. The bride is depressed all day long and cannot eat or sleep. It is reported that the groom had agreed with the bride earlier to hire a boat to transport 40 piculs of brown rice to Changzhou for sale, and to conveniently purchase wedding supplies. It was agreed that he would return to Tan that day to hold the wedding. This was learned by Liu Zhaoxi, a neighbor, who had evil intentions. He tracked him to Changzhou and, together with four other bandits, carrying weapons, asked Fan for a large sum of money. Fan refused, and he held a grudge. He threatened him with dangerous words, saying, "If you don't spend a little money, you will spend a lot of money." He left in anger. Afterwards, Haibao disappeared. There is a boatman who can testify. The county government, upon receiving the report, believed that Liu Zhaoxi was highly suspected and immediately arrested him and brought him in for questioning.

### City School Teachers' Strike - "A Disgrace to Our City" - Four Principles Proposed to Handle Future Labor Disputes - ...Mayor Qian Reported at the Memorial Week Meeting Yesterday...

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Qian reported at the Municipal Government Memorial Week meeting yesterday morning, stating that the city had experienced a strike by municipal school teachers a few days prior. The Municipal Government had not been notified beforehand. Although classes in all schools resumed yesterday, students' studies have been neglected considerably, which is unfortunate and a disgrace to our city. Students are the future pillars of the nation and bear the important responsibility of building the country in the future. Teachers should set an example but rashly took such action, which exerted a negative influence on students. The soaring prices in Shanghai and the poor living conditions of teachers are indeed facts, but the treatment of public education personnel is regulated by the state and cannot be singled out for differentiation. Public education personnel are different from general workers. Labor disputes involve both labor and management, which is not the case for public education personnel. In this difficult and challenging period for the country, public education personnel should endure hardship and work diligently for the public, not prioritize their personal comfort. The past will not be investigated, but the future must be restrained. It is hoped that all colleagues will encourage themselves to work with peace of mind.

Work Hard to Produce After Labor Disputes Resolved

Recently, labor disputes have been occurring frequently in the city. After the victory, some factories have been unable to start up. Furthermore, the people have suffered greatly from the eight-year occupation. Workers are struggling to maintain their livelihoods, and their compensation does indeed need to be adjusted. Therefore, in each labor dispute, the Social Affairs Bureau has followed this principle to mediate appropriately. Even if workers have taken actions that have exceeded the bounds of propriety, no deep investigation has been conducted. However, most labor disputes have now been fully resolved, and workers' compensation is based on the cost-of-living index. The wages of workers in various industries not only reference the cost-of-living index but are also largely based entirely on it. Therefore, there should be no further unreasonable demands, and even less should there be actions that exceed the bounds of propriety. The War of Resistance Against Japan has been won, and the most important task now is to build the country. Since the disputes have been resolved, both labor and management should work together with one heart and mind to dedicate themselves to production.

Four Principles for Handling Disputes

Going forward, the following four principles must be observed when handling labor-management disputes: (1) State-owned enterprises must comply with central government regulations and shall not engage in strikes or slowdowns. (2) Strikes or slowdowns without legal procedures shall be prohibited. (3) Demands that are not acceptable given the current state of production in China shall be rejected. (4) Illegal actions beyond the bounds of propriety shall be sanctioned. All of this is for the sake of national production and for the workers themselves. The interests of workers are based on the development of production. If production shrinks, the first to suffer will be the workers.

Everyone Should Comply with the Campaign to Tidy Up the City

The Mayor then added that he had seen municipal government notices pasted on the walls of Sincere and The Sun department stores that morning. The municipal government has long stipulated that public notice boards should be set up in various parts of the city specifically for posting public notices, in order to tidy up the city. Therefore, he specifically instructed the responsible personnel to correct this situation.

Electrical and Mechanical Workers Raise Demands

The electrical and mechanical workers in this city have recently raised the following demands to the employers: (1) The daily wage base should be two yuan and fifty fen to two yuan and eighty fen, divided into three grades, A, B, and C, with meals provided. Those not provided with meals should receive a monthly rice subsidy of six dou. (2) An eight-hour workday for day shifts and a two-hour workday for night shifts, with pay calculated at half-wage. (3) Apprentice monthly base pay should be divided into three grades: fifty fen, seventy fen, and ninety fen. (4) If employers require work on weekly holidays, pay should be calculated at three times the normal rate. (5) Wages should be paid weekly. (6) Temporary workers should be eliminated, but there may be a one-week trial period. After two weeks, they will become regular workers. Temporary workers' wages should be five jiao more than the fixed wage. (7) Workers should not be dismissed without cause. (8) Medical expenses for work-related injuries should be provided by the factory. (9) A set of uniforms should be given every six months. (10) Annual bonuses should be paid once a year, but the total amount should not exceed four months. (11) Female workers should be given one month of maternity leave. (12) One week or half a month of leave should be given for weddings and funerals, with wages paid. Employers consider the conditions too harsh. It is heard that the Social Affairs Bureau will convene representatives from both sides to gather opinions before making a final arbitration.

Basic Measures for Aiding Workers from the Rear Determined

After victory, state-owned and private factories in Sichuan and Guangxi underwent demobilization and relocation and were successively shut down. Approximately ten thousand laid-off workers will be gradually sent to Shanghai by the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. One thousand have already arrived in Shanghai. Last Friday, they gathered at the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, demanding work and sustenance. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, convened relevant agencies at eleven o'clock yesterday morning to discuss the re-employment and relief measures for the workers sent to Shanghai from the rear. More than twenty people attended. It was decided that the various factories under the Resource Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, as well as the China Textile Company and various state-owned factories, should employ 20% of the returned workers from the rear when resuming operations or hiring additional workers. Representatives from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and other agencies expressed their willingness to fully comply with this principle. Those who need to return to their hometowns can register at the various reception centers, and the Social Affairs Bureau will request the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Railway Bureau to provide free boat and train tickets and provide appropriate food and lodging expenses along the way.

### Citywide Flood Prevention Project Requires Approximately 100 Billion - Six Fundraising Methods Proposed

The Municipal Bureau of Public Works recognizes that many roads in the city are low-lying. Whenever it rains, water accumulates, causing not only inconvenience to transportation but also harming the city's appearance. Therefore, it is actively promoting a citywide flood prevention project. The estimated total cost is between 620,000 and 950,000 million yuan. The Bureau of Public Works has proposed several fundraising methods for these expenses: (1) A method of citizen apportionment, using the Baojia system to collect funds. (2) The city treasury and all citizens share the cost equally. (3) A method of collecting a surcharge on house tax, with the amount of contribution determined by the value of the house. (4) A method of collecting a surcharge on land tax. (5) Issuing municipal bonds. (6) A method of cost-sharing by owners on both sides of the street (in the Hongqiao area): owners of street-facing houses on both sides of the street bear half the cost, and the remaining half is distributed among all owners within the area benefiting from the flood prevention project, based on the size of their land. The above methods have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and are expected to be implemented soon.

### Murder of American Pilots Case - Final Court Hearing Today

The trial of Sawada Shigeru and three others, the main culprits in the murder of pilots from General Doolittle's unit in Shanghai, has been conducted by the U.S. military court eight times. Yesterday, the confessions of the four defendants were read aloud in court, and dozens of pieces of evidence were presented to the judges for review. Therefore, most of the work has been completed. Today will be the final trial. As for the date of the verdict, it will be decided after detailed consideration and discussion by the presiding judges in two or three days. According to the U.S. military personnel trying the case, the number of American pilots killed by the Japanese is difficult to estimate, but many Japanese war criminals are still at large.

### Allied Council for Japan - Our Delegation Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday - Headed by General Zhu Shimin, the Group Will Depart for Japan Soon

According to the decision of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers, the Chinese delegation to the Allied Council for Japan, responsible for controlling Japan, has been selected by the central authorities, with Zhu Shimin, former Chinese representative to the Far Eastern Commission, as the head of the delegation. The members of the delegation are specialized personnel selected from various ministries and academies. It is understood that the Chinese delegation, led by Zhu, consisting of twelve people, arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing yesterday afternoon and will soon depart for Japan. It is also heard that some members of the delegation were unable to come with Zhu yesterday due to the suddenness of the notice and will fly to Shanghai and then to Japan in succession.

Zhu's Talk

Zhu Shimin, along with the delegation's secretary, the chief of personnel Qian, specialized committee members Xie Nanguang and Zhang Fengju, and advisor Li Ji, a total of twelve people, took a military plane from Jiulongpo, Chongqing, at 8:15 a.m. yesterday morning and safely arrived at Dachang Airport at 1:20 p.m. Few people outside the delegation knew about Zhu's trip. Those who welcomed them at the airport included Wang Pengsheng, director of the Institute of International Affairs, Li Libo, section chief of the General Staff Headquarters, and Zou Renzhi, deputy director of the Japanese Residents Management Office, among others. Zhu, dressed in military uniform and full of energy, shook hands with the welcomers one by one after disembarking from the plane and immediately went to the hotel by special car to rest. The reporter made a special visit to inquire about the delegation's organization and mission. Zhu said that the delegation was ordered to organize and transfer to Shanghai to wait for a flight to Japan. As for the personnel selection, they were selected by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, General Staff Headquarters, and Economic Affairs to participate in the joint control of Japan. Zhu will stay in Shanghai for two or three days while waiting for a flight to Japan. Zhu has served as director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, military attaché to the United States, advisor to the National Government, and Chinese representative to the Far Eastern Commission of the organization of eleven countries before the victory.

### U.S. Sailor Robs Diamond Ring - Evidence Shows Suicide Due to Fear of Punishment

Director Zou's Explanation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the case of the U.S. sailor Dahl, who robbed a diamond ring from Dachang Jewelry Store on Linsen Road and shot to resist arrest, ultimately shooting himself to death after being unable to escape, a Western newspaper reported that he may have been shot by a police officer. Therefore, our reporter made a special visit to Director Zou of the Julu Road Police Station yesterday. Zou explained that the sailor fell forward in the alley, in a left-curved position, with most of his body facing right, which is clear evidence of suicide due to fear of punishment. A pistol was found next to the body of the deceased. It was a number two revolver, with two bullets remaining in the chamber. It was verified that four shots had been fired. The recovered pistol and bullets were handed over to the U.S. military police for filing. The location of the bullet entry point also proves that he used the gun to commit suicide. As for the revolver used by the sailor, it was .35 caliber, while the firearms used by the city police are .38 caliber. The truth will naturally be revealed.

### Overseas Chinese Do Not Forget the Motherland - Large Amount of Remittances - Government Allocates Funds to Aid Overseas Chinese Production Enterprises

According to statistics from the Bank of China, the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese is still very large. Last year, from January to October, remittances from London were over 489,000 pounds, from New York over 9.22 million U.S. dollars, from Sydney over 464,000 pounds, from Calcutta over 120,000 pounds and over 440,000 rupees, and from Havana over 1 million U.S. dollars. The figures for this year's remittances are still being compiled, but it is believed that they will exceed last year's by more than double. The contribution of overseas Chinese to the motherland is evident. It is understood that the government has recently allocated 50 million U.S. dollars to the Bank of China in Chongqing and Shanghai to be remitted to the Philippines and various parts of Southeast Asia, for loans to overseas Chinese industrial and commercial enterprises and for relief expenses, to restore the businesses operated by overseas Chinese in various places before the war. This is due to the fact that the production enterprises operated by overseas Chinese in various parts of Nanyang were destroyed or looted by the enemy during the war, resulting in huge losses and many people being unemployed and struggling to make a living.

### Mr. Starr Expresses His Thoughts in New York - Regarding the Future of Shanghai - Its Superior Economic Position Will Always Make It an International Metropolis

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mr. Starr, Chairman of the English-language China Daily Mail, recently returned to the United States from China and delivered a detailed speech about Shanghai at a meeting of the China-America Council of Industry and Commerce in New York City. We have excerpted the main points as follows: I arrived in Shanghai on October 11 last year and immediately felt that the work to be done by the Chinese was overwhelming. However, after staying in Shanghai for five weeks, I saw significant progress in the maintenance of Shanghai's houses, the improvement of policing, and cooperation between the municipal government and various parties. Therefore, I predict that a reasonable and effective municipal government will emerge in Shanghai. In the near future, Shanghai will restore its superior position in economics, trade, and finance. People often ask me whether Shanghai's future depends on China's unity and currency stability. I believe that the latter issue is even more important than the former. The Chinese government is currently redeeming various counterfeit currencies. It is rumored that, in the new agreement with the Communists, the various banknotes issued by the Communists will also be redeemed by the government. Therefore, the Chinese government will not be able to determine the total amount of currency in circulation until the redemption is completed at the end of March, and then, after considering the import and export situation, it can determine the external value of the currency. After the victory, the people who flocked back to Shanghai were divided into three major groups: first, the Allied nationals from concentration camps, who received enthusiastic support from the people of Shanghai after leaving the camps; second, the American soldiers who came to Shanghai waiting to be evacuated back to the United States, the arrival of the American soldiers created a market for the trading of American dollars, which somewhat supplemented the supply of American dollars in Shanghai; third, the people who had been living in the Chongqing area and returned to Shanghai. Although American and British nationals often find it difficult to recover their original property, it is clearly not intentionally caused by Chinese officials. During my stay in Shanghai, President Song came to Shanghai and tried to find a solution to this problem, tasking another official to handle it. In a few weeks, the results were remarkable. Shanghai is a metropolis where Chinese and foreigners have lived together for over 130 years. It has its own unique culture. Although the enemy and puppets occupied it for many years, I have not seen any changes. Therefore, Shanghai will not only always be a large trading city but also a happy and interesting place to live. The sincerity of the Chinese in welcoming Americans is beyond description, and their reliance on Americans is even greater than on other countries, which is the only cornerstone for future cooperation between China and the United States.

### Madame Chiang Visits Endner Twice

[Our Newspaper's Report] After flying from Chongqing to Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon, Madame Chiang rested briefly at her private residence and then went to visit Kong Xiangxi, former Vice President of the Executive Yuan.

At 4:15 p.m. yesterday afternoon, Madame Chiang and Dong braved the rain to visit the hospital again, leaving at 5:10 p.m. When Madame Chiang came downstairs, she smiled and walked out of the building before returning to her residence.

### Bureau for Handling Enemy and Puppet Assets - New Methods for Handling Housing - Some Agencies Panic

The Shanghai District Bureau for Handling Enemy and Puppet Assets decided yesterday to stop accepting new applications for housing and stipulated that past applications are being submitted to President Song of the Executive Yuan for personal approval. Regarding Allied housing, it is stipulated that lessees should directly contract leases with the owners and do not need to apply to the Bureau. Since the above new regulations were introduced, various agencies in the city have been unable to apply to the Bureau for housing leases. However, many agencies have not been able to rent housing and cannot work. They are greatly panicked by the Bureau's new regulations implemented yesterday.

### Architect Tao Guilin - Discusses Overseas Inspection Experience - The Domestic Construction Industry Should Have a Unified Organization

[Our Newspaper's Report] Tao Guilin, an authority in the construction industry and General Manager of Fook Kee Construction Company, returned to Shanghai last week from Seattle on a U.S. Navy transport ship after completing his inspection of construction engineering in the United States. Tao departed from Chongqing last September and transferred to India, first visiting major industrial areas in London, Manchester, and Canada to inspect the British construction industry and meet with leaders of the country's construction, architectural, and industrial sectors to discuss post-war reconstruction plans. Later, he traveled to the United States, visiting major cities such as New York and Washington to visit major factories and meet with engineering authorities in Washington and leaders of various engineering associations to discuss Sino-US construction and exchange views, both sides were very satisfied. Because Tao's planned trip was for six months, he could not visit other places.

A Great Lack of Architectural Talent

Yesterday afternoon, the reporter made a special visit to Tao. According to him, he had many impressions from this overseas inspection. The industrial development of Britain and the United States is beyond our reach. He hopes that in the future, the construction industry in our country can organize a unified organization to be collectively responsible for planning projects and purchasing materials, without seeking personal gain, and working together for the country's reconstruction and construction undertakings. This will not only curb the rising prices of materials but also speed up the work. Tao presented this view at a welcome meeting for him by the Shanghai construction industry, which was highly appreciated by all sectors, and they plan to actively prepare for it. However, the most difficult problem at present is the shortage of talent in addition to the lack of materials. On the one hand, we should step up the training of technicians, and on the other hand, we should suggest that the government assist with machinery to supplement the lack of manpower.

Export of Materials is Greatly Restricted

Tao also said that the UK has suffered a lot of damage to buildings during the war and is currently renovating and planning. But the lack of materials also affects work. The UK also needs to supply a large amount of building materials from abroad, while the United States only exports 15% of its building materials, and China only gets 1% or 2% of them. After Tao returned to Shanghai, he found that domestic merchants were ordering supplies from foreign countries, which he found very strange. According to his own experience, Britain and the United States are currently eager to revive their own businesses, and major factories are not able to meet their own needs, so it is unlikely that they can supply foreign orders in a short period of time. Therefore, the arrival time of the goods that have been ordered by people here will be long, so he hopes that Chinese and foreign traders can understand the country's economic difficulties and prevent capital from being frozen and affecting financial turnover.

Trip to Beijing to Inspect and then Fly to Chongqing

Tao has dedicated himself to the construction industry for more than 30 years and made many contributions during the War of Resistance. The famous Jialing New Village and Jialing Hotel in Chongqing were both developed and operated by Tao. In addition, the International Hotel, a skyscraper in this city, the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing, and the residences of celebrities in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing were all built by Fook Kee Construction Company.

Tao moved west with the government from Beijing at the beginning of the War of Resistance. He was a close friend of the late former Chairman Lin Sen. He is scheduled to go to Beijing tomorrow to inspect the damage to the capital during the war, and then come to Shanghai to fly to Chongqing to report to the government authorities on the inspection experience in the UK and the US, and make some suggestions.

### High Court Criminal Division Trials Traitors - Lin Fengxiang et al. - Final Verdict - Judgment on the Case of Puppet Military Officers and Others on the 30th

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Criminal Division of the High Court in Tilansia continued to hold a collegiate bench yesterday afternoon and first judged three treason cases: (1) Lin Fengxiang, who served as a translator for the puppet 1629th Detachment and a translator for Longhua Airport, was sentenced to four years of imprisonment and four years of deprivation of civil rights for colluding with the enemy, selling out the country, and holding military office.

(2) Wang Fa, 32 years old, from Nantong, opened a car company during the occupation of Shanghai and hired a Japanese man, Sato, as the company's liaison. Later, through Sato's introduction, he entered the gendarmerie as an informer and used his power to bully people. He was reported after Shanghai's liberation. (3) He Musheng, 40 years old, from Songjiang, who used to be a peddler, was accused of serving as an informant for the puppet police gendarmerie of the Songjiang Public Security Bureau from July 1944 to 1945, but the Baojia proved that this was not the case. The arguments in the above three cases have all ended, and the judgment is scheduled to be announced on March 30. (4) Wu Zhiqing was the captain of the 12th patrol team during the enemy occupation, and Liu Jinrong was a member of his team. They led the Japanese to take Chen Liansheng, Zheng Zhengmin, and Ma Fupu to the North Sichuan Road Gendarmerie Headquarters, where they were tortured illegally. Chen Tongsheng was subjected to electric shock, iron plate, and needle pricks, among other tortures, until he died. However, Wu and Liu are at large and have not been brought to justice, so the trial has been postponed for further proceedings.

According to shipping industry news, the water level in Hankou has now reached sixteen feet, and Yangtze River steamers under 3,000 tons can navigate without hindrance.

### Martyrdom of Xu Chang, Funeral of Division Commander Lu Passes Through Shanghai to Kaihua. Commander Tang Officially Cries in Grief During Sacrifice at Wuxi.

During the summer of the previous year, when the enemy invaded the Central Plains, they were the most elite Kwantung Army. At that time, Lu Gongliang, the division commander of the newly formed 29th Division, was ordered by Tang Enbo, the commander-in-chief of the Lu-Su-Wan-Yu Border Region, to defend Xuchang alone. Eventually, due to running out of ammunition and being cut off from reinforcements, Division Commander Lu and Deputy Division Commander Huang Yongwei, along with all the officers and soldiers of the entire division, made heroic sacrifices.

Heroic Sacrifice in Defending Xuchang

Division Commander Lu was from Kaihua, Zhejiang, and a student of the sixth term of the military academy. He was a promising young general and was highly regarded by Commander Tang. At the time, he bravely advanced and was shot by enemy machine guns, but still encouraged his men to kill the enemy, eventually dying in battle due to his severe injuries. Deputy Division Commander Huang was from Sichuan and was originally the commander of the Eight Hundred Heroes Regiment in Sihang. After being wounded, he was replaced by Xie Jinyuan. Therefore, he had made significant contributions to the war of resistance. At the time, he was captured after being wounded. The enemy took him away in a car, but Huang drew his gun and killed several enemies on the way, resulting in him being stabbed to death by multiple knives. The situation was extremely tragic.

Father and Elders Weep at the Departure of the Coffin

It is now known that the coffin of Division Commander Lu has been transported by his quartermaster director, Wang Yuling, to his original hometown for burial.

When it reached Wuxi, people from all walks of life warmly paid their respects. Commander Tang presided over the memorial ceremony. Tang could not restrain his grief and cried while caressing the coffin. The coffin of Lu arrived at the North Station the night before last. Yesterday, friends of Lu during his lifetime went to pay their respects. It was transported to Hangzhou that night for transfer to Kaihua for burial. He left behind a wife, two sons, and two daughters, and his family is in dire straits.

### Here, There is No Need to Visit the Telephone Company Anymore. Let's See Whether the Raw Material of Monosodium Glutamate is Really Snake Meat. Harvests from the Industrial Exhibition.

— Our Reporter, Xing Wu

Rainy days always make places seem deserted, but yesterday's Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition in the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association was an exception. The light was naturally a bit poor due to the rain, so all I saw were crowds of heads, which proves the public's interest and emphasis on industry.

As soon as I entered, many familiar patterns came into view. Samsung toothpaste, Invincible tooth powder, Wuzhou medicated soap, etc., were displayed in a dazzling array. The most eye-catching was the Yuhua Soap Factory, which was manufacturing olive oil soap on the spot. All the processes from stirring oils and fragrances to grinding, soaping, and printing were handled by three electric motors. The soap they made was also sold in the charity sale department.

On the third floor, the entrance passage was full of pictures and printed materials from the Yongxiang Printing House. The hand-cranked mimeograph machine of the Daming Industrial Company was printing their advertisements at any time, which was indeed fast and clear. The China Machine Company displayed microscopes, anemometers, balances, and other instruments they produced. The "Engineering World" published by "Zhongji" and their work report printing were also exhibited here. The cultural atmosphere here was the strongest, so there were also more visitors, including intellectuals wearing thick glasses and students holding books who had just come out of school.

The fourth and fifth floors were the world of science. The indoor automatic intercom telephone of the Zhongyuan Telephone Manufacturing Factory had the same principles as the telephone of the Shanghai Zhou Telephone Company, and also had dial tones and busy signals. After you have seen it here, you don't need to visit the telephone company anymore. The Decheng Gramophone Factory played records at any time, allowing you to watch the masterpiece of scientization in the melodious sound of music, making you feel more pleasant. The public health drawings, tables, and specimens of the Aurora University Medical School were able to attract the attention of the audience. They were vaccinating the audience for free on the spot. Starting today, they have also hired doctors from various departments of Guangci Hospital to conduct free physical examinations. The airplane models of the China Aviation Association and the performance of automatic trains automatically controlling red and green lights, two sprayers were constantly spraying, making the air in the venue too humid. The Taiyi Monosodium Glutamate Factory displayed in detail each manufacturing process from adding acid to flour and gluten, fermentation, crystallization, dissolving, filtering until it turns into pure white monosodium glutamate. Miss Min Shufen, the personnel director of the exhibition who accompanied me on the visit, said: "The general public is not very clear about the manufacturing process of monosodium glutamate, especially the raw materials, and they even mistakenly believe that it is made of snake meat. This can dispel doubts." Although the knowledge that monosodium glutamate is made of gluten is now very common, there were indeed quite a few people who suspected that it was made of snake meat ten years ago. Similarly, you can see the scientific manufacturing methods of many daily necessities in the exhibition, and you will no longer have the question of "what is ×× made of after all?"

At the same time, in the exhibition, you can see the backwardness of China's industry. Therefore, the purpose of the Chinese Technical Association in preparing this exhibition with great difficulty is precisely to give all sectors of society a new inspiration to arouse the public's attention to industry. The hard work of "Zhongji" has already been harvested in the two days before the initial opening of the exhibition, and we should be fortunate for the future of China's industry.

After government bonds were bought up last Saturday, yesterday, floating capital came in droves. With the encouragement of industry insiders, the market atmosphere was lively. Retail investors only listened to rumors, and Class C bonds rose to over 2,100 yuan as soon as they opened. Various fund holders rushed to buy, pushing the price to a high of 2,970 yuan before slightly receding. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Classes A, B, D rose by more than 800 yuan, Class E rose by more than 700 yuan, and Class C jumped by 1,000 yuan. The retail market closed early, and it was feared that it would be difficult to sell later. Chinese stocks still rose at the start, reaching a peak again after opening, with Yongsha at 5,250 yuan, Meiya at 4,150 yuan, and Jingfu at over 355 yuan, before slightly falling back. There was a lot of consolidation in the process. After 11:00 AM, the police suddenly came to the Overseas Chinese Building for inspection, and the government bond meeting was stopped. Chinese stocks were also deterred by the news of investigations and arrests, and temporarily stagnated. Selling pressure increased, and the market closed at low prices at noon. As a result, compared to last Saturday, familiar stocks fell slightly, while unpopular stocks remained flat. Rongfeng's new stock itself was active and the momentum was the most favorable. In the afternoon, off-exchange spot settlements raised prices slightly for the three popular stocks. Foreign stocks were still stable at the start, with Yisha seeing around 11,100 yuan again. Chinese stock speculators sold off, and the rise was hindered and slightly fell back. Due to the news of the Overseas Chinese Building being searched and two people being arrested, foreign stocks were also afraid of being affected, and the market closed slightly earlier, with each stock closing down by about half a percentage point. Compared to last Saturday, Yisha, Asian Beer, and Jardine Matheson each fell by half a percentage point, and although other stocks fell, the drop was not large. Only Yiqiu had someone looking for it, and the price rose instead.

### Central Bank's Inventory is Sufficient. Gold Market is Narrow and Fluctuating. Indian Gold Reserves have been Shipped to Shanghai in Batches. Resumption of Gold Trading Exchange is Currently Impossible.

[Report from Our Newspaper] It was recently learned from a responsible person at the Central Bank that the bank's overseas gold reserves are mostly in the United States and India, especially the gold reserves in the United States are more abundant. The bank's gold reserves in India have been shipped to Shanghai in batches in the past few months, while the large amount of gold reserves in the United States have not yet been used. If there is a need, they will also be shipped to Shanghai in batches. It is reported that the current gold reserves in the bank's Shanghai vault are extremely abundant, enough to stabilize the gold market.

(Another Report) When the reporter inquired about the resumption of the Gold Exchange to a responsible person at the Office of the Financial Commissioner, he said that it is probably not possible at present.

Yesterday, gold and banknote prices in Peidu and other places fell. After rising, many took the opportunity to close positions. The Central Bank distributed 190 bars to peers at a price of 1.6 million. In the end, the market was flat and weak. The morning opened flat, and after opening, it saw over 1.62 million, but it was only a flash in the pan. It soon fell back to the 1.6 million level. When the Central Bank distributed, the market price was at 1.59 million, so the number of registrants was not large, and the overall trend was very flat. The fluctuations were also narrow. The low price was 1.58 million, and it was still around 1.59 million until noon. In the afternoon, if it did not advance, it retreated. In the end, it retreated to around 1.58 million, falling back 35,000 compared to last Saturday. Decorative gold was listed at 172,000, silver was unchanged, and silver dollars hovered around 1,050 yuan. The shadow exchange rate was flat, and the interest rate was between 1.6 and 2 jiao.

### Actual Goods Flood out of New Port, Hong Kong Dollar Tickets Rise and Fall

The US dollar was slightly prosperous, and buyers were once active. Although the morning opened flat, it once rose to over 2,000 yuan in the middle, but the momentum did not last long. At noon, it was still hovering around 1,980 yuan. The situation changed from tense to slightly relaxed, and the market price did not change. As a result, it rose slightly compared to last week. The swap rate for gold was 800 yuan for 10 taels. The US exchange rate was unchanged. The old Hong Kong dollar tickets were flat and weak. New Hong Kong dollar tickets suddenly rose and fell yesterday due to the dumping of actual goods. The 1936 issue was forced to shrink all the way from 245 yuan by sellers. At noon, it retreated to within 190 yuan. Finally, there were buyers at low prices, and it rose back to around 200 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, the old issue fell by 5 yuan, and the new issue fell back by 35 yuan. Hong Kong Telegraph was 430 yuan, and Roby was 530 yuan.

### More Than 500,000 Bales of American Cotton Imported. Goods Arriving Before March 4th Must Find Their Own Foreign Exchange.

It was recently learned from cotton industry magnates that the total amount of imported American cotton has reached more than 500,000 bales, each bale weighing 500 pounds, equivalent to 375 catties. Furthermore, President Bei of the Central Bank recently held an important meeting to discuss the settlement methods for cotton imports. It is rumored that for goods arriving before March 4th, foreign exchange cannot be settled in any case, but if the ship has not yet arrived, it can still be applied for. As for future application procedures, the purchase order and the completed application form, along with the foreign exchange bank, should be submitted to the Central Bank for approval.

(Another Report) It is also rumored that the value of imported cotton before March 4th is 14 million US dollars, and the foreign exchange for this item must be cleared by each cotton company directly with foreign banks. Because this transaction was privately handled between the two parties at the time, the Central Bank has rejected them all.

Cotton Yarn Sales are Quite Smooth. Cotton Market is Currently Mediocre.

Yesterday, the yarn market was quite stable. The initial asking price in the morning was very flat. Later, because the inland companies and the Guangdong companies were very interested, the 20-count yarn sold well, rising about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan compared to the end of last week. The 16-count yarn was also firm, but fine yarn still showed no improvement. At noon, the Textile Construction Corporation posted prices as usual, and the supply was still abundant. Various fine yarns above 42-count continued to be listed from 80,000 to 300,000 (80-count Sunlight was listed at 6.3 million last period, and 6 million yesterday).

Yesterday, New York American cotton rose 9 to 17 points, with near-term at 27.02 US cents and far-term at 27.06. The current spot price of Metling is 27.64. The futures market has already shown a near-low and far-high situation. The current cotton market in this city is still mediocre, but transactions have begun to expand. In addition to the Textile Construction Corporation not purchasing, the private-owned Shenxin First Factory and Nantong Dasheng Factory both have demand. Peers also have Metling ordinary goods being traded, totaling about 1,500 to 1,600 bales.

### Rice Market is Firm

The rice market still has sources, but the production price is high, and owners are unwilling to sell. However, shops are also watching because the digestion is flat, so the market has reached a stalemate. The Yinyuan goods are mostly sluggish and have fallen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Flour remains firm due to slight movement in sales to Taiwan. Bran has increased by another 200 yuan. Soybeans, after continuous declines, have seen slight inquiries for retail sales, and the situation is weak but firm. Bean cake is temporarily flat. Raw peanuts are stable, and high-quality goods have risen by another 1,000 yuan. The oil market is downstream and has fallen by another 500 to 1,000 yuan.

Also, according to news from the rice market in this city, yesterday more than 10,000 stones of rice arrived in this city, including 5,919 stones of white japonica rice, 1,036 stones of thin paddy rice, 2,682 stones of plain paddy rice, and 2,000 stones of other varieties such as Yangxian, Duxian, Wuxian, and Yinbaiyuan, totaling 11,658 stones.

### Silk Weaving Industry Demands Textile Construction to Allocate Rayon.

Small Dispute Occurred on the Spot.

Members Petitioned the City Government.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Labor-management disputes have been occurring in electric silk weaving factories recently, and yesterday, when the China Textile Construction Corporation opened its goods, some members of the industry had a dispute with the company's openers. For a time, there was banging on tables and shouting. The reason is that the industry has repeatedly requested the company to open rayon to stabilize the black market, but what was opened yesterday were still various yarns, which caused the dispute.

Also, according to the person in charge of the guild, the Ministry of Economic Affairs' China Textile Corporation originally stipulated that 500 boxes of rayon per month should be allocated to silk weaving factories in the city. However, after the first batch was allocated on March 6, the application forms for the second batch were submitted a month ago, but the goods have not yet been issued. Therefore, members of the guild had no choice but to petition the city government in teams at 10:00 AM yesterday, requesting relief.

### Calculation of Losses from Forced Purchase of Yarn and Cloth: Gold and Black Market Yarn Rise Together, Actual Purchase Price Still Only One-Fourth

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau received cotton yarn and cloth from the puppet Cotton Unification Association. These were goods forcibly seized by the enemy from our country's dyeing and weaving factories and yarn and cloth factories in August of the 32nd year of the puppet regime. At that time, puppet banknotes and gold were distributed in installments. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the respective trade associations applied for their return, because they were forcibly taken, and the price given was less than one-fourth of the market price at the time. However, some people also said that the gold distributed at the time was converted at a price of only 40,000 yuan per tael, fearing that the yarn and cloth factories may not have suffered much loss in reality. Therefore, our reporter specifically investigated the truth from people in the industry. It is said that although the gold was valued low at the time, the yarn and cloth were valued even lower. Afterwards, the price of gold rose in installments, and the market price of yarn and cloth rose even more. Even other prices rose. If the gold issued in each installment is converted according to the black market rate, plus the puppet banknotes issued in each installment, it is still only one-fourth of the market price of yarn and cloth at that time. It is also said that taking 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth as an example, the purchase price was 375 yuan in puppet banknotes. Based on the black market price of gold issued each time, plus the puppet banknotes, it amounted to 29.2% of the market price at that time. Therefore, the price given by the enemy and puppets was indeed far from enough to compensate for the losses of yarn and cloth manufacturers. However, regarding the yarn factory side, it is said that some factories received flower cloth at the time, and the loss from the forced purchase was calculated separately. Here is a table comparing the puppet banknotes and black market price of gold issued in each installment with the market price of unbleached cloth, taking 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth as an example (amounts are in puppet currency):

(Note) On January 1, year 33, the price of gold at that time was 78,000 yuan in puppet currency. On October 1, the second installment, the price of gold at that time was 540,000 yuan in puppet currency.

Mrs. Needham, a scientist from Cambridge University, has completed her two-year term of service at the Sino-British Science Cooperation Office in China and has returned to her country. Her husband, Dr. Needham, is the director of the Sino-British Science Cooperation Office.

Cultural Exchange in a Low House

The Sino-British Science Cooperation Office, maintained by the British Cultural Association, is located on a mountain peak on the bank of the Jialing River in Chongqing. In this low house with whitewashed planks, countless new scientific books, magazine reprints, boxes of instruments and chemicals, various special seeds and seedlings, and materials specially prepared in Britain and India for Chinese scientists who craved information during the war have flowed through. At the same time, reports of Chinese scientists' research work and agricultural materials have also passed through this house to reach scientists in Britain.

Scientific Cooperation on a Long Journey

The work of the Sino-British Science Cooperation Office is not limited to Chongqing. All the staff traveled long distances by truck, visiting universities and scientific institutions in the evacuation areas. The Needhams and a Chinese scientist once traveled thousands of kilometers north from Chongqing to the provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu in two years. On the way, they encountered flooded broken bridges, which led them to abandon their trucks and wade through the water to nearby hills.

Arriving in Baoji, Shaanxi, the Needhams saw many things of scientific interest.

Visiting Education in Baoji

For example, Henan University, founded in Kaifeng fifteen years ago, had taken refuge four times due to the Japanese invasion. The university taught in a temple in Er Zhuang, Baoji, and the professors and students lived in nearby farmhouses or caves. The university had carried several boxes of instruments hundreds of miles on foot, but there were no places to open laboratories. There was not a single science book in the collection, because all the science books had been destroyed by the Japanese. The teachers and students had also sacrificed all their clothes, so they wore summer clothes in the cold winter. Everyone hoped to get a cotton coat for relief. News came after the victory that the school buildings had been severely damaged and transportation was difficult, making it difficult to restore the school. The hope during the war became a bubble after the war.

Reaching Gansu in the North to Visit Forests

The Needhams traveled north to the Soil Conservation Institute of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Gansu Province, where the work was very good. They also visited the Forest Conservation Institute and the Shaanxi Provincial Health Experiment Institute, which had started making smallpox vaccine as early as 1932 to resist the cholera epidemic at that time.

The above few places are only part of the visits by the Sino-British Science Cooperation Office. The office has done its best to meet the needs of Chinese scientists, although the amount supplied only represents a little thought from the people of Western Europe. Now that the war has ended, the British Cultural Association will surely be able to rely on the close cooperation of Chinese and British scientists to actively develop science and international relations.

### (Golden Jade Cities, Decaying Villages!) Wounds All Over the Central Plains. A Dispatch From This Newspaper on the 16th. Fan Shiqin Reports from Zhengzhou.

On the highways, from the cars, gazing at the Central Plains, hills rise and fall, and the fields enter the painting. On the railways, from the trains, avoiding looking at the Central Plains, it stretches as far as the eye can see, with wheat seedlings like a sea. The railway in the Central Plains forms a cross shape. The highways wind around on both sides and around the railway. This shows that the Central Plains are surrounded by mountains like barriers, while the middle is a vast, open basin. This exterior grandeur and interior tranquility truly make it a naturally great garden!

Looking at the Central Plains from a natural geographical perspective is quite different from looking at them from a human geographical perspective.

Kaifeng's Outer Shell Is Complete, But Its Spirit Is Entirely Gone

After this great war, and even with the embers of the war still smoldering, the Central Plains are completely disfigured. Kaifeng was not destroyed by artillery fire, and the enemy even embellished Kaifeng a little. However, although Kaifeng's outer shell is complete, its spirit is entirely gone. Arriving in Kaifeng for the first time, the people do not know the Qin and Han Dynasties, nor do they understand master and slave. There are not even the Four Books and Five Classics in the bookstores, but on the streets, one can see fellow countrymen wearing Japanese-style short outfits. Kaifeng has been occupied for eight years, and its flesh and blood have been soaked with poison. Zhengzhou used to be the number one place in Henan Province. The Pinghan and Longhai railways once crossed its territory; Xuchang is a famous tobacco-producing area, with piles of tobacco leaves like mountains, and factories with chimneys like forests standing; Luohe is a place where mountain goods gather and disperse. During the War of Resistance, it was still a place for the exchange of goods between the enemy and us, and its fame was known far and wide. Zhengzhou, Xuchang, and Luohe, except for a section of the station that showed traces of artillery fire, the high-rise buildings in the city areas are adjacent to each other, and are currently still renovating their facades, greatly refreshing them, and filled with a victorious and peaceful atmosphere. Goods from all directions, east, west, north, and south, gather and disperse in these three places, especially actively. The hotels, restaurants, and bathhouses in Zhengzhou, Xuchang, and Luohe are known as the "three nos." Looking at the Central Plains from these places, the Central Plains seem to have a sign of prosperity and a vigorous atmosphere. However, if you want to go and take a look ten miles, or even five miles, outside these places: the houses have no complete walls, the residents have a malnourished look, and you will have a feeling of golden jade cities and decaying villages. Counties away from the railway lines have their city gates wide open, and in not many counties, most of the city gates are half open and unguarded early and late. Villagers run to the cities, and city people run to the county governments. At the slightest disturbance, several cries of warblers echo in the night. The Central Plains were a place of four wars during the war, and now they are a place of four chaos.

Three Survey Teams Investigate the Yellow River, The Eighth Route Army Blocks the Way

The Yellow River flooding has become a mystery, and no one can solve this mystery yet. It is said that the Yellow River flooding passed through fifteen counties, from the Huayuankou in Zhengzhou to the junction of Henan and Anhui provinces, with a width of eighty li and a length of more than six hundred li, covering tens of thousands of acres. Each acre produces one dan of wheat, and each dan is calculated at 3,000 yuan, resulting in an annual loss of more than 7.8 million yuan. The Kaifeng newspapers always shout for the control of the river every one or two days, and constantly seek domestic and foreign sages to discuss the grand plan of river control. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission has an unshirkable responsibility for river control, and has sent three survey teams to work along the 1,500 kilometers from Huayuankou to Lijin into the sea. Unexpectedly, they were blocked by the "Eighth Route Army" when they arrived at Kaocheng. Surveying is still a problem, and the Yellow River returning to its old course is even more hopeless. The Yellow River returning to its course is also like a wandering refugee, not only not looking good itself, but also making people uncomfortable. It is said that the fundamental control of the river should start from the upper reaches. Reorganizing Shanghai requires maintaining soil and water, and maintaining soil and water means implementing a greening policy. However, this plan cannot be achieved overnight. Now, it is not easy to control the upper reaches, and it is impossible to return to the old course, so in the end, we still have to repair the embankments in the flood area.

More Than Two Million Righteous People and Refugees Await Assistance

The Henan branch of the Relief Administration has already started working in Kaifeng. They originally had thoughtful plans in Chongqing, but when they arrived in Henan, they faced a dilemma of where to start. It seemed that the prepared lessons were not related to the questions on the final exam. This greatly troubled these kind-hearted people. Inconvenient transportation, and far water cannot quench a near fire, is the main headache for these kind-hearted people.

Of the refugees from Henan scattered in Shaanxi Province, 200,000 will return to their hometowns immediately, and there are still 2 million who cannot return to their hometowns. The Henan Rehabilitation Committee bowed and scraped to the railway bureau, requesting free train rides for refugees returning to their hometowns, and at the same time ran to the military and political leaders, asking them to raise their voices and help these people live in peace.

Self-Defense Flag Presentations and Petitioning for Relief, A Sad Farce

The counties in the Central Plains are busy presenting flags and petitioning for relief. Military and political leaders receive the banners with one hand and the relief with the other, experiencing the pain of not knowing whether to laugh or cry. The people of the Central Plains enthusiastically present flags and petition for relief with tears of sorrow. This duet is not a comedic duet, but a tragic one. Some counties calculate that they have lost more than 3 million yuan in the War of Resistance and ask for relief. When calculated one by one, the loss is indeed this great. However, the central government's 90 million yuan of relief funds for Henan only cover a quarter of the loss!

At the end of last year, the Henan Provincial Assembly held a meeting and launched a major attack on corruption. The provincial government unfortunately lost a batch of files during the relocation in the Central Plains war last year. This batch of files happened to be files on corruption cases. The Provincial Assembly was very dissatisfied with this, and public opinion was in an uproar. I think the provincial government should post a reward in the newspaper to find the lost files.

Large Chimneys in the Central Plains, Plans Are Difficult to Realize

Amidst the ruins and wounds waiting to be rebuilt, enthusiastic nation-builders have launched a wave of building large factories. There are enterprise companies, nation-building companies, and industrial development companies everywhere, with plans everywhere. The capital is all in the range of 50 million to 100 million. The industries included not only spinning and weaving, mining, and oil refining, but even making hemp bags and bricks and tiles. However, the Central Plains are still turbid and chaotic. These plans to erect large chimneys on the plains are still just plans, still just words on paper.

However, the newspaper industry is catching up quickly. There are now as many as thirteen major newspapers in Kaifeng. There are also three major newspapers in Zhengzhou, and it is said that three or four more are in preparation. The motivation for running newspapers is mostly to have something to say after the implementation of constitutional government. Democracy, democracy, the first manifestation of which is broad channels of expression and freedom of public opinion, seems to be qualified. However, I heard that a former puppet county magistrate, a traitor, changed his name and surname and also started a newspaper. This person's intelligence can be described as top-notch, sailing with the wind and heading towards what he considers the road to democracy.

I spoke with Liu Maoen, Chairman of Henan Province, for two hours. He believes that the crisis in Henan is not today, but on the day when the civil war truly breaks out. At the same time, he believes that governing in a crisis requires not relying on luck. This is quite a realistic statement. He also said that the civilian guns in Henan should all be burned, otherwise Henan will be difficult to progress. (Zhengzhou, 16th)

### Rice and Straw in Zhenjiang, It Is Difficult To Buy Even Five Dou or One Dan

— This Newspaper's Express News on the 16th, Tao Tao Reports

"No place is as good as home; the best mountains and rivers, the best springs" (A local Zhenjiang person's saying). Now, let's not discuss whether Zhenjiang's mountains and rivers are "the best," we only need to compare it with Emperor Qianlong's eight-character impression of Zhenjiang, and we can get an understanding. The eight characters are "poor mountains and bad waters, shrewish women and cunning people." However, the so-called "number one in Jiangnan" is certainly based on something, and it is definitely not just random talk. Talking about the landscape, although it has undergone several calamities, the old stubborn diseases are still unscathed. One place is on the hillside of Beigu Mountain, where six large stone bricks, two feet square, are embedded in the wall, engraved with "The Number One Landscape Under Heaven." The other place is opposite the Jintian Temple on Jinshan Mountain, where "The Number One Spring Under Heaven" is located. Visitors here always like to taste the flavor of the spring water.

(Poor mountains and bad waters, it is really not an overstatement) In the eyes of the local Zhenjiang people, it is no wonder that it is worth boasting about. But after Emperor Qianlong's exposure, it seems that Zhenjiang is not worth a penny. "Shrewish women and cunning people," these four words, we can put aside for now, but the four words "poor mountains and bad waters" are really the most appropriate, because Zhenjiang is surrounded by narrow mountain peaks and undulating ridges, except for the side facing the river. And these mountains are all bare, not only are there no forests and trees, but there is not even much grass, because as long as you go one or two feet deep into the soil, it is all large pieces of stone. Looking at these open areas, you can only let them go to waste, how can you not say they are poor mountains? As for talking about the water, it is the Yangtze River with white waves, rolling eastward all day long. Not only can you not get some fish and shrimp, but even firewood and grass are not produced much. If you encounter the tide flooding, you will suffer its threat instead. It doesn't seem to be too much to say that it is a kind of bad water. So, what about Zhenjiang now?

(The Scene is Desolate, People are on the Line of Starvation) I left Zhenjiang and traveled to other places, and it has been exactly ten years. Today, I am revisiting the old place, so everything looks a little different. Especially the ruins of tiles and broken walls after the calamity are really everywhere. These are all gifts of war. Someone has estimated that in this war, among the county towns on the Jinghu Line, Zhenjiang is second only to Nanjing. The public and private houses in the entire city that were destroyed by artillery fire are around 3,000, and they are still left to waste. It is rare for one or two out of a hundred families to be able to restore their old appearance. The area along the river has completely changed its face, with broken walls standing in all directions, providing me with a place to lament. According to the Public Security Bureau's estimate, the total amount of garbage in the entire city is now more than 200,000 tons. Due to the need to improve the appearance and hygiene, I heard that the authorities are planning a method of "work for relief" to completely clean it up, but I don't know when it can be realized. In short, the entire municipal administration is out of the question, the market is extremely desolate, and you can't see any signs of prosperity. The associated problem is that people are also struggling on the line of starvation.

(Rice and Grass Exhaust People, Life is Extremely Difficult) Since the provincial government returned, it has been followed by a forest of institutions. The first thing that is worth hoarding is food and housing, and now, due to the southward migration of people from Jiangbei, it is even more a case of demand exceeding supply. A basic house, although it doesn't require gold bars and banknotes like Shanghai and Nanjing, it still requires a deposit of 100,000 and a broker's fee of around 10,000 to even ask about it. Otherwise, you don't even need to talk about it. If you think it's too expensive and can't afford it, someone else will come. Moreover, in Zhenjiang at this time, it is difficult to find a vacant room. The price of superior rice has crossed the threshold of 30,000 per dan, and firewood and grass are 6,000, and the price is rising sharply. Even if you have US dollars in your pocket, it is difficult to buy five dou of rice or one dan of grass. Not only rice and grass are like this, but even washing and haircuts, if you don't have more than 500 yuan in your pocket, you can't even think about stepping into these doors. Even a glass of plain water is not worth less than 20 yuan. As for hotels, they are always full, and it is difficult to find a room in the evening. Therefore, some travelers, as soon as they get off the train or boat, first have to solve the hotel problem before they can busy themselves with other work, unlike in the old days when hotels sent waiters to "wait for your arrival" at the station or dock. This is because since the incident, the large hotels that were previously located along the river have all been burned down. Now, all the hotels are former second-rate or third-rate establishments, so even if three or four of them are combined, they don't have as many rooms as one former hotel. As things are scarce and expensive, the hotel industry, of course, cannot escape this formula.

(The Road is Rugged, It is Impossible to Walk) Today's Zhenjiang, although not a metropolis or city, the two words "provincial capital" are always unbreakable. In terms of construction and municipal administration, there should be some necessary conditions. However, if we rigorously investigate again, it is not only inferior to Suzhou, but even Wuxi is out of reach. Several yellow sand-paved roads, with a week of strong winds, yellow sand blows in your face, and dust rises up. Walking on them, high and low, makes you feel pain in your feet all the time, giving you the feeling that it is impossible to walk. The cement sidewalks are not non-existent, but they are dilapidated. If you encounter rain, if you are not careful and step into a low place, you can get covered in mud. Daxi Road is the commercial center, which is equivalent to Nanjing Road in Shanghai and Guanqian Street in Suzhou. However, the market is not as prosperous. Every store is desolate and deserted. One reason is the people's weak purchasing power, and the other is that the counties in Jiangbei have fallen into the hands of the Communist army, making Jiangbei, the only target of Zhenjiang's commerce, a dead end. On the whole, there is no retail or wholesale, and the depression has reached its peak. The only industry that is relatively vibrant is the silver shop, which is developing abnormally. This is because almost all counties in Jiangbei now use gold as a chip (because anti-Japanese currency and legal tender cannot circulate), and they can earn profits from buying and selling.

(Entertainment Venues, Filled with Low-Level Taste) Such a large provincial capital, and a major transportation route in and out of Jiangnan and Jiangbei, and with a population of nearly 200,000, there is not a single good entertainment venue. Once it gets dark, the lights are dimmed and extinguished, and there is no night market at all. Although there is a Peking opera theater and another Yangzhou opera, their business is exceptionally quiet. Moreover, the facilities are corrupt, and the performers are inferior, only able to provide entertainment for low-level people. Movie theaters are still lacking. Compared with ten years ago, it has really regressed far. Now, not only can't you see the shadows of hotels and pubs, but even hotels and pubs are not as lively as they were ten years ago. There are not many prostitutes to be seen either. Some people say that you can see a glimpse of the local social and economic situation from these aspects; if this is the case, then we can understand everything else without saying it.

The most famous scenic spots and historical sites in Zhenjiang are, of course, Jinshan and Jiaoshan, but the three temples in the southern suburbs have a unique tranquility, which is a pity that tourists always overlook. Inside, there is the study platform of the Song Dynasty prince and the tiger-running spring with dripping greenery. After the incident, except for the Jinshan Jintian Temple, which was unaffected, the buildings of the First Spring were completely destroyed. Jiaoshan suffered the most damage due to the presence of gun emplacements and was almost completely turned into scorched earth. The three temples in the southern suburbs are no exception. Although the outlines are still there, their faces are completely changed. As for the Ganlu Temple on Beigu Mountain, only the front is still there. As for all the pavilions and towers behind, you can only look for some ruins among those broken tiles and walls, for people to yearn for. Public buildings, such as the police academy, the land bureau, and the meteorological station, some have only empty shells, and some have become open fields, making it difficult to find even traces. Now, if you want to restore all these scenic spots and historical sites and public buildings to their original state, it will probably be difficult to do it within one or two decades. However, it is good to keep the authenticity and keep the original state, which can be left as a kind of lesson for the second generation to see, so that they can strive to become stronger and avoid decadence.

### The Trial of the Great Traitor Will Open Next Month, The Ministry Orders to Allow Filming, Miao Bin Is Indicted

— This Newspaper's News on the 24th, Qingping, Correspondent in Suzhou

Chen Gongbo, a major traitor of the puppet government, has been investigated and concluded by the High Procuratorate, and has been prosecuted on the 18th of this month. Recently, the Central Film Studio sent a special commissioner to Suzhou to negotiate filming because Chen's trial is imminent. After the High Court's request to Ye Zifeng was approved, the High Court has now received instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to allow production. After receiving the order, the High Court has instructed the film studio to come to Suzhou to film on the day of the public trial. In order to be cautious about this case, the High Court has issued 200 audience passes, which will be distributed to reporters from various newspapers and the Suzhou-based journalists and other heads of agencies for use in listening to the trial. According to sources from the court, the trial is scheduled for early April.

Miao Bin, Deputy Dean of the Puppet Legislative Yuan and Examination Yuan, has been investigated several times by Prosecutor Li Shudong of the High Procuratorate, and the investigation has now concluded. The indictment was delivered to the detention center at 6:40 p.m. on the 23rd and handed over to Miao. The accusation records of the indictment of the Jiangsu High Procuratorate are as follows:

"Defendant Miao Bin, male, 44 years old, from Wuxi. Resident of 158 Shaoxing Road, Shanghai. Deputy Dean of the Puppet Examination Yuan."

The case of the right-hand defendant, a traitor in the 35th year of the Republic of China, No. 714, has been investigated and concluded. It is believed that a public prosecution should be filed. The facts and evidence of the crime, as well as the legal articles violated, are listed below:

The defendant, Miao Bin, participated in the Kuomintang work in the 11th year of the Republic of China and served as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province. In the 26th year, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the capital fell, and the National Government moved westward. The enemy's Special Service Department in North China used Wang Kemin to organize a puppet provisional government and established the Xinmin Association. It sent Japanese Yoshino Hiroshi and Yoshimura Torao to Shanghai to seduce speculators to join the association. The defendant was avoiding the war in Shanghai, and was introduced to them through Xu Xiuzhi. He immediately went to Beiping and colluded with enemy chiefs Yamamoto Eiji and Major General Nemoto Hiroshi and Ozawa Kaisei to join the Xinmin Association and serve as the vice president, openly crowding the puppet regime and resisting the central government. Under the enemy's instructions, he founded the Youth Training Institute and served as the director, absorbing youth for use. Later, he echoed enemy chiefs Lieutenant General Ishiwara Kanji and Prince Higashikuni, and launched the East Asia League movement, advocating Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and military cooperation. In January of the 30th year, because his old subordinate Li Changjiang served as the Deputy Commander of the Luyu Guerrilla Force, stationed in Qixian County, after being seduced by the Nanjing puppet government several times without success, Wang Zhaoming managed to win over the defendant as a liaison to go south to contact Li's troops and change sides, betraying the central government. He appointed Li Changjiang as the Commander-in-Chief of the First Group Army of the puppet army, and the defendant also introduced Hao Pengju to be the Chief of Staff of Li's troops. The area of northern Jiangsu fell from then on. Wang then used the position of President of the Legislative Yuan of the puppet government as a reward, and after the defendant took office, he restricted the puppet laws and restricted the people. In August of the following year, he was transferred to Deputy Dean of the puppet Examination Yuan, until the enemy surrendered and the puppet government disintegrated. The General Headquarters of the Army dispatched an investigation room to send the defendant to the court for investigation on March 8. The investigation found that the defendant had gone to Beiping in the winter of the 26th year of the Republic of China, when our country's resistance to Japan was initially unsuccessful, and participated in the puppet Xinmin Association, serving as the Vice President of the Association and the Director of the Youth Training Institute. He also went south in January of the 30th year to take office as the Deputy Dean of the Legislative Yuan and the Examination Yuan of the puppet National Government, and echoed the enemy's advocacy of the East Asia League movement, advocating economic cooperation and military freedom. His collusion with the enemy country to violate the country is undoubtedly true and undeniable. As for the betrayal of Li Changjiang's troops and Hao Pengju's attachment, according to the defendant's confession, Wang Zhaoming had asked him (referring to Li Changjiang) to participate several times, but he refused. He sent someone to Beiping to ask me to guarantee him, and he agreed to participate. Hao Pengju was introduced to Li Changjiang's troops by me. He was originally Hu Zongnan's senior staff officer and escaped. That is also when he began to participate in the alliance and so on. From this observation, it is undoubtedly that Li Changjiang and others were confused by the defendant and participated in the puppet organization. Although the defendant argued that his motivation for participating in the Xinmin Association was to engage in defection work and enter the tiger's den, it was purely empty talk and there were no concrete facts available for investigation. Even his relationship with the Central Military Intelligence Bureau occurred after August of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, when the enemy's Pacific War was repeatedly defeated. It was even more obvious that he was taking advantage of the situation and hoping to avoid punishment. In summary, the defendant's actions violated Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 13 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, and based on Article 1 of the Regulations on Litigation of Special Criminal Cases, and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the public prosecution is filed accordingly, and the case is sent to the criminal court of this court for trial in accordance with the law. This is addressed to the Criminal Court of this Court."

### Iranian Oil Fields: The Soviet Union's Unauthorized Development

Iran possesses abundant oil fields, and its rapid development has transformed it from a medieval, agricultural nation into a modern industrial state. Iranian oil fields have now become a focal point of political discussion, with explicit regulations even prohibiting Iranian officials from discussing oil-related matters with outsiders. An Iranian legislator stated that it is difficult to determine whether Iran's possession of such oil fields is a blessing or a curse. While it is acknowledged that these oil fields can help Iranians secure employment, increase national wealth, and improve living standards, there are deep fears that powers eager to seize oil will turn Iran into a battlefield. Observers in Iran and other countries generally believe that prohibiting Iranian officials from discussing oil issues with foreigners is the only way to prevent major oil companies from attempting to obtain resource rights. This bill was drafted by Iranian parliamentarian Mossadegh and passed by the parliament in 1944. It stipulates that government officials are not allowed to negotiate with foreigners regarding Iranian oil matters, or even "discuss" this issue, before foreign troops are withdrawn, with violators facing an eight-year prison sentence. Supporters of this bill claim that major powers have been corrupting the Iranian government for decades and fear that "oil aggression" will lead to interference in Iran's internal affairs. Iran's potential oil production can be glimpsed from the operations of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. This company is managed by the British, and its Abadan refinery, along with oil transported via pipelines from the Qeshm oil field to Haifa and Tripoli, totaled 10 million tons last year. The company employs 50,000 workers, pays more than 10 million yuan in taxes to the Iranian government annually, and its annual wages and material purchases amount to 20 million yuan. This contribution by the company is particularly significant. In northern Iran, the Soviet Union possesses an oil field located east of Tehran, near Semnan. Before the Soviet revolution, it was managed by individuals, but later it was taken over by the Soviet Kavil Oil Company. Before the war, this oil field supplied the local residents with the fuel oil they needed. The current situation is unknown. It is said that the Soviet Union is developing oil fields in various regions from Azerbaijan to Gorgan. According to geologists, northern Iran contains a huge amount of oil, and local residents have been obtaining crude oil from surface oil pools for medical purposes for centuries. The Armenian Oil Company, which is American-owned, possesses a large number of oil fields along the Soviet border to the Gulf of Oman and the eastern border of Iran. However, because the company was unable to build a pipeline from Khorasan in the north to Chabahar during the war, it abandoned its oil rights. The Soviet Union has huge oil fields and refineries in places such as Krasnovodsk, Baku, and Grozny, all of which are close to the Caspian Sea, with pipelines supplying the Soviet Caspian Fleet with the oil it needs. Many Iranian officials believe that the Soviet military is developing Iranian oil fields without the consent of the Iranian government. (Tehran, 20th)

### Restore Shanghai's Past Prosperity: Quickly Establish a Transportation System

Mr. Editor:

For the sake of life, for the sake of family, for the sake of social order, for the sake of the fundamental conditions under which people should work in the nation-building process, we, the more than 3,000 workers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, have suffered the pain of unemployment for the past five years. During the enemy-puppet era, we endured all kinds of oppression and exploitation. The heavy pressure of life has not eased on our shoulders at all. We fought for life, endured to win the final victory, waited, hoped, and struggled on the starvation line, enduring all kinds of hardships, and got through a long period of difficulty. Last year, on August 15, the news of victory came, the country was restored, the nation was reorganized, the enemy bowed its knees, and we were overjoyed. We secretly rejoiced that repatriation was imminent, but the repatriation of our company was nowhere in sight. We watched as other industries gradually returned to normal work. In the current wave of unemployment, the soaring prices of everything and the pressure of life are unbearable. Now we have to speak out loudly here, hoping that the relevant authorities and people of justice in society will give us their sympathy and assistance from a just standpoint.

In the past, within the British concession area of Shanghai, there were two major transportation businesses, one was trams, and the other was buses. The trams did not stop running, so let's not talk about them for now. As for the buses, since the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8, 1941, when the enemy occupied the concession, the company declared its closure on the pretext of the interruption of diesel supply, and dismissed all employees with suspended pay. At that time, all of our workers understood the situation and fully accepted the company's intentions. However, the so-called consideration for the workers' difficulties and the payment of severance pay by the company were all from our usual public funds and the salary for the last month, totaling more than 150 yuan per person. Just imagine, how could the meager amount we received maintain us for these five years? Although there was no shortage of technical personnel among our workers, there was no place for us to make a living at that time. The proactive ones tried to make a living by setting up shops, while the passive ones had no way to make a living, wandering around in misery. The sadness of the situation is difficult to describe.

Now our request is that Mr. Collie, the person in charge of the company, should quickly return the money owed to us to relieve the suffering of our unemployed workers. We also sincerely request the municipal government that if the British-owned China General Omnibus Company in the former public concession is not allowed to resume operations, our skilled transportation workers should be introduced to work in the municipal bus company. In this way, our suffering can be relieved, and we can once again have the opportunity to serve society. We hope that the authorities will quickly provide assistance or order the person in charge of the company to resume operations in the short term to increase the convenience of transportation in the city. We believe that our practical and well-intentioned requests will receive the sympathy and assistance of all sectors of society. (Representatives of the former British-owned China General Omnibus Company, Han Yangqi, etc., March 17.)

### Uniforms Should Be Prescribed Immediately

Mr. Editor: Since the founding of the Republic of China, the styles and materials to be used for men's and women's clothing and wedding and funeral ceremonies have not been officially announced and implemented. As a result, people have adopted European styles, using foreign products and styles as beautiful. As a result, China's original silk fabrics and various products have been discarded and unused, which is a loophole in our country's economy. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and construction is about to begin, the promotion of domestic products should not be taken lightly again. Explicit regulations should be made for men's and women's clothing, so that manufacturers can manufacture accordingly. Because of the eight years of the War of Resistance, most of the people's original clothing has been lost or damaged, so those who need to buy new clothes can purchase them according to the prescribed styles and materials, so that after a few years, they can be gradually changed into a uniform "Great Republic of China Clothing Style", avoiding the current absurdity and foreign-made free clothing. If the government can order civil servants of various agencies to implement it first, and gradually extend it to schools, factories, merchants, and people, it will be successful and beneficial to the national system and economy. I am particularly concerned because I see that most people boast about foreign products every day. I wonder if you agree? (Jiang Yifeng, March 19)

### Two Programs of the Political Consultative Council

— Special Correspondent Zhao Haosheng from Chongqing

Transportation Issues

The first program of the Political Consultative Council was a report on transportation. Before it started, Shao Lizi announced that Yin Shuxian and others had a temporary motion, asking for everyone's opinion: "Should we read it out?" The audience shouted: "Don't read it!"

Minister Yu was tall and large, but his voice was very light and gentle. The report on railways included both records of demolition and repair. The Minister, who was barely able to eat enough, sighed that he felt very sorry for this industry. Democracy requires everyone to keep their promises. The decision of the "Transportation Recovery" three-person group has not been widely implemented.

Speaking of air transport, Minister Yu said that the Ministry of Transport has now bought six C54 passenger planes from the United States, which are the large aircraft with four engines used by Special Envoy Marshall. The equipment inside is very comfortable. They can come in by the end of June. The Ministry of Transport will increase the number of routes to Southeast Asia.

In Minister Yu's report, he described the hard work of various departments and finally said: If I were not the Minister of Transport, I would also criticize the Ministry of Transport.

Some people said that the Ministry of Transport's report had already been used at the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee and is now "submitted twice."

After the report ended, questions flew towards the Secretary-General's seat like snowflakes. Three people took turns reading them aloud on the podium. Two of them had Beijing accents, and one spoke Zhejiang Mandarin. There were a total of sixty-one questions. The repetitive cycle of reading aloud took two hours, which was a visual "fatigue bombing."

The text, tone, and form of the written questions varied. The concluding sentence was: "May I ask what your Minister will do?" Some said, "Please reply!" Luo Heng's was completely colloquial: "Does Minister Yu know?"

Zhao Shu said that to buy plane tickets in Kunming, you need "face" and "lining." "Lining" means "silver."

Xue Mingjian said that the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) was full of malpractices. He asked Minister Yu if he knew that they were carrying private goods in the lower deck of the plane.

Ma Yuan asked: Where did He Jingwu, the director of the Anbei Highway Administration, who was reliably corrupt, go after being "summoned"?

Wang Shanhan said that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has become a bureaucratic enterprise. Before the war, it could not share navigation rights with foreign ships, and after the war, it did not contribute as much as private companies. Why were so many ships divided up during repatriation?

After the first question, Zhai Xuelu always faced Minister Yu and said: If Minister Yu has not heard of this, he is derelict in his duty. If he knows but does not deal with it, he is letting down the people. He said that the Nanjing Communications Bureau forcibly occupied the houses of the Central Revolutionary Relics Administration Bureau on the grounds that communications matters were important. He asked Minister Yu: Is cultural undertaking important? After speaking, he personally gave Minister Yu a slip of paper with questions.

Kong Geng's question said: The Communist Party has established "War Road Management Bureaus" everywhere. Are they under the command of the Ministry of Transport? This caused a burst of laughter.

Zhang Shouyue said: Seeing that the Communist Party has appointed so many railway bureau chiefs, I really don't know what was agreed in the political consultation rumors?

Many councilors stood in front of their seats to speak, and there was a loud shout in the hall: "Go up!" - meaning go to the podium with the microphone.

Most of the councilors were eloquent. At the first meeting, they were just testing the waters. (21st)

Economic Issues

The meeting started at eight o'clock, which was a bit too early. People couldn't make it in time, so it was naturally extended by half an hour. The meeting place was rearranged again. After everyone took a turn in the cloakroom, they began to rush to find seats.

Minister Yu arrived very early and sat alone on the bench for officials, quietly pondering the contents of his report.

Chairman Jiang Xi asked that both reports and questions should be "brief!" So as not to drag on until the end, and there would be no time for the responsible officials to give an impromptu thank you.

Minister Yu's report was still the same as the one at the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, but he expressed at the beginning that after eight years of the War of Resistance, now that victory has been achieved, he would like to resign from the government and take a rest.

His report said that Shanghai alone received usable enemy and puppet materials worth 30 million yuan - just a "dry" number.

He specifically mentioned in his report that the "Company Law" will be promulgated soon, and there will be no need to waste any more words on the issue of state-owned and private operations in the future.

Following the report, a series of numbers came, and the staff of the Secretariat went back and forth to the Chairman to send fifty-three face-to-face inquiries.

The written questions revolved around the issue of "takeover", and the rest were about Shanghai prices. The one that attracted the most applause was: "The industrial and mining resources of the Northeast have been plundered by the Soviet Union. What should we do?"

"Taking over" became "stopping", which was the slogan in the speech of the first speaker, Su Lian.

The China Textile Company (CTC) was attacked with concentrated fire. Zhu Huiqing said: Among the prices in Shanghai, the price of cotton yarn rose the highest - 12 times. The CTC's daily listing is "leading the price increase!"

Wu Zhaoxu said that he could not hear what the entire economic policy was in Minister Weng's report.

Wang Hansheng's Northeast dialect was the most moving. He said that the Northeast has more than 80% of the country's railways and is the best area to develop heavy industry. He questioned the results of the Sino-Soviet economic negotiations. He shouted loudly that the Northeast we want to take over is a complete Northeast in the sky, on the ground, on the water, and underground. Before the Soviet army has fully withdrawn, no economic negotiations can be held. Finally, he asked: How did Zhang Huafu die? Wang's speech created the heaviest atmosphere in the entire hall, and the applause lasted for a long time.

Leng Ran also scolded the CTC - how could a package of cotton yarn that costs less than 500,000 yuan be priced at 1.2 million yuan?

Wu Jingji "looked at Jiangnan", mostly chimneys that did not emit smoke. He spoke urgently and called "Minister Weng" "Minister Yu".

Liu Yiru said: "Are the receiving personnel and the economic dolls flirting and colluding with each other? Does Minister Yu know?"

When the questioning reached twelve o'clock, Wu Jingji proposed to set another time for Minister Weng to make an oral reply. Shao Lizi said that the 14th session was a legal matter and could not be extended. Zhang Bangzhen shouted to move the review committee's time to the evening. Increasing the oral reply was approved by applause from the whole hall. (22nd)

### Sculpture Class in an American Art School

Inside the sculpture class of an American art school, male and female students are practicing clay modeling and wood carving, with expressions as picturesque. Some of the students are army and navy personnel stationed nearby, who take advantage of their spare time to seek further education. Although the United States does not have ancient art heritages, there are more than 500 art schools in the country, most of which are located in New York State in the east and California in the west. In recent decades, they have cultivated a considerable number of famous artists and sculptors. The largest cities in the country have about 600 museums, most of which have specialized art departments, and many larger cities also have gallery facilities. Millions of Americans from all walks of life have visited the international art exhibitions at the New York City World's Fair between 1939 and 1940. People in rural areas can have the opportunity to appreciate art works in traveling art exhibitions. Even during wartime, art has played an important role in the United States, because military personnel suffering from the psychological pain of war can use art as a spiritual therapeutic comfort.

### The Blank of Life

— Yang Tongfang

The great thinker Wells said: "The process of a person's life is like a blank notebook. Originally there was not a word on it, but when people write words on it, it becomes his history."

From these few words, we understand the true meaning of life. What we are born with is nothing, just like a blank notebook, without any meaning. However, through people's learning, thinking, creation, and work, the blank life history is written into brilliant words.

I feel that from birth to death, a person must pursue a meaningful life, so that every page of the blank life history is written very richly. If you live in peace and waste your time, treating life as something insignificant, it is simply destroying life, destroying life, and wasting the blank in the life history. People like this must give up on themselves and refuse to stimulate the courage of life, and refuse to strive for the value of life. They live their lives in a muddle, and then die in a muddle. Their blank life history still remains blank, as if they have never lived in the world.

If we want to live a conscious life, a meaningful life, we should add more brilliance to the entire life process. Even if we cannot live a spectacular life, we should not die with the blank of the life history completely left blank. Romain Rolland said: "Life is a battle." We cannot stop fighting on the battlefield of life for a moment. Facing the reality and moving forward bravely will surely guarantee success. Decadence and inaction will only make the flowers of life wither day by day. The great British writer Stevenson, with his weak body, never gave up the courage of life. He fought against the disease all his life, and was able to complete his rich literary career, leaving behind an immortal literary heritage. There is nothing in the world more worthy of praise than people who are constantly struggling with real life.

People who can constantly struggle with real life are warriors on the "battlefield of life". Even if they cannot establish any great achievements, at least they can avoid making the blank of the life history forever blank.

People who truly recognize the value of life must make their lives meaningful and fill the blank in the life history with very rich and substantial information. This is also their history. Such a life can avoid being wasted in vain, because he has fulfilled his responsibility as a human being and shouldered the burden of life. Even in death, there is no regret.

Remember: We must raise the ideals of life. A mediocre life, a life of living in peace, is not worth living. We must fill the life history with various activities such as learning, thinking, creation, and work, and strive to make the blank in each page of the life history more and more substantial, more and more brilliant, more and more sublime and great, and more and more solemn and magnificent!

### The Commoner Huang Xuchu

— Chen Shan

Everyone knows that Guangxi is a model province famous at home and abroad, and it has made a particularly large contribution to this War of Resistance.

Mr. Huang Xuchu, the chairman of Guangxi Province, is very commoner. He usually wears a Zhongshan suit. From a distance, he looks like a middle school student. He never carries a guard with him. He always walks when he goes out, unless it is a long distance that he takes a car. When he walks, his hands swing rhythmically, appearing very free and easy.

Not only is he like this personally, but his family is also very commoner. Once, Mr. Yu Qingtang, the current director of the Municipal Social Education Office, went to see him. Guess who answered the door? It was his old father. All the chores in his family are also taken care of by his wife. He is very busy every day, and he has to ride his bicycle to the street to buy groceries every morning. Because although they hired a little maid to take care of their daughter, when she goes to school, the little maid also has to carry her schoolbag to go to school, because Guangxi is enforcing compulsory national education.

Aviation

### The Achievements of Liaison Aircraft

— Wu Ji

We often hear stories of the many meritorious achievements of American bombers and fighters dispatched to the war zones of China, Burma, and India amidst hardship and danger. However, few know that there is another type of aircraft called the "Liaison Transport Team," which has also created many astonishing feats in this war. These light, small aircraft, unarmed and painted olive green, carry brave soldiers dedicated to delivering messages and transporting supplies, appearing and disappearing on the battlefield.

This type of aircraft is named the "L-5" model, also known as the "liaison aircraft." The pilots are all soldiers already assigned to the unit. Although the aircraft is small, its mission is greater than that of larger aircraft. They carry many letters to places that others cannot reach—even where radio waves cannot reach. They can soar over war zones, obtain accurate intelligence from the front lines amidst intense artillery fire, and quickly report back to headquarters for operational reference. Sometimes they are sent to search for or rescue downed airmen or dying soldiers in the blazing sun.

This aircraft is a single-wing, small aircraft with only one pilot, one communicator, one receiver, and two hundred pounds of goods to be transported inside. It can continue flying for three hours. The interior is very simple, without the complex equipment of other transport aircraft or the complicated mechanisms of other fighter aircraft, truly deserving the praise of being "small and exquisite." It is not only easy to take off but also capable of landing leisurely in very small spaces.

India-Burma Campaign

In the communication of the Burma and India campaigns, this small aircraft fully performed extremely important tasks. A certain senior American military officer said upon returning to his country after the war: "We fought in the jungles of Burma, and without this small 'liaison transport' aircraft, we could not have been so successful. This little thing is truly invaluable!"

In Burma, in fact, the large C47 transport aircraft only did large-scale transport work, while the "L-5" did the liaison transport work in various war zones. This type of work is useless for large aircraft. In addition to encountering grasslands smaller than a small ball field, liaison aircraft can take off and land at will with goods. They used hooks to hang many packages under their silver wings and dropped them with parachutes into bombed areas, allowing the troops on the ground to receive ample supplies. Someone once said: "An L-5 pilot's ability to drop packages is more accurate than a bomber's bombardier's ability to drop bombs."

Flying Jeep

Because it is a small "flying jeep" and its speed is relatively slow, they must undergo risky low-altitude flight training. They often fly this aircraft over the treetops, just skimming over the undulating treetops. It is extremely difficult for the Japanese artillery fire on the ground to hit them. Many aircraft dispatched to scout in forests occupied by the enemy often bring back bullet holes on their fuselages, but pilots are rarely injured by them.

If a "liaison aircraft" is forced to land due to inclement weather but cannot return to base for a while, a ball field can be used for the aircraft to land; however, after landing, it must be disassembled and towed out by truck.

This L-5 type aircraft has a speed of fifty-two miles per hour and can reach a maximum speed of one hundred miles per hour. When necessary, this 185-horsepower engine can raise the aircraft to an altitude of 16,000 feet.

This L-5 type aircraft has already achieved significant results in the war. Although it is not tasked with bombing or combat, it can save the lives of countless soldiers and continuously supply many necessities for combat in difficult conditions. These contributions are enough for it to be proud of.

### A Fine Tale of Military Mail

— Meng Shuzu

At the start of the War of Resistance, the Directorate General of Posts established military post offices to accompany the army, serving amidst the chaos of artillery fire. The spirit of adventure and resilience of the postal workers was initially no less than that of the armed officers and soldiers.

In the spring of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], the Military Affairs Commission organized an expeditionary force to fight alongside its allies, earning great merit and truly deserving a place as the most glorious page in the entire history of the War of Resistance. In order to commemorate the War of Resistance and comfort the officers and soldiers at the front, the Directorate General of Posts specially printed a type of "military mail" stamp: made in a light reddish-blood color, depicting two aircraft, three soldiers, and one officer, with sandbags stacked, deep trenches, and barbed wire faintly visible in the left corner, truly a microcosm of a "current battlefield."

This "military mail" was given to combat officers and soldiers free of charge, with only three stamps per person per month, and was not sold by the post office. The stamp had no set price, so the soldiers called it an "invaluable treasure," cherishing it like jade, and only using it sparingly to send letters to girlfriends, adding a fine tale to the history of the world's post.

In the spring of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946], due to printing difficulties, the allocation of "military mail" was discontinued. At one point, stamp collectors began to collect them en masse, and the price even reached fifty cents in US dollars, the same price as the black market for the relief refugee surcharge stamps issued at the same time.

Now that the War of Resistance has been won, this meaningful "military mail" has increased its "historical" value even more, and is not only regarded as a "souvenir."

Psychology

### Do Not Doubt Yourself

— Yang Congjun

Recently, it was reported that a White Russian girl, who owned considerable assets at home, had lived in this port for many years. Eight years ago, she suddenly contracted a strange disease and could not get out of bed, with her feet paralyzed. She spent many years of her life in bed like this. It is said that she did not feel any pain, just unable to walk. Not long ago, an American military doctor treated her; after a thorough examination, it was proven that her serious illness had already healed due to rest, and the spasms in her feet had also recovered. If she immediately got out of bed and tried, she would not feel any discomfort. When the military doctor told her that her illness had been cured, she did not fully believe it at first, expressing great surprise, because many doctors had told her to rest for several more years and take considerable medication before she could be cured, but the military doctor said that her getting out of bed and walking was no longer a problem. Wasn't this a question? The next day, she followed the American military doctor's advice, asking someone to help her take a step, and indeed, there were no obstacles. She just felt some apprehension in her heart, fearing that she would stumble. After trying this for several days, her steps were very stable, and she could walk steadily without help. After a week, she was able to walk freely like a normal person without any inconvenience.

It is said that the American military doctor who cured the White Russian girl's strange disease was very knowledgeable in psychiatry. When diagnosing the girl's illness, he was able to grasp the psychological factors of the disease, so he did not need medication and was able to cure a patient who had been bedridden for many years. This may seem like a miracle, but in fact, there are many similar situations, but they have not been noticed. The severity of the White Russian girl's initial illness may not be ignored, and her inability to walk without a long period of rest may be an absolute fact, but it is undeniable that the long period of not getting out of bed caused all kinds of fears, so that she was unwilling to get out of bed and try, and dared not get out of bed and try. If she had been able to bravely try to walk when she realized that her condition had improved, she would probably have returned to normal long ago and would not have suffered the blow to her body and mind.

From this, I think of many people who lose the happiness of life because they doubt themselves. They need happiness, but they are unwilling to walk the path to happiness. They need health, but they are unwilling to seize the opportunity to gain health. They themselves squander the happiness and health they deserve in vain, and instead become discouraged, disheartened, and even pessimistic and disappointed because they cannot obtain happiness and health. The reason why they produce these bad results can be said to be entirely because of doubting themselves and not believing in themselves. In books and newspapers about mental health published in the United States, such examples can be found everywhere, and there are also similar examples in our society. As long as we pay attention to thinking about it, we will definitely be surprised by how many people sacrifice happiness due to doubt and fear!

Symonds investigated a mental patient who suffered from mental illness with paralysis of his hands and feet after experiencing extreme fright. Sometimes his hands and feet could hardly move for three months. Later, he was cured by a doctor, proving that the symptoms were completely eliminated. However, because he could not always avoid doubt and fear, it recurred and was even more severe than before. One day, he went to a dance hall in New York to participate in dancing. In the midst of joy and excitement, he released all his doubts and danced gracefully with his partner, completely no different from ordinary people. When he returned home, his wife asked him: "You went to a dance party today. Have you forgotten about the paralysis of your hands and feet?" Only then did he realize his usual psychological fright—the inconvenience of muscle reflexes caused by worry and doubt. People say that dancing cured him, but in fact, his illness lay in doubt. Once the doubt was gone, the bodily functions would immediately recover.

The Psychology Research Laboratory at the University of Ottawa conducted an experiment. Professor Werr experimented with two groups of white mice, one group allowed to rest quietly and the other group subjected to all kinds of fright. The results produced different effects, proving that psychological disturbance and palpitations can become the main cause of disease. Someone said to a child: "Turn around and I will stab you with a very sharp needle." The person only used his finger to strike the child's back, and the child cried out in fear. The person said: "I won't stab you anymore. I stabbed you a few times and it's already bleeding." The child thought that blood had really come out on his back and cried out in distress. This story also illustrates the influence of psychology on physiology. A British psychologist once said: "There is no real current, but the power of suggestion can be used to cause a person to faint or even die."

There are many people who are originally healthy, but become ill because of doubt. I know a person who often doubts himself, thinking that he is plagued by demons. All year round, he thinks of nothing else but illness. Sometimes he actually gets sick because he thinks about it and suspects it, but his illness is not physiological, so it naturally gets better after a day or two. When he is sick, he goes to see a doctor, but the doctor cannot find his symptoms. However, he himself is indeed sick. Conversely, there are also people who occasionally suffer from minor illnesses, but do not take them to heart and continue to do their own things. Because they hold this attitude of "forgetting the illness," their health quickly recovers. In certain circumstances, "forgetting the illness" is indeed a way to cure the illness.

There are also many people who have good abilities in learning and doing things, and are very talented, but because they are too doubtful and have too many concerns, they never believe in themselves, resulting in very few achievements. If you can not doubt yourself, face reality with a humble attitude and persevering spirit, let out your courage, and try bravely, you may believe that you are still a competitor, speaker, musician, dancer, scientist, writer, dramatist, or one of the other experts. Those who dare to try may have success starting from this one try. I have a friend who took the exam to study in the United States the day before yesterday and ranked among the best. According to him, I took this exam entirely because of the encouragement of his aunt and father, who repeatedly encouraged him and persuaded him, and he agreed to give it a try. In terms of his academic ability, he could have taken the exam long ago, but at first he doubted himself very much, thinking that even if he passed the course by fluke, he might not have enough physical strength, or he might be eliminated because he had no relationship with the examination authority. What he was worried about and thought about was "failing the exam," and he did not think about "passing the exam" and "passing the exam very well." If no one had encouraged him and persuaded him this time, he would have missed the opportunity to study abroad in doubt again. Duncan discovered that she was a promising dancer at a chance party, and the audience also discovered that she was a talented artist.

Many geniuses gain their confidence in their efforts from "accidentally trying and succeeding." Before the "accidental try," even if someone tells him that he will definitely succeed in the future, he will not fully believe it. This is very much influenced by an inferiority complex. "Accidental try" seems to be not easy, because it requires self-confidence and courage, but many people have buried their talents forever because they doubt too much and have too many concerns!

I hope that everyone will get rid of doubt and build self-confidence from now on. For things you want to do, you may as well bravely try them immediately. The foundation for future academic and career success may be in this one try. Moreover, the sooner we try, the better, because we can let ourselves understand ourselves sooner!

### The First Pass Under Heaven

— Chen Yanfan

It has been a week since I arrived at Shanhaiguan. After settling down, it snowed heavily like pouring for the first two days. Before two or three days passed, the accumulated snow had not melted, and today it snowed all day again. According to the locals, it has been many years since such a heavy snowfall has been seen. Shanhaiguan has two middle schools. Tian's Middle School, in front of "The First Pass Under Heaven," is one of the only two middle schools. When I had free time, I visited the two schools, and the students were between seven and eight hundred. There are more than a dozen elementary schools here, which is much stronger than the surrounding areas in this respect. An old principal of Shanhaiguan Elementary School, a county school, told me: "Shanhaiguan is located in a strategic location and has always been a passage for transportation between the Northeast and the South. Therefore, although the Northeast was occupied for fourteen years and the war of resistance inside the pass lasted for eight years, it was not within the scope of Manchukuo, but it experienced fourteen years of suffering like the Northeast." He also said that during the time of Manchukuo, going from here to the Northeast was simply an unbearable torment. There were more than twenty Japanese and Manchukuo and other inspection agencies at the station here, all the way to the station ahead. Therefore, it was common for travelers going to or returning from the Northeast to be unable to pass for five or six days. As a result, many people ran out of travel expenses and wandered around begging. Such suffering is truly difficult to describe in words. Shanhaiguan Elementary School and Tian's Middle School both have a history of thirty or forty years, which shows that people here are quite serious about running schools, and many people have devoted their entire lives to it. The other day, when I went to Shanhaiguan Elementary School, their principal asked me to say a few words to the students, because those who were listening were all children in their teens, and it was not easy for them to understand the Southern Mandarin accent, so I only spoke some simple and clear words, and also told them a little about the current situation in the Northeast.

The place where I live is Dongjie, so as soon as I go out the door, I can see the famous "First Pass Under Heaven" city tower. The streets here are not very lively, especially after it has snowed for several days in a row. There is simply no trace of people in front of the majestic First Pass Under Heaven. But on the road to Nanguan, there are quite a few shops and foreign buildings, and they look a bit like Suzhou. The difference is that the cars passing by are all "big cars," carrying firewood and miscellaneous grain. Although there are also rickshaws, most of them stay at the train station to pull passengers. There is only one train a day going south and north on the Beining Road, so rickshaws are rarely seen on the streets at ordinary times. The cheap things here are pears, red dates, and walnuts. Pears are 100 yuan a catty in legal tender, which is less than 10 yuan in circulation coupons. Dates and walnuts are all produced nearby, so they are more than half cheaper than in Shanghai.

### Letter

Dear Sir: There is a child named Chen Le Er, aged seventeen, suffering from a spinal area disease, who was transferred from the Pediatrics Department of Jiangwan Chengzhong Hospital, Mrs. Ke Ninghan Memorial Hall, to the International Second Shelter, namely the Second Hospital of the Refugee Relief Association, on August 19, 1938. Because the hospital has long been dissolved, the whereabouts of the child are unknown. Now his parents are eagerly hoping for their son, and entrusted us to investigate. Therefore, we specially prepare a letter to ask your newspaper to publish it. If any charity group shelters the child or has ordered him to learn other professions, those who know the details, please immediately inform our association so that we can convey the information to reunite the family, which will be immeasurable merit. Our association is in charge of child care, and we will be deeply grateful. Sincerely, Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association to Shenbao Social Services Department.
