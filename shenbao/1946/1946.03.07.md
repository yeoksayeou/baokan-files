### French Troops Forcibly Land at Haiphong, Clash with Our Garrison; China, America, and France Send Personnel to Investigate On-Site

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 6th] China and France agreed on the 6th on the method for French troops to take over the defense of Northern Vietnam. From the 7th, French troops can land in Northern Vietnam, but they are not allowed to carry weapons, and their lodging locations will be designated and protected by us. Starting from the 16th, we will formally hand over the defense of Northern Vietnam to the French. Furthermore, the Franco-Vietnamese negotiations concluded at 6 PM on the 6th. At 4:01 PM, Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Vietnam, and Sainteny, the French Commissioner for Northern Vietnam, signed the Franco-Vietnamese agreement, which consists of six points. China and the United States were invited by both France and Vietnam to be present at the signing.

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 6th] While the French side in Northern Vietnam was discussing technical issues regarding the handover of defense with us, they suddenly used five warships to forcibly land at Haiphong late on the 5th and shelled our port garrison, resulting in a clash. The conflict only stopped at noon on the 6th, with the French warships withdrawing from the port. One of our ammunition depots was hit and caught fire, resulting in over ten casualties on our side and six injuries on the French side. After the Sino-French agreement was signed on February 28th, our authorities here received orders on March 4th to negotiate technical issues regarding the handover of defense with the French. Upon learning that a batch of French troops would land at Haiphong on the 6th, both sides, citing insufficient preparation for the handover, decided to postpone the landing date to the 7th. Unexpectedly, the French side disregarded the agreement and landed ahead of schedule, and then opened fire despite our garrison's warning, leading to this unfortunate incident. After the incident, the investigation personnel from China, America, and France who went to Haiphong had not yet returned here as of 6 PM.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Regarding the restoration of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, it is reported that 150 kilometers of track between Mengzi and Lao Cai on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway were dismantled and moved. The Ministry of Communications is currently formulating a construction plan, and the collected materials are sufficient to lay 50 kilometers. This project will start from Hekou, so that the materials used for mine exploitation can be transported from abroad in the future.

The new Sino-French agreement was signed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the wartime capital on February 28th. The photo shows Foreign Minister Wang Shijie signing the agreement, with French Ambassador Meyrier sitting opposite him.

### No Country Other Than China Has the Right to Remove Northeastern Resources; British Foreign Secretary Bevin States in the House of Commons

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 6th Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in the House of Commons today: "Regarding the disposal of Japanese factories and machinery in Manchuria, the British government believes that the disposal of Japanese industries should be decided by the governments of all countries that can obtain compensation from Japan. Before this decision is obtained, all Japanese industries and resources should be temporarily kept in custody by the government where the industries are located." Subsequently, Member of Parliament Davies inquired to Bevin: "Does any government other than the Chinese government have the right to remove resources from Chinese territory?" Bevin replied: "There is no treaty under heaven that grants such rights to any country other than China."

[Central News Agency, London, 4th] The British House of Commons convened tonight, and members raised questions about the secret clauses of the Yalta Agreement regarding Northeast China. The atmosphere was quite agitated at the time. Davis, the leader of the Liberal-Constitutional Party, asked whether the British government considered itself bound by this Yalta Agreement. Minister of State Baker replied: Yes, it is bound by it. Davis then asked: Under what agreement was the removal of industrial machinery in Northeast China based? Baker then consulted with Prime Minister Attlee but did not immediately provide an answer. He said: If this inquiry is submitted in writing, a reply may be obtained in the future.

[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 6th Broadcast: Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Kai stated today: China is "constantly" urging the Soviet army to withdraw from the Northeast and has clarified China's position to Moscow. Liu confirmed the news that the Soviet Union had removed industrial machinery from the Northeast but neither confirmed nor denied whether the central government had protested to the Soviet Union about this matter. He said: Foreign Minister Wang has clarified China's position, that all Japanese and puppet assets must be regarded as part of the compensation paid to China. This view is inconsistent with the Soviet Union's position that these assets should be treated as Soviet war booty.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] A foreign journalist reception was held at 3 PM on the 6th, hosted by Minister Wu Guozhen and Vice Minister Liu Kai. The following is a record of the main questions and answers:

Question: The US government has requested China to inform the US of the situation of the Northeast negotiations at any time. Has the Chinese government replied?

Answer: The Chinese government has replied to the US government.

Question: Since February 1st, has the Chinese government received any documents from the Soviet side regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops?

Answer: The Soviet authorities have informed our country that the delay in the withdrawal of Soviet troops is due to technical difficulties, but they have not specified what kind of technical difficulties.

Question: What is the situation of the takeover of Lushun and Dalian?

Answer: The issue of Lushun and Dalian is related to the entire takeover of the Northeast.

### The Soviet Union's Demands for Northeastern Industries; Our Government Cannot Agree; Reply to the United States Declares that the Soviet Union is Exceeding its Scope

[US News Agency, Washington, 5th] The State Department issued the following statement today: On February 9, 1946, Secretary of State Byrnes instructed the US Embassies in Chongqing and Moscow to present notes to the Chinese and Soviet governments, clarifying the US view, which reads as follows: Recently, it has been reported that officials of the Chinese and Soviet governments have been holding consultations on the disposal and takeover of industries in Manchuria. The US government is very concerned about this. The Sino-Soviet Treaty signed on August 14, 1945, stipulated that China and the Soviet Union would jointly manage certain railway trunk lines in the Manchurian region. However, this agreement did not include the specification that Manchurian industries would also be placed under joint management. The US government has been constantly receiving reports on the progress of the aforementioned negotiations, up to the point when both parties accepted this agreement in August 1945. The US government believes that the joint management of Manchurian enterprises by the Chinese and Soviet governments should be limited to the railways related to the aforementioned agreement. Therefore, the US government has received reports that the parties are currently conducting negotiations. The US government is deeply concerned about these reports, the result of which may be the realization of joint Sino-Soviet management of Manchurian industries.

The US Will Propose Allocating Japanese Overseas Assets

Under the current circumstances, when people of other nationalities have not gained the freedom to enter Manchuria, and the people of the US and other allied countries have not obtained equal opportunities to participate in the economic development of Manchuria, the US government feels that such negotiations held by the Chinese and Soviet governments regarding Manchurian industries are contrary to the Open Door Policy. This will cause obvious discrimination to US personnel who are willing to participate in the development of Manchurian industries, and it will place US merchants who establish trade relations with Manchuria in a significantly disadvantageous position. Directly related to the issue of Manchurian industries is the issue of reparations policy toward Japan, because before Japan's defeat, the industries of Manchuria were mostly in the hands of the Japanese. The US government believes that the final disposal of Japanese overseas assets, such as Manchurian industries, is a matter of common interest and concern for all allied countries that bear the main responsibility for defeating Japan. The US government is now preparing a broad policy outline regarding Japanese reparations, which will soon be submitted to the governments concerned for consideration. This policy will recommend the establishment of an Allied Committee to seek reparations from Japan. This committee will make the final allocation of Japan's overseas assets among the countries that have made requests. Therefore, it is inappropriate to make a final disposal of Japanese assets in Manchuria at this time, whether it is the removal of industrial assets from Manchuria as "war booty" or the establishment of control over the ownership of the aforementioned assets by the Chinese and Soviet governments.

The US government is willing to cooperate with the Chinese and Soviet governments to find a solution to the above-mentioned problems, and hopes that the other two governments can show the same spirit of cooperation. The US government would be grateful if it could be informed of the progress of the Sino-Soviet negotiations or the actions they are about to take regarding the disposal or control of Manchurian industries. We would welcome a frank and full discussion of general issues.

Byrnes Announces Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Reply

Secretary of State Byrnes announced today that he had received a reply from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the gist of which is as follows: In its memorandum submitted to the Chinese government on January 21, 1946, the Soviet government declared that all Japanese enterprises in the northeastern provinces of China that had served the Japanese army were considered by the Soviet Union to be war booty of the Soviet army. The Chinese government believes that this request from the Soviet government far exceeds the scope of war booty recognized by international law or international practice. Therefore, the two governments have not been able to reach a consensus on the relevant basic principles. In another memorandum submitted to Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters in Changchun, the Soviet government declared that it intended to transfer part of the Japanese industries that the Soviet Union considered war booty to China, but the remaining enterprises, including designated coal mines, power plants, steel plants, chemical industries, and the Shuifeng hydroelectric plant, should be jointly operated by China and the Soviet Union. The Chinese government feels that it cannot agree to this Soviet proposal because it exceeds the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 14, 1945, and conflicts with the position taken by the Chinese government regarding Japanese industries and enterprises in China.

### Prelude to Soviet Military Exercises; Tanks Crawl Through Changchun City; Troop Strength in the Northeast Increases to 600,000

[Report from this Newspaper, Changchun, 5th] Various signs indicate that Soviet troops in the Northeast will not withdraw before May of this year. The attention they previously paid to the Political Consultative Conference has now turned to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and the upcoming Political Participation Council to be held on March 20th. Not only that, but they also personally want to see what the National Assembly to be convened by us on May 5th is all about. In conversations, Soviet officers and soldiers often reveal their concern for the evolution of our internal affairs. Government personnel from the interior and the general public generally refer to the central government as "Zhong Yang," while the Soviet army directly calls it the Kuomintang. Although this is a small detail, it is enough to reflect the callers' views on our domestic politics. The Soviet army here will soon hold combat exercises. Huge tanks, never seen before, often crawl through the city in teams. Some of the Communist personnel who previously withdrew from the city have now returned to the Changchun-Changtu railway area. Armed railway troops ride freely by car and often check passengers. On the contrary, the security forces that were airlifted to Changchun a month ago are still confined to their barracks, leading a dull life as out-of-town troops. The newspapers in Changchun were originally ordered not to publish articles attacking the National Government or harming Sino-Soviet relations. At present, this kind of ban has been abolished in a sense. Articles and texts criticizing the National Government have been published frequently in recent months, and some have been published twice. All of this is enough to illustrate that the situation in the Northeast is deteriorating.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 6th] Yishi Bao reports: The Soviet Union continues to increase its troops in Northeast China, and its troop strength has now reached 600,000, doubling its original strength. The Soviet army is building airfields, military facilities, and new naval bases in Lushun and Dalian.

[United Press, Beiping, 6th] Observers here believe that the tense situation in the Northeast, due to General Xiong Shihui, Director of Chiang Kai-shek's Northeast Headquarters, going to Jinzhou, foreshadows new developments. Headquarters staff members are accompanying General Xiong. It is noted that General Xiong Shihui has stayed in Beiping for a considerable period of time, during which the Sino-Soviet negotiations on the Northeast issue have stalled.

### Soviet Union Notifies Harbin Municipal Government to Prohibit Two Matters

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 5th] The Municipal Government recently received a notification from the Soviet side, requesting that the following two matters be prohibited in the Harbin urban area: (1) All folk gatherings and societies that have not been permitted should be ordered to stop immediately. (2) If offbeat leaflets are found, they should be immediately banned, and the distributors and printers should be arrested and brought to justice. It is noted that leaflets requesting the Soviet Union to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance have been found in Harbin.

### Zhang Zhizhong to be Transferred; Director of the Northwest Headquarters

Some of Zhang's old subordinates in Beijing have already been ordered to prepare to work in Xinjiang.

### The Second Plenary Session Reviews Post-War Relief; Materials Should Be Returned to the People Bit by Bit; Today's Assembly is a Report on Political Consultation

[United Press, Chongqing, 6th] The Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee has been convened for six days, and it is expected to close on the 12th. The Assembly attaches great importance to the Northeast issue, and there has been intense debate. Foreign Minister Wang promised that the government will never make concessions that would harm China's sovereignty.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] The sixth plenary meeting of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee was held at 9:20 AM on the 6th, chaired by Chen Guofu, with 247 Central Executive Committee members in attendance. After the secretariat read the minutes of the fifth plenary meeting and reported on documents, the chairman announced the continuation of the review of the report on diplomatic issues. Speakers included Huang Ziren, Wang Xingzhou, Hu Jianzhong, Fang Zhi, Liu Jianqun, and others. They all unanimously criticized the errors of secret diplomacy and made suggestions for future diplomatic style. Their passionate and intense emotions were even greater than yesterday's. A break was taken at 10:40 AM, and the meeting continued at 11:00 AM, still continuing the review of diplomatic issues.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] The seventh plenary meeting of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee was held at 3:20 PM on the 6th, with 199 members in attendance, chaired by Chen Cheng. The chairman announced the report on post-war relief, which was reported by Pu Xuefeng, Deputy Director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and lasted for one hour. After a ten-minute break, the meeting continued. The chairman announced the review of the report on post-war relief. Ten people spoke. Because the time was up, the remaining speakers submitted their requests in writing to the Relief and Rehabilitation Review Committee for review. Subsequently, the chairman announced the list of members participating in the review committee, which was convened by Kong Xiangxi, Hong Shiyou, and Wu Zhimei. Finally, the secretariat reported that the plenary meeting on the morning of the 7th would be a report on the Political Consultative Conference and a review of that report, and the plenary meeting in the afternoon would be a political report and a review of that report. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM. At the plenary meeting this afternoon, the speakers who reviewed post-war relief included Cheng Zhonghang, Liu Chengzhao, Wei Yongcheng, Lv Yuzhang, Zhang Banghan, Deng Qingyang, Wen Yiyou, Liu Wendao, Zhou Bomin, Lv Xiaodao, and others. The main points of the speeches were: (1) The Administration's expenditures are too large and the salaries of its employees are too special, which should be adjusted as soon as possible. Also, although the Administration's expenditures are not paid by the national treasury, they must still be submitted to the government for verification. (2) The war disasters in northern Jiangsu and Hubei provinces are particularly severe, and effective relief should be provided quickly. (3) Relief materials should be strictly managed and rationally distributed to ensure that every material can be returned to the people bit by bit. (4) The Administration's officials at all levels should be selected domestically and do not need to recall students studying abroad, in order to increase expenditures. (5) Materials shipped from abroad that are not suitable for rural use can be publicly auctioned first, and the cash can be used to purchase suitable items for distribution to rural areas. (6) Provide funds to send righteous people back to their hometowns as soon as possible and find ways to make a living for them.

### Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall Return to Chongqing Yesterday; There are Rumors of a Mediation Group Being Sent to the Northeast

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Zhang Zhizhong, Zhou Enlai, and Marshall and their entourage flew back to Chongqing from Hankou at 12:30 PM on the 6th.

[United Press, This Port, 6th] Today, sources close to US Special Envoy General Marshall claimed: The entire Northeast is within the scope of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters in Beiping. It is expected that a "cessation of conflict" on-site observation group with US representatives will soon have to be sent to the areas in the Northeast that the Soviet Union has rejected American observers. It is stated that the "cessation of conflict" agreement signed in Chongqing on January 10th does include the Northeast. It is said that the unfortunate impression that the Northeast is not under the jurisdiction of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters occurred during a press conference held when the headquarters was being formed. At that press conference, the three members of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters stated that the Northeast was not within their jurisdiction. Another reason is the fact that the on-site observation group has not yet entered the Northeast. The source close to Special Envoy Marshall continued: The recently completed plan for the reorganization and unification of the National and Communist armies also clearly includes the Northeast. This plan stipulates that the reorganization of troops should begin immediately, so sending an on-site observation group to the Northeast in the short term has been regarded as an urgent matter. (Note: A recent report from a visitor to the Northeast stated that the Soviet Union is arming the Chinese Communists in the Northeast "for political and propaganda use." This report mentioned the possibility of the above plan becoming complicated when implemented.) The central government, it is said, is unwilling to allow the observation group to enter the Northeast, fearing that this action may arouse the hostility of the Soviet Union. China's relationship with the Soviet Union is already tense. The Communist Party, it is understood, agrees to the entry of the on-site observation group into the Northeast, because it is said that the central government wants to avoid any actions that could offend the Soviet Union, the "trustee" of the Northeast. Therefore, it has been suggested that the Soviet Union could at least be invited to hold talks with the observation group on-site in the Northeast as a gesture of courtesy. However, the possibility of this has not been officially confirmed.

### 30 Communist Regiments Depart from Chahar Towards Rehe

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] According to news from Jinzhou, Communist troop movements in Zhangjiakou have been frequent recently. Thirty regiments have departed from Zhangjiakou towards Rehe. Their intentions are unknown. Also, Communist troops near Xifengkou have recently departed for Rehe, with the intention of reinforcing Pingquan.

### The Chaos in the Harbin Financial Market

[United Press, Tianjin] It is reported that today, the financial market in Harbin is in a state of "extreme chaos," with most banks requesting assistance from the Central Bank. Another reason for the chaos is that depositors are rushing to withdraw funds from the banks because they were not allowed to withdraw even a small percentage of their deposits during the Japanese occupation.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th] On the 4th and 5th, the fluctuations in gold and U.S. dollar prices were minimal. The Hong Kong dollar saw a relatively large increase. On the 5th, gold was priced at 167,000 yuan, U.S. dollars at 1,850 yuan, and Hong Kong dollars at 366 yuan.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 5th] After the opening of foreign exchange, prices in the city have remained relatively stable, but gold prices have seen slight fluctuations. In the morning, the price was 142,000 yuan per tael, briefly rising to 150,000 yuan at noon, and falling back to 146,000 yuan in the evening.

### News Censorship in Recovered Areas to be Abolished From Date of Telegram

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] In order to implement the established policy of freedom of the press, the government has abolished the news censorship system in the recovered areas. Minister Wu Guozhen publicly announced at a press conference with foreign reporters today that freedom of the press is the government's established policy and the consistent advocacy of the Kuomintang. Due to the war, the censorship system was adopted as a last resort. After the Japanese surrender, the government first abolished news censorship in the mainland on October 1st. In the recovered areas, it was temporarily retained because order had not yet been fully restored. Now, the government has, in accordance with its original policy, telegraphed all recovered areas to abolish all news censorship from the date of the telegram.

### Postal Personnel Returning to the Capital to Fly from Chongqing to Nanjing Within Days

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The first group of ninety personnel from the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications returning to the capital will fly from Chongqing to Nanjing in the coming days. Part of their families have already arrived in Hankou by boat, and it is expected that all will return to the capital next month. Also, a batch of demobilized personnel from the Wartime Transportation Bureau will arrive in Nanjing on the 7th aboard the Jiangding and Hangli No. 2 ships.

### East Mongolian Representatives Leave Beiping

[United Press, Beiping, 6th] It is reported that the East Mongolian delegation has flown from here today, preparing to return to Hailar. It is noted that the delegation held several meetings here with General Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Headquarters of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Subsequently, they abandoned their original plan to go to Chongqing to request "high autonomy."

### Jinan Traitor Cases Under Investigation by Shandong High Court

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 6th] The Jinan traitor cases are currently being investigated one after another by the Shandong High Court and are expected to be publicly tried within this month.

### Strict Crackdown on Rice Hoarding in Nanjing; Over 20,000 Stones Confiscated and to Be Sold at Discounted Prices; 8,000 Tons of Siamese Rice to Be Shipped Back and Distributed to Disaster Areas Within Days

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Rice prices in Nanjing have fallen to 21,000 yuan per stone for inferior rice, due to the continuous arrival of large quantities of rice from the Jurong and Lishui rice-producing areas. The Nanjing Municipal Government is currently strictly cracking down on rice hoarding and has confiscated 27,923 stones, which will be ordered to be sold at discounted prices.

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 5th] In the past few days, 72,000 bags of rice, totaling thousands of tons, will be shipped back to the motherland from here to relieve the shortage of rice in some areas. Zheng Wulou, Chairman of the Association for the Relief of Famine in the Motherland, organized by overseas Chinese here, will go to Shanghai to supervise the distribution of this Siamese rice to the various disaster areas. The movement to relieve the rice shortage in the motherland, organized by overseas Chinese here, is progressing enthusiastically. To date, 10 million Siamese baht have been raised.

### Despite Fertile Land in the Northeast, It is No Longer a Prosperous Industrial Area; Soviet Troops' Entrenchment Shows Determination to Stay

[United Press, Local Dispatch] When Soviet troops will withdraw from the Nine Northeastern Provinces is probably only known to the Kremlin. However, if the Soviet troops withdraw, the Nine Northeastern Provinces will no longer be a prosperous industrial area. All kinds of machines, regardless of size, from locomotives to lathes, have been taken away by the Soviet troops as spoils of war. Yet, the Soviet war against Japan lasted barely a week. The Nine Northeastern Provinces still have vast fertile land, but they no longer have industrial potential. A qualified Chinese told the United Press reporter: "The removal seems to have two purposes. First, the Soviet Union can use this to establish its own military industry in the east. Second, if the Nine Northeastern Provinces become a battlefield again, there will be no factories for the enemy to use." Of the 5,000 large and small factories in the Shenyang area, almost all have been emptied and severely damaged. According to American journalists who have visited this Soviet military stronghold, even if the Soviet Union withdraws from other parts of the Nine Northeastern Provinces after obtaining certain economic benefits, it is still prepared to stay in Dalian at any cost. Foreign reporters stayed in the Nine Northeastern Provinces for a total of two weeks, and this reporter is the first to return to Shanghai. Most of the time in the Northeast, the reporters were accompanied by Soviet machine gunners. The impression from all aspects is that the Soviet Union has deeply entrenched itself in some areas, and only pressure greater than that from China can drive them out. A senior Chinese general in Shenyang said: "The speech delivered by Marshal Malinovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet forces in the East, in Changchun on Red Army Day reflects the Soviet Union's determination to stay." The staff officer also told the reporter that this statement has been "confirmed," but American reporters who were detained in Changchun for many days have yet to make any statement. In Shenyang and other cities, although Chinese and Soviet flags are displayed side by side, the Chinese have no real power, no different from being in Moscow. Also, White Russians in the Nine Northeastern Provinces are used by the Soviet Union, but generally suffer poor treatment. In short, the Soviet Union has gained a new foothold in Asia, backed by the military force of the Red Army. This secret police, spies, and intimidation ensure safety. On the surface, the Soviet Union feigns Sino-Soviet friendship, as revealed in the slogans on Red Army Day in Shenyang, but in reality, they only despise the Chinese. Their treatment of the Chinese is no different from conquered people. Heartbroken Chinese only dared to tell reporters inside the Chinese military headquarters that Soviet troops in China commit all kinds of atrocities, including rape and plunder. The Chinese openly express fear of the Soviet troops and dare not walk on the streets of Shenyang even in broad daylight, fearing being stopped by Red Army soldiers and losing their watches or money. Only a few Chinese soldiers guard the headquarters in Shenyang, because General Peng’s large army remains stationed outside the city to prevent conflicts with Soviet troops, who never leave their weapons. Soviet troops forbid Chinese civilians from carrying weapons, and violators are immediately executed, except for the mayor and his secretary, who have special passports from the Soviet commander allowing them to carry weapons. Fearing looting by Soviet troops, Shenyang stores are nailed up with wooden strips, and only third-rate goods are displayed in the windows. Only when Americans shop do they show higher-quality goods, which are usually hidden to avoid being seen by Soviet troops. Germans in Shenyang have not been affected by the Soviet occupation. According to Chinese, for two weeks after the Soviet troops entered, the Nazi flag still flew above the German club. Chinese people in Shenyang are overjoyed to meet Americans, even if they are just reporters. Upon seeing a CBI insignia, they smile and ask, "Are you an American soldier?"

### Promulgation of Japan's New Draft Constitution; Forever Forbidden From Training Troops; The Emperor Has No Right to Govern the Country

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 6th] Emperor Hirohito promulgated an imperial rescript tonight, fully accepting the draft of the new constitution. The rescript states: "I wish to fundamentally revise the constitution of the Empire in accordance with the will of the people and the principle of respect for fundamental rights, and I hereby instruct the government authorities to do their utmost to achieve this."

[Another Dispatch] The Japanese government's decision to adopt the draft of the new constitution was the result of a lengthy and arduous discussion. The cabinet met at 10:00 a.m. yesterday and did not adjourn until 11:00 p.m. Last night, Prime Minister Shidehara and constitutional expert Matsumoto entered the Imperial Palace to meet with the Emperor for about three hours. Foreign Minister Yoshida visited MacArthur's headquarters. The cabinet continued to meet throughout the day today until 4:00 p.m.

[United Press, Tokyo, 6th] MacArthur's headquarters suddenly announced Japan's new constitution today. The new constitution stipulates the permanent abolition of war and forbids the training of armed forces. Sovereignty belongs to the entire people, and the Emperor has no governing power. His position is reduced to a national symbol, only presiding over national ceremonies. The new constitution has ninety-five articles, listing the revolutionary rights enjoyed by the Japanese people. The power of the House of Representatives is expanded to a true legislative body, and the hereditary House of Peers is replaced by a popularly elected House of Councillors. Article Nine of the new constitution states: "Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes. In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized."

### Absolute Equality Between Men and Women; Abolition of the System of Slavery

The new constitution also states that if Japan wishes to occupy a glorious position in the international community, it must ensure that the Japanese constitution internally lays a solid foundation for a democratic government and externally leads the rest of the world to abolish war. Although the new constitution stipulates that the Japanese Prime Minister will be elected by the parliament, current officials can still be re-elected. The Japanese cabinet meetings yesterday and today have reached their final stage. It is expected that another important resolution will be announced within days to expand the scope of the purge of militarist elements, and the government may be reorganized as a result. The new constitution grants the people new, revolutionary freedoms based on the American constitution, including: equality between husband and wife, marriage requires the consent of both men and women, abolition of any slavery, and prohibition of forced enslavement of others except as punishment for criminals. People have freedom of thought and belief, and others must not infringe upon it, which is noteworthy in a country with "thought police." Officials are absolutely prohibited from using torture and other cruel punishments. Japanese police are not allowed to arbitrarily search and arrest people. All cases should be tried quickly without delay and must be handled in accordance with legal procedures. People have freedom of speech and religion, and the government and its affiliated agencies must not conduct religious education or engage in any religious activities.

The preamble to the new constitution states that the Japanese people are willing to cooperate peacefully with all countries in the world, hoping to enjoy all kinds of freedoms at home, and have decided to prevent government actions from causing the tragedy of war again. It is hereby announced that government measures should be based on the will of the people.

The new constitution also stipulates the establishment of a regency system, which is unprecedented in the Japanese constitution. The Imperial Family's acceptance of property grants and its expenses must be approved by the parliament. People should have equal obligations and equal rights without discrimination.

Japan's new constitution was drafted by the Japanese government and MacArthur's headquarters after repeated meetings over the past five months. According to MacArthur's statement tonight, the new constitution is an enlightened document, and its content "has my complete approval." According to the new constitution, the Emperor no longer holds Japanese political power. He will obey the will of the people and will only be a symbol of the entire Japanese people.

At the same time, the U.S. Congress also reacted to the declaration by Britain, the United States, and France suggesting the overthrow of Franco. Some members of Congress expressed their approval, but others believed that the United States should not interfere in Spanish affairs. Some even believed that the three countries' actions were appeasement of the Soviet Union. The U.S. State Department said that it received a note from Franco twenty-four hours before the statement was issued stating that the Spanish people would never tolerate foreign interference in their affairs. The three countries' statement was addressed to the Spanish people, especially patriotic leaders and freedom-loving Spaniards, hoping that they would soon be able to safely overthrow Franco and establish a provisional government. However, Franco's determination to not step down under pressure, and the fact that the United States, Britain, and France hope that Spain will not have another civil war, have effectively hindered any immediate action to force Franco to step down as soon as possible. However, there are clear signs that the Spanish issue may be raised at the UN Security Council's resumption of meetings in New York.

### Editorial: Resolving the Current Economic Crisis

During the fourth and fifth plenary sessions of the Second Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, many members spoke generously and emotionally about the current foreign affairs, financial, and economic problems of our country. Regardless of what secondary discussions the Second Central Committee will have on this issue, and what measures the government will take in the future, this enthusiastic scene is a symbol of the Kuomintang's rebirth. Since the long-awaited victory of the Anti-Japanese War arrived, internal and external troubles have followed in the past six months. Although victory is in hand, the national crisis has not been eased at all. Especially for the people in the recovered areas, the constant rise in prices in recent months has brought them a high degree of insecurity in their lives. The problems facing us now are the failure of foreign affairs and the serious economic crisis. The Chinese Kuomintang, which led our people to victory in the long-term Anti-Japanese War, also bears the heavy responsibility of resolving the current national crisis. During this Second Central Committee session, some demanded a change in diplomatic style, while others conducted strict reviews of the government's financial, monetary, and economic measures, which not only raised our awareness of these issues, but also carried out the Kuomintang's task of supervising the government, and at the same time spoke out the knots in the hearts of the people.

We will not talk about diplomatic and international issues here, but we must point out the severity of the current economic crisis. This economic crisis has not been alleviated by the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and its severity is increasing day by day. If the government does not come up with measures to strictly implement, China's national economy will collapse completely; in fact, China's national economy is on the verge of collapse. The bankruptcy and decline of the middle class in recent years has made the future economic recovery of China extremely difficult. Today, more than half a year after Japan's surrender, let us think about what dangerous symptoms our current national economy is showing. Production enterprises in the Great Rear Area have stagnated, and production enterprises in the recovered areas are also stuck in a state of stagnation. The rise of new bureaucratic capital in the recovered areas not only competes with the people for profits, violating the spirit of the Principle of People's Livelihood, but also undermines government policies, or arbitrarily raises its own salaries, undermining the government's entire system, or takes the lead in raising prices, prompting the rise of general prices; as for the handling of enemy and puppet industries, it is especially a mess, and no one knows the details. In the recovered areas, general prices have risen more than six times in six months, making the people unable to bear the burden of life, and labor strikes have been occurring one after another, with no peace of mind. If this continues, the government and the people will both suffer, which is not a blessing for the country and the nation.

Why is the current economic crisis becoming increasingly serious? The main reason is that the government does not have a basic policy to deal with the current economic crisis, and even if it has a policy, it cannot be implemented uniformly. This fully demonstrates the government's incompetence. An incompetent government not only fails to resolve the current difficulties, but also makes the difficulties more severe. Chairman Chiang inspects a place and pays attention to local prices, wanting to stabilize them. Our Chairman's concern for prices is indeed sincere; but why have prices in various places not only failed to achieve the desired effect of stabilization in recent months, but have instead risen day by day, rising at least six times in six months. This shows the incompetence of the government, especially the various departments in charge of finance, monetary affairs, and economics. In terms of finance, what is our national fiscal policy? During the war, there was an unavoidable reason to make up for income by issuing currency; but why has the value of the legal tender also decreased by six or seven times more than six months after the end of the war? In theory, the vast recovered areas could accommodate the already inflated currency, and the expansion of the issuing area could achieve the goal of partially contracting the currency; but why has our currency value continued to fall? We want to ask the financial authorities what policy they are taking on our currency and how to prevent it from falling again; we not only want to ask the financial authorities what measures they will take on this currency issue, but we also want to ask the financial authorities whether they have a practical plan to reorganize the currency system. The Chinese people and the government cannot be troubled by malignant currency inflation for a long time due to the incompetence of the financial authorities. This disease needs to be diagnosed and treated immediately, without delay. "Save the Legal Tender," what a pressing cry. "The主管當局有辦法說出來，無辦法想出來，有辦法挑起來，無辦法放下來" is the right step; we cannot let incompetence harm our lives. ("The authorities in charge should speak out if they have a solution, think of one if they don't, take it up if there's a solution, and put it down if there isn't" - This is a paraphrased translation of an idiomatic Chinese expression)

Regarding finance, there is also a rather serious problem that has not been noticed by the world, that is, the increase in salt prices everywhere, and there is a salt shortage everywhere, but the salt production in the producing areas cannot be sold externally, so that most salt farmers give up salt production and switch to other industries. The name "Salt Administration" still appears in our country, and our country still has so many "salt officials" to handle the "salt administration," which is our shame. May I ask whether there are such "salt officials" in England, the United States, or other civilized countries, who are destroying our traditional salt distribution system, and taking advantage of the situation to monopolize, but not allowing the people to freely buy and sell, so that salt prices are high everywhere and there is a salt shortage everywhere. May I ask whether such governance can be tolerated by the Principle of People's Livelihood? The "He Zheng" ("Harmony Administration") official is in charge of financial authorities, why doesn't he ask?

Speaking of the economic aspect, the seriousness of the situation is self-evident. Factory shutdowns, worker unemployment, the cultivation of bureaucratic capital, the obstruction of private enterprises, and the Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Bureau have not yet announced the whole picture, all of which make the people uneasy. We cannot let this situation drag on for a long time. The Chinese Kuomintang is the ruling party, and it has a heavy responsibility to resolve the current economic crisis. We hope that the convening of this Second Central Committee session can come up with a solution to resolve the current economic crisis. The future of the nation depends on it.

### Demanding the Release of Arrested Representatives: British-Owned Tram Workers Strike; Tram Services on All Routes Suspended After 5 PM Yesterday; Chinese National Aviation Corporation Employees Begin Work-to-Rule

[Our Newspaper Report] Tram company employee representatives Zhang Xuekui, Qiu Changjiang, and Peng Shaolin were suddenly arrested yesterday at the tram workers' union. Workers were agitated by the arrest and rallied at the Social Affairs Bureau to petition for their release. However, they were unsuccessful. As a result, British-owned tram services on all routes were suspended after 5:30 PM as a form of protest. According to authorities, the three arrested workers were secretly reported for participating in a puppet union and for improper conduct.

### High Court Tries Traitors; Wang Xingjian Propagated for the Enemy; Chen Bohua Held Successive Puppet Positions

[Our Newspaper Report] The High Court opened court yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Cao Jun, to try two cases of traitors. Details are as follows:

Wang Xingjian was reported to have worked in the telecommunications department of the puppet military commission during the Anti-Japanese War, and established a radio station in Nanjing, engaged in propaganda for the enemy. The High Procuratorate concluded the initial investigation and formally filed a public prosecution. The defendant was allowed to be released on bail for 500,000 yuan. The case opened for the first time yesterday morning. The defendant did not appear.

He was unable to return in time for today's hearing and requested a postponement. The court ordered the case to be postponed for further hearing.

Chen Bohua worked for the Jing-Hu and Hu-Hang-Yong Railways before the war. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he followed Ding Mocun and held successive positions in the puppet Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Industry. By the time of victory, he was still the executive member of the puppet two-railway party department. Later, he was reported and arrested, and the High Procuratorate filed a public prosecution. The case has been tried several times. The defendant claimed that although he held a puppet position, he did not forget the country. After the victory, he even tried his best to preserve all materials so that they could be transferred intact. When the hearing continued yesterday morning, the two witnesses cited by the defendant, Jin Ali and Cui Changyu, did not appear. The court ruled that the case be postponed for further hearing.

### Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Bureau Streamlined into Five Groups

The Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Bureau has been established for several months.

### Fierce Debate Between Lawyers on Both Sides – U.S. Military Court Conducts Third Trial of Ishihara Yu

How Can the Words "Abnormal Psychology" Absolve Him of His Crimes?

The U.S. military court conducted a third trial of Ishihara Yu yesterday. To demonstrate that his actions were all carried out to fulfill his duties, Ishihara Yu cut off his little finger before his arrest last year. During yesterday's hearing, the defendant was questioned by lawyers from both sides about the abuse of American prisoners of war in Jiangwan and Wusong. Ishihara Yu spoke at length in court, expounding his views in broken English. He first stated that he despised cowards and considered those in the concentration camp to be incompetent. Since they could not fight on the front lines, they should do hard labor in the rear. He also admitted to administering water torture to the war criminals, but explained that water torture would not lead to death because he himself had been subjected to water torture nine times. He also claimed to have sought benefits for everyone in the camp and resigned in 1945 because he was dissatisfied with various measures within the concentration camp. At 10:30, the lawyers on both sides began their arguments. First, the defendant's lawyers, Major Levy and Lieutenant Dona, pointed out the reasons for Ishihara Yu's crimes and asked the judges to pay attention to: (1) The testimonies from the American side were exaggerated and seemed to make Ishihara Yu's crimes more serious. (2) Ishihara Yu was the target of public criticism and has already admitted his guilt. (3) They hoped the court would investigate the circumstances of the defendant's crimes. Major Levy also explained that Ishihara Yu's crimes were due to abnormal psychology. Because the defendant was very proud when he arrived in China from Tokyo, but later obtained a small position in the concentration camp and was treated the same as soldiers, he was very distressed and vented his dissatisfaction on the prisoners of war. He took pride in beating people each time, so his beating and treatment of the prisoners of war was not voluntary. The plaintiff's lawyer, Mr. Garland, refuted Major Levy's opinion, believing that Ishihara Yu was close to being brutal and that the four words "abnormal psychology" could not absolve him of his crimes. After the arguments on both sides were completed, the presiding judge scheduled the verdict for 3 p.m. today (7th).

Our newspaper's reporter has learned the following from the Foreign Exchange Review Department of the Bank of China: Except for goods that are prohibited from import, imported goods are divided into two categories: freely importable and importable with permission. For freely importable goods, importers can apply directly to a designated bank. For goods that require an import permit, importers must first apply to the Import Management Office for an import permit and then use the permit to purchase foreign exchange from a designated bank. When exporting goods, exporters must first sell the foreign exchange from short-term or long-term exports, or re-exports, to a designated bank. Only after obtaining proof from the designated bank can they report the goods to the customs for export. However, this restriction does not apply to goods with a total value of less than US$25 and without commercial behavior. "Foreign remittances," "foreign exchange sold in China," and "all other foreign exchange" must also be sold to a designated bank. For personal legal needs for foreign exchange, such as living expenses, travel expenses, and insurance fees, you can also apply directly to a designated bank, but only up to a maximum of US$250 or 60 pounds per month. For tuition fees for students studying abroad, the limit is US$150 or 36 pounds per month. Other legal needs for foreign exchange must first be approved by the Central Bank.

Yesterday, the local gold market was weak at first. It opened at 1.49 million, but after the securities firms sold gold to switch to stocks, the process fell slightly in extreme calm. It once fell to 1.44 million in the morning. Credit was exceptionally loose, and those with funds who had not yet lent them out took advantage of the low price to absorb them. At noon, it stabilized again. Securities firms had been overly aggressive in selling gold in the morning, so their positions became loose at noon, and they made up for it by buying gold. In general, people were quite sensitive to the forward U.S. dollar, which the Central Bank raised month by month, and people were slightly agitated. It rose to over 1.55 million before becoming calmer. As a result, it closed 60,000 higher than the previous day. Ornaments rose from 1.58 million to 1.68 million. Silver ingots were low at first but then evened out and were still listed at 1,800. Silver dollars were similar to the previous day.

Citibank and other banks also set the exchange rate for U.S. currency at 1940 yuan to 2040 yuan, with both buying and selling. Currency dealers, seeing that the buying price was 50 yuan lower than the market price, lowered the price of large bills by 40 yuan before they could be delivered. The opening price was 2000 yuan for selling and 1980 yuan for buying, with a low of 1960 yuan. At noon, it was around 1980 yuan.

### Natural Green Tea – Lack of Supply of Good Products

It has been found that the natural green tea that is most appreciated by the United States, the city's tea export lines have been receiving telegrams from overseas recently. Quality ones are in short supply, so it is difficult to find them for a time. Everyone is waiting. As for the city's tea market, the volume of transactions has decreased compared to before. This is because credit is tightening, and purchases are picky. However, prices have been able to stand firm because the sellers are reluctant to lower their prices.

### Rice and Grain Prices Drop; Soybean Oil Market Also Weak

Yesterday's rice market saw a significant influx of shipments arriving in Shanghai via waterways, primarily from the vicinity of Suzhou and the Sujia Road area of Wujiang Tongli. Consequently, vessels filled the riverbanks, market sales stagnated, and粳 rice continued its downward trend, dropping by another small thousand yuan. Early Bo Dao, Du Xian, and Ke Xian varieties also decreased by a small thousand yuan, though Bai Yuan arrival and sales were both scarce, keeping the market stable. The oil market experienced oversupply, resulting in a further decline of two to three thousand yuan.

The raw peanut market mirrored this trend, with bran prices staying level. Overall, grain prices continued to soften.

### Strong Support from New Bulls; Chinese Stocks Soar; Foreign Stocks Also Rise

Yesterday, under the strict scrutiny of the authorities, public bonds saw only slight activity, with trading volume minimal, almost nonexistent.

At the midday close, Category A and B bonds were up 80 yuan compared to the previous close, Category C up 70 yuan, Category D up 50 yuan, and Category E up 80 yuan.

Some even converted gold into stocks, stirring market sentiment. Consequently, popular stocks surged by 20%, ending at midday at high prices, with significant gains of 35% for hot stocks and 20% to 30% for less popular ones. Foreign stocks also rose by about 15%.

### Market Chatter: After the Opening of Foreign Exchange

Since the Central Bank implemented the free buying and selling of foreign exchange this Monday, all parties have been paying close attention. In reality, where foreign exchange is quoted and where it is freely bought and sold remains unclear to the average merchant. Importers settling US dollars must not only pay the price stipulated by the Central Bank but also bear brokerage commissions. Banks handling foreign exchange also charge additional fees. Exporters settling foreign exchange face varying buying prices from different banks, generally slightly lower than the market price for US dollars, and must also take a 97% discount. As a result, buying and selling prices diverge by over a hundred yuan. Previously, in the black market, telegraphic transfers were generally higher than US dollars, and large cash transactions were valued at a 3% discount to telegraphic transfers. Exporters could sell telegraphic transfers for more than the market price of US dollars, enjoying a premium. After the opening of free buying and selling, importers and exporters, in addition to facing various application restrictions from the authorities, simultaneously bear the handling fees for middlemen's transfers. Furthermore, the so-called quotations, except for US dollars, are based on market prices calculated by the handling banks themselves for other foreign currencies. Therefore, the solemnly established foreign exchange quotations are no better than those of money changers. Recently, the difference in US dollar buying and selling prices in small money shops is less than 30 yuan, while the buying and selling prices of US dollars in major banks differ by over 100 yuan. Moreover, calculating other foreign currencies based on market prices rather than using official rates shows no improvement over small money shops operating in the black market. Yesterday, futures trading was implemented, with prices increasing by 100 yuan per month, the opposite of previous forward foreign exchange. Speculative psychology has become somewhat sensitive. We hope that open foreign exchange trading will have complete foreign exchange quotations, and the range and spread should be narrowed as much as possible. A reasonable calculation should be made for foreign currencies other than US dollars, ensuring that speculators have no opportunity to exploit. Prevention is better than cure; the time is now.

### Basketball League Yesterday's Games: Liangxi Defeats the Blue Team; Green Forest Easily Defeats the Sixth Platoon; Green Team Wins Against Qianghua in the Women's Division

Three basketball league games were played yesterday. In the first women's division game, the Green Team displayed its power, soundly defeating Qianghua. The score at halftime was 29 to 3, and the final result was 68 to 7. In the second game, the Green Forest team of Division A faced the Sixth Platoon. Green Forest led at halftime with a score of 16 to 9, and the final result was 35 to 22. In the third game, the Blue Team of Division A faced Liangxi. The game was intense. At halftime, the score was 21 to 16. The final result was 40 to 34.

In the women's division game, Huang Mingyuan of the Green Team was incredibly brave and scored 40 points alone yesterday, a remarkable achievement. In Division A2, Shu Jiayi and Chen Guozhen of Green Forest easily scored on layups. Gao Anzun of the Sixth Platoon was the only one who made some contribution. In the second half, Green Forest became even more rampant, and Chen Guo Zhen scored countless points. In the final game, Liangxi of Division A faced the Blue Team. The latter's offensive power was greatly reduced yesterday due to the absence of Jin Kun. Although the strength of the new force, Ti Youling, was insufficient, he shot the ball very smoothly yesterday. In the second half, Zhang Shaoqing and Yang Yuanlong of Liangxi scored successively. At 35 to 34, the situation was extremely tense, but Zhang Shaoqing suddenly saw his luck turn and scored two more goals, resulting in a final score of 40 to 34, with Liangxi winning.

### Outdoor Exercise Fields: Popular in America
Outdoor exercise fields in cities are becoming increasingly popular as the public places greater emphasis on physical fitness. In the 19th century, only a few children's playgrounds were organized by schools and community groups. However, since World War I, with the increasing frequency of street traffic, the need for such outdoor exercise fields has become more urgent to allow children to play in fresh air after school without danger. America is vigorously promoting this. Shown is a group of children in New York City, on the Atlantic coast of America, practicing volleyball on an outdoor exercise field run by the municipal government.

### The Highest Institution of Higher Learning on the Plateau of Xikang: National Xikang Vocational and Technical College (Part 1) by Jin

Seven years ago, when Xuzhou, Wuhan, and Guangzhou fell to the enemy one after another, and pessimists shortsightedly doubted the strategy of protracted war, the establishment of Xikang Province was like a strong ray of light, shining in every corner of China, awakening the deluded from their dreams, and exposing the faces of traitors. A large number of engineers and various experts poured into Xikang, and the slogan "Develop Xikang" was on the lips of people in the interior and appeared in every newspaper and magazine in the rear.

Dr. Li's Creation
In the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic [1938], Dr. Li Shutian—a hydraulic engineer and director of Beiyang Institute of Technology—led a group of people to Xichang, the wealthy Tibetan center of Xikang. There, boundless reserves of iron, copper, zinc, and coal existed, and untouched forests and pastures awaited development and utilization. After Dr. Li completed his investigation, he immediately wrote a report, which, in addition to reporting its wealth, also suggested establishing a specialized school, including agriculture and engineering, to cultivate cadres responsible for developing resources. Because the war of resistance was a long-term and constructive undertaking, and the development of all resources was the only capital for long-term resistance, it was naturally necessary to establish a specialized school to take on this important task.

After multiple trips and numerous plans, under Dr. Li's efforts, the new sign of "National Xikang Vocational and Technical College" stood proudly in Xichang, a remote and often regarded as uncivilized area.

A New Type of Institution
The original plan was to establish a university. However, due to the circumstances at the time and the urgent needs of the war of resistance, they adopted two specialized systems—three-year and five-year—which was the first of its kind in the country. The former recruited high school graduates, like a regular university, providing three years of specialized training. The latter recruited junior high school graduates, providing five years of specialized training. The first two years covered the general high school curriculum, and the last three years were the same as the three-year system, focusing on specialized courses. In this way, it could compensate for the insufficient academic time of a general four-year system, avoid unnecessary subjects in the four years of university, and shorten the duration of study, creating a large number of cadres. There were only three such new types of institutions in the country. In addition to "Xikang Vocational and Technical College," there was a "Northwest Vocational and Technical College" in the Northwest, offering only a five-year agricultural program, and a "Central Vocational and Technical College" in Leshan, Sichuan, focusing on light industry departments such as papermaking and leather manufacturing.

Heavy Industry Departments
"Xikang Vocational and Technical College" was the lucky one among the three. Under Dr. Li's leadership, heavy industry departments were established. In addition to mining and metallurgy, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, and civil engineering, there were also agriculture and forestry and animal husbandry. He brought the spirit he had at Beiyang Institute of Technology to found "Xikang Vocational and Technical College." Although some said it was "using a sledgehammer to crack a nut" and "a waste of talent," he worked tirelessly for the nation, for the country, and for education, regardless of criticism. In the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], a large number of young people from the border regions were recruited in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming, and the first class began on Mount Lu in the scenic area of Xichang.

The departments established at that time have already been mentioned above. Among them, the mining and metallurgy department only accepted high school students, while the mechanical engineering and chemical engineering departments only accepted junior high school students. The other three departments accepted both high school and junior high school graduates. At that time, the professors and staff, even the librarian, were from Beiyang Institute of Technology. The professors of agriculture were also nationally renowned scholars. The "Xikang Vocational and Technical College" at that time could be called its golden age.

Factories and farms were also established at the same time. The books, except for a few newly purchased, were mostly remnants of Beiyang Institute of Technology. The instruments were also borrowed by Dr. Li. For example, the civil engineering department had four theodolites and three levels, half of which were from Zeiss. Many chemical and mineral specimens were also donated from various sources.

### Cultivating Mental Stinginess by Suoyin
Stinginess is the opposite of generosity and is criticized by people. But most people think that stinginess refers to material things; in fact, there is also stinginess in the mental sphere, and those who are mentally stingy are probably more numerous than those who are materially stingy.

For example, a person who is unwilling to easily teach or impart the knowledge and skills they possess unless there are conditions; who is unwilling to tell people good news; who is unwilling to express joy when hearing others talk about their successes; who is unwilling to express sympathy when others encounter misfortune; and who, in ordinary times, is unwilling to show a little smile, say a few pleasant words, or praise others, these are all forms of mental stinginess.

Apart from stinginess with knowledge and skills, the rest belongs to emotional stinginess, which is what is called "coldness," "indifference," or "unfeeling." Sometimes, being emotionally generous is more difficult than being materially or physically generous. There are many people who would rather give you money, materials, or even let you work for them, but are unwilling to offer you a kind word or facial expression. They may claim to be "naturally arrogant," but this is actually selfishness, which leads to the same end as material stinginess.

Excessively wasting emotions or using them inappropriately certainly has its drawbacks, but moderate and appropriate use of emotions is necessary, which benefits both others and oneself, because humans are emotional animals. Therefore, if you want to be a successful person in human society, you must make good use of emotions and be generous in using emotions.

### Physiological Monocular No Worries by Zhong Zuo
In industrial accidents and wartime injuries, many people unfortunately lose one eye. These monocular individuals often become passive and pessimistic due to various fears.

Monocular individuals often think that their field of vision is only half that of a normal person, but in reality, the difference between the two is very small and not important in comparison. The judgment ability of monocular individuals for short distances (within one or two feet) is indeed lower than that of normal people. For example, they may sometimes spill coffee on the saucer or have difficulty threading a needle, and they often perform poorly in mechanical work that requires precise measurement. However, these situations will disappear with a little care and patience.

Generally, monocular individuals often worry that one eye doing the work of two eyes will easily be damaged. This is not true. When the eye is first damaged, there may be feelings of eye fatigue or headache, but this is only temporary. If monocular individuals rest their eyes frequently in the first few weeks, they can still do things that require concentrated vision and do them well without any danger.

Monocular individuals often complain that their appearance is completely ruined, but today's advanced surgery has overcome this difficulty. Modern plastic artificial eyes are almost exactly the same as real ones.

British naval admiral Nelson was a monocular; the current British Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell, is also a monocular; a monocular American pilot even flew around the world and broke records; and the famous American surgeon Wheeler lost one eye in the middle of his medical career, but he continued to train himself to perform surgery on patients.

Monocular individuals don't need to worry! Long-term psychological fears will ruin your life.

### International Racial Self-Esteem and Discrimination by Yang Mou
Germans and Japanese both have a high sense of superiority towards their own race. The outbreak of this war can also be said to be largely due to the mischief of this psychology, leading to the arrogant ambition to dominate the world. But on the other hand, don't the British and Americans also have arrogance towards their white race? I think everyone knows about their discrimination against people of color, so I don't need to elaborate.

This psychology of respecting one's own race and discriminating against other races may be a common human trait. This trait promotes the continuous development of human civilization, and it is also this trait that causes humans to engage in insane massacres like wild beasts. However, this trait is very exceptional in China.

The plight of overseas Chinese, who suffer discrimination from the governments of their host countries, is too much to describe. Take the recent example of Siam, where there was a massacre of overseas Chinese. Only because China has always been a weak country without diplomacy in recent centuries, overseas Chinese can only accept discrimination, without a trace of resistance, and live a life of humiliation.

Domestically, because of the unequal treaties over the years, the minds of the general public have retained a psychology of respect for "foreigners." Although consular jurisdiction has now been recovered and unequal treaties have been abolished, the shadows left by this psychology have never been eradicated. On a small scale, many institutions, and even many of our national institutions, have significant differences in the treatment of Chinese and foreign personnel. Personnel doing the same work are paid far more to "foreigners" than to "Chinese," and the reason for this is truly inexplicable. On a large scale, although the consular jurisdiction of "foreigners" has been abolished, they still seem to enjoy certain privileges. I have personally witnessed several times when the police have taken a blind eye to the illegal behavior of "foreigners."

From the Opium War to the present, China has experienced countless hardships and suffered countless losses. Now, we have finally joined the ranks of the powerful countries. We painfully reflect on the past and feel that our losses are no greater than the loss of this psychology of respecting our own nation.

Once, a person was taken to the police station by the police for violating traffic rules, but another "foreigner" who committed the same offense passed by leisurely. The person questioned the police, and the police replied, "Why didn't you reincarnate as a foreigner?" The speaker was unintentional, but how heartbreaking it was to the listener.

We do not hope to discriminate against other races, nor do we want to boast ourselves recklessly, but we must maintain the dignity of our own race. We should not discriminate against other races, nor should we be discriminated against by other races.

Consoling the wounds that our nation has suffered for a hundred years cannot help but arouse infinite emotion in us. Standing on a new foundation and making new efforts is already the time. Everyone should respect themselves and respect our own nation.

### People: Mrs. Churchill by Andong
In England, when you mention Mrs. Churchill, everyone will say, "Mrs. Churchill? Oh, she's really amazing!" If you ask again, "What makes you say that?" they will explain, "Well, you know, she's just amazing!" Thinking further, another adjective that can be used to describe her is that she is very charismatic.

Mrs. Churchill is a beautiful woman. Her appearance contributes to the good feelings that the British have for her and her husband. Because the British tend to have a romantic inclination towards beautiful women. They like to say, "This is our old Churn, look how beautiful his wife is!" Older people remember London in the gaslight era. They often saw Miss Hozier (Clementine Hozier, Mrs. Churchill's maiden name) and her mother inseparable. Mrs. Churchill is still a remarkable figure today.

She is also quite athletic, playing a good game of tennis. She is an excellent athlete in every season. Experts who are considered to have learned to ski in the nursery are surprised by Mrs. Churchill's continued fitness in her old age. The determination she shows when skiing is the same as the determination she shows in anything. Not long before the war, one winter, she even announced that she would participate in a famous official ski competition. At that time, the younger and more experienced members were shocked. Because the weather was snowy, they were worried that she would at least break four or five bones. Unexpectedly, she reached the finish line, still full of energy and without any injuries.

Another sport she plays well and enthusiastically is croquet, which is not the refined game in British garden parties as people imagine. The famous playwright Noël Coward is one of her good opponents. She likes to go to the theater and enjoys socializing with actors.

Like her family, she likes French movies, old music hall songs (Churn has a very rich collection), and American magazines.

Those who know Mrs. Churchill say that she is a very progressive Liberal, although Churn tends to be a Conservative. For thirty-five years, they have respected each other as guests. When Churn takes weekend breaks, they always play cards quietly.

A London tailor went to 10 Downing Street to fit Mrs. Churchill with a new dress. Churn, wearing pajamas and with a cigar in his mouth, walked into the room and watched gently. The tailor remembered: "Mrs. told him where she was going that day and told him not to come back too late. Mr. said, "Yes, dear." Just like an ordinary man."

Even if Churn is an ordinary man, Mrs. Churchill's concern for his career would not be any different.

### Inventing the Latest Inventions in Clothing Materials by Zuoyou
For thousands of years, the methods of weaving fabrics have remained unchanged: cotton is spun into yarn, and yarn is woven into cloth. This method has undergone unprecedented innovation recently due to the advancement of the chemical industry.

(1) Colorful Damask Does Not Need Weaving
The first new method of making cloth is like this:

Cotton fibers are first combed into a fluffy sheet like wool, and then pressed tightly between rollers, becoming a thin layer. Then, a special paste is applied to the surface, so that each cotton fiber is tightly adhered together and no longer moves. This paste is not only white and colorless, but also can be mixed with various brilliant colors, printed on the cloth, and draw various patterns.

After the colored paste is dried on a warm cylinder, the cloth is made successfully. In an instant, cotton raw materials have become colorful damask, while old-fashioned looms still require more than a dozen complicated procedures.

This new type of cloth is cheaper than old-fashioned cloth, firstly because it is simple and quick to manufacture, and secondly because it saves more raw materials for the same amount of cloth. For example, one pound of cotton can only weave eight yards of thin yarn on an old-fashioned loom, but if a new method is used, it can produce twenty-four yards of towels. And that new type of cloth is also extremely dense, while even the finest cloth on the loom is still full of pores.

(2) Cicada-Wing Gauze Clothing Seamless
The second method of making cloth is even more wonderful.

A pulp-like fiber is mixed with cotton fibers, and then pressed with a hot roller, and a kind of almost transparent gauze as thin as a cicada's wings is made. This gauze contains pulp, so it can repeatedly combine two pieces of shredded yarn under heat and pressure without revealing any traces. Therefore, the clothes to be tailored in the future can be seamless, and the sewing worker does not need needle and thread, just an iron for ironing clothes is enough.

(3) Non-Wet, Non-Staining, Non-Shrinking
There are more amazing things.

Chemists have invented a medicine that can be applied to clothes, which can be washed without shrinking. Moreover, clothes coated with this medicine are not easy to wrinkle and are durable.

To prevent clothes from getting wet in the rain, just soak them in a layer of ammonium-based rich compound, then even in heavy rain, the clothes will still be free of water marks.

The above-mentioned compound can also make clothes free from stains. If there are ink marks on the clothes, just wash it with the medicine, and the ink marks will disappear immediately, and there will be an invisible protective quality on the clothes. Bedsheets and quilts can be used twice as long after being washed with this medicine.

There is also a chemical raw material called "Vining", which can be woven together with cotton, wool and other materials to make strong and durable clothing materials, and this kind of clothing material will never wrinkle, and it will never be deformed when used to make clothing eyes.

(4) Eggs and Peanuts Become Clothing Materials
Chemists have discovered that all proteins can be made into fibers. So eggs, peanuts, seaweed, whale fat, pumpkin seeds, chicken feathers and bark have all been made into clothing materials. Perhaps in the future, the woolen hat on your head will be partly made of milk fiber.

### New Language of Finger-Guessing by Chen Puyun
One leader, two parties open their hearts
The three islands seek to surrender, the four powers allied
The five-yuan meeting, the air force is on standby
The July 7th Uprising, the Shanghai Battle in August
Signed on September 9th, global jubilation

### (Unpaid) Americans by Ye
The strangeness of Americans is precisely those trivial matters of daily life that they themselves have not noticed.

European history is a dim old draft; American history is a tense novel.

In Europe, the poor envy the rich; in America, the poor eagerly hope to become rich.

America is the power plant of world civilization.

### Social Service: Benevolent Sanatorium Offers Free Medical Treatment for Elementary School Teachers

Hoping that everyone will come to the library to collect certificates to go to Wuxi for recuperation.

Mr. Lu Buzhou of the Shanghai Office of the Wuxi Benevolent Sanatorium wrote: "In reply, I have received your letter of February 20, along with the patients' certificates and other documents. I happened to be away on business in the lower reaches of the river in the lower sentence of February, and returned to Shanghai on March 2nd, resulting in a delay in replying, I am very sorry! I appreciate your selection of four qualified patients, and I am now writing to invite them directly to Xichang. However, it must be stated in advance that if the condition is serious, our hospital will not accept them, so as to avoid wasting money on travel. There are three other patients who are not teachers, and no exceptions can be made according to the regulations. Since you have asked us to reduce the fees on their behalf, we should give them a discount. According to the current lowest price of our hospital's inpatient fees, which is 2,000 yuan per day, we will calculate it at 70%. If you introduce patients in the future, you must follow the hospital regulations. Since our hospital's funds are limited, I hope you will understand. I am replying to this letter accordingly, and please check it for your reference."

To: Social Service Department, Shen Bao Newspaper

Editor's Note: The following four gentlemen have been approved by this office after examination: Liu Sang, Xu Youjiao, Cao Jimeng, and Chen Rongqi. In addition, Chen Yafeng, Mao Hanqing, and Huang Ciyi are not teachers and are approved for reduced fees. The above gentlemen, please come to the library within a few days to collect the certificates, so that you can go to Xichang for recuperation. All regulations shall be handled in accordance with the letter above.

### Replies to Readers
This newspaper's social service column is specially employing well-known scholars and experts as consultants to answer questions and difficulties from readers. The tentative scope is as follows: (1) Industry and commerce enterprises; (2) Culture and education; (3) Medicine and health; (4) Legal questions; (5) Vocational guidance. When readers have questions about the above items, the text should be concise and clear. Questions of a general nature will be published in the newspaper, otherwise, this column will reply individually in writing.

Zhang Yingong asked: I am an adopted son. My adoptive father died early, and my adoptive mother is naturally unruly. After the Anti-Japanese War, Wang Mou coveted my adoptive father's inheritance and cohabited with my adoptive mother, pretending to be the head of the family. He is also insidious, addicted to gambling, and does not engage in proper business. He constantly provokes my mother-son relationship and induces my adoptive mother to use high-pressure tactics. Since then, my life has become increasingly difficult. I had no choice but to submit a request to my adoptive mother last month to divide the jointly owned property based on the property division settlement record of the Jiangsu Higher Court in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], but was rejected. At the same time, my adoptive mother stopped all living supplies, obviously with the intention of embezzling the jointly owned property. I hope that your column will uphold justice and provide some guidance.

Lawyer Duanmu Kai replied: If you are indeed an adopted son, you can request your adoptive mother for your adoptive father's inheritance in accordance with Article 1142 of the Civil Code. If you are refused and the family meeting cannot resolve the matter, you can only seek legal judgment.

Che Mingzheng asked: On December 5th of last year, the municipal government announced the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rent Standard. Our landlord and sub-landlord should have no problem in principle, but the matter has not been resolved yet. Please give me a reply based on reason so that I can follow. The landlord has not been collecting rent since October of last year. Although the municipal government announced the new law on December 5th, they insist on collecting according to the new law from October, ignoring the law. Please ask from which month should I pay? The new regulations stipulate that the wartime rent should be calculated at 60 times the pre-war rent, but the pre-war water bills, miscellaneous fees, and repair fees were all included. Now the landlord no longer cares about these three fees. Please ask whether they should be deducted before calculating 60 times, or should they not be deducted? The landlord does not want to deduct them now, but the sub-landlord wants to deduct them, so the matter cannot be resolved. Please give a public reply.

Lawyer Duanmu Kai replied: (1) According to the principle that laws do not apply retroactively, you should pay according to the new law from December. (2) Whether water bills, miscellaneous fees, and repair fees should be deducted for calculation depends on whether the original lease specified each of these fees separately.

Wang Yifang asked: (1) Pre-war small national currency deposits in banks; (2) Central Savings Association's fixed-term lottery savings; (3) Packages lost by postal bureaus, railway bureaus, and other agencies during the war. How should the compensation be assessed?

Lawyer Duanmu Kai replied: It should be handled in accordance with government orders.

Zhang Jie asked: I am a former judicial officer. I never joined any enemy or puppet organizations during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. I heard that I can re-register. Is this true? Please reply!

Lawyer Duanmu Kai replied: You can register with the High Court.
