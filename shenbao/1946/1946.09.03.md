### Dispatch of Envoy Wu and Zhang to Return to the Capital; Five-Person Group to Begin Talks Tomorrow; Agenda Limited to the Number of Seats for the Communist Party in the Government Committee

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Ambassador Stuart flew from Shanghai at 11:30 AM on the 2nd, arriving in Beijing and immediately going to the embassy to rest. He only went out once in the afternoon and had no political activities. The Ambassador originally hoped to meet with Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng, who were returning to Beijing from Guling, for an informal pre-opening meeting of the group, but since Wu and Zhang only arrived in Beijing in the afternoon, he rescheduled the meeting for 10:00 AM on the 3rd at the embassy to exchange views. Furthermore, Zhou Enlai called the Ambassador from Shanghai on the night of the 1st, intending to return to Beijing by special plane, and called again on the morning of the 2nd to say that he would postpone the trip due to business, but he would definitely arrive in Beijing on the morning of the 3rd. The Ambassador has scheduled a meeting with Zhou for 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, and the formal talks are scheduled to begin at the embassy on the 4th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng, Minister Zhang Lisheng, and Vice Minister Hong Lanyou returned to Beijing from Guling together at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. The reporter visited Mr. Wu at his private residence in the evening. Mr. Wu was sitting in the courtyard enjoying the cool air, holding a palm-leaf fan. His tone was calm when talking to the reporter, reflecting his attitude toward the current situation. It is reported that his trip to Guling with Minister Zhang was to consult with the Chairman regarding the informal group meeting, and they hope that this meeting can be convened as soon as possible. It has now been decided to meet with Ambassador Stuart on the morning of the 3rd to exchange views before the meeting. Secondly, we are deeply moved by the mediation efforts of Mr. Marshall and Mr. Stuart in the peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Finally, he stated that the theme of this meeting should be the reorganization of the National Government Committee, as it is the key to all problems. If a good agreement can be reached on this theme, other problems can be easily solved. Because the Kuomintang is currently the ruling party and other parties are in the opposition, if the reorganization of the National Government Committee is completed, all parties will be in the government, and everyone can handle all issues as masters. When the reporter asked his views on this meeting, Mr. Wu said: We have great confidence that an agreement will be reached, and we believe that this meeting will have good results. When the reporter further inquired about the Communist Party's external rhetoric, emphasizing that if there is no guarantee of an immediate ceasefire after the reorganization of the National Government, and the government does not withdraw the five demands, then this meeting will be in vain, what is his opinion? Mr. Wu said: I sincerely hope that they will not insist on it.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The reporter visited Minister Zhang Lisheng on the evening of the 2nd. According to him, the Chairman summoned him three times in Guling. The Chairman's instructions for the informal group meeting were that some issues have already been decided by the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), and only the implementation is in question. The number of seats in the National Government Committee has also been decided, that is, the Kuomintang will occupy half of the forty seats in the Government Committee, and the current discussion is only about the distribution of the remaining seats to other parties. This meeting will take this as the only topic, and he hopes that everyone will think more about the future of the country and the nation, so that peace and independence can be realized. If other issues are raised, it will be beyond the original agenda, and he sincerely hopes that not too much will be involved. At the same time, he expressed that he did not want to express any opinions before the formal opening of this meeting.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng said: The five-person group was established specifically to discuss the issue of reorganizing the National Government Committee, so the scope of the agenda is limited to the issue of the number of seats for discussing communist parties to participate in the government committee, and does not involve other issues. Mr. Wu continued: Since the closing of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), the reorganization of the National Government Committee has not been realized because an agreement has not been reached on the issue of the number of seats for various parties to participate in the government, and the list has not been submitted. At the same time, the list of National Assembly representatives of various parties has not been submitted, resulting in the postponement of the National Assembly. Therefore, based on past experience, the discussion of the five-person group regarding the distribution of the National Government list in the future will inevitably involve disputes and difficulties. However, recently, all parties seem to have a realization that if the reorganization of the National Government had already been realized, and representatives of various parties had participated in the government and were responsible for solving various problems, then the situation in China might be better than it is today. Currently, all parties have expressed that they do not object to conducting negotiations on reorganizing the government. If everyone meets with sincerity, even if there are some difficulties, it is hoped that a solution can be reached.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] According to the spokesperson of the Communist Party delegation: Zhou Enlai is not optimistic about the informal group meeting. He also said that the two prerequisite opinions must be resolved before the meeting, otherwise, we will not be able to discuss any other issues.

### Baker Discusses the Current Situation in China; Closely Resembles the American Civil War; Recognizes the CCP as a Land Reform Party

[Central News Agency, New York, 1st] San Francisco News: Baker, who has long been engaged in relief work in China, recently told the San Francisco Public Welfare Society that the current situation in China closely resembles the American Civil War, and the various problems facing Chairman Chiang are almost the same as those encountered by Lincoln at the time. Baker said at a luncheon meeting of Pacific Coast business leaders that Lincoln's attitude towards military rebellion was almost the same as Chairman Chiang's. Lincoln also lacked unanimous support at the time, and the only condition for peace was unification. If this condition was rejected, his troops would advance to the rebellious states, and he was accused of starting a war. Chairman Chiang has insisted on establishing a national army. If there are two independent armies in one country at the same time, then it cannot be called a unified country. Those who protected the slave system in the United States during Lincoln's era were noisy for a while, and now those who protect the CCP in the United States are also very noisy. They praise the virtues of the Communist Party and condemn the sins of the Kuomintang. Baker finally pointed out that although Mao Zedong claims that the CCP is a real communist party, the CCP is still a land reform party.

Jialing Zhoujiacun in the southeast of the city and Majunying in the east of the city have been lost. The Fulu Police Academy in the east of the city was also lost yesterday. Currently, Chu Xichun's department has completely retreated to the city. Although there is no report of the loss of the airfield in the southeast of the city, since there are no defenders in the southeast of the city, it should have been attacked by the Communist Army.

Commander Mu Xinya, commander of the Fifth Division, reported to Ma Zhanshan that he was feeling unable to support it.

### Gansu's Five-Person Group Visits Chief Sun; Scheduled to go to Zhangjiakou Today to Inquire About Opinions

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] The Gansu Five-Person Group visited Sun Lianzhong, the chief of the Eleventh War Zone, at 4:30 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd to solicit his opinions on resolving the Anping incident. Sun expressed that the occurrence of the Anping incident was unfortunate for Sino-US friendship, and he sincerely hoped that the group would complete its investigation work as soon as possible to seek a fair and reasonable solution. Sun then excused himself due to official business and instructed Deputy Chief of Staff Gao Songyuan and Huang Rencai, the commissioner of the Fifth Administrative Region, to answer the group's inquiries on his behalf. Gao solemnly answered Colonel Martin's inquiry that the National Army did not participate in the July 29th incident, and the US military did not assist the National Army. During the inquiry on the 2nd, regarding whether Anping was a liberated area, Gao said: After the victory, Xianghe and Baodi in eastern Hebei were both areas of the National Army. After the January 13th truce order, the Communist Army captured Xianghe on August 8th. The Hebei Provincial Government and the Chief's Office requested the Executive Headquarters to mediate, but no results were obtained. After January 18th, Xianghe County was forced to withdraw west of the North Canal. Occasionally, the Communist Army would cross the canal to search for supplies to the west. In order to ensure the safety of the Pingjin Highway, the Chief's Office often sent troops to patrol, and US military vehicles often passed through. On June 2nd, the Xianghe Police Corps stationed in Anping Town was transferred to Shicao due to housing adjustment and training reasons. Gao finally said that not every place in the National Army's garrison area is constantly garrisoned, so it cannot be called a liberated area just because the National Army does not garrison troops. Huang Rencai, the commissioner of the Fifth Region, said that Xianghe was one of the counties received by the Fifth Region after the victory. On December 26th, Ban Zhangru, the magistrate of Xianghe County, arrived in the county town to take over the county administration from the puppet county magistrate. In January of this year, after half a month of war, the Communist Army captured Xianghe, and Ban Zhangru led the local team to withdraw to Anping.

### Xiong Shihui Receives Our Newspaper Reporter, Discusses Plans for the Future of the Northeast, Reception Work Should Not Be Delayed

[Our Newspaper, 2nd Dispatch] On the eve of the first anniversary of the September 3rd victory, our newspaper reporter interviewed Director Xiong of the Northeast Headquarters, inquiring about the grand plans for the future of the Northeast. Xiong stated: The fruits of the national revolutionary war of resistance are extremely precious, and all Chinese people must cherish them. If this can be done, the success of national construction is not the most difficult. Because some people have a weak national concept and implement deceptive tricks, causing the current chaotic situation, my personal opinion is that the media should strive to clarify right and wrong and correct perspectives. The reporter then asked Xiong about the fact that some provinces in the Northeast have not yet been received. Xiong said: The people of the Northeast have endured fourteen years of puppet rule. If the government understands the suffering of the people, it should seek a solution as soon as possible. If it cannot be received by peaceful means, then it should be received by military means. In short, it should not be delayed for a long time, leaving the people to suffer in deep water and fiery heat. Regarding diplomatic and political aspects, in the Northeast, except for Jinzhou, which was recovered at the end of last year, Jilin and Liaobei have been recovered for a shorter period, and Shenyang has only been recovered for half a year. During the military period, all facilities cannot be as expected, but the responsible personnel in all departments can review and improve them at any time.

### Hebei-Chahar Investigation Team Sends Letter to Tianjin Mayor, Offering Opinions on the Wang Xijun Case

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 1st Dispatch] Before leaving Tianjin, the Reception Work Investigation Team sent a letter to Mayor Zhang, offering opinions on the Wang Xijun case of the Public Utilities Bureau. The original letter stated: "We recently heard that Your Excellency, the Mayor, gave a speech to the employees of the Public Utilities Bureau regarding the Wang Qianjun corruption case, scolding the whistleblower as not being born of parents, and stating that there would be a thorough investigation, etc. The colleagues of this team deeply believe that this is not the case. In recent years, corruption has been rampant, and the reception process has been particularly lax. This is due to the corruption of officials and the abandonment of laws and regulations. However, the general public, turning a blind eye and failing to report, is also a major cause of the growth of corruption. After the victory, the Chairman visited and set up secret reporting mailboxes to encourage people to report corruption in order to correct the situation from top to bottom and eradicate corruption. The provisions of this team's investigation methods stipulate that receiving reports from the people is based on this principle. Moreover, this report has no ulterior motive, so all whistleblowers, unless they are making false accusations out of resentment, are good citizens who distinguish right from wrong and excellent civil servants who are unwilling to associate with the corrupt. The government agencies should maintain them to cultivate the integrity of the country. If they are discriminated against, it will not only violate the Chairman's intentions and hinder the investigation work, making it impossible for politics to be clear forever, but also involve suspicion of protecting corruption. Your Excellency, the Mayor, must share our views. We would like to know whether the speech given by Your Excellency to the employees of the Public Utilities Bureau is true, and we hope to receive a reply."

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd Dispatch] The Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Area Reception Work Investigation Team worked in Tianjin for two weeks and returned to Beiping from Tianjin on the morning of the 1st.

### Exemption of Field Tax in Rear Provinces Changed to a Two-Year Average Exemption, Other Government Tax and Borrowing Work Handled by Region

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 2nd Dispatch] The Executive Yuan recently drafted measures for collecting and borrowing grain, and issued a circular to all provinces to comply with them.

Grain collection and lending guidance areas will be set up nationwide, and the grain collection and lending work will be supervised by the area. C.

The districts under the city are mostly intertwined with the neighboring counties, and it seems inappropriate to start collecting half a month earlier than the neighboring counties, so the city government has considered collecting at the same time as the counties, and the old debts of previous years will also be collected at the same time after the collection begins.

Editorial

### One Year Since Japan's Surrender

This day last year, the signing of Japan's surrender on the deck of the American warship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay was a significant turning point in human history. Since then, a distinct era in human history has ended, and a new chapter has begun.

The arrogant Japanese militarists knelt on this day last year. Representing the Japanese militarists, who are now detained in Sugamo Prison and listed as war criminals, the former Chief of Staff of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, Yoshijiro Umezu, along with Mamoru Shigemitsu, the representative of the Japanese government, silently signed their names on the instrument of surrender on this American warship, under the gaze of Allied Supreme Commander General Douglas MacArthur and delegations from various Allied nations, and then quietly departed. This signature not only represented the belief that justice will inevitably triumph over tyranny, shattering the myth among the Japanese people that the Japanese army had never been conquered by foreign forces and that Japanese territory had never been invaded by foreign powers throughout their history. This signature also represented the decline of an empire and the beginning of a new era in human history. In the hearts of the Chinese people, the scene on the USS Missouri holds particularly profound significance. It was the complete settlement of Japan's aggression against China over the past fifty years, washing away the humiliation we had endured since 1895. Since then, Japan has been under Allied control, and a year has passed in the blink of an eye. Today, as we commemorate this significant day, and reflect on the evolution of the global situation over the past year, we cannot help but feel a multitude of emotions. We offer a few words to encourage mutual vigilance.

First and foremost, we must express our respect and admiration for General MacArthur, who bears the practical responsibility for Allied control of Japan. This five-star general, the liberator of the Philippines, is not only an outstanding military leader but also a great statesman with a deep understanding of the situation in Japan. He is indeed the most suitable person to bear the practical responsibility for controlling Japan. Under General MacArthur's control over the past year, we have seen various signs that Japan is moving towards democratization. The holding of general elections, the dissolution of financial cliques, the improvement of feudal tenant relations, and the amendment of the constitution and other laws are all symbols of Japan's movement towards democratization. Although their progress may not have reached the ideal speed, and their scope may not be entirely as we would like, Japan is indeed changing, moving from the tyranny of militarist rule and feudalism towards democratization. These changes cannot be achieved in a short period. Given the depth of the Japanese people's poisoning, this kind of change requires a longer period to complete. General MacArthur's steady yet very proactive policies, which allow the Japanese people to have ample opportunities for re-education and enable Japan's democratization to have a solid foundation, are indeed very timely.

Looking at the world from Japan's perspective, the turmoil and instability of the past year cannot help but make people uneasy. In this turbulent world, the clash of ideologies is the primary cause of all the instability. Now that the Axis powers have been defeated, some countries still adhere to power politics, believing that world peace can only be maintained if the entire world adheres to the same ideology. Is this starting point really that different from the Japanese militarists' "Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof"? On the eve of the first anniversary of Japan's surrender, General MacArthur's statement specifically pointed this out, and its significance is extremely profound. General MacArthur began by saying, "It has been a year since Japan signed the instrument of surrender on the USS Missouri, and now the world is shrouded in a shadow of fear and unease due to the erosion of harmful ideologies." He continued, "If we allow this kind of thinking to spread unchecked, then individual freedom will disappear without a trace. Those who have long been indoctrinated by the extreme right wing are often easily captured by extreme left-wing ideologies." And finally, he reminded us of Japan's future role in the world: will it become a bastion of peace, or will it turn into a springboard for war? This warning is truly worth pondering. The Japanese people have long been under the indoctrination of extreme right-wing ideologies, and the shift from extreme right to extreme left is as easy as turning one's hand. Whether General MacArthur's policy of controlling Japan will succeed, we must look at it from a long-term perspective and see if it can prevent the kind of change that he himself has observed.

Here, however, we must also point out that although many of the main figures of Japanese aggression are listed as war criminals and will soon receive their due punishment, the remnants of Japanese militarism can still spread and circulate among the Japanese people. The execution of militarist leaders does not necessarily mean the death of the Japanese military. Although the Japanese military has been formally dissolved in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration, the young officers who formed the backbone of the Japanese military still exist among the Japanese people. The training and ideologies of these people are no different from those of Prussian officers. Under the Treaty of Versailles, the defeated Prussian officers were able to rebuild the German army. How could the Japanese young officers scattered among the Japanese people not be dreaming and waiting for their opportunity? The Prussian concept of war is deeply ingrained in the hearts of Japanese young officers. In their minds, the end of World War II may be just the end of a battle, not the end of the war.

It is under the mutual erosion of these remnants of militarism and other harmful ideologies, as General MacArthur has said, that the true democratization of Japan will be threatened. We are confident that under the General's wise policies, these threats will not prevent the true democratization of Japan. Only under the circumstances of Japan's thorough democratization can the Japanese people themselves and world peace benefit from it.

Alas, the Man-Made Unemployed!

The great wheel of the era is constantly turning. Our environment is also constantly undergoing various changes, closely following this great wheel. Those who can adapt to these changes, innovate, and adjust to the new environment are called the fittest, while those who lag behind the times will inevitably be eliminated by nature. This is a very obvious and common principle.

However, "the observer sees clearly, while the person in the midst of it is confused." Those who are in the midst of the situation, clinging to old habits and reluctant to change, often follow the old ways, which is contrary to the trend of the times. This leads to many tragedies of failure and resentment. We deeply sympathize with these victims of the times. But their inertia is too deep, and their vision is too short. They only blame heaven and earth, and never change, so they ultimately cannot avoid the final tragic scene.

It has only been a short year since the victory. But the street vendors, the employees of massage parlors, the three-wheeled fish cart operators, and the dance hall owners have almost all disappeared with the tide. The back scrubbers, foot massagers, and rickshaw pullers are still struggling. There are also many middlemen, the so-called "brokers" in Shanghai, who were once prominent, but now, in these extraordinary times, as a result of direct allocation or the promotion of cooperation, have had to become victims of the times. These are all the results of socio-economic changes, which are inevitable and not intentionally caused by any party. Only by accurately assessing the situation and opportunely improving.

However, let's go back to the topic. If these sacrifices are indeed the result of socio-economic changes, we sincerely feel helpless. But if it is due to policy innovation and man-made causes, then it is worth considering carefully before making decisions and implementing them. That is, from the point of view of the matter itself, is it necessary to implement this? If it is considered necessary to implement, is it necessary to implement it immediately at this time and place, and is there a proper and appropriate arrangement? "Bad, I do my thing, and the life and death of the people are of no concern!"

The current economic problem and unemployment problem are really too serious! If it is not really necessary, it seems that it is not worth further increasing the severity of people's unemployment at this time. At this time and place, the best policy is to enable the people to recuperate and live in peace for a while. Last year, the police department planned to ban back scrubbing and foot massage, but later ordered a postponement, which was indeed an unbiased and very wise move. In terms of adapting to the times, it is especially worthy of our praise. Now we often hear a kind of specious argument, that is, on the one hand, strengthening the destruction of the status quo and increasing unemployment, and on the other hand, saying very simply that it can be taken care of by a certain organization for relief, as if the two sides can do their own thing. In fact, if you want to destroy, why provide relief? If you feel unable to provide relief, why destroy so much at once? Moreover, what organizations does the government have now that are always preparing to specialize in providing relief to those who are unemployed? We always feel that in the way of governing, the factors of time and place must always be considered first. This is the only task of a politician!

### Preliminary Results of Greek Referendum Revealed: Royalists Hold Overwhelming Advantage; King George II's Restoration No Longer a Problem

[Report from Our Newspaper, Combined News] Under close observation by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the referendum to determine whether Greece should be a democratic republic or a constitutional monarchy was held on the 1st, with over 1.5 million voters. During the voting process, although clashes between left-wing and right-wing groups occurred in various locations, resulting in deaths and injuries, the overall situation was generally good. According to a report from the Associated Press yesterday (2nd), the results of voting in various districts have been successively revealed. Although there are still no official statistics at present, based on general estimates, approximately 70% to 80% of the votes support a constitutional monarchy. The restoration of King George II seems to be no longer a problem, but when he will return to the country has not yet been determined. The government announced on the 2nd that a total of 1,207,000 votes were counted, of which 924,540 votes supported the monarchy. However, the opposition party, consisting of three parties, held a meeting on the morning of the 2nd and decided to issue a statement denying the results of this vote, believing that there were irregularities, so they "will continue to fight for the establishment of a democratic republic."

Slavic Bloc's Attempts Backfire

Regarding this referendum, the "Resistance" newspaper in Paris published an article on the 1st analyzing why the royalists gained an overwhelming advantage, which was quite accurate. The article stated that the Greek left-wing originally could have won the referendum a few months ago, but due to the recent changes in the international situation, it has made the restoration of the monarchy in Greece possible. Although King George V has been accused of having a "pro-fascist attitude," under the direction of the Soviet Union, the representatives of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria at the Paris Peace Conference, and the representative of Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council in New York, separately launched offensives against Greece, which instead aroused the spirit of unity among the Greek people to cope with the threat of encirclement by Slavic nations.

### Byrnes and British Foreign Secretary Hold Important Talks Yesterday; Committee Discusses Trieste Port Issue in Italian Treaty

### Ceasefire Expires, Compromise Hopeless; Fighting Begins in Central Luzon; Cannon Fire Heard 50 Miles from Manila

[Central News Agency, Manila, 1st Special Dispatch] The ceasefire in central Luzon expired at midnight yesterday. The land occupied by the Hukbalahap forces was bombarded by enemy artillery. Two large armies from Nueva Ecija province and Tarlac province are attacking the concentrated areas controlled by the Communist-led Hukbalahap forces. The Hukbalahap forces are in danger of being surrounded. Malacañang Palace announced that President Roxas has received a telegram from Taruc, the supreme leader of the Hukbalahap, in which the wording is in effect a declaration of war against the government. The president has replied with a sternly worded response, stating that there is no possibility of compromise with those who violate the law. The president has notified the supreme leader of the Hukbalahap that arrest warrants have been issued for him on charges of murder. Philippine congressmen, with a few exceptions, yesterday all agreed to carry out punitive expeditions against the rebels in central Luzon. Although Manila is filled with rumors of panic and the sound of cannon fire can be heard 50 miles away, the atmosphere in the city this morning is still calm.

### Wellington Koo Delivers Speech at American Legion Convention

[United Press, Wheeling, West Virginia, USA, 2nd] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wellington Koo said in a speech at the American Legion national convention today: The current world situation is different from the past, and new problems have arisen as a result. These problems must also be solved with new and different methods. The post-war world is a new world, and the work of peace has only begun in Paris. Based on its current progress, it is impossible to predict when the treaty can be signed and when the world can focus on reconstruction.

### Eisenhower Calls for Breaking Down Human Barriers and Promoting Good Neighborliness

[United Press, Lincoln City, 1st] Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower gave a speech to veterans here today, enthusiastically calling for the implementation of global good neighborliness, and saying that no people in any country want another global war. However, if the people of one country want to divide the peoples of two countries, they cannot become friends. Eisenhower did not specify which country he was referring to, but he was clearly referring to the Soviet Union and its allies. Eisenhower also said that it is useless to develop a one-sided spirit of good neighborliness by using strong barriers of humanity to separate one part of the people from other peoples. This is a matter of life and death, a disturbing problem, and we must face it head-on. It is puzzling why an attitude of kindness is rejected, and why the preparation of aid is put aside. Earlier, Eisenhower told reporters that he did not think the US military was demobilizing too quickly, and that 600,000 to 700,000 regular troops stationed abroad by the United States in 1948 would retire.

### Members of Indian Interim Government Sworn in Yesterday; Muslims Hang Black Flags in Protest; Major Riots Continue in Bombay

[Report from Our Newspaper, Combined News] The seven main members of the Indian interim government were formally sworn in yesterday (2nd) morning. According to Reuters, the cabinet is allocated as follows:

Foreign Affairs and Federal Affairs: Nehru (President of the Congress Party)

Defense: Singh (President of the Congress Party)

Home Affairs (including Intelligence and Broadcasting): Patel (Congress Party)

Finance: Matthai (Indian Christian)

Transportation (Transport and Railways): Asaf Ali (Muslim)

Agriculture and Food: Prasad (Congress Party)

Labor: Ram (President of the Depressed Classes Federation)

Health, Education, and Arts: Ammatgan (Muslim)

Legislation, Post and Aviation: Sakhir (Muslim)

Industry and Supply: Rajagopalachari (Congress Party)

Works, Mines, and Power: Bhabha (Congress Party)

Commerce: Babar (Leader of the Parsi Community)

The inauguration ceremony was held at 11:00 AM on the 2nd in the square of the Viceroy's House in New Delhi. During the ceremony, Muslims climbed to the top of a 120-foot gate opposite the Viceroy's House and raised a black flag to show contempt and protest, but it was soon discovered and pulled down by the police. After the ceremony, Nehru came out onto the balcony and received enthusiastic cheers from the thousands of people below. However, because the Muslim League did not participate in the interim government and firmly expressed its unwillingness to cooperate, the day the new government was established was also the time when riots broke out across the country. According to Reuters, riots broke out in Bombay on the 1st, resulting in nearly 300 deaths and injuries. The Bombay government has declared a state of emergency. The turmoil was caused by the Muslim League instructing Muslims to hang black flags to show contempt for the Indian interim government, which led to demonstrations and clashes.

According to a report from the Associated Press, the Bombay riots have spread to new areas. As a result of the clashes between Indian and Muslims on the afternoon of the 2nd, at least sixty people have died. When the military police entered the disturbed areas, they were pelted with stones by the crowd. The police then opened fire in self-defense. Martial law has been implemented in the city, and at least 500 people have been arrested. About 200 people have been injured, 20 of whom are seriously injured.

Internal Strife Harms the Nation

Nehru, the leader of the new government, expressed deep regret for this kind of internal strife, saying, "We are still moving forward towards our goals, and the future is still very difficult." He expressed regret that "the Muslim League has taken another path," and said, "We still continue to hope for their cooperation, and the door to cooperation will always be open." According to the Associated Press, Nehru may lead the Indian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference for a short stay.

Ali Khan, one of the leaders of the Muslim League, said at a mass rally in Hol province on the 1st, "The direct action of the Muslim League is intended to make it impossible for the Nehru government to exercise its powers. We should launch a movement to refuse to pay rent, and politically and socially boycott Hindus and British people. We should also implement a scorched earth policy so that the Hindus cannot obtain the surplus grain in the Muslim areas."

Wang Shutao Delivers Speech

This City News: Wang Shutao, the director-general of the China-India Society, who recently came to Shanghai from Chongqing, told a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday that China and India have had relations for more than a thousand years. They have lived side by side without any wars, and the Himalayas have not hindered the exchange of culture. We are very pleased that India has achieved initial independence. In the future, China and India will join hands and cooperate, which will be a stabilizing force for world peace. Regarding the internal disputes in India, Wang believes that India will be able to resolve them itself, because the Indian nation has strong endurance. In the future, it may adopt a similar federal system and establish a great unified country. It is also heard that Dai Jitao and Zhu Jiahua, the supervisors and directors of the association, will send congratulatory telegrams.

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek Sends Congratulatory Telegram

[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] Among the congratulatory telegrams received by Nehru was one from Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, which read: "We wish you success. We are paying close attention to the situation in India, and we congratulate you on your past achievements."

### Tito Apologizes to the US for the Incident of Shooting Down American Planes

### The Interior Ministry Announced a Revival Plan Yesterday

Most People Will Engage in Agriculture

[United Press Tokyo, 2nd] The Interior Ministry today announced a detailed five-year revival plan that will ensure that 60% of the Japanese people will be engaged in agricultural work after five years. The plan is based on the assumption that Japan's population will reach 80 million by 1950 and aims to transform the Japanese people's lives into an agricultural nation. In terms of industry, it will be limited to what is permitted in the peace treaty. According to the Interior Ministry's forecasts, Japan can be approximately 85% self-sufficient in food, with 85 million dou of grain imported annually from overseas offset by export trade. If this plan is implemented, Japan's unemployment problem can be solved. The population of major cities will be maintained at their current levels, and no new households will be allowed to move in. Reconstruction work will focus on smaller cities and rural areas. The number of Japanese people who will find work as a result of the revival plan will be 38 million, of which 20 million will be engaged in agriculture and fishing, and the rest will be engaged in industry and mining. In terms of industry, 6.3 million workers will be employed, a decrease of 3 million from the wartime peak. Factories and schools will be redistributed to adapt to this change.

### Nehru's Sister to Serve as Indian Representative

Attending the United Nations General Assembly

[Reuters New Delhi, 1st] Nehru's sister, Mrs. Pandit, will lead the Indian delegation to the United Nations organization meetings, representing India's protest against South Africa's discrimination against Indian residents. Mrs. Pandit is currently the Minister of Public Health of the United Provinces, the first Indian woman to serve as a cabinet member in a province.

### The Soviet Union's Ambitions Are Worrying; U.S. Military Forces in the Pacific Are Insufficient for Self-Defense; U.S. House Military Committee Issues Warning

[United Press San Francisco, 1st] Six members of the House Military Committee who inspected Tokyo issued a warning, saying: "A second Pearl Harbor incident is imminent." They expressed concern about Soviet ambitions and admitted that the U.S. military presence in the Pacific is insufficient for self-defense. Looking at the map of the North Pacific, the U.S. outer defense line is based on Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, Japan, and southern Korea, with a small number of troops stationed in North China. Behind this defense line are Guam, Saipan, Okinawa, the Philippines, and other bases. The Soviet Union, to the west of the Aleutians, has Commander Island, the Primorsky Krai, the Kuril Islands, Sakhalin Island, Siberia, northern Korea, and Lushun Dalian. The positions of both sides are now facing each other remotely. In terms of military strength, the U.S. Pacific Fleet is strong, far beyond the reach of the Soviet Union's few submarines. Although the Komsomolsk port in the Primorsky Krai has equipment for building larger warships, it cannot catch up. However, the Soviet army in Siberia far exceeds the total U.S. military strength in the western Pacific in terms of numbers. The whereabouts of the 750,000 Japanese soldiers captured by the Soviet Union in Northeast China are still unknown. Will they fight for the Soviet Union? This is still a matter of doubt. The most important question is the air force. Although the Soviet Union was the first to train paratrooper units before the war, with the invention of long-range bombers and air transport units in World War II, it is difficult to determine what use paratroopers still have. The strength of the Soviet air force, apart from its own fighter planes and aircraft acquired under the U.S. Lend-Lease Act, is unknown. The U.S. Air Force has made amazing progress, which is a visible fact. The B-29 Superfortress has become a thing of the past after the invention of the B-36 Stratofortress. Unmanned aircraft have also been successfully tested. The joint defense exercises between the United States and Canada in the Arctic Ocean are being conducted on a large scale, and both sides are engaged in V-2 rocket experiments. Finally, the United States has created the atomic bomb, while the Soviet Union is still researching it.

### First Anniversary of the Occupation of Japan; MacArthur Issues Proclamation Yesterday; Tokyo Spends the Day Quietly Without Ceremonies; Nimitz Simultaneously Issues a Warning

[United Press Tokyo, 2nd] MacArthur issued a proclamation today on the first anniversary of the occupation of Japan, mentioning the crisis of the struggle between democracy and communism in Japan. It stated briefly: What kind of concept will post-war re-educated Japan form? The answer to this question has a profound impact on the fate of mankind and the future of civilization. The conflict of ideas in Japan is not unfavorable to those seeking a democratic path in accordance with the intentions of the Potsdam Declaration. The Japanese people, who have long been trained in extremely conservative right-wing theories, may easily be confused by radical theories. Democratic thought is the crystallization of human rights, justice, and integrity, and will be the cornerstone of Japanese freedom, unless it is destroyed and suppressed by the intrusion of hostile ideologies that despise individual dignity. The Japanese people's faith has been disillusioned by defeat in the war. Everything they believed in and lived for has been declared disintegrated. American soldiers came with excellent self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-control, implying to the Japanese people the hypocrisy of their former beliefs, thus causing a spiritual revolution, which is an unparalleled great change in the history of world society. If this spiritual reform is encouraged and given the opportunity to develop, its foundation will be deeper and more lasting than that entrusted to false beliefs. However, extreme ideas often gain the belief and support of true liberals due to incorrect propaganda and attractive slogans. Much has been achieved in the past year, but much remains to be done, proving that the power of democracy promotes lasting peace, and there have been significant gains. This gain must be consolidated and expanded. The way to do this requires patience and determination to shape the lives and institutions of the Japanese people based on the best social concepts and political standards. The goal is very great, because the strategic location of the Japanese islands, if not becoming a strong shield of peace, will become a springboard for war.

[United Press Washington, 2nd] On the first anniversary of Japan's formal surrender, the U.S. conscription agency appropriately began its activities again to maintain the strength of the army as stipulated. Conscription will now be distributed to various stations in order to convene 25,000 young men aged 19 to 29, who will enlist in September after a two-month "conscription holiday."

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 2nd, United Press] Today is the anniversary of Japan's surrender, but there were no special commemorative ceremonies here. Most of the Allied organizations stopped working, but this was because Labor Day happened to coincide with the anniversary of the signing of the surrender document on the USS Missouri. Neither Americans nor Japanese held special programs. MacArthur worked as usual, spending the whole day holding meetings and doing other routine work. Japanese newspapers did not have editorials mentioning the anniversary, only the English-language Japan Times reminded the Japanese people that they have legal and moral obligations to the world to fulfill the Potsdam terms.

(Admiral Nimitz)

[This newspaper] San Francisco, 2nd broadcast, Admiral Nimitz issued a warning on the first anniversary of Japan's surrender, saying: The United States must have force as a backing in order to achieve a just peace. "I believe that Byrnes' views expressed in the peace conference must have authority, and this must be supported by a strong navy."

### Moscow Holds Huge Commemorative Ceremony Today

[United Press London, 1st] Moscow Radio announced today a huge plan for the Soviet Union to commemorate the first anniversary of the victory over Japan on September 3. The squares and streets of the Soviet capital have been decorated, and there will be large-scale parades and entertainment programs at that time.

### Brazilian Prices Soar; Congress Holds Emergency Meeting

Disputes Among Legislators Escalate into a Martial Drama

[United Press Brazilian Capital, 1st] Riots broke out here yesterday due to popular resistance to high prices. This ancient city of joy has now implemented martial law. Troops are patrolling the entire city to prevent further clashes. As a result of yesterday's conflict, one person died, a hundred people were injured, and five hundred people were arrested. The authorities announced that all stores in the city will open tomorrow under the protection of the military police. Emergency measures are now being taken in all aspects to cope with the economic crisis. Prices have tripled, and the black market is rampant. At the same time, Congress also held an emergency meeting to investigate the reasons for the soaring prices, which turned into a martial drama due to heated debates. Former President and current Senator Vargas strongly refuted the point that the current crisis should be the responsibility of the former government and demanded that those who criticize him meet outside the conference hall. When a legislator accused the Vargas government of being responsible for the turmoil, Catholic priest and legislator Camara punched another legislator in the nose. Some people claim that Brazilian prices have increased by 300% since 1944, causing demonstrations by salary earners, students, and workers, which have escalated into riots.

### A Dose of Refreshment; Steadily Passing the Mid-Autumn Festival; Pei Tsu-yi Expresses Confidence; Resolving the Difficulties of the Industrial Sector; Satisfactory Result of the Appeals of Speakers Pan and Hsu; Decision to Handle Small-Scale Industrial Loans

[This newspaper] The Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Pan Kung-chan, and the Deputy Speaker, Hsu Chi-kuang, have exchanged opinions with some industrial and commercial councilors in recent days, all of whom believe that the current factories are facing many difficulties and crises, and the money is extremely tight. The industrial loans previously approved for each factory have also been temporarily suspended. In this case, the future is really unimaginable. The Municipal Council will not open until the 9th of this month, and the Mid-Autumn Festival is coming in an instant. If we do not seek a solution in advance, then it will be too late. Therefore, the participants unanimously decided to elect Pan and Hsu as representatives to meet with the President of the Executive Yuan, Sung Tzu-wen, and the Governor of the Central Bank, Pei Tsu-yi, to state the pain of the industrial sector and request relief.

Yesterday afternoon, Pan and Hsu met with Pei, who said: "I have always been concerned about the industrial sector. I had planned a small-scale industrial loan method a month ago. At that time, private financial circles participated in the discussion. The plan was reported to President Sung. However, due to the foreign exchange adjustment, we had to temporarily take austerity measures. On the 31st of last month, I submitted the plan to President Sung again, and it was approved. Now it has been handed over to the Business Bureau of this bank for processing. The loan method is to form a group of every ten money shops, which will be jointly responsible for each other. Anything related to industrial production can be applied to the Central Bank for rediscounting. The loan amount for each group is 150 million yuan."

After hearing about the method, Pan and Hsu immediately expressed: "(1) The loan target is small-scale industries, and the scope may be too narrow; (2) Ten money shops only get a loan of 150 million yuan, which is worth 15 million yuan per shop. If used for industrial production, the amount is too small, and we hope to relax the amount; (3) Many banks also make industrial loans, and we hope to cover all banks."

Pei replied: "(1) Most of the factories in Shanghai are small-scale industries. Except for the yarn factories that are profitable and do not need loans, other factories can be said to be small-scale industries; (2) Relaxing the loan amount will be considered; (3) When planning this method, it was stipulated that factories mostly have dealings with money shops. Now it is decided that each bank will also handle it according to the above method."

Finally, Pan and Hsu said again: "The finances of this city must strive for stability so that it can gradually restore its vitality. The industrial sector has many difficulties, and the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching. We hope to pass it safely. We especially hope to take into account Chairman Chiang's recent instructions: 'Production loans are not subject to austerity measures,' and do not implement austerity measures uniformly for the industrial sector." Pei replied: "The situation of the industrial sector will be paid attention to at any time. I am confident that there will be no financial accidents during this Mid-Autumn Festival. I will report the above situation to President Sung within today and tomorrow."

### Celebrating the Anniversary of Victory Today; 30,000 Consolation Items Distributed

The Shanghai Municipal Celebrations of the United Nations Victory Anniversary Conference is scheduled to be held at the Majestic Theatre at 9:00 a.m. today, and to comfort the national army and allied forces. General Gillon of the U.S. Headquarters and the heads of the Allied naval, land, and air forces stationed in Shanghai, and the consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai, were all invited to participate. Various agencies, schools, and community organizations in the city will send representatives to participate. The conference will be presided over by Mayor Wu Kuo-chen, Director Wu Shao-shu, Commander Hsuan Tie-wu, Speaker Pan Kung-chan, and Chairman Hsu Chi-kuang. The conference propaganda team has already prepared a special publication to celebrate, to be distributed at the venue. The consolation team has re-collected 30,000 consolation items, which are scheduled to be sent to the Sung-Pan Security Command this afternoon, and request that the department forward them to the national army stationed in Shanghai. At the same time, the first show of each movie theater and the day show of each Peking opera theater will be free to entertain the national army, in order to express their condolences.

### Dying for Justice and Freedom; Colleagues in the Press World; Pootung Commemorates Loyal Souls

During the Anti-Japanese War, the number of employees of North American businesses in Shanghai who were killed in action almost exceeded the total number in other parts of the country. Their tragic deaths and their commendable and tearful deeds were admired by people across the country. Shanghai's press colleagues held a memorial service for the martyrs of the Shanghai press who died in the Anti-Japanese War at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to commemorate the fifteen martyrs who died for justice and freedom, including Chu Hsing-kung. More than a hundred people attended, presided over by Pan Kung-chan and Cheng Chung-hang, standing supervisors of the Reporters Association, and assisted by Feng Yu-chen and others. In the center of the hall were the portraits and spirit tablets of Chu Hsing-kung, Chin Hua-ting, Chang Shih-hsu, Cheng Chen-chang, Shao Hsu-pai, Li Chun-ying, Feng Meng-yun, Chao Kuo-tung, Chen Tung-hsuan, Chou Wei-shan, Chin Chung-huan, Wu Hung-kuei, Chu Ming-chun, Wang An-lu, and Chen Kun-lin. In front of the stage were flower wreaths donated by Peng Hsueh-pei, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Hsiao Tung-tzu, President of the Central News Agency, and the Association of Field Reporters. Around the stage were full of elegiac couplets and banners. The Shanghai Journalists Association wrote: "Uprooting traitors and eliminating enemies, the universe moves and the wind and thunder sound; tough grass withstands the severe frost, always leaving behind a spirit of uprightness. Taking righteousness to achieve benevolence, the light shines in Shanghai; loyal hearts and green blood, always emitting fragrance." Shen Pao wrote: "The wind is high and the moon is dark, and the demon rope spirals; it is a pity that the stubborn scholar, ten steps of fragrant grass splashed with green blood. After the rain, the sky is clear, the stove smoke is ethereal; you should miss your relatives and kindred spirits, a cup of imperial wine sprinkled on the heroic spirit." In addition, newspapers such as Hsinwenpao, Central News Agency, Central Daily News, Ta Kung Pao, Minguo Daily, Wen Hui Pao, and Ta Wan Pao also made elegiac gifts.

Memorial Ceremony Begins

At 11 o'clock, the solemn and grand memorial ceremony began in mourning music. The presiding officer, Cheng Chung-hang, offered flowers and incense, and the whole body paid tribute to the martyrs. After silently mourning, the memorial text of the conference was read. The text read: "On September 2nd, the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Journalists Association and all colleagues in the press world respectfully offer clear drinks and fragrant flowers to the spirits of the martyrs who died in the Anti-Japanese War: The vast land of Yu, based on Kunlun, history is long, relatives are distant and neighbors are harmonious. The killing intent surges, and the Eastern Ying starts; the pigs and snakes wreak havoc on their invasion. The light of the fire is blazing, causing shock; the reeds are clear, the moon is cold, and the Shanghai poison clouds are heavy. The anti-Japanese army rises, and the whole country is united. News warriors hold pens in the front row, exposing the hidden, more strict than axes. Not afraid of the strong, they suffer poison; sacrificing their lives for the country, green phosphorescence and green blood. Great are the martyrs, loyal and bright as the sun and stars; meritorious achievements are obvious, glorious and brilliant. Victory has been achieved, and monuments are erected; bamboo and silk leave fragrance, forever admired. Souls, come back, enjoy this clear wine, alas, alas, may you enjoy it."

Cheng Chung-hang Reports

Cheng Chung-hang, the chairman, then gave a report, saying briefly: Shanghai is the center of education, culture, and news in the country. For fifty years, from the Xinhai Revolution to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, all major events in the country were launched in Shanghai. Shanghai's public opinion leads the country, and the encouragement and promotion of this Anti-Japanese War also caused great difficulties for press colleagues in the rear. For example, the great bombings of "May 3" and "May 4" in Chongqing in 1939. But no matter how crazy the enemy bombed, the newspapers in the rear did not stop publishing for a day until the victory. On the contrary, after the Allied air force bombed Osaka and Nagasaki in July last year, the enemy had no newspaper for three days. After hearing this news, we can be proud and believe that the victory of the Anti-Japanese War can be realized. The spirit shown in the press world can be seen. However, the spirit of colleagues in the occupied areas, especially in Shanghai, who fought against the enemy puppets, is beyond the reach of colleagues in the rear. When Mr. Zhang Ji-luan accepted the Missouri Award in 1941, he also specifically mentioned the great spirit of the Shanghai press world. This is because the rear has millions of troops to protect our editors and our speech. Although there are air raids, there are alarms so that we can calmly hide in air-raid shelters to avoid death. Colleagues in the occupied areas are not like this. They have no army to protect them and seek justice and peace in the midst of emergency alarms all day long. Now that victory has come, it is a successful struggle for world public opinion. In the United Nations Charter, the most important of the basic freedoms is freedom of speech. For the past eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the martyrs have sacrificed for basic freedom, human justice, and peace. Colleagues across the country should continue the spirit of the martyrs and strive for freedom of the press and basic human freedom.

Speaker Pan Speaks

Pan Kung-chan then spoke as the Speaker of the Municipal Council, saying that the martyrs of the press world sacrificed for the struggle for basic freedom. In the future, to establish basic freedom, we must use the power of the press world—newspapers—and the people's opinion organs—all levels of councils—to cooperate with the ability of truly representative organs of public opinion, and value the freedom that everyone should have, at any cost, to protect human freedom, so that we can embark on the road of democratic politics. The Shanghai press world has a history of several decades, and it has done a lot for the country, both tangible and intangible. The martyrs disregarded sacrifices to promote justice for the national family and fight for the freedom of the entire nation. Their contribution will be even greater in establishing the road of democracy. Westerners have a saying: "Give me liberty or give me death." The martyrs died for this spirit, for freedom. In the future, I hope that the press world and the Municipal Council will cooperate, with all their spirit, to seek to protect the spirit of freedom and to lay the foundation for democratic politics.

Demands of the Family Members

After Pan finished his speech, Chang Wei, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, on behalf of the city government, paid tribute to the martyrs and encouraged those who died later to promote the righteousness of the martyrs. Finally, Shao Hsieh-hua, a family member of the martyrs, gave a thank-you speech, saying briefly that the martyrs stood in the position of the press, exerted their strength, and sacrificed for the survival of the country and the freedom of the nation. Today, I would like to express my gratitude to you for holding such a grand memorial service. I would also like to make three concrete demands on behalf of the families of the martyrs, and please convey them to the government: (1) Most of the martyrs were not buried properly in the turmoil, please allocate land to build a public cemetery and bury them immediately. (2) Please help the society and protect the lives of family members and the education of children to comfort the spirits of the deceased. (3) The commendable and tearful deeds of the martyrs should be handed over to the National History Museum and adopted as teaching materials to promote righteousness, so that the deeds of the martyrs will not be buried and unknown. The conference ended at 12:10.

### The Investigation Team Accepts New Cases; 400 Billion Big Fraud

[This newspaper] The receiving work investigation team originally planned to leave Shanghai for Hangzhou yesterday (2nd), but because there were too many cases of complaints and secret reports accepted, it was difficult to end them for a while, so it was temporarily decided to postpone it for a week, scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 9th of this month. In this last week, the investigation team is focusing on thoroughly investigating a 400 billion yuan big fraud case. The team received a secret report a few days ago that there was fraud in the enemy puppet materials received and managed by the Municipal Government Materials Receiving Management Office. The value of these materials reached 40 billion yuan. The case involves many senior officials, and Zhang Qing-zhen, a member of the investigation team, is working hard to investigate the case.

### Interrogation of Han Jian Suspects; Two Puppet Members and One Factory Director

[This newspaper] The High Court yesterday heard three cases of Han Jian suspects: (1) Tao Tzu-wen, a member and acting section chief of the construction section of the puppet Shangchu County Government, cut down trees, demolished the scenic spot of Jin Gu Ting, and forcibly recruited laborers to build barracks and roads for the enemy during his tenure. After the victory, he was reported and arrested. He confessed in court yesterday that the barracks and roads were built before he took office, and he could request an investigation, etc. (2) Chen Da-fang, the owner of the Da Fang Machinery Factory, was accused of contacting the enemy's 1629th unit during the enemy puppet period, and in July last year, he drove a large number of copper blocks from the enemy's army in the racecourse to the factory and hid them. After the victory, he was secretly reported. The defendant confessed that the copper blocks were buried before the war and denied that he had contacted the enemy unit. (3) Le Chia-chun, an investigator of the Fifth Section of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau, was accused of extorting 40,000 yuan in puppet currency from the Yi Chang Silk Village on Shandong Road in this city with the puppet section chief Lo Ching-ho during the war. After the victory, he was reported and sentenced to five years by the High Court. The defendant refused to accept and appealed to the Nanjing Supreme Court. After being returned for a retrial, he confessed in court yesterday that the 40,000 yuan was not extorted, but was automatically sent as a festival gift. All of the above cases were adjourned for further hearing.

### Chen Ke-ming and Others Indicted

[Another message] Chen Ke-ming, Xie Wen-yuan, Shen Liang, Shen Bing-chen, Hsu Sen-fu, Huang Kuo-ming, Chu Yi-men, Chu Yung-nian, Hsu A-tao, Yi Li-chih, and others were reported to have rebellious behavior. After investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, they were prosecuted on suspicion of being Han Jian.

### Puppet Army Commander Li Bo-ying; Transferred to the Garrison Command Yesterday

[This newspaper] Li Bo-ying, the commander of the puppet Fifth Army, is now 49 years old and is from Anhui. He was arrested after the victory and detained in the High Prosecutor's Office in this city. After investigation, because the crime committed was a military crime, he was transferred to the Military Law Department of the Shanghai Garrison Command for interrogation yesterday afternoon.

### Chou Chi's Case of Suspected Rebellious Crime; The Film Shot by the Inspection Office

Film star Chou Chi, because he shot the film "Turning Back Is the Shore" during the enemy puppet period and played a role, was reported to the District Prosecutor's Office by the Dazhong Evening News. It is learned that the office has extracted the film from the Central Film Photography Studio and checked it to study what kind of poison the film contains.

### "Flower of Peace" - After All, China Ranks Among the Four Great Powers; Even Sentient Plants Compose a Chapter

[Special Report from This Newspaper] One summer seven years ago, lawyer Jin Gong discovered a potted "immortal's head" (also known as a cactus) at Wing On Company. After careful nurturing, it actually bloomed that year. The flower was white with a yellow center, possessing delicate, beautiful, cicada-like membranes within. Its stem resembled a trumpet, its form like an autumn chrysanthemum, and it was exquisitely fragrant. The flower bloomed between 8 and 9 p.m., and withered by noon the next day. In the following two years, although flower buds sprouted in profusion, they never opened. Since 1943, every summer, flowers have graced the plant, reliably blooming one at a time, reopening after wilting, with a maximum of three blooming simultaneously. Jin Gong used this to augur the fate of the nation, naming it the "Flower of Peace." Since the Japanese surrendered and victory was achieved, four flowers have bloomed simultaneously this year, which he believes signifies the image of the Four Great Powers. Heaven's will and human intention are surely not accidental. A photograph is included, along with this quatrain: "After all, China ranks among the Four Great Powers; even sentient plants compose a chapter. Heroes strive with all their might, heaven and earth are moved; the people have special honor, the nation has glory."

### Fake Official Demands Extortion and Opens Fire; Attempts to Escape by Crossing River; Gets Lost and is Captured

[Report from This Newspaper] A sentry of the Second Company, First Battalion, 436th Regiment, 146th Brigade of the Army, on guard duty near Longhua Airport, discovered a suspicious person attempting to cross a small river in the early morning of the first of this month, seemingly wanting to enter the airport, and immediately went forward to question him. Unexpectedly, this person turned and fled, discarding a pistol into the river. After the sentry pursued and captured him, he confessed his name was Chen Yonghui, twenty-seven years old, from Taipei. During the enemy puppet regime, he served as an economic advisor and secretary to the puppet government's Economic Commission. After the victory, he remained hidden in Shanghai. However, due to a lack of means to make a living, he broke into the home of a Westerner named Nash, a former assistant to the Shanghai Municipal Council and current representative of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in China, on Lin Sen West Road at 3 a.m. that day, demanding extortion without success, and fired three shots. Because the Westerner shouted for help, he fled in a panic, intending to detour back to his residence near Hongkou. However, due to unfamiliarity with the terrain, he mistakenly arrived at Longhua and was arrested. The suspect has now been handed over to the Garrison Headquarters. After interrogation by the military court, he will be transferred to the High Procuratorate for legal proceedings today.

### French Tram Company Stopped Service Yesterday; Protesting Unreasonable Arrest and Assault of Ticket Seller Liang Guanghui by Naval Soldiers; Liang Guanghui's Life in Danger; Naval Authorities Promised to Punish the Culprits

[Report from This Newspaper] The tram, trolleybus, and red public bus lines belonging to the French Water and Electricity Company announced a cessation of service yesterday morning in protest against the unreasonable beating and serious injury inflicted on Liang Guanghui, a ticket seller of Route 18 trolleybus No. 392, by soldiers of the Second Battalion of the Navy Training Camp the previous evening. After the incident, the Garrison Headquarters, the Police Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the General Labor Union all sent personnel to the French Water and Electricity Company in Lujiawan to persuade all drivers and ticket sellers to resume work first while negotiations were underway. The labor union immediately expressed its consent, and the vehicles on each line resumed service at 10:05 a.m. The employees of the British tram company, in support of the actions of the French Water and Electricity Company employees, had notified the authorities that if the French company's matter was not resolved swiftly and satisfactorily, they intended to take united action. Fortunately, the French company resumed work immediately, and therefore the British tram company did not take any action.

At 2:30 p.m., representatives from the Police Bureau, the Military Police Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Garrison Headquarters, the Labor Union of the French Water and Electricity Company, the company authorities, and the Navy Training Camp held a meeting at the Taishan Branch Bureau on Lin Sen Central Road. Chief Zhu of the branch bureau presided over the meeting. First, Zhu Junxin, the representative of the labor union, reported the beginning and end of the unfortunate incident, stating briefly: At 7:18 p.m. the previous evening, the Route 18 trolleybus was traveling from the Great World entertainment center to Xieqiao. When it reached the Golden Theater, it stopped because of a red light. At that time, twelve navy soldiers wanted to board the bus. Ticket seller Liang Guanghui refused to open the door because it was not at a station. One of the soldiers climbed in through the window and forced the ticket seller to open the door to let the other soldiers on board. After entering the bus, they clashed with the ticket seller, even resorting to violence. At that time, a navy officer happened to be on the bus and stopped them. When the officer got off the bus at Nanyang Bridge, the soldiers became unbridled and beat the ticket seller again. After the bus arrived at Xieqiao, they actually took Liang to the camp and beat him severely again. It was already past midnight. When the labor union received the news, it immediately sent three representatives along with two military police officers to negotiate. They only released Liang at 2:15 a.m. Liang Guanghui was already covered in injuries and on the verge of death. He was immediately taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, he has not yet escaped danger. The labor union also put forward demands for punishing the culprits and for aftercare. Battalion Commander Ye Baoqi, the naval representative, stated that the culprits Zheng Fulin and others had already been placed under confinement and would be handed over to the military court for trial. If the victim died, he promised to execute the culprits. He also stated that he would strictly discipline the soldiers in the future to prevent similar incidents from happening again. The company authorities stated that they were willing to bear the medical expenses of the injured person, and it was decided that the Navy Training Corps would apologize to the Labor Union of the French Water and Electricity Company. The labor union representatives were satisfied, and the turmoil was resolved.

### Okinawa Jeeps to be Shipped to Shanghai in Mid-Month for Distribution

The registration for the distribution of jeeps to the press in this city by the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau has been going on for over a month. Yesterday, according to the person in charge of the bureau, speaking to a reporter from the East China News Agency, regarding the distribution of jeeps to the press in this city, personnel were dispatched a few days ago to Okinawa Island to negotiate with the U.S. military authorities on transportation issues.

The selling price of these surplus materials will be settled at a rate of 3,350 yuan due to exchange rate adjustments. However, the bureau is currently seeking instructions from the Executive Yuan as to whether to calculate the price for those who have already registered at the pre-adjustment rate of 2,020 yuan or at the new exchange rate.

Regarding the citywide charity singing performance by movie stars, which was originally scheduled to be held at the Great Light Theater on the 5th, last night at 7 p.m., the Shanghai Fundraising Association of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association hosted the film industry at the Lidu Garden. More than 20 people, including Zhou Jianyun, Feng Xizui, Yan Youxiang, and stars Zhou Xuan and Wang Danfeng, attended. During the discussion of the program, they all felt that the performance time on the 5th was too rushed. The stars participating in the singing still needed a short period of practice. As a result, it was decided that Zhou and Yan would do their best to arrange it. If they really could not perform, the association would be notified to reschedule. In addition, the charity screenings in seven cinemas last Sunday raised a total of 2.2 million yuan (excluding donations), bringing the total amount raised, including the first time, to about 5.7 million yuan.

### Failure in Gold and Stock Speculation - Huakang Bank Collapses

Loss of More Than 100 Million Yuan, Zhu Langsun Flees Without a Trace

[Report from This Newspaper] After this foreign exchange rate increase, general speculators misunderstood the government's policies and took the opportunity to raise gold and stock prices, resulting in serious blows. On the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, Huakang Bank, located at No. 2 Guizhou Road, suddenly announced its closure yesterday morning due to speculative failure and lack of liquidity. It is reported that the affected parties reached more than 100 million yuan. The manager of the bank, Zhu Langsun, has fled without a trace. It is learned that the bank has been engaged in buying and selling red card securities on behalf of customers. During the recent wave of foreign exchange adjustment, it used customer funds to purchase a large number of red cards. As a result, the red cards plummeted, and the losses accumulated. It had no choice but to deceive customers with long-term post-dated checks and gold deposit receipts. After the closure yesterday morning, Ma Huaizhen reported to the Laozha District Bureau that he had been defrauded of 50 taels of gold, and Fan Bin was defrauded of 10 taels. The total number of post-dated checks that have not yet expired exceeds a huge amount of 100 million yuan.

### Unable to Marry, Ashamed to Face Lover, Unemployed Youth Commits Suicide in Despair

At about 11 p.m. the night before last, a young man committed suicide by taking lysol in Room 704 of the Yangzi Hotel. The bellboy discovered it and quickly called for a car to take him to Renji Hospital. The man was still unconscious due to an overdose of poison, and there was concern for his life. According to reporters, the suicide victim was named Liu Heming, 23 years old, from Zhejiang, and worked at a department store in Hangzhou. Recently, because the department store's business was sluggish, it planned to close after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Heming met a local woman named Hong Suqiu in the spring, and they fell in love. The spring breeze changed, and a secret pregnancy resulted. The matter was learned by the woman's father, and since what's done is done, he could only urge Heming to get married as soon as possible. However, Heming was unlucky, with no savings and the company about to close, so the wedding could not be resolved. Heming had an older sister living in Shanghai, who invited him to stay with her temporarily, but Heming was proud and considered relying on others to be shameful. Therefore, the day before yesterday, he opened a room at the Yangzi Hotel at No. 704, and suddenly had the idea of ending his life due to this double blow. Before committing suicide, he wrote two farewell letters, one to his girlfriend Hong Suqiu, which said in brief: The company closed, I cannot afford the wedding, I am ashamed to face you, so I have to commit suicide. Please keep the name ring I gave you as a memento. You are already four months pregnant, take good care of yourself, etc. The other letter was addressed to his older sister, also declaring his intention to commit suicide.

### Workers Organize and Commit Assault, Stabbing Four Colleagues

[Report from This Newspaper] The Houde Building on Minguo Road, Xinkaihe (formerly the Flour Exchange), has part of its premises rented to the Dagong Daily as a printing factory. The remaining houses are rented to the Shanghai Branch of the Chongqing Fuxing Military Uniform Factory, where the entire seam-sewing department works. There is also a motor vehicle department, whose factory is located at No. 471 Limalu, Nanshi. Several workers from the motor vehicle department stayed overnight in the Houde Building. At about 9 p.m. last night, when two workers from the motor vehicle department returned to the dormitory, the seam-sewing department had not yet finished work and was collecting military uniforms from the female workers, so they prevented them from going upstairs, which led to an argument. The two workers went away unhappily, but half an hour later, they gathered more than 20 workers from Nanshi, secretly carrying sharp knives and beer bottles, and rushed over, hitting anyone they saw and stabbing workers in the seam-sewing department with sharp knives. Hu Yuqing (22 years old) was stabbed in the left waist, Yang Degen (32 years old) in the left arm, Cui Guiqing (25 years old) in the right knee, and Shen Yicai (28 years old) in the left chest and lungs, suffering the most serious injuries. After causing the trouble, the factory closed the iron gate and reported to the Yimiao Branch Bureau, which ordered a large number of police officers to the scene and detained more than 40 workers for interrogation. The four injured workers were sent to the hospital for treatment.

### How Living Index is Calculated; Based on Average of 54 Daily Necessities; Objects of Investigation are Items of Greatest Consumption by Public

[Report from This Newspaper] Currently, nothing is more closely related to anyone than the cost of living index published by the municipal government every month. What kind of materials is this index based on? What kind of methods are used to calculate it?

For the sake of clarity, here is a basic formula for calculating the cost of living index:

It looks very simple. All that is needed to know is the price of goods and the average consumption. However, collecting all kinds of accurate data is not an overnight effort. Shanghai began compiling the cost of living index in 1926, and the base period for the current calculation is 1936.

The objects of investigation for the price of goods are the most commonly used or consumed items, divided into four categories: food, clothing, housing, and miscellaneous goods. Recently, there are a total of 54 kinds. The method is to select a number of areas and use the shops or markets with the most consumers as data providers. The municipal research office sends personnel every Wednesday to investigate the market price of various goods. These investigators all have many years of work experience and are very familiar with the objects they are investigating, so the results they obtain are generally quite accurate. Furthermore, the price of each item must be determined by combining the average of the prices quoted by at least ten different businesses before it can be determined as the market price of a certain item in a certain week. Then, the average of the market prices for four weeks or five weeks is taken as the price of a certain item in a certain month.

As for the average consumption, because it changes very little, the current calculation of the workers' index is still based on the results of the 1942 survey of 305 worker families, and the officials' index is based on the results of the 1941 survey of 418 official families. The method is to have these hundreds of selected families record the details of their daily expenses in a specially designed account book, and then the investigating agencies classify, synthesize, and analyze these account books to obtain the average total consumption of a certain item by each family in a year, and then divide it by twelve months to obtain the average monthly consumption.

The numbers obtained in this way are then subjected to a comprehensive average according to the above formula to obtain the monthly cost of living index, which is used by various social strata to calculate salaries and wages.

Many people do not understand the calculation method of the cost of living index and believe that it does not match the actual prices. To give a recent example, it is a fact that prices have jumped after this foreign exchange liberalization, but the published workers' cost of living index for August increased by only 0.95% compared to July, so its accuracy is highly doubted. However, according to those responsible for compiling it, this is actually a misunderstanding, because the cost of living index is calculated using an average value. This exchange rate change occurred in late August, so its impact is naturally very small when averaged over the entire month. Furthermore, the investigation of commodity prices is based on the items that are most consumed by the public. For example, rice prices have changed very little recently, and many items that have risen sharply are not among the 54 items. This is also an important reason why the cost of living index has risen very little.

### Feng Yuxiang and Wife Leave Shanghai to Study Water Conservancy Projects in the United States; Madame He Yingqin Leaves on the Same Ship

Feng Yuxiang, known as the Christian General, left Shanghai yesterday aboard the "General Meigs" ship with his wife, Ms. Li Dequan, his daughter, Miss Lida, and advisors Feng Jiyi, Secretary Wang Heng, Wu Zuxiang, water conservancy experts Liu Zairen, Zhang Yuanyi, and others, a total of eight people, to study water conservancy projects in the United States.

### The Increasing Seriousness of Educational Problems: Education Minister Zhu Seeks Instructions from the Chairman; Deputy Minister Hang Remains in the Capital, While Deputy Minister Zhu Accompanies Him to Kuling

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] With the current situation unstable, the seriousness of educational problems is also increasing daily. Education Minister Zhu Jiahua and Deputy Minister Hang Jingnong have both gone to Kuling to make certain representations to the Chairman. Only Deputy Minister Hang Liwu remains in the capital to oversee ministry affairs. A reporter inquired about issues such as educational funding, post-war reconstruction, student enrollment, and professor待遇s. The responses were as follows: (1) The difficulty in securing educational funding is the biggest problem currently faced. The reconstruction and development of education at all levels in the recovered areas require funding. The Ministry of Education has drafted a budget requesting an increase in reconstruction funds. This proposal has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and a decision is expected shortly. (2) The reconstruction of various schools has been affected by poor transportation and has not reached the expected situation. The supply and demand of primary and secondary schools in various places are imbalanced, and the problem of students dropping out of school has also arisen. The Ministry of Education is deeply concerned about this. However, if there are no problems with funding, increasing the number and capacity of public schools can gradually solve the problem. (3) Regarding the enrollment problem of students returning to their hometowns from universities in the rear, such as Chongqing University, the Ministry of Education has designated universities such as National Central University to hold transfer student examinations on a regular basis. Every effort will be made to provide them with convenience and opportunities for light study. Even if they fail the examination, they can still return to their original school to study, so as not to drop out of school. The travel expenses for returning to their original schools are a minor problem. (4) After the reconstruction of universities, the living environment of university professors is often poor, and research equipment is even more lacking. Life is not easy in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, and the situation is extremely difficult. The Ministry of Education is very anxious about this. Although the research funding for professors has recently been increased to five yuan, it is still not enough to solve the problem. The Ministry of Education can only find ways to remedy the situation at any time.

### The Serious Problem of Students Dropping Out of School in Guangzhou

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 2nd] It is estimated that the number of primary and secondary school students dropping out of school in Guangzhou has reached 150,000. In terms of secondary schools, there are only seven provincial secondary schools and three municipal secondary schools. In the city of Guangzhou, which has a population of over one million, there are only ten secondary schools, which is enough to make people understand the seriousness of the problem of students dropping out of school. In the entrance examination for this semester, Provincial No. 1 Middle School admitted 600 students, and nearly 30% of the applicants failed. Due to the large number of students dropping out of school, private secondary schools have been established one after another, most of which are speculative. The quality of their equipment and teachers is quite questionable. According to recent statistics, there are a total of 48 private secondary schools, most of which charge exorbitant fees, making it difficult for the children of ordinary civil servants to attend.

Those present included Deputy Director Li Ximou of the Education Bureau, Director Zhu Junti of the National Education Department, Director Zhu Xubai of the Municipal Government News Department, Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau, and principals of various private schools, totaling 92 units. Mayor Wu apologized for his late arrival at 2:40 pm due to hosting a luncheon for American congressmen at his residence. He then said that since the tuition fees of various schools were set several months ago, the municipal government has received a large number of letters from citizens, and editorials in newspapers have also criticized the fees, so he felt it was necessary to reconsider them. However, if the tuition fees are too low, the lives of teachers and staff cannot be stabilized, which is also not a good plan. Today's meeting of private school principals is to collectively discuss and seek a win-win solution.

Then, Jiang Jizhou, principal of Minguo Middle School and chairman of the Municipal Federation of Primary and Secondary Schools, Gao Baiba, principal of Huahua Middle School, Zhou Zenglin, principal of Shanghai Middle School, Liu Boheng, principal of Guangzhong Middle School, Shen Wu, principal of Xinhua Girls' Middle School, Cui Yiwu, principal of Daozhong Girls' Middle School, and Sun Xiangzhong, principal of Aiguo Girls' Middle School, spoke in detail on issues such as tuition, fees for meals and accommodation, raising teachers' salaries, expanding school facilities, providing free admission for poor children, and making school finances public. Finally, Mayor Wu put forward various opinions, which were discussed in detail. The conclusions reached were as follows:

(1) Each school should deposit the tuition fees collected into a bank (determined by the school itself), and all interest should be listed under the school's financial expenses. (2) Each school should report the amount of income to the school's audit committee twice, once after the start of the semester and once before the end of the semester. At the same time, the school should announce it publicly and report it to the Education Bureau for record. (3) Each school's free places should be handled in accordance with the proportion (15% for each middle school and 20% for each primary school). (4) Student meal fees should be collected in installments, and a meal committee should be organized to handle it. Parents who are willing to pay in one lump sum are allowed. (5) The various fees collected by each school should be used in accordance with the prescribed items. After the above decisions were made, Shen Wu, principal of Xinben Women's Primary School, filed a complaint about the school's funds being forcibly occupied by military man Jin Handing. Director Zhang of the Health Bureau also expressed his views on health education in schools, saying that the municipal government will restore the Health Education Committee, with the mayor as the chairman and the director of the Education Bureau as the vice-chairman. He hoped that each school would attach equal importance to "teaching" and "education," and that the health fees collected by each school must be taken from the school and used for the school. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 pm.

The National Government had issued a clear order to commend her posthumously, and Chairman Chiang had also sent a special telegram of condolence, praising her for being unyielding in her might and strictly dealing with those who followed the current or went against it. Tomorrow (4th) is the seventh anniversary of the martyr's sacrifice. At 10:00 am in the auditorium of Shanghai Girls' High School, a memorial ceremony will be held to commemorate the martyr's spirit of sacrifice for education.

### The Tianjin Huasheng Expedition Basketball Team Held a Representative Selection Competition; The Tianjin Taidong Team Defeated the Pingbei Beixing Team

[Our Tianjin Dispatch] The Huasheng team, organized by Tianjin basketball players for an expedition to Shanghai, has been prepared since the middle of last month and is now ready. Recently, the Beixing team from Beiping came to Tianjin to compete with the Taidong team for the right to represent the expeditionary force. The Beixing team has former Shanghai stars Qu Yalin and Li Binzhong, while the Taidong team is a strong local team with Wang Youcai, Wang Hongbin, Yin Huanwen, and others. Their strength is very strong. On that day, tickets were sold for 2,000 yuan each, and more than 2,000 spectators came to admire them, creating an unprecedented record for the Shengli Houxu Stadium. All ticket revenue was used for the Huasheng team's travel expenses to Shanghai. As a result of the competition, the Beixing team was one step behind in the first half, trailing by 8 to 17. After changing sides, the Beixing team tried hard to recover, but the Taidong team pressed forward, and as a result, the Taidong team easily defeated the Beixing team by 43 to 21. As for when the Huasheng team will depart for Shanghai, it is still waiting for a reply from the Shanghai Basketball Committee. Furthermore, the Beixing team must first return to Beiping. Once the selection is completed, they will prepare to depart.

Problem Research

### A Humble Proposal to Improve Secondary Education in Shanghai (Part 2)
— Xie Engao

To improve secondary education in Shanghai, from an objective point of view, it seems that intensifying material construction is the most important thing. Educational facilities cannot be without tools, and material equipment is one of the important tools for educational facilities. A workman must first sharpen his tools if he wants to do his job well. A poor material environment will never produce high-quality educational effectiveness. Without complete science laboratory equipment, there is no way to talk about the provision of science education; without suitable farming and industrial practice places, there is no way to talk about the promotion of labor education; without the construction of gyms, sports fields, and swimming pools, there is no way to talk about the training of strong physiques; without a complete library, there is no way to talk about the cultivation of good learning attitudes. All other equipment is related to the effectiveness of implementing education. Good and effective results can never be obtained by chance. Although the number of secondary schools in Shanghai is very developed, their material equipment is really extremely pitiful. Except for a few with a slight foundation, most of them rent private houses as classrooms. There is no talk of lighting and ventilation, and other things are even more nominal. This kind of secondary education, except for training the ability to use writing tools and imparting abstract book knowledge, has no other harvest. If education is to exert great power, it must permeate the entire life of students. Students regard schools as relay stations, coming to class and leaving after class. Because of the limitations of insufficient material equipment, the opportunity for teachers and students to live together during the week is almost zero, and there is no way to see the effect of mutual spiritual induction. Letting young people pursue themselves in the social storm and float and sink with the customs is too dangerous and contrary to the original intention of educational facilities. Education is not only about material equipment to fulfill its function, but without material equipment, even if there are educational experts, there is no place for them to use their talents. Especially in the secondary education era of the youth stage, it must rely on a rich material environment to complete its beautiful and reasonable educational life, so that students' body and mind can be developed in a balanced way. Otherwise, it is an incomplete secondary education. This kind of incomplete secondary education has more harm than good to the country and society.

Based on the foregoing, the improvement of secondary education in Shanghai can be summarized into the following three principles:

(1) Since the number of schools has already had considerable development, we should pay attention to improving the quality of schools in the future.

(2) Since the number of private secondary schools is greater than that of public secondary schools, in order to improve the quality of schools effectively, we must determine an effective and universal improvement method for private secondary schools.

(3) Since improving the quality of schools takes improving material construction as a prerequisite, we should make overall plans for the majority of private secondary schools that are materially poor in the future, and cooperate to thoroughly renovate their material environment within a considerable period of time.

How can the above-mentioned ways to improve secondary education in Shanghai be achieved and achieve its purpose? This is the suggestion that this article wants to put forward.

In the last semester, the total number of students in public and private secondary schools in this city was less than 80,000. In this semester, students from the rear have returned to Shanghai one after another, and the number of secondary school students may increase to 100,000. In three to five years, it may increase to 200,000 to 300,000. Assuming that 200,000 secondary school students are the design goal, and each secondary school is assumed to accommodate 1,000 to 1,500 people, only 140 to 200 secondary schools can accommodate all of them. Even if the number of secondary school students expands to 300,000, if the capacity of each secondary school is also expanded to 1,500 people, there is no need to increase the number of 200 secondary schools, and they can still accommodate all of them. At present, there are less than 80,000 secondary school students, but the number of public and private secondary schools has reached as many as 226. The average number of students in each secondary school is less than 400. In terms of effectiveness, it is inevitably low. For the improvement direction, the few private secondary schools that are hopeless due to excessive manpower and material resources should first be advised to merge, shut down, or change to primary schools. Retain those hundred and dozens of schools with a long history, significant results, sound yellow guild organization, and qualified teachers, except for more than ten schools such as Private McTyeire School and Xuhui Middle School, whose material construction has reached a considerable scale and does not need to be rebuilt. Other articles can gather the strength of both the government and society to seek new construction. This new construction must be economical, practical, and most suitable for the ideal of implementing youth education. How to realize this plan, according to my meaning, in the east, west, south, and north suburbs of Shanghai, we should use the original public land or requisition private land to open up four major secondary education zones, each zone with an area of ​​1,500 mu to 2,000 mu, with the construction of 30 to 40 secondary schools as the scope, and with the target of accommodating 30,000 to 60,000 secondary school students. For example, the Hongqiao Airport in the west district was originally a centralized military training camp for high school students and above in Shanghai. Later, due to the tense situation between China and Japan, it was ordered by the central government to expand the requisition of nearby private land to become an airport, covering an area of ​​more than 1,000 mu. Later, because the Longhua and Jiangwan airports were opened, the Hongqiao Airport was abandoned and unused. Today, weeds are overgrown and it has become a livestock farm for nearby farmers. If the local government submits a report to the central government to allocate it for the construction of a secondary education zone, turning useless into useful, would it not be the good fortune of Shanghai alone!

Civil Affairs Briefs

### The Executive Yuan Orders the Municipal Government to Pay Attention to the Selection of Baojia Heads, Thoroughly Eliminate Malpractices, and Prevent Government Orders from Being Distorted

The Executive Yuan yesterday ordered the Municipal Government, saying: "An investigation into the situation of the people in various districts has led to the distortion of government orders. We must pay attention to the selection of Baojia heads, thoroughly eliminate malpractices."

The 22nd District Mediation Committee

The 22nd District Office (Jiangwan) held its 7th district affairs meeting on the 31st. Deputy District Chief Xu reported first, stating that the previous Deputy District Chief Ni had resigned and his resignation had been approved. The vacancy will be filled by himself. Then, he explained the work, and the heads of each section also reported on the work done in the past month. They also discussed proposals on the spot, including the following important items: (1) The personnel adjustment in this district should be approved by the Municipal Government as soon as possible; (2) A mediation committee should be organized immediately; (3) Investigate and report enemy and puppet property and public construction matters; (4) Prepare for the welfare of colleagues in this district, etc. In addition, Xu Zhongtian, the head of the 5th Bao, and Jin Jindi, the head of the 9th Bao, in the district have resigned. The district office has elected Li Shangda as the head of the 5th Bao and Jin Shouliang as the head of the 9th Bao.

The 23rd District Repairs Zhoujiaqiao

The Zhoujiaqiao bridge in the 6th Bao of the 23rd District (Wusong) has been in disrepair for many years. The district office has submitted a request to the Public Works Bureau to send personnel to survey and repair it. In addition, the corner of Hongsong Road and Zhongxing Road in Wusong Town had a self-police pavilion built during the enemy and puppet period. Because no one managed it after the victory, it is now leaning and collapsing. Whether it should be demolished has now been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval.

The Wusong Exchange of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation is temporarily located downstairs in the 23rd District Office. All the wires to the city have been installed and communication began on August 30.

### The Civil Affairs Department Explains the Questions Regarding Migration Registration

The Municipal Government Civil Affairs Department, according to a signed report from the 5th District Office, forwarded a report from Han Shoukang, the head of the 62nd Bao, and others, stating that there are several questions regarding the investigation and reporting of households: (1) All the tenants of a three-room house have moved away, and they did not return the lease in advance, nor did they report the move-out to the Bao. Afterwards, the citizens even took away their National ID cards. Can the second landlord or another head of household living together report this type of household? How should this Bao investigate and report it? (2) The tenants of a three-room house have moved their belongings away without returning the lease or making any statement, whether they are returning to their hometown or will come back to live again, and they have not reported to the Bao or reported a temporary floating household registration. The door is locked and they do not return for several months to a year and a half. How should this Bao investigate and handle this type of household? (3) The situation is the same as the previous one, but there are still one or two pieces of waste left in the room. The Civil Affairs Department once answered a question from Mr. Changhong in the Central Daily News and Shen Bao: "The door is locked, which seems to indicate an intention to return." The Baojia believes that "if there is an intention to return, the household should also report a temporary floating household registration to the Bao when moving out in order to be able to check and comply with the procedures. Since they did not report and locked the door for several months or a year, it is similar to a fugitive population." How should the Baojia investigate and handle it? There are also unscrupulous Baojia heads who often rely on their position to oppress the people, causing resentment. All levels of local government should eliminate this malpractice and order them to be informed. Some cunning tenants of a three-room house take this opportunity to transfer the house to a fourth party and make a huge profit from it. Therefore, the house is locked first. Once the fourth party moves in, if the second landlord inquires, the fourth party will rely on having a lease right with the third tenant and ignore it. If the second landlord sues the third tenant, the third tenant has disappeared. (4) How should fugitive populations be investigated and reported? Should we only report that a certain household has now moved out and we do not know where they have moved to? Please explain the above four points so that we can follow them.

The Civil Affairs Department explained in detail as follows: (1) If the tenants of a three-room house move out without applying for a move-out, the head of the Bao in charge may apply on their behalf. (2) If the move-out has been more than a month and has not been applied for registration as a move-out, the head of the Jia or head of the Bao in charge may apply on their behalf. (3) "The door is locked, which seems to indicate an intention to return" is a factual inference. However, the registration of a floating population or the registration of a move-out must still be applied for in accordance with the law, because after applying for a move-out, it is not impossible to return. To prevent abuses in house leasing, please consult with the competent authorities on appropriate measures. (4) The fugitive population should still apply for a move-out by the head of the household. As for fugitive households, it can be explained according to point 1.

### District Briefs

The District People's Representative Conference of the 12th District (Beining) of this city will hold its first meeting at 8:00 am today in the auditorium of the Municipal Public Experimental School at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Changping Road.

### Household Registration Regulations: Questions and Answers (Continued)

(62) Question: When there is a change in the place of original registration or temporary registration, the relevant household registration officer should be notified to register the cancellation of the original registration or the transfer of the temporary registration, according to the law. However, there are no columns for the relevant and governing household registration officers on the household registration application form. If the receiving household registration officer cannot notify, what should be done?

Answer: The applicant may indicate the administrative region of the relevant or governing household registration at that time in the remarks column of the application form.

(63) Question: What surname should an illegitimate child take?

Answer: An illegitimate child is a child born out of wedlock under the Civil Code. If the parents are untraceable, the child is considered abandoned in household registration terms. According to Article 58, Paragraph 2 of the Household Registration Law, the household registration officer should establish a surname and given name for the child. If the abandoned child has been adopted, the child should take the surname of the adopter, as stipulated in Article 1078 of the Civil Code. The application for birth registration can be processed using the usual procedures. Furthermore, if the mother of a child born out of wedlock marries someone else, the child should take the mother's surname, according to Article 1065, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code.

### Establishment of the Shanghai Banking and Money Trade Joint Reserve Association
### Will Intervene in Times of Tight Credit
### Representing 160 Banking and Money Shop Units

[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Banking and Money Trade Joint Reserve Association, which has been in preparation for years, finally held its inaugural meeting at the Bankers' Club at 3 p.m. yesterday. The seven executive committee members present were Li Fusun, Xu Weiming, Li Daonan, Xu Jiguang, Qian Xinzhi, Qin Runqing, and Shen Rixin, along with 134 members from various banks and money shops, representing a total of 160 units. Li Fusun was publicly elected as the chairman of the meeting. Li delivered a speech reporting on the association's preparations, stating that the association was a continuation of the former Banking Association Joint Reserve Association. Although the organization has expanded with the inclusion of money shops, the association's work has not been interrupted. Its establishment coincided with the aftermath of the January 28th Incident. On the day following the outbreak of the war, a citywide strike was held, creating a serious situation. The Joint Reserve Association was established within a few days, accumulating over 40 million in assets, effectively increasing the deposit reserves among the banking community by over 20 million, thereby stabilizing the market. Since then, whenever political issues have caused financial turmoil, the Reserve Association has intervened to facilitate a smooth transition.

Preparations After Victory

After the victory, preparations were made with the Money Trade Association to establish the Banking and Money Trade Joint Reserve Association, and a draft covenant was prepared and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Approval was finally received from the Ministry of Finance at the end of June this year. A joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of the Banking Association, and representatives of the board of directors and supervisors of the Money Trade Association was convened on July 10th. As the association's affairs required urgent planning and implementation, all members of the first executive committee were nominated by the two associations, with five members from the banking industry and two from the money trade. Qin Runqing and Shen Rixin were nominated as the two representatives from the money trade. The five members from the banking industry were the five standing committee members of the Joint Reserve Association, who continued in their roles. The joint meeting unanimously approved and commenced preparations. On the one hand, letters were sent to various banks and money shops to solicit membership and sign the association's covenant. The phrase "joint guarantee" in the covenant received the most attention from the various banks and money shops. An explanation was requested from the Ministry of Finance through the two associations, and a ministry order has now been received stating that when joint guarantee liability arises, it should be borne in proportion to the number of treasury bills each member bank and money shop actually holds at the time. This has been incorporated into the association's articles of association for compliance. The Executive Committee reported during the preparation period: (1) To determine the amount of assets that member banks and money shops should subscribe, it was decided that 10 million yuan would be the minimum and 20% of the average deposits for the most recent three months would be the maximum. (2) To determine the term of office for executive committee members to be three years. (3) To draft the association's articles of association in accordance with the covenant, incorporating the Ministry Order's explanation of the original text of the joint guarantee for compliance. The standard for sharing expenses will be based on the proportion of the total amount of assets subscribed, as stipulated in the covenant. However, there is a significant difference in the total amount subscribed by the banks and money shops (ranging from 10 million to 1.8 billion yuan). Since the Reserve Association serves the banks and money shops equally, it would be unfair to base the proportion solely on the assets subscribed. It is proposed to set a basic amount, assuming 50,000 yuan per bank and money shop, and apportion the expenses based on the proportion exceeding this amount, which seems more equitable.

Hoping for Prudence First Among Peers

Now that the association is in its initial stage of operation, I have a few words to report to the general assembly. The association was originally founded with the aim of mutual assistance among peers, at a time when the country is in turmoil and the financial situation is unstable. National banks are also advocating a tightening policy. I hope that our peers will prioritize prudence during this period and hope to weather the difficulties. When the nation is stable, we can then unleash our efforts. The Reserve Association can only serve as a mechanism to resolve tight credit situations. When the city's credit situation is tight, the Reserve Association will come forward, and the Central Bank will provide support. During normal operations, I ask that each bank and money shop maintain its position and respond to the situation as it sees fit. Do not have excessive expectations of the Reserve Association, so that the Reserve Association's foundation can be increasingly consolidated, valued by society, and valued by the government. Only then can it come forward to deal with difficult situations. This is a sincere piece of advice from me. Please understand.

Passed Thirty-Two Articles of Association

The meeting then discussed and passed thirty-two articles of association. Here is an excerpt of the major points: Regarding the reserve assets, Article 6 stipulates: Member banks and money shops should determine the amount and prepare reserve assets of equivalent value. In the event of a decline in value or other changes, they shall be responsible for making up the difference at any time. The amount of reserve assets subscribed shall not exceed 20% of the average monthly total deposits of each bank and money shop over the past three months, and shall not be less than 10 million national currency. Article 7 stipulates that the reserve assets are limited to the following categories: 1. Government-issued bonds and other securities approved for listing on the stock exchange. 2. Investment certificates approved by the Ministry of Finance. 3. Real estate in the city that is legally registered, has a market price, and can be sold at any time. 4. Warehouse receipts for goods that can be sold immediately. Regarding treasury bills: Article 11 stipulates that the reserve assets paid by member banks and money shops will be issued treasury bills at 70% of the appraised value. Article 12 stipulates that treasury bills are registered. Article 13 stipulates that member banks and money shops may use treasury bills as collateral for debts. If the debt is not repaid, the association may handle it in accordance with Article 13 of Chapter 4 of the covenant. (This article stipulates that if a member bank or money shop uses treasury bills as collateral for a debt and fails to repay it, the association shall, at the request of the creditor bank or money shop, immediately sell all or part of the original reserve assets paid by the debtor bank or money shop and use the proceeds to repay the debt. Any surplus shall be returned to the original paying bank or money shop, and any shortfall shall still be recovered from its other assets in accordance with the law. Article 14 stipulates that if a treasury bill holder encounters events such as loss or destruction of treasury bills, they should immediately notify the association and publish a statement in the newspaper. If no disputes arise within one month, they may provide collateral to the association or find a suitable guarantor to reissue the treasury bills.

Membership Fees are Shared Proportionally

Finally, the meeting discussed the method for sharing the association's expenses, which is 12 million yuan per month, to be shared by each member bank and money shop in proportion to the appraised value of the reserve assets paid. The method of payment shall be determined by the executive committee. The meeting adjourned at half-past five.

Furthermore, before the meeting yesterday, representatives of various member banks and money shops signed the covenant to express unanimous agreement with the provisions of the covenant and jointly guarantee it, which was submitted by the Shanghai Banking and Money Trade Associations to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation.

The association's organization consists of seven executive committee members (see the first paragraph of this dispatch for the list). These seven members will elect three standing committee members, and then the three members will elect one chairman to attend meetings regularly and preside over the association's affairs. The candidates for standing committee members and chairman have yet to be determined at a future executive committee meeting. According to observations, Li Fusun will be elected as a standing committee member and chairman, and the other two standing committee members will be representatives from the national bank and the money trade. Although there were reports earlier that some national banks and bureaus did not intend to join the reserve association, it is possible that they will still consider joining due to the needs of the situation.

### Rice Prices Gradually Stabilize, Oil Prices Continue to Rise

With successive arrivals of goods from various regions, the rice market sees stable prices for high-quality new japonica rice, while medium and lower grades fall by another thousand yuan. New indica rice from Xinbu, new japonica rice, new indica rice, and new sheep indica rice all experience price declines of a thousand yuan for medium and small grades. White yuan rice also shows less spirit. The North and South markets registered a total of over 7,000 piculs of incoming goods. Flour shops see brisk sales. Market conditions outside the market are firm. Millers slightly move on Min-style wheat. The Ningbo traders selectively acquire. Transactions for northern white wheat are sluggish, with prices weakening by 500-600 yuan. Soybean trade in Shantou is suspended, resulting in stagnation and few transactions, with prices falling by over a thousand yuan. Jute sees high prices for top-quality goods but stagnation for lower grades. Raw peanuts remain unchanged in the Chaozhou region, with prices falling by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Due to stagnation in Qingdao, new corn sees brisk prices of 500-1,000 yuan. High-quality broad beans rise by a thousand yuan, while medium grades remain stable, but lower-quality goods are relatively short in supply, with active trading. The oil market sees rising prices outside the market, with rumors of high prices in the Qingdao production area and insufficient allocation of oil for store sales, resulting in price increases of 2,000-3,000 yuan. Soybean cake remains sluggish, with prices falling by 100-200 yuan. Wheat bran is in short supply, with prices rising by 300-400 yuan.

Following the instructions of the Social Affairs Bureau, the China Edible Oil Company yesterday allocated approximately 2,000 piculs of raw oil to the bona fide members of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Association at a price of 88,000 yuan per dan, with 60 Group A households receiving 5 barrels each and 170 Group B households receiving 3 barrels each. Temporary orders were received yesterday, with payments due today and tomorrow, followed by staggered deliveries. Yesterday, Zhongzhi Oil Factory also allocated 350 piculs of raw rapeseed oil at 77,000 yuan.

### Companies Shifting Registration to Hong Kong: 171 Firms in August

[United Press, Hong Kong, 1st] According to Hong Kong government statistics, 171 Chinese companies moved their registration to Hong Kong in August. However, a government official told United Press that this number does not represent the total number of companies that have moved their companies and investments from China to Hong Kong. Some companies previously operating in Malaya have also moved to Hong Kong. The official pointed out that according to current Hong Kong law, companies recognized by the Hong Kong government are divided into three categories: (1) Hong Kong companies, which are only allowed to operate in Hong Kong; (2) Hong Kong-China companies, which are controlled by Hong Kong but have branches in China; and (3) Chinese companies, which are registered in China but can operate in Hong Kong. The Chinese government has expressed opposition to the second category, and the Hong Kong government may also abolish it in the near future.

### Fluctuating Government Bond Situation

The government bond market is chaotic. The spot market once moved upward, dropping before rising again. However, with the extreme tightness of credit, high prices were difficult to sustain. The prices of various bonds fluctuated. Unified C bonds initially traded at 2230 yuan in the morning, rising to 2770 yuan midway, with remaining bonds being sold off. The price retreated to 2450 yuan at closing. As a result, compared to last Saturday, A, B, and E bonds remained flat, while C and D bonds rose by 100 yuan. The situation is volatile.

### New Longan and Dried Longan Arrive

The first batches of new Taiwanese longan and Guangzhou dried longan have arrived in small quantities. The initial trading of new Taiwanese longan yesterday did not result in a transaction due to poor bids. Samples of inexpensive dried longan will be available for trading today.

### Social Affairs Bureau Organizes Sugar Price Review Committee

Adopting Price Negotiation and Increasing Supply

Since the Social Affairs Bureau and Taiwan Sugar Corporation agreed to allocate sugar in installments at a stable price of 70,000 yuan per dan, the price of each installment has remained stable. However, the black market for foreign sugar is rampant. In order to eliminate the black market and correct abuses, the Social Affairs Bureau will adopt a price negotiation system for this installment and switch to unlimited allocation in order to increase supply and eliminate speculation. It is understood that the first Sugar Price Review Committee will be convened at the Social Affairs Bureau at 4:00 p.m. today (the 3rd), and letters have been sent to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Sugar Industry Union, and the North-South Goods Industry Union, inviting each to send a representative to participate.

### Scarce Black Market Transactions, Lower Stock Bids

Most Chinese stocks were closed yesterday. Only a very small number of dealers in the spot market had some transactions. Stock bids were lowered due to tight credit. The market was initially flat, but gradually weakened after opening. Less popular stocks remained balanced. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yong Yarn and Mei Ya fell by about 5%, Jingfu and Xinguang fell slightly less than 5%, Qinxing remained flat, and smaller and medium-sized stocks were also dragged down slightly. Old established stocks remained stable.

Foreign stocks were also slightly affected. The more popular stocks declined slightly. Yi Yarn and British Union gradually declined from 9700 yuan and 11000 yuan, respectively. Among the smaller stocks, Ruoye and Guang Steel remained stable. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Ruoye rose slightly, Steel remained flat, and Paper, Yi Ting, Asia, and Jardine Matheson suffered slight declines. Yi Yarn and British Union fell slightly more than 5%, and Xiangtai hovered around 14500 yuan.

### Textiles and Construction Maintain Original Prices, Yarn Market Price Surge Has Been Somewhat Suppressed, While Grey Cloth Rises Due to Short Supply

[Report from this Newspaper] In the week before last, the yarn and cloth market saw rising prices due to foreign exchange fluctuations and positive sentiment. Furthermore, with the purchase from various groups and extreme scarcity of spot goods, the price surge was even more intense. Fortunately, the Textiles and Construction Corporation (Fangjian) maintained the original prices throughout, and private factories were able to cooperate with the authorities' will to suppress prices and jointly open goods, thereby curbing the rising trend somewhat. However, the amount of fine cloth opened by Fangjian on Saturday was limited, and the market price was 8,000 to 9,000 higher for those taking delivery. In general, practical manufacturers purchased actively because the autumn sales season had arrived, and since there was a lack of supply, brokers arbitrarily raised the prices. The market sentiment often sees the amount of goods opened by Fangjian as the standard for high and low prices. If a certain yarn or cloth is continuously opened by Fangjian, market sentiment will decline and prices will fall. If Fangjian does not open a certain yarn or cloth twice in a row, sentiment will rise and market prices will soar. Therefore, if Fangjian can supply as much as possible, prices will inevitably fall. In recent days, the purchase appetite of the Guangdong traders has gradually waned. Fangjian has tightened the restrictions on opening goods to non-practical factories. According to market sources, if private factories and Fangjian can continue to collect goods and cooperate effectively, the prices of yarn and cloth will definitely fall and not rise.

Another report says that the yarn market was firm at first but then softened yesterday. Buyers showed unyielding appetite, still choosing spot goods for allocation. Therefore, the prices of spot goods of all brands rose to 20,000-30,000 yuan in the morning. However, with the industry forced by tight credit, many dealers released their goods, causing prices to return to flat slightly. However, the foundation was particularly stable. Fangjian announced its prices as usual at 10:00 a.m., and both 20-count and 42-count yarns were opened. The price of Blue Phoenix remained unchanged. The former was 1.16 million and the latter was 1.9 million, both of which were market prices before the foreign exchange adjustment.

Although the cloth market continued to rise by 1,000-2,000 yuan, the price was still much lower than the previous day, and the momentum was somewhat flattened. However, due to rising prices in the foreign markets, sales gradually became active. In addition, since Fangjian did not have sufficient inventory, grey cloth was only maintained for dyeing factories and was not supplied to trading houses at all. Therefore, the price of grey cloth from private factories and small factories has been rising daily.

### Tight Credit, Gold and Currency Fall, Spot Red Once Fell Near 2 Million Mark

Spot red continued to deteriorate yesterday, with pressure and short selling rising simultaneously. It was difficult to recover from fatigue. It opened at 2,065,000 in the morning. Supply exceeded demand. Although the pressure was not heavy, it was difficult to maintain due to unfavorable trends. It gradually declined from 2,070,000, but it was still relatively flat at first. Therefore, after 10:00 a.m., the Central Bank still allocated 201 pieces at a price of 2,055,000. After entering, the situation became more deserted. Those who needed short-term loans had to seek cash by short selling. As a result, at noon, it had fallen to the 2,000,000 mark. It gradually stabilized in the afternoon, and the next-day settlement rose to 2,030,000. As a result, it fell by 30,000 compared to last Saturday. Ornament gold was at 15,000, silver bullion and silver dollars were both flat. The implicit discount interest was generally very tight, and demand was not easy to come by. Interest rates ranged from 1.5 jiao to 2 jiao, and rose slightly in the afternoon.

Foreign currencies also fell lower. In this environment, people have many views of going too low. From the morning opening sale price of 3,340 yuan, the currency repeatedly fell, and there was a slight struggle along the way around the 3,300 yuan mark. At noon, it dropped to below 3,270 yuan and settled down slightly. The gold market rose in the afternoon, but because the US dollar was for same-day settlement, it was taken up, but it was very limited. As a result, it fell by 70 yuan compared to last Saturday. The exchange rate against gold recently tightened to 613 yuan for ten taels. Finally, it was still strong at 620 yuan. Hong Kong dollars were looser than usual, with an initial price of 710 yuan and a lack of sustained demand, finally dropping to around 670 yuan. As a result, it fell by 25 yuan compared to last Saturday. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 680 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 840 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 11,000 yuan. There was very little trading. There was no need for US dollar exchange rates.

### Although Credit is Tight, No Problems are Expected for the Festival Season, More Returned Checks Than Usual

[Report from this Newspaper] According to Li Lixia, Director of the Financial Inspection Department of the Central Bank, speaking to reporters, since the government adjusted the exchange rate, the Central Bank's gold, China Textile and Construction Company's yarn and cloth, Taiwan Sugar Company's sugar, and the municipal government's rice have all been sold in large quantities to meet the needs of the market in order to stabilize market prices. Therefore, the huge amounts of legal tender recovered successively are gathered in the Central Bank. At the same time, as it is the Mid-Autumn Festival, commercial banks must release short-term loans, so there is inevitably a feeling of tightening. According to Li's speculation, the current tightening of short-term credit in the market may be even worse than the end of June. However, the financial community in this city takes the end of June as a lesson and is deeply cautious. Since the end of June, the lending and business management policies have become much more cautious. Therefore, although short-term credit is tight before the Mid-Autumn Festival, it will not cause panic.

According to the Shanghai Clearing House, the average amount of returned checks exchanged by the office is about 5 billion yuan per day. With the recent tightening of short-term credit in the market, the amount of returned checks has increased slightly, to about 8-9 billion yuan per day.

### Anecdotes from Anhui Province

— From Our Correspondent Fei Chaoran, Hefei, Gansu

The people of various counties in Anhui Province have been universally forced to "northernize southerners," changing from eating rice to eating noodles. After a short respite, they were also worried about the aftermath of the war. Fortunately, Heaven showed mercy and heavy rain poured down in due course. Without moving waterwheels, the crops in the upland and lowland fields grew vigorously, and the drought-resistant grains grew densely. The early rice has already been harvested, and the late rice is being harvested. Farmers did not have to work hard to cultivate the fields, and this year has actually been realized.

Double Harvest in Central and Southern Anhui

The counties in central Anhui were scorched by the high sun during the midsummer heat, with temperatures reaching over 100 degrees every day. The heat was unbearable! However, the rice seedlings received a wave of heat during the flowering period, and the grains were particularly large and abundant. Although they did not produce two ears per stalk, according to old farmers, it can be compared to the harvest of 1927. The rice ears in that year had 260 grains, and the current lowland rice also has this number, with plump grains, and even exceeding it. In other words, fields that used to yield ten shi of grain can yield twice as much this year. According to reliable information from various counties in southern Anhui, the harvest is comparable to that in central Anhui. In Wuhu, Wuwei, and other counties, the lowland fields along the Yangtze River are said to have two ears per stalk.

Busy Farming and Rising Prices of Rice and Grass

Many farmers in central Anhui are stepping up efforts to hire people to harvest, with daily wages reaching 5-6,000 yuan. They also have to prepare fish, meat, wine, and rice to entertain them diligently. Due to the full-scale mobilization of farming, the supply of rice straw has been cut off, so the price of new rice, which had fallen to 30,000 yuan per shi, has risen back to 40,000 yuan, and the price of burning grass, which had fallen to 4,000 yuan per dan, has risen back to 5,000 yuan. However, this is a temporary phenomenon during the harvest season. It is expected that when the osmanthus blooms, the price of rice will still fall to below 30,000 yuan, and the price of tall grass will also fall sharply.

Northern Anhui Counties Turn into Waterlands

The suffering and happiness are like heaven and abyss, and northern Anhui is the most extreme. The Huai River, Sha River, and Quan River have been flooded by the Yellow River water from the Huayuankou breach, leveling the embankments. The torrential rain that lasted for a month flooded the land to a depth of several feet, and there was no way to discharge the water. The rain also soaked the roots of the embankments, and there was no soil to dig, so how could they be rescued? As a result, the rivers collapsed one after another with a roar, and the sorghum, millet, miscellaneous grains, etc. in the fields were swept away by the water. Ying Shang, Huo Qiu, Fengtai, and Shou County, covering hundreds of miles, have become a vast waterland. People, livestock, and houses have floated into the Crystal Palace. Countless surviving victims, mostly old and young, went out to seek food, becoming refugees like Zheng Xia after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The price of wheat, the staple food in northern Anhui, has reached 100,000 yuan per shi (40 jin), how can the impoverished people bear this high pressure on their livelihoods? The Huang disaster relief committees in Ying Shang and other counties have been established recently, and they have reported the disaster to the province, asking for (1) exemption from military tax and public grain this year, (2) allocation of continuation grain from 1944 for relief on the spot, and (5) the relief sub-office to quickly abolish large-scale material relief. It is heard that the provincial government has approved the allocation of grain for relief, which is a short-term blessing for the victims, but it is still a drop in the bucket, and various parties still need to find other ways to provide widespread relief.

Severe Disaster in Fuyang Due to Levee Breach

I recently met a friend from Fuyang, who said that the Huang disaster in that county was even more severe than in other counties! The Ying River, Quan River, Hong River, and Qian River in the territory were all flooded by the Huang River water. The Yuehekou and the north bank of the Hong River collapsed one after another. In early July, there was heavy rain again, and the land was flooded with several feet of water. The crops in the fields were all drowned, and the loss of life and property was difficult to estimate! In the 104 townships in the county, 80 were affected. There are now hundreds of thousands of disaster victims who are exposed to the elements, without clothes or food. They are emaciated and miserable, and deaths are occurring one after another. The situation is unprecedentedly tragic! In recent days, the United Provincial Association of Fellow Villagers has gone to the provincial government and the relief sub-office to appeal for the allocation of large amounts of material for relief and to ask the provincial council to raise a call to encourage donations from various counties to expand relief efforts.

Hail and Rain for Days, Sprouts in the Fields

What is lacking in central Anhui is that since the beginning of autumn, there has been a hailstorm almost every day. The heat has been swept away by the autumn wind, but the water in the upland and lowland fields will flood the rice ears, hindering the harvest. Sprouts have also grown in the fields. If the weather does not improve, the food at the door may suffer a major setback. Today (the 3rd), the black clouds disappeared and the red sun rose. The people everywhere are celebrating!

Representatives Call for Significant Reduction in Loans and Taxes

The total amount of loans and taxes for this autumn in the province was originally stipulated by the Ministry of Food, with each yuan of land tax requiring the borrowing of four dou, excluding the public grain at the provincial and county levels, totaling 8 million shi. Fortunately, the provincial council publicly recommended Gao Shouheng, who was old and virtuous, and Jin Weinong, who was enthusiastic about public welfare, to go to Beijing to represent the 30 million people of the province and make a desperate appeal to the central government. As a result, public opinion was accepted, and the specified amount was greatly reduced, changing it to borrow three and lend one, plus 30% for public grain at the provincial and county levels, totaling 5.39 million shi. Mr. Gao and others made a long journey in the humid summer to benefit the people, and their trip was not in vain.

Many People Reducing the Number of County Offices

The province originally had 51 county grain offices. Last month, the Ministry of Food eliminated counties with fewer taxes and determined that there would only be 31. The provincial office was very troubled by this matter! Because if they followed the order, the reorganization of the grain section would be hurried and would affect the entire collection. If they were to be temporarily preserved, where would the huge salaries and subsidies for the 20 offices be paid from? The provincial office is currently submitting a report to the Ministry of Food for approval. Director Yang Zhongming of the provincial office also went to Beijing on the 18th to argue for it. In addition, in order to adjust personnel and improve operations, the provincial office decided to replace the heads of 16 county offices, including Hefei. The candidates were chosen for their integrity and experience. It is heard that the number of people recommended by various parties reached over 200. There was a lot of competition for few positions, making it difficult to choose. The candidates for the county offices who have been announced are only 10 offices, including Hefei and Shexian, with only six offices remaining that are still competing. However, for the sake of the people of the province, it is hoped that they will break through the front as much as possible and carefully choose those with strict integrity to achieve the goal of enriching the country and benefiting the people.

### Family Economic System

— Du Yun

Chinese people have traditionally lacked a so-called "system" for family finances. Even privately owned businesses often make this mistake, resulting in no final accounts and no budgets. Consequently, there are often issues of excessive waste or financial strain in life. To remedy this problem, a family economic system should be established.

First, household accounts should be kept. The benefit of keeping accounts is not only that income and expenses are clear but also that examining expenditures helps one realize what is wasteful, what is necessary, and what can be saved. With a final account, a budget can also be made. This is the initial step toward a healthy family economy.

Second, live within your means. Unlike the government, which determines expenses first and then seeks to generate income to balance them, many people in Shanghai hold onto the attitude of "drink today, worry tomorrow" or the belief that "money spent will return." There are also those who are accustomed to speculation during the period of occupation, viewing making money as too easy and spending it all without a thought. However, now that the environment is different, they are experiencing financial difficulties due to past habits of extravagance. This is due to not establishing a family economic system.

Third, separate family and personal finances. Some people keep their money solely for themselves, with the wife unaware of her husband's monthly salary or how it is spent. She must ask her husband for money to buy groceries or daily necessities. Under the husband's sole control of finances, neither wife nor children have any room to manage their own finances. As a result, the wife may often inflate expenses to get some pocket money from her husband's allowance, while the husband may also deceive his wife in hopes of achieving savings. In reality, this is not the best approach. At the beginning of the month, in addition to budgeting for regular family expenses, the husband should also provide the wife and children with an appropriate amount of money, allowing them to independently allocate their spending. This not only allows for budgeting family expenses but also cultivates the children's knowledge of using money. As long as they do not use it for gambling or improper activities, it can also cultivate the wife's and daughters' self-esteem and autonomy. Being able to freely use money brings a sense of joy!

### How Should You Treat a Husband Who Comes Home Late at Night?

— Feng

Every virtuous housewife hopes to have a harmonious and sweet, fulfilling family. This is undeniable. But if, unfortunately, your husband comes home late at night, what will you do?

Generally, housewives often deal with them by arguing, questioning, and glaring. After they return, they don't let them sleep peacefully, forcing them to explain the reason for their lateness. After all, the reasons usually fall into two categories: normal social interactions or an affair where they spent time with a girlfriend's sweet words. The former is forgivable, while the latter must be rigorously questioned. This is the common understanding. In reality, the fault lies with them, but using this method to deal with them is not very clever.

First, we must understand that harmony and love between husband and wife are built entirely on genuine emotions, and the cultivation of emotions is based on mutual care and consideration. If one side speaks harshly and glares, then in the vital pre-condition of affectionate feelings between husband and wife, it is undoubtedly a failed strategy. The reason why housewives adopt such severe measures to deal with their husbands is to prevent them from engaging in inappropriate behavior outside and to bring them back to their former love. However, in reality, this not only will not achieve any effect but will increase their hatred and resentment, even leading to them not coming home at all!

Smart housewives, if unfortunately faced with this situation, will definitely use the greatest patience and deepest emotions to stop it. The pain and resentment hidden within her heart will never be revealed on her face or in her actions. The night is deep, and the earth is silent. Under the dim lone lamp, she leans alone on the head of the bed or sits on the sofa, mending her husband's clothes. The rhythmic ticking of the clock, cold and monotonous, strikes her sorrowful heart. However, she does not despair, does not become pessimistic, and is determined to wait for her husband's return! Finally, the door is gently pushed open, and the husband tiptoes in through the darkness. When he discovers that his wife is still leaning on the head of the bed at such a late hour, waiting for him to return home, he will surely be deeply moved by that affection. At this time, she should greet him with a weary smile, striving to suppress the resentment in her heart, and not ask a single word about the reason for his late return. Instead, she should gently and considerately ask him if he is tired, if he wants to eat some snacks, and tell him to go to sleep quickly because his health is important and he has to work tomorrow! Everything is as if nothing happened, and they peacefully lie down in bed together. At this moment, I can know that if this couple had a passionate love affair before marriage, the husband will repeatedly toss and turn, unable to fall asleep, because the gentle love, care, and generosity of the virtuous wife will deeply stir his heart, reminding him of that period of history filled with hardship, suffering, sweetness, and bitterness! He shouldn't be so ruthless. He shouldn't commit any more wrongdoings. He will feel ashamed and guilty! If one time cannot move his heart, I urge you to complete your wish with the greatest patience and with tears in your eyes. You will definitely succeed! If your husband is a humane person, he will not only abandon his evil thoughts but will also love and respect you doubly because of your kindness, deep affection, and consideration.

Have you seen the beautiful and moving film "The Great Waltz"? The gentle and virtuous Henriette, Johann Strauss's wife, used the most sincere emotions and patience to make her husband abandon the diva Karla and return to her embrace!

### Addenda to "Some Dietary Notes"

— Bu Yun

In recent years, the progress of nutritional science has changed the general public's perception of food. Some research findings have even surprised the scientists themselves. Some, you might say, "What? I've always thought so!"

(1) Roast beef should be eaten rare, because the flavorful red juice is blood-nourishing.

That flavorful red juice has no special value. Eat your beef however you like, just don't burn it into charcoal.

(2) Sugar is the most energy-producing food.

Aside from salt and water, all common foods produce heat energy. This heat energy is measured in calories or "heat units." However, this heat energy has nothing to do with the so-called energy and endurance that ordinary people imagine. Sugar is merely like other simple carbohydrates: easily digestible and chemically, heat energy can quickly penetrate the blood to be used by the body.

(3) Fish is brain food.

Fish contains phosphorus, and brain tissue also contains phosphorus. The phosphorus in fish can reach brain tissue, as well as other phosphorus-containing parts of the human body such as nerve tissue and teeth, just like the phosphorus contained in milk, steak, and so on.

(4) Fried foods are the most difficult for the stomach to digest.

Careful research has not found evidence for this common view. Fat remains in the stomach for a longer time than other foods, but this does not mean it is indigestible. Fried eggs and boiled eggs are equally easy to digest. The fat contained in fried pancakes and fried dough twists is just as easily digested and absorbed as the same amount of fat cooked in other ways.

(5) It is dangerous to eat acidic foods and milk at the same time, because the acid will curdle the milk. Strawberries and milk, for example, should not be eaten together.

If you can eat the two foods separately, then you can also eat them mixed. If fruit acid cannot curdle milk, your stomach acid will still curdle the milk.

(6) Drinking large amounts of milk can prevent tooth decay.

Drinking large amounts of milk is beneficial, but most drinkers with existing cavities would deny this belief. Although milk is the largest source of calcium and phosphorus - the main minerals contained in teeth - some other elements are still needed to combine these two minerals into a complete tooth, and these elements may be missing in your diet.

(7) Do not eat rice and water at the same time.

Unless you swallow rice without chewing and with water. Water will not dilute the contents of your stomach. It flows out of the stomach in one go and is immediately absorbed by the large intestine.

(8) Wheat bread is more nutritious than white bread.

White bread is easier to digest. Made from cheese and refined flour, it is the main source of various minerals, vitamins, carbohydrates, and heat energy. Whole wheat bread naturally contains many valuable elements originally in wheat grains and coarse fiber that aids excretion. However, coarse fiber is not very easily tolerated by sensitive digestive organs. Both types of bread are equally nutritious foods.

(9) The natural vitamins contained in food

are superior to artificially produced vitamins.

All known vitamins, whether in natural foods or in pills, have no chemical difference in composition. Although many foods may contain some unknown vitamins that have not yet been distinguished, plus other trace substances, which are therefore important for nutrition, artificial vitamins are indeed the best supplements.

### Small Family

— Mo Ping

——Minimum Living Expenses——

Taking a family of a husband, a wife, and a child aged four or five as an example:

1.  Rent: A small room in a dilapidated building, monthly rent of 20,000 yuan.

2.  Rice: Each person consumes two *dou* of rice per month, with the child consuming half, so half a *shi* of rice is needed per month. The current price of rice is 60,000 yuan per month, so half a *shi* costs 30,000 yuan.

3.  Meat Money: Eat meat once a month, usually eat vegetarian dishes. The average daily cost of vegetables is 1,000 yuan (four pieces of tofu, one *jin* of winter melon, one *jin* of green vegetables).

4.  Oil, Salt, Sauce, Vinegar: Limited to 5,000 yuan per month (5 *jin* of vegetable oil, 1 *jin* of salt, 2 *jin* of soy sauce, 300 yuan for vinegar).

5.  Coal Costs: Burning two *dan* of coal briquettes per month, 16,000 yuan, firewood for lighting the fire, 3,000 yuan.

6.  Soap, Toothpaste: Valued at 2,000 yuan per month.

7.  Toilet Paper: 1,000 yuan needed per month.

8.  Child's Snacks and Adult's Breakfast: A minimum of 1,000 yuan per day.

9.  Newspaper: 150 yuan per copy, 4,500 yuan needed per month.

10. Stamps: 500 yuan per month.

11. Streetcar fare to the office: 7,000 yuan per month.

12. Tea, Matches: One *liang* of tea costs 100 yuan per month. One box of matches every five days costs 100 yuan, so 600 yuan is needed per month.

13. In terms of spending money, let's use the lowest grade cigarette, priced at 200 yuan per pack, one pack every two days, already requires 3,000 yuan per month. Add unavoidable socializing and buying envelopes and other miscellaneous items. Estimated at 20,000 yuan per month, a total of 23,000 yuan.

14. Shirts, Leather Shoes, Towels, Socks, Children's Shoes, etc.: Limited to 300,000 yuan per year (this amount is only enough for each person to add two pieces of cloth clothing, two pairs of leather shoes, three pairs of children's shoes, five or six pairs of socks, and towels). An average of 25,000 yuan per month.

The total monthly expense is 200,600 yuan. This amount is truly the minimum living expenses for a small family of two and a half people per month. However, in the eyes of a small civil servant, it will probably still be a luxurious amount.

### Wife Needs Help

— Gang Ren

——One of Miss Dix's Mailboxes——

Dear Miss Dix:

Do you think I was wrong? To ask my husband for some help on a Sunday morning.

During the week, my husband only needs to work five days, and only eight hours each day, but every evening after returning, he just takes care of eating, reading the newspaper, and resting. On Sunday, he firmly refuses to give me any help, saying that this day is God's designated day of rest for him.

We already have a child who is just two months old, who needs constant care. So, in addition to doing housework and cooking all day long, I also have to take care of such a child, which makes me feel very tired. Therefore, I asked him to tidy up our house on Sunday, but he resolutely refused.

Afterward, he said that children do not need excessive care and hopes that I can also find a position and go out to work.

Am I wrong? Because I suspect that my husband no longer loves me! Manqi

Dear Ms. Manqi:

Clearly, your husband is a man who loves himself more. He neither considers the happiness of others nor gives comfort to others.

He may have a good heart to treat you, but perhaps it is only because you can be like a pair of good horses that endure hardship without complaint. So, this is not enough to make him reach out to help you.

Your husband only works five days, in other words, there are two full days of free time and only forty hours of work. What about you? Almost all-day work, no Sundays or holidays, like the famous poem says:

"Men finish their work, from sunrise to sunset; what about women? There is work that is never finished."

When you think of such an unbalanced work between a man and a woman, you must be surprised that women have endured it for so long, never wanting to put down their hands and go on strike to demand a shorter working time, so that men can also share some of the responsibilities of raising children for "motherhood"; if possible, wash the dishes or wipe the floor!

They will win, because everything in this world will stop advancing. If one day no one prepares food, raises children, tidies up the everything in the home.

But he is able to wash some bowls, or take the children out to play, so that within this hour. No more children come to cling to their mother's neck, and it is not a husband's supreme love for his wife:

However, a husband who truly loves his wife should think about how to reduce the burden of motherhood!

### The Merits, Demerits, and Rights and Wrongs of Jazz Music

— Liang Youting

"Jazz Music" is translated into Chinese as "爵士音樂" [juéshì yīnyuè], which literally translates to "Duke Music." Looking at the characters, it seems very noble, but it is actually just a transliteration. The original meaning did not say: "This is the music of dukes." On the contrary, it was popular in South America before World War I, and it is said to be a creation of black people. To this day, black dance music is still authentic "jazz."

If we refer to Chinese popular and elegant music, "jazz" should belong to popular music. Its characteristics are lightness, liveliness, excitement, and stimulation, and it is full of carnal temptation. The music that Tolstoy opposed mainly refers to this kind of music. The emergence of this type of music is due to people's "excessively indulgent" enthusiasm. As for why jazz became jazz, it is because the structure of the music purely uses rapid rhythms, smooth melodies, and lively harmonies. It uses "syncopation" and obvious rhythms. Why do we say that it is full of carnal temptation? My personal explanation is as follows: A piece of music that can stimulate the listener's spirit is often music with a delicate melody, a not-too-rapid, not-too-obvious rhythm, deep emotion, and slightly melancholic in some places. It makes the mind immersed in certain thoughts or memories and aspirations. Conversely, a piece of music that makes people dance and expand their limbs, that excites the listener's body, must be music with a strong and obvious rhythm, and a fast tempo. Dance music and marches are examples of this. We are not saying that pieces with a fast tempo are not as good as pieces with a slow tempo, but if we specifically emphasize excessive excitement in terms of physical sensation, and make the music and dance of the time purely about sensory pleasures, then these arts lack artistic elements. Hume said, "The highest art is consistent with morality," which can also illustrate that music should not move toward "low-level indulgence."

Americans are too wealthy and particularly like jazz music. But the attacks on jazz are directly proportional to its popularity. I remember once an American radio station asked the famous conductor Itubi to conduct jazz music. Itubi hated it while conducting, and as a result, he stopped halfway and announced to the audience: "Ladies and gentlemen, this is not music, I can't do it, I can't hurt your hearing!"

Everywhere, we can hear the voice of condemning jazz music, but jazz music cannot be eliminated. To speak frankly, many famous musicians sometimes like to play jazz. The famous violinist Heifetz and the famous conductor Toscanini both play or conduct jazz. However, it should be pointed out that Chinese jazz is different from foreign jazz. The tricks of jazz also require skill. For example, expressing the sound of laughter in the Saxophone requires very high skill to achieve. According to Mr. Dai, the principal of the National Conservatory of Music, he heard the performance of jazz by local orthodox musicians in Vienna, and the skill was really admirable!

Currently, the Shanghai Music Association has invited Chinese and foreign musicians to discuss the issue of dance music in Shanghai. As a result, they did not reach a conclusion on jazz either. The level of the performers is too low, and everyone thinks it is simply a mishmash. As for the more acceptable jazz, they did not deny its advantage of being close to the masses, but in the current China, jazz is not needed. Their conclusion is: jazz can be "critically accepted."

The above rambling words are just to introduce a general overview of jazz. In terms of its merits, demerits, and rights and wrongs, I still cannot sympathize with it. As Mr. Chen Hong said, "Technique exists to express content. If the content is not good, what is the use of technique?" Therefore, although jazz technique is not entirely without merit, its essence is actually the same as the cookie-cutter and colorful song and dance films of America! As for the music in Shanghai dance halls, it is not even worthy of being called jazz!

### Small Thoughts While Watching Clouds

— Che

Long confined to the desolate dryness of the desert, I thought of visiting the small bridges and flowing water of Jiangnan. But after a plane landed at Jiangwan Airport, I was plunged into the hustle and bustle of Shanghai, and almost a year passed in a hurry. I had almost forgotten that besides the cunning, streamlined cars and gaudy, makeup-smeared skyscrapers created by humans, there was also a world naturally crafted by heaven.

Only once, in a sleeping car on the Jinghu Railway, with the lights dim and the window curtains half-closed, did I see the lush green fields outside, sleeping heavily, deeply breathing in the breath of the summer night. The moonlight was like water, shining on the verdant plants, shining into the windows of the car, and I recalled many distant scenes like light veils, distant faces of friends like shadows... But soon I fell asleep in the fatigue of a day's journey.

Another time, in the film *Lassie Come Home*, immersed in the air conditioning of the theater, I watched the scenes of the forests in the Scottish grasslands, which were so familiar and so intimate. The sunlight through the dense leaves illuminated the forests so crystal clear, so exquisitely beautiful. Who would I ride horses and gallop with there... But when the show ended, I was back in the scorching sun.

This morning, I accidentally looked up from the window and saw the sky was so blue, with wisps of curly white clouds, floating charmingly like white sails. I suddenly felt that I had been separated from these for so long, so long. Had I not looked at the sky for a year?...

Being obsessed with wealth and fame can certainly turn Zhongnan Mountain into a bustling marketplace, but even being absorbed in work and career can gradually lead people to become mediocre. And can a mediocre person truly always focus on work and career without treating means as ends, pursuing fame and fortune? A difference of a hair's breadth is often wrong by a thousand miles.

Friends often wonder why I don't smoke or drink, but in the past, did I need to smoke or drink? In remote places, doing land reclamation work, there were enough dreams and interests in life. Why did I need tobacco and alcohol?

But in the future, I should "steal half a day of leisure" to learn about smoking and drinking. Perhaps the ethereal smoke rings will lead me to look up at the sky, giving me a glimmer of dreams; perhaps the rich and strong alcohol will make me leave the entangled real life, giving me a little lofty interest.

### ### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 21

My mind was like a pot of boiling water, tumbling and churning, and I simply didn't know how to answer him.

"You lie here and don't move; otherwise, retreat into the mountains!" As he spoke, he was already gone, as swift and agile as a wildcat.

I felt my whole body trembling, unsure whether it was excitement or shame; the blood vessels all over my body seemed about to burst, my forehead and temples throbbed, and my heart seemed to float up. My throat felt like it was burning, and it was extremely dry.

With all my might, I saw Little Tiger leap onto the highway, aim at the truck, and after only a few steps, he raised his arm, and a bullet had already left the barrel, as if shooting at the truck. At the second shot, the light on top of the truck cab went out. After a while, the headlights also went out, and the highway was pitch black. Then I heard the sound of Mauser pistols on the truck answering the other side's rifles, one by one, seemingly rhythmic, but I never saw that _____.

From the wounded soldiers, I learned that they were soldiers under General Zhang Zizhong, guarding the area from Langfang to Zhimen; they had fought the Japanese devils several times. "They are all sneaky; they launch a sneak attack and then flee; each of our defense zones has no contact either. When the Japanese devils come, we just go up and block them. I heard that Commander-in-Chief Song (Zheyuan) doesn't want to fight, and our officers can't order us to fight either, so we can only get beaten!"

More than a dozen cart drivers were injured, not too severely. These nine military officers killed eight of the twenty-two wounded soldiers. I asked the cart drivers to go into the city with us. They _____ for a while and decided on a plan; those who were injured would pull their carts home on their own; those who were not injured would have to return to the front line, because there were simply not many stretcher bearers there...

"See you later!" The few who were not injured pulled up their carts and greeted me. In order to rescue those brave men who were guarding every inch of the motherland's land, this small line summoned up courage again, took firm steps, and hurried to the front line.

"Uncle!" After a while, the child ran back, his face covered in sweat; his clothes, a blue short-sleeved shirt, were also sticking to his body, and he was carrying a Mauser rifle, the latest German-style twelve-shot, probably used by the "Imperial Army".

"Can we go now?" He smiled, but also with some nervousness. The smile was to comfort me; the nervous expression was probably because he was afraid that something would go wrong again. As I started the truck, I briefly told him what had happened here.

"The generals just drive fast, don't worry about us, we can take the small roads home, don't be afraid--" The injured cart drivers pulled their carts, limping along, seeing that our truck was driving slowly, and they thought we were protecting them.

"Seven, not counting the cart driver--four locals, using the cart driver's Mauser pistols on this truck; chased three, using this long gun; and a few scattered and left--you know, I dare to see them, but they dare not see me!" He smiled playfully, while politely offering me a bite, and he himself ate the ______ cake he had squeezed out of his pocket.

### ### A Storm (Novel)

— Shi Qi

Wang Changfa walked into Zhengyanglou Chinese Restaurant, sat by the window, settled his buttocks on the stool, and slapped the table hard:

"Waiter!"

The waiter hurriedly ran over with an oilcloth over his shoulder?

"Sir, what do you want?..."

Wang Changfa glared at the waiter, his eyes rolling around, and suddenly stood up!

"Slap!" He slapped the waiter in the face:

"Damn it, you're doing business, and you don't even know the rules!"

The waiter's face was burning, he rolled his eyes, and threw the oilcloth behind him:

"Damn it, you hit, you hit someone..."

"Hit, I'll hit you, you bastard!"

Wang Changfa stood up suddenly, grabbed the waiter's ear, and slapped him on the face like he was fanning himself.

"Slap, slap, slap, slap!"

"I'll hit you, you bastard, I'll teach you a lesson!"

The accountant sitting at the desk pulled on the sleeve of the old _____ sitting next to him:

"Boss, Li Si is really unlucky this time. Why doesn't he have eyes? You dare to offend Wang Changfa, the famous secret agent of the Guandong Leased Territory?"

The boss stuck his tongue out for a long time but couldn't retract it.

"This is Wang Changfa, damn it, am I also unlucky? Sir, I beg you, go and persuade him!"

The accountant touched his head, stood up, and sat down again, looking at the boss.

The boss kept bowing:

"I beg you, sir, I'll treat you later, just take pity on me!"

Over there, Li Si was being beaten like a ball by his ear:

"Ouch, ouch, ouch..."

So pitiful. The accountant helplessly stood up, took two steps and combined them into three, and scurried over. He didn't dare to pull Wang Changfa, but gritted his teeth and slapped Li Si in the face.

"Your business is getting worse and worse. What did I teach you all day in the shop? This is Wang-Daya, we can't even invite him. Are you blind?" Then another kick:

"Get out, pack your bags and get lost!"

Then he quickly turned around, bowing repeatedly:

"Wang-Daya, you're a big man, don't be angry with a small man. This guy just came, he doesn't know the rules. You see, I was too negligent, I was only busy keeping accounts, I didn't see you come in, Wang-Daya..."

Another bow.

Wang Changfa finally let the accountant push him to sit on the stool, and said with a stern face:

"Boss, you know how to do business!"

The accountant bowed:

"Easy to say, Wang-Daya, doing business has rules!..."

Wang Changfa slapped the table:

"You also know the rules!" He pointed out the window:

On the ground outside the window, someone, after eating, couldn't digest it, and threw up all over the ground. The ground was covered with white rice grains, as if someone had spilled a bowl of white rice porridge there.

"Do you know that the Guandong Leased Territory strictly forbids Chinese people from eating white rice?"

The accountant's heart was beating non-stop, wondering which grandson had caused trouble here. Haven't we suffered enough from the Japanese devils in recent years?

While thinking in his stomach, he kept bowing.

"Answering your question, Wang-Daya, my shop would never dare to sell white rice, that's the rule. You, Wang-Daya, are always wise. I'll go check for you, check for you..."

As he spoke, his feet slipped, and he flew out like a plane....

There was a moment of chaos in the shop, the boss and the waiter all ran out....

After a long time, the accountant stumbled back in, put his mouth to Wang Changfa's ear, whispered for a long time, and then squatted down to offer his respects:

"Please, Wang-Daya, give me some face!"

Wang-Daya waved his hand and nodded:

"I'm going to catch the rice seller!"

The accountant immediately rushed over:

"Of course, of course, just beg you not to arrest the people who ate it. I'll have them take you there, and I guarantee you'll catch them!"

He beckoned to the door, and a person ran over like a puff of smoke.

"Quick, pay your respects to Wang-Daya." That person respectfully offered his respects:

"Thank you, Wang-Daya, I'll take Wang-Daya there."

Wang-Daya glared at that person with his triangular eyes:

"What's your name?"

"Answering your question, Wang-Daya, my name is Xie En!"

"Xie En, you're not allowed to lie!"

Xie En then offered his respects again:

"I wouldn't dare, Wang-Daya!"

Wang Changfa happily stood up and patted the accountant on the shoulder?

"Good kid, this is to your credit!"

He pointed his hand at Xie En:

"Let's go!"

Xie En walked respectfully in front, leading Wang Changfa out.

The accountant breathed a sigh of relief, sat down at the desk, and glared triumphantly at the boss:

"Finally got this demon out!"

The boss flattered:

"Thanks to you, sir, I'll be the host!" He raised his neck and shouted:

"Tell the kitchen to add four dishes for the sir, make them neat, and bring half a jin of white liquor!"

The accountant leaned his head against the wall, closed his eyes, and looked as excited as if he had already drunk half a jin of wine:

"This, this time, uh, lost some rice, uh..."

The boss sighed:

"Sister-in-law Liang is also quite pitiful,..."

The accountant shook his head:

"A real man, when doing things, must be ruthless..."

He didn't continue, because Xie En and Wang Changfa were already knocking on Sister-in-law Liang's door.

"Sister-in-law Liang, it's me, Xie En:"

Wang Changfa flashed to the side of the wall, the door opened with a creak, and Xie En darted in:

"Do you have rice, Sister-in-law Liang?"

"How much do you want? But the price has gone up!"

Wang Changfa suddenly burst out:

"Good, secretly selling white rice, the Japanese..."

He looked up, and in front of him was the face of a pretty woman, her round eyes staring. He almost fainted:

"It's you?"

An old woman came out from the inner room, looking very peaceful:

"Wang-Daya, this is the third wife's capital, you're arresting someone from your own family!"

That woman, the one called Sister-in-law Liang, stamped her small foot and threw herself into Wang Changfa's arms:

"You arrest, you arrest, you dare to arrest me, you must have been bewitched by some fox spirit. Tonight you can forget about getting on my bed!"

Wang Changfa stood there stunned, and suddenly seemed to wake up. He jumped over and slapped Xie En hard in the face:

"Get lost!"

### ### Night Crying

— Shao Fu

Returning home at midnight, bringing with me a body full of exhaustion, hoping for a peaceful sleep, but at this time, the cries of a child came from my neighbor's house. In the quiet of the night, it stood out in relief, making it difficult to fall asleep.

Rain of flowers, ghost night crying, are legendary omens of social misfortune. A child's night crying is just domestic unrest. However, in any case, it is an iron fact that parents have failed to take good care of their children, resulting in this unhealthy condition. However, fathers and brothers often go to the streets and walls to post such posters: "Heaven is bright, earth is bright, my family has a night crying boy, a gentleman walking by recites this once, and sleeps soundly until the sky is bright," instead of seeking medical treatment and medication. This ignorant behavior has sacrificed many precious little lives.

Children's physiological functions are fragile and cannot withstand the slightest invasion. In cases of discomfort, dissatisfaction, and pain, they can only express their pain by crying, which is very different from adults.

"A person who has not cried bitterly through the long night is not qualified to talk about life." The crying of adults is not limited to pain. The tragedy of a widow's night crying is not difficult for us to imagine.

Disappointments are often eight or nine out of ten, but only two or three can be told to others. If we wake up from a midnight dream and lie in bed thinking about everything during the day, I'm afraid there are very few people who don't want to cry. It's a pity that we can't be like a sick child, able to be uninhibited and emotional, often just crying silently!

### ### The Fame of the Wright Brothers, Inventors of the Airplane

— Fan Fu

"I am more concerned about world peace than the future of the aviation industry!" — Orville Wright said at his recent 75th birthday.

In 1871, two obscure figures were born in Ohio, USA: Wilbur Wright and his younger brother Orville Wright.

The Wright brothers were poor, and they tasted the bitterness of the world as children. Life forced them to think about ways to make a living. At the age of six or seven, the two brothers ran to waste and garbage piles all day, picking out bones and scrap copper from them and selling them to soap factories and second-hand shops to earn money. They entered school very late and only completed elementary school education. Later, they used the money they had saved frugally to open a small bicycle shop.

Dropping out of school halfway was originally a last resort. Whenever they had free time, the two brothers would definitely take out books and read. One day, Orville was reading in a public library and read the writings of the German scientist Lilienthal, describing his design for a kite-like glider and the theory of how it could rise into the air. This narrative and understanding aroused great interest in Orville. That night, he had several identical dreams in a row: he was sitting in a glider, which rose into the air, just like a sparrow.

After the two brothers' joint research and efforts, Orville's dream became a human miracle: at 10:35 on December 17, 1903, Orville climbed into that primitive plane. After untying the ropes, the engine emitted thick smoke and a heavy creaking sound, and then it rushed forward, rising into the air, lasting for twelve seconds, and then landing on the plain one hundred meters away. This was the process of the first airplane taking off in the world. At that time, Orville was only thirty-two years old.

After that, the Wright brothers devoted themselves to researching biplanes and finally succeeded. The two then traveled by air in the United States and overseas. In 1909, the French "Learned Society" presented the Wright brothers with an invention certificate. In 1915, the Wright brothers sold all the machinery and profits of the "Wright Airplane Company", which they had founded in their hometown of Dayton, but they served as technical consultants to the company. In the same year, the U.S. Department of the Navy hired the Wright brothers as consultants.

At the end of last month, Orville Wright celebrated his 75th birthday in the United States. During his birthday, he said that he was more concerned about world peace than the future of the aviation industry. — Of course, he did not foresee that airplanes would be used as murderous weapons.

— Wen Yi

Professor: Tell me, in any year, the number of tons of coal exported by the United States.

Student: In 1491 (Note: The year Columbus discovered the New World), the United States did not export a single ton of coal.

### ### Proportion

— Sun Yuehan

I have a friend who teaches at × Elementary School. The subject he is in charge of is advanced arithmetic. The students have not been able to thoroughly understand the problem of proportion. So he used a simple analogy: "For example, in today's society, high-ranking officials make big money, and low-ranking officials make small money, which is called direct proportion. Also, for example, the busiest people earn the least money, and the most idle people earn the most money, which is called inverse proportion..."

### ### Electron Microscope

— Zhang Wenzhong

——Scientific Common Sense——

According to a TASS report from Leningrad last month, the 12th, an electron microscope that can magnify objects by 40,000 to 50,000 times has been completed here. The microscope was manufactured by the Red Guard Factory and is used for microbial research, etc. The term "electron microscope" may still be a term that we are not very familiar with, so I will briefly introduce the manufacturing principle of the microscope as follows:

It is found that the microscopes currently used in daily life are all composed of various convex and concave lenses. Using its curvature, objects can be magnified up to 2,000 times. In addition, a less common type of microscope uses ultraviolet rays that cannot be seen by the human eye to project images of objects onto photosensitive plates, and then develops them with chemical solutions. With this microscope, objects can be magnified up to 5,000 times.

The so-called "electron microscope" was originally invented in Germany, and the United States followed closely behind. Now Russia can also manufacture it itself. In terms of appearance, it is not very moving, just a tall, six-and-a-half-foot-high cylinder that can be placed on a table. The top is equipped with handles and pointers, and the inside is vacuumed to allow electrons to move freely. A thin tungsten wire is installed on the top of the cylinder. When current passes through, an electron current is generated. Different voltages are applied below the thin tungsten wire to increase the speed of the electron current flowing downward. Below is a magnetic field, which can bend the electron current and converge it into a focus. A fluorescent plate is installed on the focus, and the object to be magnified passes through the electron beam and is projected onto this plate for observation. Unfortunately, this type of light is harmful to living organisms, so it can only be captured as an image for observation. However, because light is not used for photography, it cannot be called an image. Scientists have given it another name: "Electron Display Image."

Under the electron microscope, we can see the true nature of various germs, and thus be able to further study the causes of the disease. Industrialists have used electron microscopes to improve cement manufacturing, and the mining industry is using electron microscopes to study minerals that are harmful to the health of miners. Chemists have seen the molecular composition of various elements under the electron microscope, which has created an amazing advancement in organic chemistry, resulting in the enjoyment of artificial glass, artificial silk, and artificial rubber.

Scientists have also told us that as long as a voltage of one million volts is applied, causing electrons to flow at 175,000 miles per second, we can see the unimaginable "atoms" that are smaller than molecules. Creating a million-volt voltage is not an impossible task, so the future of the electron microscope is just beginning. However, if we always wait and see or sit back and enjoy the results, we will always lag behind others!

### ### Witnessing Strange Things

— Leng Yan

On August 25th and 26th, the second batch of new students at × University took the entrance examination. Strange things happened in the examination hall, which were both funny and absurd, and rare in the history of the university. Here are a few examples:

In the third class, when testing civics, the test questions were relatively new. A large number of ×× students, feeling that it was difficult to write, shouted from the heights by ×××: "Are today's test questions difficult or not?" Everyone said: "Difficult." Then he shouted: "Difficult! Everyone doesn't take the test, everyone goes to question who made these test questions." At that time, the crowd was in an uproar and left the examination hall one after another, and the order was greatly disturbed. The proctors were at a loss and stood there like wooden chickens. Seeing the overwhelming momentum, they fled with their heads in their arms.

A certain examiner, who did not wear the red ribbon with the words "Examiner" on it, walked proudly into the examination hall, but was asked by a certain examinee: "Who are you?" "Do you understand the rules of the examination hall?" "You are disrupting our order"... A long string of words made the examiner confused, with a flushed face and red ears, he hurriedly took out the ribbon from his pocket and put it on.

### Where Did Sherlock Holmes Come From (5)

— Translated by Si Dao Shuai Zhuo Yu Qiang

This agent generously hired two British literary figures: one was a talkative Member of Parliament named Gill (Glll), whose pen name was Oscar Wilde; the other was a poor doctor from Portsmouth, Arthur Conan Doyle. Oscar Wilde engaged in lively conversation. The two happy writers immediately promised to write for Lippincott's Monthly Magazine. Later, Wilde wrote "The Picture of Dorian Gray," while Doyle's work was "The Sign of Four." The text describes Holmes and Watson walking into the London fog together to investigate atrocities and murders.

The book was published as a standalone volume in the autumn of 1890 by Spencer Blackett. This edition is rare and difficult to find today. However, the royalty income was insufficient for the author's needs, and Conan Doyle continued to practice medicine in Southsea.

He was a humble man, and always a practicing doctor. When his profession did not provide enough income, he wrote novels. In the second half of 1890, he planned to happily combine his two professions.

He thought that if he became a specialist, he would have more free time to write and a large number of patients. Therefore, he decided to go to Vienna to study specialist medicine! The die was cast, and at the end of the year, Dr. Conan Doyle and his wife closed the door of Bush Villa. Today, a plaque bearing the name "Doyle House" hangs there, making it a place of interest for travelers. It can also be said to be the birthplace of Sherlock Holmes.

In the spring, he completed his studies in Vienna. A sign for an eye specialist was nailed to a door on Divan Street, marking the beginning of a new hardship. "Every morning," Conan Doyle later wrote, "I would leave my house on Montague Place and arrive at my clinic at ten o'clock, sitting there until three or four o'clock, never disturbed by the sound of the bell."

This was perfect for literary work. At that time, many best-selling monthly magazines began to appear on newsstands, including the famous Strand Magazine. While the smoking doctor in Eiderdown looked skeptical about serializing long novels in such magazines, a series of short stories with a single protagonist was very suitable. Fortunately, the protagonist was at hand. So, Dr. Conan Doyle, the eye specialist at 2 Divan Street, began writing his famous series of detective short stories while waiting for patients, which is now known worldwide as "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes."

Now, Sherlock Holmes has firmly established himself in the world. The lean and strong figure has become as familiar a landmark as Nelson's Column and the Tower of London. The character has penetrated so deeply into the public consciousness that he lives more vividly in history than contemporary warriors and politicians. A phantom is so real, as Father Ronald Knox once happily revealed: one day someone in heaven will forget that he is just a character in a book.

### The Repatriation of Japanese Nationals and Prisoners of War in the Year After Victory

On August 15th of last year, Emperor Hirohito's surrender broadcast announced the final fate of the warmongers. The million-strong army of fierce soldiers, who had been in China for ten years, suddenly lowered their heads in dismay and became obedient prisoners. According to the surrender report from the China Theater and the General Headquarters of the Chinese Army, the total number of Japanese prisoners of war and Japanese nationals was 2,138,353, including 1,255,000 Japanese soldiers, 784,974 Japanese nationals, 56,665 Korean nationals, and 41,714 Taiwanese.

On October 25th, the Chinese and American authorities held the first meeting on the repatriation of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war in Shanghai, which agreed on a plan for the repatriation of Japanese officers, soldiers, and nationals in the China Theater, allocated the work to be undertaken by both China and the United States, and stipulated the matters to be observed by Japanese soldiers and civilians returning home. According to the plan, the Chinese mainland, Taiwan, Hainan Island, and northern Vietnam were designated as concentration points for Japanese prisoners of war, who would return to Japan by ship from twelve ports: Tanggu, Qingdao, Lianyungang, Shanghai, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, Haikou, Sanya (both ports in Hainan Island), Haiphong, Keelung, and Kaohsiung. The inland transport was to be undertaken by our side, while the sea transport was to be assisted by the US military.

On January 5th of this year, the "China-US Joint Meeting on the Repatriation of Japanese" was held in Shanghai. The meeting pointed out that as of January 1, 1946, the number of Japanese awaiting repatriation in various places was:

(Location) (Number of People)

Taiwan 492,000

Haiphong 31,000

Haikou 30,850

Sanya 10,000

Lianyungang 114,850

Qingdao 102,800

Dagu 329,500

Northeast Provinces Approximately 2,000,000

Guangzhou 110,684

Guangzhou Bay (Xiying) 3,650

Shantou 6,400

Xiamen 10,700

Shanghai 759,250

According to the original intention of the US military, in terms of sea transport, it was planned to use 80 landing ships to repatriate Japanese prisoners of war, and it was expected that all of them could be transported by the end of January 1946. Later, after several consultations, it was decided to increase the number to 85, and one Liberty ship was added, as well as Japanese ships under US control, with the repatriation scheduled to be completed by the end of June this year.

In terms of inland transport, due to the lack of ships on the Yangtze River and the repeated destruction of railways by the Communist army, the waterway and land transportation were hindered, and the transport of Japanese prisoners of war could not be fully coordinated with the sea transport, so it exceeded the original deadline. However, generally speaking, the work was not very slow. According to an announcement by the US military in early July this year, after the last batch of Japanese nationals evacuated from Shanghai by ship, there would be no trace of Japanese in Central China. This last batch of Japanese nationals who evacuated totaled 1,350 people, and the number of Japanese who had previously evacuated had reached 800,000. In the provinces of North China, 550,000 Japanese have been evacuated, leaving only a very small number. As for the work of evacuating Japanese nationals and prisoners of war in South China, Taiwan, and northern Vietnam, most of it has also been completed.

In the Northeast, the Japanese nationals and prisoners of war within the government-controlled area have already been evacuated. Regarding the Japanese in the Communist-controlled area, after negotiations between the US and the Chinese Communists, the two sides first reached an agreement, and finally the US forwarded a recommendation to the central government. On August 17th, government representative Li Xiujian, Chinese Communist representative Li Minran, and US representative Colonel Bell of the Military Mediation Department signed the Agreement on the Repatriation of Japanese Nationals in the Northeast, which came into effect on the same day. The agreement stipulated that, except for Japanese nationals in Lushun, Dalian, and Xinyicun, starting from August 20th, they would come to the National Army defense zone via the Songhua River, Lafa, and Duxi to transfer to Huludao for repatriation. At the same time, according to Sotoyama Niro, a Japanese national who returned from the Soviet Union to Fukuoka, he originally belonged to the motor vehicle unit of the Jiandao Garrison. In early October last year, he was sent to Posiet in the Soviet Union, and then sent to Sorsk in northern Siberia to work as a car laborer. His unit had 10,000 people, and there were 80,000 to 100,000 Kwantung Army soldiers in other ten concentration camps. From this, it can be seen that some of the Japanese nationals and prisoners of war in the Northeast have been transported to Siberia to serve the Soviet Union.

Regarding the requisition of technical personnel from among the Japanese nationals and prisoners of war to serve the Chinese government, since there was no explicit provision in the surrender document, there are currently 27,892 Japanese who have remained in China for service. The service period will be extended until the end of this year and will not be continued.

The repatriation of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war had to be carried out in batches due to the large number of people. The last batch of Japanese prisoners of war left Shanghai in mid-July of this year, while the last batch of Japanese in North China only boarded a ship in Tanggu on the morning of August 10th to return home. Generally speaking, the first to be repatriated were: (1) single men and women who could not support themselves, (2) undesirable elements, and (3) those who had legitimate reasons to apply for early return home and had been approved. The rest were separately stationed in "Japanese Unarmed Soldiers Concentration Camps" and "Japanese Nationals Management Offices," waiting for ships to return to Japan one after another. Taking only the Shanghai-Nanjing area as an example, there were as many as 19 concentration camps in Jiangwan, Wusong, Nanjing, and Suzhou.

In the concentration camp, the daily routine, meals, and entertainment of the Japanese prisoners of war were all scheduled. The Japanese prisoners of war's "staple food" was treated the same as that of our soldiers, and "non-staple food" and pocket money were issued separately. The Japanese nationals were given living expenses according to the local living standards. With regular life and stable living, although they were called prisoners of war, none of them were pale and thin.

According to the repatriation plan, in addition to the various rules to be observed when returning to their homeland, the items and luggage that each Japanese national and prisoner of war carried with them were limited to what they could carry on their own at one time. The cash they possessed could not exceed 1,000 Japanese yen for nationals and 500 or 200 Japanese yen for officers and soldiers. The reporter once witnessed a line of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war waiting for repatriation, each with a sad face and carrying luggage that they could not bear, and some even fell by the roadside in a disheveled state. The "favored sons of heaven" of the past ten years, once reduced to "dogs of a bereaved family," it is unknown whether they felt shame and anger in their hearts, or repentance?

For more than ten years, these Japanese have acted recklessly in our country, massacring and bullying tens of thousands of good and innocent compatriots. The blood debt and deep hatred have not yet been repaid. The magnanimity of the Chinese has allowed these "guilty of death" executioners to calmly and leisurely carry their neat luggage back home.

Every Japanese person who returns from China should forever remember! This kind of tolerance between nations is unprecedented in ancient and modern history, both in China and abroad.

### Sixty Years of Japanese Aggression Against China: Eight Years of Arduous Resistance, A Century of Humiliation Washed Away in One Day

— Special Compilation by This Newspaper

Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has been deliberately seeking overseas expansion, and aggression against China is merely one aspect of its overall policy. This can be seen in the chapter "Japanese Colonial History" in the book "The Latest World Colonial History" written by the Japanese historian Okuma Yūko. He said, "If we regard the advanced countries of England, France, the Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal as colonial powers before the 19th century, then Japan is a colonial power after the 20th century. Japan's possession of overseas colonies began with the occupation of Taiwan after the Sino-Japanese War, so Japan's colonial history is only thirty years old, and therefore, its colonial talents are still somewhat immature. However, in the following ten years or so, Japan's colonial territories have increased every year, and its management methods have gradually improved, and it has become a strong colonial power in the world, on par with the great powers." These simple words of self-description exposed the ferocious face of the aggressor, and they were delighted that Japan had become a "strong colonial power," which shows the extent of their ambition.

The formal establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan was in the ninth year of the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty—the third year of the Meiji era in Japan. Japan sent Yanagihara Sakimitsu to China to present his credentials. At that time, China was being forced to sign unequal trade treaties with Western powers. Yanagihara's trip was clearly to gather information and plan to sign a treaty based on precedent, but he failed to do so. In May of the following year, Ōkura-kyō Idate Munemoto was appointed as the official envoy, and Yanagihara Sakimitsu as the deputy envoy, and together with Li Hongzhang, they negotiated and concluded a treaty of amity with eighteen articles, a trade regulation with thirty-three articles, and attached Sino-Japanese customs regulations. However, because these were not entirely the same as the treaties signed with Western countries, they were not satisfied and repeatedly requested revisions.

The Process of Annexing Ryukyu

The Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan, the former being a dependency of China and the latter being Chinese territory, Japan, after the Meiji Restoration, had long harbored the intention to annex Ryukyu, which was close at hand. In November of the tenth year of Tongzhi, Ryukyu fishermen were caught in a hurricane and drifted to Taiwan, where they were killed by aborigines. In February of the following year, four residents of the Japanese Oda Prefecture were also killed in Taiwan. Japan then sent Foreign Minister Soejima to China to question this. At that time, the Zongli Yamen replied that the aborigines were uncivilized people outside the law. Japan then used this as an excuse to invade Taiwan. Through the mediation of British envoy Thomas Wade, a treaty was signed on September 22nd of the thirteenth year of Tongzhi. Although Taiwan was preserved, Ryukyu was de facto owned by Japan. In the fifth year of Guangxu, Japan changed Ryukyu to Okinawa Prefecture.

Korea and the Sino-Japanese War

Korea was also a tributary state and had the deepest relationship with China. Japan repeatedly sent envoys to carry out activities there, but without success. In the first year of Guangxu, the Japanese warship Unyo sailed into the Korean coast and conducted surveys, resulting in a conflict known as the Ganghwa Island Incident. As a result, the Ganghwa Treaty was signed with Korea, in which Korea was recognized as an autonomous state, in order to seek further exclusive control. Later, Yi Haeung, the biological father of the Korean King Gojong, dissatisfied with Queen Min's dictatorship, attacked the palace at night and set fire to the Japanese legation, in what became known as the Imo Incident. Japan dispatched troops to rescue and signed the Chemulpo Treaty, and Japan stationed troops in Korea. At this time, the old and new factions in Korea were opposed to each other. The old faction was attached to China, and the new faction was pro-Japanese. The old and new factions attacked each other, causing the Gapsin Coup. Japan sent Itō Hirobumi, a court envoy, to China to sign the Treaty of Tianjin with Li Hongzhang. The two countries withdrew their troops stationed in Korea, and in the future, when something happened, both sides would notify each other before sending troops. In the twentieth year of Guangxu, the Japanese encouraged the Donghak Party to rebel in Korea. The Korean king requested troops from China. China and Japan both sent troops to Korea. After the rebellion was quelled, the Japanese cabinet strongly advocated interfering in Korean internal affairs, which China opposed. This led to the Sino-Japanese War. The Chinese army suffered defeats on both land and sea. On April 17th of the twenty-first year of Guangxu, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed, recognizing Korea as a completely independent and autonomous country, ceding the Liaodong Peninsula, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, and compensating war expenses of 200 million taels of silver. Later, due to the intervention of Russia, France, and Germany, the Liaodong Peninsula was able to be returned. Although Taiwan was ceded, the local people formed organizations to resist the Japanese army's landing for half a year.

Japan and the Eight-Nation Alliance

During the Boxer Rebellion in the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu, Japan, citing the murder of secretary Sugiyama Akira by the troops of Dong Fuxiang, sent troops to occupy Xiamen. It also joined forces with the armies of Britain, France, and other countries to enter the Pingjin area, which was known as the "Eight-Nation Alliance." On September 8th of the following year, the Boxer Protocol was signed. China sent an envoy to Japan to apologize and pay a total indemnity of 450 million taels of silver, of which Japan received more than 34 million taels.

The Influence of the Russo-Japanese War

Russia incurred the resentment of Japan by interfering in the return of the Liaodong Peninsula, and both countries at that time had intentions towards Northeast China. During the Boxer Rebellion, Russian troops forcibly occupied Manchuria and refused to withdraw, and the interests of the two sides conflicted. On the night of February 8th of the thirtieth year of Guangxu, the Japanese army attacked the Russian fleet in Lushun, and the two countries declared war. Japan won and Russia was defeated. In addition to ceding the southern half of Sakhalin Island to Japan, the treaty also stipulated that Russia would transfer its rights and interests in Manchuria to Japan. China could not resist, so it concluded the Sino-Japanese Agreement on Manchuria in the thirty-first year of Guangxu. In addition to acknowledging that Russia had ceded all its rights and interests in Manchuria to Japan, it opened up many new trading ports. The Anfeng Railway was allowed to be continuously operated by the Japanese government. Japanese concessions were designated in Yingkou and Andong. Japan further demanded seventeen articles from China, including "China shall not build a railway parallel to the South Manchurian Railway," which we rejected. Japan even included it in the meeting minutes, later falsely claiming that it was a secret agreement.

As for Korea, in the second year of Xuantong, Resident-General Terauchi Masatake first seized its police power, replacing them with Japanese military police, and moved the Korean king to Tokyo. A Korean Governor-General's Office was established to govern, and Korea perished.

Extortion of Yuan Shikai

On April 8th of the second year of the Republic of China, the Chinese formal parliament was established, and various countries recognized it one after another. Japan even used tax reductions for Manchuria and Korea and the construction of five railway lines in Manchuria and Mongolia as exchange conditions, and Yuan Shikai recognized it before being formally elected president. Whenever the Japanese had an opportunity to take advantage of, they would not hesitate to use all kinds of means to extort and coerce, and their despicable shamelessness is evident in this.

The "Twenty-One Demands"

In the third year of the Republic of China, the First World War broke out. Japan tried to prevent China from participating in the war, while it joined the Allied Powers itself. On August 23rd, under the pretext of declaring war on Germany, it sent troops to occupy Qingdao and the Jiaoji Railway, with the aim of not only inheriting Germany's rights in Shandong, but also occupying the entire Shandong Province. On January 7th of the fourth year of the Republic of China, the Yuan government requested Japan to withdraw its troops. Japan, on the 18th of the same month, directly presented twenty-one unreasonable demands to Yuan Shikai through the envoy Hioki Eki. They were divided into five groups: (1) to inherit and expand Germany's special rights in Shandong; (2) to expand military, political, and economic special rights and "land ownership rights" (later changed to commercial lease rights) in Southern Manchuria and Inner Mongolia; (3) to monopolize the Hanyeping Company; (4) China shall not lease coastal islands to other countries; (5) to hire Japanese as military, political, and financial advisors throughout the country, to jointly operate Sino-Japanese police forces, to connect the railways of Wuchang, Jiujiang, Nanchang, Hangzhou, and Chaozhou, and to have Japan build roads and mines in Fujian. Japan's ambition to annex China was exposed without reservation.

Japan presented the "Twenty-One Demands" to China, fearing intervention by other countries, and warned China to keep it strictly confidential. On the one hand, it tempted Yuan Shikai. On May 7th, Japan issued an ultimatum, giving Yuan Shikai forty-eight hours to reply. Yuan Shikai had no choice but to sign the "Shandong Treaty" and the "Manchuria-Mongolia Treaty" on May 9th. Except for the fourth group, which was announced by order, and the joint police operation in the fifth group, which Japan automatically withdrew, the others were agreed to by note. This is the "May Ninth National Humiliation," which the whole country resented.

Creating Internal Disorder in China

After Yuan Shikai's death, China's political forces formed two factions, the North and the South. The Japanese took the opportunity to win over and coerce politicians in the North, resulting in a situation of division between the North and the South in the sixth year of the Republic of China. The conflict lasted for two years and caused disasters in eight provinces. At that time, the Terauchi cabinet in Japan was in power. It provided financial support to the Northern warlords with the aim of prolonging the internal disorder in China. In total, from the sixth to the seventh year of the Republic of China, Japan lent nearly 500 million yuan to the Northern warlords, mostly through the hands of Japanese rogue Nishihara Kamezo, which was called the "Nishihara Loans." The warlords were able to engage in long-term civil war because of this. In the seventh year of the Republic of China, the European war ended, and both sides declared a truce. In February of the eighth year, peace talks were held in Shanghai. However, due to the behind-the-scenes manipulation by the Japanese, no results were achieved.

The Japanese were cunning and deceitful. In September of the seventh year of the Republic of China, they lured the Northern government into establishing the "Sino-Japanese Joint Military Agreement for Preventing Enemies." On February 5th of the eighth year, they continued to sign the so-called "Sino-Japanese Military Agreement Extension Treaty." In addition, there were other secret agreements that were not published, with the aim of creating long-term internal strife in China, undermining our national strength, in order to gradually realize their policy of encroachment and annexation.

The Stirring of the Paris Peace Conference

In the seventh year of the Republic of China, the European war ended. In January of the eighth year of the Republic of China, the Allied Powers convened a peace conference in Paris. China was one of the participating countries, so it was able to send representatives to attend. At that time, it was believed that the "Paris Peace Conference" was the biggest turning point in international relations. The Chinese government and the public had deep expectations for the peace conference, hoping to remove all unequal shackles in one fell swoop. Unexpectedly, Japan had already made secret agreements with various countries. Our representatives put forward the request to recover Qingdao and Germany's special rights and interests in Shandong. The Japanese representatives resolutely opposed it and insisted that the treaty of peace with Germany should clearly stipulate that all German rights in Shandong be unconditionally transferred to Japan. At the same time, they protested to the Beijing government, interfering with the speeches of our representatives at the peace conference. As a result, the Treaty of Versailles finally included a clause that transferred Germany's rights and interests in Shandong to Japan. Our representatives applied for reservation, but were rejected. When the news reached our country, it aroused widespread indignation among the people, resulting in the "May Fourth Movement" launched by the student circles in Peiping.

The Principles of the Washington Conference

In July of the tenth year of the Republic of China, the United States initiated the convening of the Pacific International Conference, which opened in Washington in November. Participants included England, the United States, China, France, Japan, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal. The themes discussed at the conference were one, limiting armaments, and two, the Far East issue—that is, the outstanding issues between China and Japan. American representative Elihu Root put forward four principles as the basis for solving the China issue, which were passed by the conference. The four principles were: (1) to respect the sovereignty and independence of China and the integrity of its territory and administration; (2) to give China a completely unimpeded opportunity to develop and maintain a strong and consolidated government; (3) to establish and maintain the principle of equal opportunity for all countries in China's business and industry; (4) not to take advantage of China's current situation to seek special rights that reduce the rights of the people of friendly countries, and not to reward actions that are detrimental to the safety of friendly countries.

As a result of the conference, Japan opposed both the two points of our country's tariff autonomy and the abolition of spheres of influence. The former proposed an alternative compromise, while the latter was shelved.

Our representative at the meeting had proposed two proposals to Japan, namely: to return the rights and interests in Shandong and to abolish the Sino-Japanese Treaty of the Twenty-One Demands. The Japanese representative initially refused to discuss it, but later, due to pressure from the United States and international pressure, he had to make some concessions. German industries in Shandong were returned to our country within six months, and Japanese troops and police in Shandong Province were also withdrawn within a time limit. In short, although the "Washington Conference" did not fully meet our country's expectations, it was like a head-on blow to the ambitious Japan.

The Occurrence of the May 30th Massacre

The Japanese had many yarn factories in Shanghai, and they treated the Chinese workers they employed very harshly. Unfair incidents were often heard. In May of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, workers elected representatives to petition the Japanese factory owners, demanding improved treatment. The Japanese factory manager suddenly opened fire and killed the worker Gu Zhenghong, and wounded several other representatives. The injured workers were instead detained by the Public Concession of the Shanghai Municipal Council, which aroused public outrage among the students. On May 30th, they launched a public memorial for Gu Zhenghong and gave demonstration speeches in the Public Concession. Western police interfered, arresting the speakers. Crowds followed to the front of the police station. Western police suddenly opened fire on the crowd, causing many deaths and injuries, resulting in a major tragedy. Tracing the root cause, the Japanese were the real culprits.

The Evolution of the Jinan Massacre

In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, our National Revolutionary Army made smooth progress in the Northern Expedition, defeating the Zhilu Army, and occupied Jinan at the end of April. On May 1st and 2nd, the central government agencies arrived one after another. On the morning of the 3rd, because a Japanese person had a dispute with a Chinese soldier, a large group of Japanese soldiers suddenly fired on the Chinese barracks. Then, all the Japanese troops in Jinan were dispatched to attack our Revolutionary Army, resulting in the entire city being occupied. Many of our soldiers and civilians were massacred, and the death of Cai Gongshi, the special envoy of Shandong, was the most tragic. The Japanese were brutal and murdered diplomats, completely disregarding international law.

The main reason why the Japanese army created the "Jinan Massacre" at that time was to obstruct the unification of the National Revolution, and still wanted to maintain the remnants of the Northern warlords, creating a situation of disintegration in China, in order to divide and rule from it. However, our Revolutionary Army endured humiliation and carried heavy burdens, changed its marching route, and continued the Northern Expedition.

After the "September 18th Incident"

On September 18th of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the Japanese army suddenly attacked Shenyang with a large army. On the 20th, they pressed on to Jilin, pointing north to Heilongjiang and south to Jinzhou. Only in November did they encounter resistance from Ma Zhanshan and his troops at the Nenjiang Bridge. By the end of December, they had occupied all the important places in the three northeastern provinces.

After the Northeast was lost, our government appealed to the "League of Nations." Japan advocated direct negotiations. The "League of Nations" twice advised Japan to withdraw its troops without result. On December 10th, the "League of Nations" established an investigation team, headed by Lord Lytton of the United Kingdom. On January 28th of the twenty-first year, the Japanese army stationed in Shanghai attacked our 19th Route Army at night. The 19th Route Army and the 5th Army fought bravely, capturing many prisoners. The Japanese army reinforced three times, until March 1st, when they landed in Liuhe. Our army retreated to Nanxiang, but the bravery of our army and the enthusiasm of the people had gained even greater appreciation internationally.

In early March, the Japanese Doihara Kenji lured Puyi to Changchun and established "Manchukuo." At this time, the Lytton Investigation Team had just arrived in our country and immediately went north to investigate. On May 5th, with the mediation of England, France, and the United States, the "Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement" was established, one of which stated that "the Chinese army will remain stationed at its current location." At the end of September, the Lytton Report was sent to the League of Nations and announced on October 2nd. It recognized that the Japanese military action was unreasonable and suggested the establishment of a "special organization" to govern the Northeast, to replace the "Manchukuo" created by Japanese force. In February of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, the League of Nations General Assembly announced a resolution: Japan would withdraw its troops, establish a system of autonomy in the three northeastern provinces, and a committee would be organized by the General Assembly to assist China and Japan in resolving outstanding issues. Japan brazenly rejected this, and in March of the same year, announced its withdrawal from the "League of Nations," no longer bound by it.

The "League of Nations" had no way to deal with it. The Japanese army advanced into Guannei (China proper). Yuguan was lost and Chengde fell. On May 21st, Tongzhou fell, and Peiping and Tianjin were in danger. Our government, despairing of foreign aid, decided that it was not the time for a decisive battle, so on May 31st, the "Tanggu Truce" was signed. There were no provisions for the puppet state of Manchukuo, but the areas in eastern Hebei were nominal at best. Japan had gained a base for attacking Hebei.

The Unfolding of the Full-Scale War of Resistance

In the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Japan's aggression against our country did not slacken in the slightest. In addition to military aspects, continuing to advance on Suiyuan, in economic terms, it carried out armed smuggling in North China. On one hand, it funded secret agent activities, and at the same time launched a diplomatic offensive, sending Kawagoe Shigeru to China for negotiations. In January of that year, Hirota Koki announced the so-called "Three Principles," demanding autonomy for five provinces, Sino-Japanese navigation, correction of tax rates, and the employment of Japanese advisors, which was tantamount to placing our country's administration, economy, and commerce under its control. Negotiations yielded no results. In the summer of the same year, the Liangguang Incident occurred, and in December, the Xi'an Incident occurred. As a result, it promoted political unity in China, and the Chinese economy tended to stabilize due to the implementation of the fiat currency policy. In the twenty-sixth year, Kodama Kenji led an economic investigation team to China to conduct cooperation, which failed due to our failure. Economic cooperation in North China was also not resolved. At the same time, Japan's eagerness to plot against us was revealed in many special activities. On July 1st, the plot of Chinese traitors to riot in Peiping and Tianjin was arrested. Then, Japan became angry and on July 7th, launched a challenge at the Marco Polo Bridge. On August 13th, it sent troops to cause trouble in Shanghai, and a full-scale war of resistance was launched. Lasting for eight years, relying on close cooperation with our allies, the firm will of the military and civilians of the whole country, finally Japan succumbed and begged to surrender, and won the final victory, washing away the century of shame and humiliation.

### Stepping into Tokyo, the Capital of the Defeated Nation: A First Visit Report One Year After the Surrender

— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in Japan, Chuan Junyi

A year has passed in a flash since Japan's defeat. Japan formally surrendered to the United Nations on August 15th of last year, with Emperor Hirohito issuing an imperial rescript, and signed the instrument of surrender on the USS Missouri on September 3rd. I, the reporter, went abroad to Japan on the day after the first anniversary of the Emperor's issuance of the rescript.

On August 16th, at 7:30 AM, I, the reporter, departed from the Shanghai office of the Free China Delegation to Japan by car. After an hour and a half's drive, we arrived at Dajie, the base of the Air Force's 8th Group. Besides Group Leader Wu of the delegation, there were four other members traveling to Japan this time. After arriving at the airfield, each person underwent a thorough inquiry, and at 9:30 AM, we boarded the plane and took off. The pilot was Major Xing Yanfei, with co-pilot Feng Ruzhen, navigator Gu Weizheng, mechanic Gao Pengfei, and communicator Huang Bangjie also participating in the flight.

After flying over the ocean for three hours, we saw land and entered Japanese territory. Navigator Gu Weizheng, in order to allow us to pay our respects to the traces of the atomic bomb left in Hiroshima, specially altered the route, flying in a roundabout way and circling Hiroshima for a week. What we saw over Hiroshima was truly a scorched earth, the ground appearing yellowish-brown.

After the plane passed Mount Fuji, we arrived at Atsugi Airfield in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, around 4:00 PM. This airfield was completely beyond my expectations, not as clean or grand as the Chapo Airfield in Assam Province, India, which was built during the War of Resistance. The ground was paved entirely with steel plates. According to the Air Force personnel traveling with me, this type of construction was a temporary structure from a period of military occupation. After landing, Major Qian, sent by the delegation, took care of us, but we still had to complete entry procedures with the American personnel, such as getting vaccinations and smallpox inoculations. It wasn't until around 5:00 PM that we boarded a military vehicle and drove out of the airfield, beginning to experience the scenery of the Japanese countryside.

Near the airfield, there were no signs of the war. It wasn't until our car entered the city of Yokohama that we began to understand the scars left on the Japanese people by the war. Yokohama, before the war, was the gateway to Tokyo, a port for trade with foreign countries. But the Yokohama streets now, apart from the broken tiles and simple wooden houses built as temporary dwellings, had almost no tall buildings and no large stores could be seen. The Kawasaki industrial area had been completely destroyed.

After crossing the Tama River Bridge and entering Tokyo, we saw some houses that had survived from before the war. However, the streets of Tokyo had completely changed compared to ten years ago, being uneven and filthy. Every place was very unfamiliar to me; I almost forgot that I was driving in Tokyo. It wasn't until our car drove into the Chinese Delegation in Hiroo-cho, Azabu Ward, that I realized this was the Tokyo after the war, and I realized how great the changes the war had brought to the Japanese people were.

(1) Night Shops in Ginza

Before the war, Ginza was like Nanjing Road in Shanghai, the most lively and prosperous street. Before the war, in addition to all kinds of formal shops, every night there were all kinds of merchants lining the streets, setting up stalls to sell various items. But after the war, Ginza was very desolate. Several large department stores such as Matsuzakaya and Mitsukoshi had been bombed. The only remaining large building was the Hattori Clock Shop (watch store), but it had been converted into an American military consumer cooperative. The Western-style buildings along the street had all disappeared, replaced by small wooden shops. It was like Chongqing's Douyu Street after the "May Fourth" bombing, plus the street vendors along the road during the day, and that was the Ginza market after the war.

On these stalls, occasionally you could see American glass combs for sale, but not as rampant as the scalper market in Shanghai. This street was silent at night, with few pedestrians, only some soldiers chasing after "divine women" and the patrols of MP jeeps. The only relatively clean places were "Marunouchi" and in front of the Imperial Palace, almost none of which was within the sphere of influence of the Allied forces. Well-equipped, solidly built high-rise buildings had been requisitioned by the Allied forces.

Currently, three large-scale department stores—Takashimaya, Shirokiya, and Mitsukoshi—still remain and continue to operate in the Nihonbashi area. But they are far less luxuriously decorated than Sincere and Wing On in Shanghai. You can't find any imported goods. The items for sale are mostly crudely made, lacking the characteristics of the Japanese people before the war—small and exquisite. But the prices are twelve times higher than before the war, and the black market prices are more than a thousand times higher. A pair of leather shoes costs around 800 yuan on the black market, equivalent to 50-60 US dollars.

(3) Housing Shortage Too

Due to the damage from air raids during the war, and the influx of a large number of Allied forces (called "stationing forces" by the Japanese) after the war, the housing shortage is very serious. There are also situations similar to the payment of "transfer fees" in Shanghai. In the newspapers, you can see small advertisements offering "transfer fees" (called "right money" by the Japanese) to find housing. It is estimated that Japan currently lacks 4.2 million houses, plus the approximately 200,000 houses destroyed by wind, rain, and floods each year. If 600,000 houses are built each year, it will take ten years to complete. However, the government's current plan is to build only 200,000 houses each year, which is only enough to compensate for the natural rate of housing damage. Moreover, Japan lacks timber and must import it from abroad, but there is currently no hope of importing timber from abroad.

(4) Food Crisis

After the Japanese surrender, some people predicted that a million people would starve to death within a year. Although the cabinet has been changed three times, they all feel helpless about the food problem. In June, there were more than twenty days when rice was not distributed in Tokyo and Yokohama. On May 19th, a crowd of 200,000 people held a demonstration march "demanding rice," carrying red flags and marching towards the Prime Minister's residence and the Imperial Palace. In view of this, the Allied forces specially imported food and distributed it to the Japanese people, a total of five times. The first time was on May 20th, for 5.2 days' worth; the second time was on June 11th, for 5.9 days' worth; the third time was on June 22nd, for 13.4 days' worth; the fourth time was on July 2nd, for 10 days' worth; and the fifth time was on July 13th, for 7.5 days' worth of flour and 6.2 days' worth of canned goods. From the first time on May 20th to the fifth time on July 27th, for a period of 69 days, 70% of the food was distributed by the Allied forces. In August, the Allied forces imported a large amount of rice and distributed it to the Japanese people. The estimated rice harvest this year is 55 million shi, 16 million shi more than last year's actual harvest of 39 million shi. This is because the Japanese people have benefited particularly from favorable weather this year, but there is still a shortage of fertilizer, so the Japanese people are truly relying on the heavens for their food.

(5) The Flood of New Yen

After the Japanese government surrendered, in order to curb the expansion of the yen, it announced the "Financial Emergency Measures Order" in February, and the Bank of Japan issued a new type of banknote called the "New Yen," ordering the Japanese people to exchange the old "Yen" for the new "Yen." However, this measure has not been effective. In early May, the issuance of the New Yen broke through 30 billion, and by August 1st, it had broken through 50 billion yen. If this situation continues, by the end of this year, it will not be far from the currency inflation situation in China and Hungary.

(6) Extremely Serious Unemployment

After Japan surrendered, all industrial activities came to a standstill, and labor power naturally could not be digested. In economic terms, the reconstruction of industry depends heavily on labor power, but the current situation in Japan is that the digestion of labor power depends on the recovery of industry. According to Mr. Kawai Atsushi, there are an estimated 2.5 million unemployed people in general. If you add black market merchants, other latent unemployed people, and Japanese people repatriated from abroad, the total number of unemployed people will reach 5 million. In the second half of this year, after the Japanese government stops subsidizing industries related to military demand, various industries will have to reorganize, and after the reparations issue is resolved, some industrial equipment will have to be withdrawn from Japan, so 100,000 people will have to become a reserve army of industry—the unemployed. These days, the workers of the state-run railway are brewing over the issue of layoffs, which shows the seriousness of the unemployment problem in general.
