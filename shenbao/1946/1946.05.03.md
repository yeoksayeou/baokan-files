### Chairman Chiang Arrives in Hankou from Xi'an, Immediately Summons Key Party, Government, and Military Leaders for Detailed Inquiries into the Local Situation

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 2nd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Hankou by plane from Xi'an at 5:20 PM on the 2nd. Local party, government, and military leaders such as Cheng Qian and Guo Chan, along with representatives from various circles, stood waiting at the airport amidst the light rain. The raindrops on their clothes further highlighted the sincerity of the Wuhan compatriots in their respect for the head of state. After disembarking, the Chairman nodded to the welcoming party, and then immediately drove to his official residence. Along Jianghan Road, citizens lined the streets to welcome him, applauding and paying their respects. The grand occasion was unprecedented since the restoration of sovereignty.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 2nd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Hankou at 6:05 PM on the 2nd aboard the special "Meiling" plane from Xi'an. Cheng Qian, He Chengjun, Sun Weiruo, Wan Yaohuang, Guo Chan, Fang Juehui, and over 300 others were at the airport to greet him. Chennault also arrived in Hankou on the afternoon of the 2nd to participate in the welcome. After news of the head of state's imminent arrival spread among the millions of citizens at noon, they stood along the streets, eager to catch a glimpse of the head of state they had been separated from for eight years. When Chairman Chiang and his wife passed through the city by car, cheers erupted along the road, the enthusiastic situation being unprecedented in Wuhan.

[Another Dispatch] Upon arriving in Hankou, Chairman Chiang, after a brief rest, immediately summoned Wang Renzeng (Cheng Qian), Deputy Directors Sun Weiruo and Guo Chan of the Wuhan Headquarters, Speaker of the Hubei Provincial Assembly He Chengjun, Hubei Provincial Chairman Wan Yaohuang, Chairman of the Provincial Party Headquarters Fang Juehui, Mayor of Hankou Xu Huizhi, Chairman of the City Party Headquarters Yuan Yong, Central Committee Member He Jian, Lu Dangping, and others to his residence.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] According to Director Chen Xizeng of the National Government's General Affairs Office, the National Government has not yet received any news regarding Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing. According to news from Xi'an, Chairman Chiang's departure for Nanjing will definitely be within four days, but people in Nanjing are hoping that the Chairman can come to Nanjing on the 3rd.

### Zhou Enlai Visits Xu Yongchang to Discuss the Military Situation in Central China, Talks for Two Hours to Prevent Escalation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Chongqing Dispatch: Zhou Enlai, upon receiving a telegram from Yan'an, is paying close attention to the development of the Zhongyuan (Central Plains) incident. Therefore, he postponed his trip to Nanjing on the 2nd. Zhou visited government representative Xu Yongchang last night at 8:00 PM to probe the government's attitude towards the movements of the Communist forces in the Central Plains. At that time, Xu immediately asked Zhou to telegram Wang Zhen, commander of the Communist Central Plains Military Region, to remain in place and not to act rashly to avoid escalating the situation and causing further suffering to the people. He also promised to immediately telegraph the Xi'an Headquarters for instructions. It is noted that two months ago, the Communist Central Plains Army, through the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Commission, convened a ceasefire agreement in Hankou, inviting the national army representative General Guo Chan and the communist small Central Plains Army Commander Wang Zhen. The Wuhan Headquarters advanced 10 million yuan to the Central Plains Communist Army to purchase food to avoid disturbing the people. After receiving the funds, the Communist Army did not purchase food and continued to forcibly requisition it from the people, and constantly used the excuse of food shortages to move to Wuhe, constantly making disturbances. The sudden outbreak of war this time is also due to this. According to a certain important official who flew from Hankou to Nanjing yesterday, the Central Plains Communist Army is now eager to move towards the railway lines. Their intention is to coordinate with the activities of the Communist Army in the Hebei-Henan border area, because the main force of the Communist Army originally stationed in the Hebei-Henan border area had already left customs in succession a month ago to increase the armed forces of the Northeast Communist Army.

[United Press, Chongqing, 2nd] Zhou Enlai met with General Xu Yongchang last night at 10:00 PM and held an important meeting that lasted two hours, and suggested that an American observer should inspect Xuanhuaidian. General Xu Yongchang agreed to forward this suggestion to Chairman Chiang. Zhou Enlai telegraphed General Marshall the results of his conversation with Xu Yongchang and asked him to find a way to prevent the situation from deteriorating further. Marshall had dispatched a special plane to pick up Zhou Enlai to Beijing, but was unable to land in Chongqing due to poor weather. Xu Yongchang and other important personnel will go to Beijing on the 3rd. After Xu Yongchang arrives in Beijing, it is expected that the Military Three-Man Team will be established soon.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] According to a certain important official who recently arrived in Beijing, small-scale conflicts have occurred frequently in the coastal areas of northern Jiangsu and along the canal in the past month. The reason is the communist army's ambush. If the communist army's actions do not affect the security of Tongyang, a large-scale war should be avoided. It is heard that the military defenses in Nantong, Yangzhou, Jingjiang, and Taixian are still in need of strengthening. As for the details of the conflict in central Hubei, Beijing has not yet received a report, but the Wuhan Headquarters and the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters have telegraphed Beijing. They are convinced that the war in that area will not escalate, because the government has never authorized any national army troops to attack the communist army. The so-called "general offensive" ordered by the national army is either for other purposes or a dream.

### Zhang Qun, Acting Director of the Chongqing Headquarters, Sworn Into Office

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The Chongqing Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission was officially established in Chongqing on May 1st. Zhang Qun, also the acting director, held a swearing-in ceremony at the auditorium of the Military Affairs Commission at 4:10 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. Chairman Chiang specially appointed Xu Yongchang, Minister of Military Orders, to represent him in awarding the seal and administering the oath. Additionally, it is reported that Xiao Yisu is the Chief of Staff of the Chongqing Headquarters, and Liu Shoupeng is the Secretary-General.

### Wang Dongyuan Inspects Disaster Situation

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 1st] Chairman Wang Dongyuan is scheduled to go to southern Hunan on the 2nd to inspect the disaster situation. Deputy Director Yao Xuehuai and Chief Liu Xuru will accompany him.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Li Rui, Director of the Hunan Finance Department, flew to Hankou on the morning of the 2nd and then transferred to Hunan to take office.

### Suggestions for Resolving the Northeast Problem are Being Considered by the Government and the CCP; Shao Lizi and Lu Dingyi Have Also Met for Discussions

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 2nd] Marshall's suggestions, presented in the form of a memorandum, for resolving the Northeast problem are currently being considered by the government and the CCP. Marshall seems to want to give both sides ample time for careful consideration of this major issue. It is heard that Marshall has expressed to social dignitaries of the third party that he deeply hopes that the government and the CCP can directly discuss an outline of this issue, and then the three-person meeting will make a formal decision, but before Marshal left Chongqing, the three-person meeting of Xu Yongchang, Zhou Enlai, and Marshall has not yet been held. According to sources concerned, Marshall's suggestion focuses on stopping the conflict. On military issues, he advocates that military mobilization and troop reorganization should be decided by the three-person meeting. The political suggestions are all "original principles" and not specific.

[United Press, Chongqing, 2nd] Since the consultation of the Political Consultative Conference's Comprehensive Group has been stalled, the overall situation in the Northeast has become increasingly tense. Government representative Shao Lizi again held consultations with Lu Dingyi at 10:00 PM last night. Zhou Enlai did not attend. The two sides proposed three suggestions: (1) The ceasefire order should take effect immediately, (2) The Dongshan Political Committee should be reorganized, (3) The Communist Party should withdraw from Changchun, but neither side should station troops there. The suggestion of not stationing troops in Changchun was not approved by the government.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd] According to reliable news from Shenyang, Niu Xianming, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Military Mediation Department on the government side in Shenyang, proposed that the Military Mediation Department send a team to Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, and Suizhong. The US has expressed its agreement to this, but it has not yet been agreed upon due to the CCP's opposition. It is rumored that the government's representatives on the Northeast team sent by the Military Mediation Department will be changed. Colonel Cai Zonglian may serve as the leader of the government side. Given the current situation, it is necessary to wait for the Military Three-Man Team to negotiate a comprehensive solution to the Northeast issue before a decision can be made. Deputy Chief of Staff Niu has unfinished work in Shenyang and will not be able to return to Beiping in the short term. [United Press, Beiping, 2nd] According to news from Shenyang today, Yang Chuoan, the mayor of Harbin, has arrived in Vladivostok and is currently returning to the country via Japan.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd] The transportation authorities officially took over the Yamato Hotel yesterday and renamed it the Shenyang Railway Hotel. The Yamato Hotel is a magnificent building that belonged to the old South Manchuria Railway and has a history of forty years.

### The Beijing Municipal Government Prepares Spacious Housing to Accommodate the CCP Delegation; Housing and Cars Valued at Approximately 200 Million Yuan

They are also preparing eleven Western-style houses with gardens and sanitary facilities at No. 30 of the same village to accommodate Zhou Enlai and his wife, Deng Yingchao. According to current market prices, the cost of the above two houses is estimated to be 114.6 million yuan, plus the cost of repairing and furnishing the furniture, as well as two cars required by the CCP representative Long Feihu, for a total value of approximately 200 million yuan. Additionally, the Youth Party has found housing at No. 24 of Jingfengtou Village, and the Democratic League's housing can be decided on the 3rd.

Finally, Chen said that I am a good friend of the Chinese people and am very willing to assist China in completing the revival, so this air transport organization will continue as much as needed in light of the actual situation.

### Important Officials of Various Agencies Remaining in Chongqing Will All Return to the Capital Before the End of the Month; Song Ziwen, Zhang Lisheng, and Others Arrived in Beijing Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] After the formal promulgation of the order to return to the capital, important officials of various central agencies remaining in Chongqing will all return to the capital before the end of May, so that the government's various tasks can be fully launched in Nanjing. The return of family members of officials of various central agencies remaining in Chongqing and the return of righteous people who have been displaced to the rear for eight years should also be actively launched. Therefore, transportation for returning to the capital and returning home in mid-May will inevitably be extremely crowded. To this end, the responsible authorities have formulated a transportation plan for May. In terms of water transportation, due to rising water levels, the Ship Allocation Committee has requested the Ministry of Transportation to quickly allocate more ships to Chongqing. It is estimated that at least 10,000 people should be transported by water in May. In terms of land transportation, approximately 20,000 people should be transported in May. In terms of air transportation, it is estimated that the number of people to be transported by China and Central Airlines should be over 7,000, and military transportation should be reduced as much as possible in May.

Seeing this, the driver retreated to Langfang and did not return until approximately 1:00 AM this morning when the Communist troops retreated. In order to ensure the safety of the line, the railway administration has suspended the express train operating from both locations at 8:00 PM tonight.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The Army's Anti-Traitor Authority has transferred all the documents of the 166 major and minor traitors apprehended to the Prosecutor's Office of the High Court. All the prisoners have been personally counted and received by Zhang Bin, the newly appointed warden of the Capital High Court Detention Center, and are detained in the detention center. The treatment of the traitors in the detention center is the same as that of ordinary prisoners.

### End of the First Phase of Army Reorganization; Training Proceeding as Planned; Bai Chongxi Discusses Army Reorganization in Various Locations

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 1st] Vice Chief of General Staff Bai Chongxi, when meeting with reporters in this city, answered several questions posed by the reporters. Details are recorded below.

(Question) Can you tell us about the mission of Mr. Bai on this trip? (Answer) This trip to Shaanxi is under orders to inspect the army reorganization and training situation, and to investigate military school education.

(Question) What is the situation of army reorganization and training in various locations that Mr. Bai has inspected this time? (Answer) This trip passed through Bengbu, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, and arrived in Xi'an. Military leaders in various locations have been able to follow the army reorganization procedures and proceed smoothly. By the end of April, the first phase of army reorganization work has been completed. Training work is also proceeding according to plan. All surplus officers and soldiers have been properly resettled, and it is ensured that their livelihood will not be a concern.

(Question) The militarization of families is a concern, and the government has explicitly ordered a nationwide army reorganization. The government army is currently being reorganized in phases. What is the situation with the reorganization of the Communist army? (Answer) I have not heard anything about it.

(Question) After the ceasefire agreement, the restoration of transportation is a matter of concern for all compatriots. When Mr. Bai arrived in Xuzhou, was the Longhai Railway able to reach Haizhou? (Answer) The Longhai Railway from Xuzhou to Zhengzhou has resumed operation. Although the section from Xuzhou to Haizhou has been repaired, formal operation has not yet been agreed to by the Communist army. This section is currently managed by the Communist army. (Question) Conflicts between the Kuomintang and the Communists are still heard from time to time in various parts of China. Can these conflicts be completely stopped in accordance with the ceasefire agreement soon? (Answer) Conflicts in various parts of China are all local, such as Nantong and Caolou, where the Communist army attacked us first. (Question) The Northeast problem has become more serious since the withdrawal of the Soviet army. How will the government handle this? (Answer) Regarding the Northeast problem, the government will carry out the takeover work in accordance with the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship after the Soviet army withdraws, in order to ensure the integrity of territorial sovereignty, so that the compatriots in the Northeast can live and work in peace. (Question) Can the military conflict in the Northeast be stopped in the short term? (Answer) The Northeast problem is currently being discussed by Marshal Marshall with representatives of the government and the Communist Party to find a solution.

(Question) The National Assembly has now been postponed. Will the postponement be longer, or can it be expected to be convened in the short term? (Answer) The founding outline of the nation was created by the Premier of our party, and the President is continuing its completion. The process is divided into three stages: military administration, tutelage, and constitutionalism. For more than thirty years, we have overthrown the Manchu Qing, completed the Northern Expedition, and won the eight-year war against the invaders. According to the founding program, the tutelage should be ended immediately, constitutionalism should be implemented, and power should be returned to the people. The National Assembly should be convened as soon as possible. This postponement was announced because the list of representatives from various parties had not been submitted in time. But I believe this postponement will not be too long. I hope that the list of representatives from various parties will be submitted as soon as possible, and the date of convening the National Assembly will be reset, and the fundamental law of the country will be formulated so that the country can embark on the path of the rule of law as soon as possible. Mr. Bai will stay in Shaanxi for three days, inspecting troops and military school students.

Measures for the Resettlement of Demobilized Officers and Soldiers

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Regarding the planning situation of the measures for the resettlement of demobilized officers and soldiers, a reporter recently interviewed Zhao Zhenyuan, who is in charge of the Government's Demobilized Officers and Soldiers Resettlement Planning Committee. The information is as follows:

(Question) What is the total number of demobilized officers and soldiers nationwide? (Answer) There are approximately 2.06 million demobilized officers and soldiers, including approximately 260,000 officers and approximately 1.8 million soldiers. They are demobilized in two phases. In the first phase, there are 100,000 demobilized officers. Together with the surplus officers from the army reorganization last year, there are now more than 200,000 officers who have been accepted for training by various headquarters (brigades), and approximately 1.2 million soldiers.

(Question) What are the resettlement measures for demobilized officers and soldiers? (Answer) The resettlement measures are generally divided into three categories: (1) Transfer to other occupations, (2) Further education, and (3) Retirement (limited to those who have reached the age limit and are too weak to serve). In the first phase of demobilized officers, it is planned to transfer 30,000 to other occupations as a group, 150,000 individually, 10,000 for further education, and 10,000 for retirement. In the first phase of demobilized soldiers, 1.2 million will be transferred to other occupations as a group to engage in construction and production, with the goal of transforming consumption into production. (Question) What is the situation of transferring to other occupations? (Answer) The departments and number of personnel allocated for officers to transfer to other occupations are divided into ten categories: (1) Police officers, 40,000; (2) Transportation management, 5,000; (3) Industrial and mining management, 1,000; (4) Agriculture, forestry, and land reclamation, 1,000; (5) Land administration, 1,000; (6) Local administration, 20,000; (7) Local health, 1,000; (8) Finance, 1,000; (9) Public education teachers, 40,000; (10) Labor service instructors, 40,000.

(Question) What is the situation of conducting vocational training? (Answer) The Demobilized Officers and Soldiers Resettlement Planning Committee has convened three committee meetings. Regarding the formulation of transfer plans, the review and compilation of expense budgets, the formulation of examination methods, and various other important matters, the committee has worked with relevant ministries and commissions to formulate a complete plan, and it was approved at the third committee meeting. A Committee for the Examination of Officers for Transfer has been established, and examination areas have been designated, including seven locations: Beijing, Ping, Xi'an, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Zhengzhou. The examination will be conducted uniformly. The examination committee members for each test area have been assigned and are expected to depart for each test area in early May. It is expected that all classes will begin training in June. In short, in addition to handling all retirements for demobilized officers and soldiers, we have also decided on various vocational training programs in order to seek a livelihood for demobilized officers and soldiers and to develop national production and construction, so as to create healthy cadres for national construction.

### Our Earnest Desire for Peace; Safety is the Top Priority; Guo Taiqi's Broadcast on Expectations for the Security Council

[US News Agency, New York, 1st] Dr. Guo Taiqi (see photo), Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations Security Council, recently made a radio broadcast to China, the gist of which is as follows: I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak with compatriots in China about the work of the United Nations Security Council. China has held the presidency of the Security Council for the past few months. Now that my term as president has come to an end, I am very happy to have this opportunity to report to you my personal hopes for the Security Council.

### Relying on Collective Peace to Safeguard National Security

As you all know, some of the issues submitted to the Security Council cannot be resolved immediately because the parties concerned cannot find a direct solution before submitting them to the Security Council. At the same time, the nature of these issues is sufficient to endanger international peace and security. In other words, the main task of the Security Council is to prevent any international situation or dispute from threatening the peace and security that we all want to maintain. Mankind's longing for peace and desire for security, and prevention of danger, did not begin after the end of the war. It was not until the end of the recent war that countries around the world realized that the prerequisite for world peace is to recognize the inseparability of peace and security. People have now realized that any divisible peace is a pseudo-peace and cannot last long. Mankind learned this lesson through painful experience. It is no wonder that today, regardless of the size of the country, all rely on collective peace to safeguard their security. The Security Council was established based on this kind of awareness and belief. From the meeting convened by the Preparatory Committee in London to today, the Committee of Experts has worked tirelessly to formulate and revise the rules of procedure. We sincerely hope that the work of this committee will be completed soon. At that time, the Security Council will have a more complete set of rules of procedure to follow when conducting discussions.

### How to Enhance Credibility is Our Current Problem

Our current problem is how to strengthen the power of the Security Council and enhance its credibility. What we need is not a debating parliament, nor a propaganda forum, but an institution with the prestige and power necessary to safeguard world peace and security. As you all know, under the Security Council, there is a Military Staff Committee of the five major powers. This committee is also meeting in New York. The Chinese representative is General Shang Zhen, Chief of Staff of the National Government. The Chinese delegation includes our army commander Lieutenant General Sun Liren, Air Force Major General Mao Bangchu, and no less than 20 experts from our army, navy, and air force. The meetings of the Military Staff Committee are not open to the public and are purely for discussing concrete military issues. China is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. Our impression of the permanent membership of the Security Council is that this permanent membership is not a privilege, but a special responsibility.

### World Peace and Security Depends on Cooperation of the Five Powers

Today, world peace and security depends on the cooperation of the five major powers. We will have no peace and security if the five powers cannot unite. If the five powers cannot unite, the Security Council will lose its effectiveness. Finally, I would like to say a few words to explain China's attitude and policy towards the Security Council. We, the Chinese people, firmly believe that the original friends contained in the Charter coincide with the principles of national construction of our Republic. For this reason, when we participate in any discussion of the Council, we are guided by the spirit of the Charter. China has fought against aggression for thirteen years. Our desire for peace is stronger than that of any other country. At the same time, our national defense strength is not yet sufficient. Although our national borders and coastline are among the longest in the world, we lack sufficient naval, land, and air defense forces. Safety is our top priority. It is because our desire for national security coincides with the desire of other countries in the world for international security that we place the most ardent hope on the Security Council. At the same time, we are determined to cooperate fully to promote the increasing power and prestige of the Security Council.

### Students of Anhui College Demand Merger with Anhui University

[Central News Agency, Hefei, 1st] More than 1,000 students from Anhui College gathered and marched in the rain to the Provincial Government to petition. They expressed their opposition to the four resolutions of the Preparatory Meeting of National Anhui University and demanded: (1) National Anhui University should be based on Anhui College; (2) Reclaim the former site of Anhui University, as well as books and instruments; (3) Move to Anqing immediately. Chairman Li Pinxian and Director Wang Shaolun met with them separately. Regarding the first demand above, they stated that a decision would have to be made by the Ministry of Education. Regarding the second demand, they said that they had already started to handle it. Regarding the third demand, they said that they could consider proceeding with it. The petitioning students, except for more than ten representatives who remained, have all returned to school to attend classes. It is said that these ten or so representatives are also planning to go to Nanjing to petition the Ministry of Education again.

### The Grain Shortage in Guangzhou is Becoming More Serious; Rice Prices Soar, Breaking the 90,000 Yuan Mark

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 2nd] The food problem here is becoming increasingly serious, and more and more poor people are starving to death. Rice prices have risen even more sharply in the past two days, rising by more than 10,000 yuan per dan in one day. The current price of top-quality rice has broken the 90,000 yuan mark, and one hundred yuan can only buy a little more than one ounce. The authorities have convened emergency meetings for days to discuss solutions to this problem. Chairman Luo telegraphed the central government yesterday, requesting 2 billion yuan to handle emergency grain loans and relieve the province's grain shortage. In addition, the Relief Committee started distributing relief yesterday. Overseas Chinese in Siam donated 500 tons of rice, which is being distributed at various police stations every day, with each person receiving 18 jin of rice upon presentation of a ticket. However, the distribution of these rice tickets is too strict. Some families with several members only receive one ticket, or two families receive one ticket together, failing to achieve universal relief.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] The Military Commission, in view of the fact that the regulations on personnel in the army, navy, and air force only specify the age limit for service but do not have regulations on the age limit for active duty, resulting in a lack of flexibility in the retirement and deployment of military officers, has specially stipulated the age limit for active duty of military officers as follows: (1) First-Class Generals, 62 years old; (2) Second-Class Generals (with the rank of General), 60 years old; (3) Lieutenant Generals, 56 years old; (4) Major Generals, 50 years old; (5) Colonels, 46 years old; (6) Lieutenant Colonels, 44 years old; (7) Majors, 42 years old; (8) Captains, 40 years old; (9) Lieutenants, 38 years old; (10) Second Lieutenants, 36 years old; (11) Warrant Officers, 34 years old.

### Implementation of the Savage Plan; Contract Signed with US Company; Yangtze River Three Gorges Project to Begin Soon

[Central News Agency, This City] The Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan has recently signed a contract with the American Morrison-Knudsen Company to implement the Savage Plan for the Yangtze River Three Gorges Project. It is reported that the company will send engineers to China soon to conduct dam foundation drilling. In the future, it is planned to build a large-scale dam near Yichang. Its main functions are: (1) To prevent the dangers of the Three Gorges shoals, so that large ships from Shanghai and Chongqing can navigate directly; (2) To use the Yangtze River hydropower to generate electricity to meet industrial needs; (3) To irrigate farmland and promote water conservancy.

### Tanggu Seaport Project; Suggestions for Early Completion

[Central News Agency, This City] Du De, Chief Engineer of the Port Group of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, and his party inspected the Tanggu Seaport and have completed their work and returned to Shanghai. They have also prepared a report suggesting to Group Leader Hou that the port construction plan be completed as soon as possible to meet the development needs of North China. The report stated: Tanggu Seaport was started in 1941 during the Japanese occupation period. Before the Japanese surrender, the important parts had not yet been completed. According to the original Japanese plan, it was planned to build breakwaters on both sides of the deep-water channel at the port entrance, extending approximately 7.5 miles into the sea, to protect the deep-water channel and allow large ships with a draft of 25 feet to enter and exit freely. After the port is built, the economic value, according to the Japanese estimates, is that it can initially absorb 2 million tons of imported goods per year. If the docks and loading and unloading equipment are improved, the imported goods can be doubled again. The ultimate goal is to improve the port to a capacity of 8 million tons of imported goods. At present, if we re-plan to build the port, we dare not have this extravagant hope before it is fully and satisfactorily completed. We were sent to inspect this time, and we deeply feel that it is necessary to actively build the port. The port is located in the prosperous area of the southeast, guarding the gateway to Peiping and Tianjin, and is located in an important location. The coal deposits in Shanxi and Hebei provinces can all be exported from here in the future, and the cost of building the port is far less than the huge losses encountered by seagoing vessels bypassing the Dagukou sandbar before the war. According to the current situation, the total cost of building the port is about US$23.5 million, and it can be completed in three years. During the construction period, seagoing vessels can still enter and exit freely, and transportation will not be interrupted. In addition, Chief Engineer Du De hopes that this project can be contracted to the American Morrison-Knudsen Company, and construction can be planned and started in the short term.

Editorial

### A Third Party Must Not Be Confused!

The "Political Consultative Conference," being termed a "consultation," must involve several parties, at least two. Since the consultation has already yielded results, all parties participating in the consultation should exert utmost sincerity to implement them. If everyone could genuinely implement the "Political Consultative Conference" agreements, the ceasefire orders, and the military reorganization and unification plans, why would there be conflicts in the Northeast? Why would there be the Battle of Changchun? And why would there be the "expansion of conflicts in the Central Plains" as mentioned by Mr. Zhou Enlai? The crux of the matter is that one or both sides have failed to implement these agreed-upon measures. Therefore, those who advocate fairness and seek mediation must carefully investigate which side, and which individuals, are failing to implement them. Only by clarifying this point can one judge right from wrong and determine which side is undermining peace. This is common sense. As the saying goes, "The bystander sees the clearest." We common people are originally the masters of the country, and although now relegated to being bystanders as a third party, we must be clear-minded observers and must not regard ourselves as confused third parties.

However, ever since the Communist forces besieged Changchun, up to occupying Changchun, seizing Harbin, destroying the Beining Railway, and obstructing the smooth operation of traffic on the Ping-Shen Line, we have only heard some people calling for mediation and others shouting for everyone to stop fighting. Yet, despite everyone knowing who is provoking and who started the fighting, no one has directly pointed it out. This is why the Chinese Communist Party has been able to wantonly rebel. Since its establishment, the Executive Headquarters for Mediation has relied on the hard work of Allied soldiers, but has never effectively stopped the CCP's actions that violate the ceasefire agreement; this has only made the CCP more arrogant and reckless. In short, the more the third party acts deaf and dumb and plays the fool, the more unscrupulous the CCP becomes in violating agreements.

Now we should wake up! On the eve of his departure from Chongqing, Special Envoy Marshall, who is tasked with mediation, offered the following advice to the CCP: "At this time, the Communist forces in Changchun should first withdraw and hand over the defense to the Central Army, and then discuss other issues." This is extremely simple, extremely straightforward, and extremely clear! The Northeast was originally not within the scope of military mediation, and the Central Government's acceptance of mediation, as long as it did not hinder the National Army's work of taking over administrative sovereignty, could already be considered the height of benevolence and righteousness. The Communist forces' launching of the siege of Changchun is clearly a breach of agreement, a betrayal of trust, and a violation of the agreement. If a third party, when advocating mediation and discussing right and wrong, fails to rectify such obvious and significant violations of the agreement, but instead confusedly accommodates reality and only hopes to muddle through, the result will inevitably be that where one crack is patched, another will appear. The matter today is very simple: those who violate the agreement must be subjected to condemnation from both domestic and foreign sources, so that they understand that there is no benefit in violating the agreement, and that they must start anew in accordance with the agreement. Only then can we hope that the overall situation of the country can truly achieve peace. Special Envoy Marshall's advice on the eve of his departure from Chongqing is the minimum demand on the CCP!

Please everyone take note: The CCP not only forcibly occupies Changchun and Harbin in the Northeast, but also has launched offensives in various places within the customs. The tension in the situation in northern Jiangsu, the surprise attack on the outskirts of Nantong, the complete cessation of railway repair work on all lines in Shandong, the attacks suffered by Licheng, Yanzhou, Gaomi, and Weixian, and even sporadic surprise attacks and disturbances in the suburbs of Beiping and Tianjin, all reveal how the Communist Party has recently been violating ceasefire orders and overthrowing the "Political Consultative Conference" agreements. At this very moment, CCP spokespersons are also spreading rumors in Yan'an, even going so far as to set up strange radio stations, falsely impersonating the broadcasts of Nanjing and Kunming radio stations to confuse the public. Furthermore, Mr. Zhou Enlai deliberately claims that the conflicts in the Central Plains are expanding, fabricating many reports that the Communist forces in Hunan and Hubei have been besieged by the National Army. This further proves that, as of today, the CCP's preparations for a full-scale rebellion are nearing completion. To put it bluntly: The one who does not want peace today, but wants to seize political power by force, or at least wants to establish a separatist regime by force, is the Chinese Communist Party. We common people, even if relegated to being a third party, must not stand idly by and must not allow ourselves to merely call for peace in a confused manner. It must be known that today's China is not Shanghai during the Qi-Zhi War of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China. We fought the eight-year War of Resistance, shed immeasurable blood, and poured immeasurable sweat. We must preserve the fruits of this victory. Whoever destroys these fruits of victory is the public enemy of the entire nation!

"Consultation" involves both sides and multiple parties. Today, the agreements of the Political Consultative Conference have been completely torn up by the Communist Party. Have the gentlemen who participated in the consultation heard or seen nothing? The agreement to convene the National Assembly on May 5th has been postponed due to the Communist Party's failure to submit a list of nominees. The expansion and reorganization of the National Government has also been indefinitely shelved due to the Communist Party's failure to submit a list of National Government members and its forceful demand for seats. The major task of formulating a constitution has also been forced to be delayed due to the postponement of the National Assembly. The reorganization and unification of the military has been indefinitely delayed because the Communist Party has not yet submitted the serial numbers of its reduced units. The administrative sovereignty of the Northeast, according to the agreement, was originally the responsibility of the National Government to take over, and the CCP was not allowed to obstruct it. Now, it has been obstructed by the Communist forces' occupation of Changchun. Orders for the cessation of military conflicts in various places have long been issued, but in the past two months, due to the CCP's reckless actions, it has continued to attack the National Army everywhere, and the hope for peace is hanging by a thread. In short, the CCP speaks of peace but in reality, it is fighting. But it is only allowed to attack others, and no one is allowed to fight back! When the CCP wants to attack someone, it must first shout that someone is going to attack it; when the CCP is attacking someone, it must refuse mediation; when the CCP has fought well and seized territory, it must shout for a ceasefire, so that the other party cannot fight back. After it has rested for some time, and its strength has been reorganized, it can fight again, and then it will first shout that someone is going to attack it, in order to repeat its signature all-out brawl. This is the CCP's wishful thinking, and today, the peace-loving people of China and the well-meaning allies who seek mediation are being deceived by the CCP's trickery. We must now loudly proclaim: If the third party truly wants lasting peace, it must wake up, stop playing the fool, and stop being deceived by the CCP!

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Enters Second Week – Devoted to Peace Treaty Discussions – Disagreements Continue to Arise Between the US and the Soviet Union

[Our Newspaper] London, Second Broadcast: The Four Foreign Ministers had new "disagreements" again today, but fortunately, due to the continuous emergence of "disagreements," a simplified discussion procedure has been discovered, which will provide many conveniences for future negotiations. Today's disagreement was about the management of Italian prisoners of war. After Molotov routinely opposed the US proposal, the French Foreign Minister immediately stood up and said: "Since the opening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, no agreement has been reached, and disagreements have emerged one after another. In the future, the discussion method should be improved. Formal meetings should be changed to informal talks, held once a day. The first meeting will be held today in the office of the British Foreign Secretary."

[United Press Paris Second Telegram] The four foreign ministers are stepping up their efforts today to seek an agreement on the peace treaty with Italy, and have placed the discussion of the Dalmatian Islands and the handling of war criminals at the top of today's agenda. The four foreign ministers are scheduled to hold two meetings today and will try their best to clear up the points of disagreement as much as possible so that they can concentrate on listening to the opinions of Yugoslav and Italian experts on the Istrian border and the Trieste issue between the two countries at the meeting the day after tomorrow. According to US sources, the foreign ministers secretly decided last night to include the Dalmatian Islands and war criminals on today's agenda, but it was not stated who the war criminals were. Well-informed observers expect that the Foreign Ministers' Conference, which has now entered its second week, will devote itself to discussing the peace treaties with Italy and the Balkan countries, and that the negotiations on the peace treaties with the Balkan countries will continue into the third week, perhaps the majority of the last week, will study the German issue. Regarding the Italian colonies, especially Libya, the foreign ministers' opinions still differ greatly. The British side advocates Libyan independence, the French side proposes entrusting Italy to manage it, the United States agrees to entrust the United Nations to manage it, and the Soviet Union proposes a plan, advocating that the Italian colonies be entrusted to one of the countries, assisted by Italy, for joint management. (Note: The Dalmatian Islands are located on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea.)

### US Suggestion to Establish Control Committee for Italy Opposed by Soviet Union

[Reuters Paris Second Telegram] During yesterday's discussion at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on the issue of appointing an Allied Control Committee to monitor Italy's implementation of the treaty, Byrnes and Molotov had a dispute, and a final agreement could not be reached. Afterward, the entire Italian issue was reviewed, and the agenda for today's meeting was selected. Byrnes suggested establishing a Four-Nation Control Committee to supervise the general implementation of the Italian Peace Treaty, not limited to military terms. This was discussed at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference in September last year, but Molotov believed that this move would harm Italian sovereignty and was not feasible. Byrnes also said that after the establishment of this institution, Italy could be exempted from accusations from any individual country. British representative Bevin agreed with Byrnes's proposal, and France did not take a definite stand, but said that it agreed in principle to the establishment of an Allied Control Committee. After Molotov protested, Byrnes proposed adopting the principles of the London Conference in September last year, namely that the Control Committee would only be responsible for supervising the implementation of military terms, but Molotov still opposed it. It is generally speculated that Molotov's intention is to prevent the establishment of similar committees in Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary.

[United Press Paris First Telegram] Austria's appeal to Italy to return South Tyrol has been rejected by the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference today.

### British Dominion Prime Ministers Oppose Partitioning the Ruhr Area

[Central News Agency London First United Press Telegram] The British Dominion Prime Ministers' Conference unanimously opposed France's demand to partition the Ruhr and Rhineland areas, and agreed to Britain's compromise plan, which allows Germany to retain the Ruhr and Rhineland areas, but is subject to the control of an international Allied organization, and has considerable political power to supervise the Ruhr coal and industrial program, and stipulates that the Allies will implement a long-term military occupation.

### US Starts "Closing Down" Bases Everywhere

[United Washington Second Telegram] The United States has now started "closing down" bases everywhere in the world. The future trend can be seen from Iceland's formal opposition to the United States continuing to maintain an air base on the island, especially in the Pacific. However, Okinawa Island is an ideal air base in the East, and Saipan Island and Tinian Island will not be returned to Japan. As for other bases such as the Caroline Islands, Lyziki Island, and Wake Island, the US Navy hopes to maintain them.

Bidault explained France's urgent economic needs for three hours.

At the same time, Bidault also spoke with President Truman, who provided guarantees for both lending to France and supplying France with supplies. It is reported that the French government recently cabled Washington, stating that France needs 500,000 tons of American wheat before this year's harvest.

### Throughout Palestine – General Strike Launched Today to Protest the British-American Investigation Report – British Troops Greatly Increased to Prevent Turmoil

[Reuters Jerusalem Second Telegram] The Arab Higher Committee of Palestine notified the Arab tribes throughout Palestine to hold a general strike for one day on Friday to protest the report of the British-American investigation team. At the same time, it also telegraphed the neighboring Arab countries to launch a sympathy strike on that day. Since the publication of the British-American investigation report, neither the Jewish nor the Arab tribes have expressed satisfaction. The Jewish tribe is most disappointed that the establishment of a Jewish state is not allowed. The Arab tribe has always opposed Jewish immigration. The report suggests immigrating 100,000 Jews this year, which makes them very angry, and allowing Jews to buy land is also a major blow to the Arab tribe. There is no sign of unusual tension on the surface here, but it is known that many British troops have entered Palestine. Some people estimate that the number of British troops in Palestine has reached as many as 100,000, with the main force in the Jewish area in the north. If the Arab tribe expresses armed resistance, these areas will be the target. It is still unknown whether the British troops came here to prevent turmoil or as an occasional gathering, but it can be said to be a coincidence in this time. The security in this city is also very tight, with armored vehicles carrying machine guns and searchlights patrolling the streets day and night.

### Britain and the United States Discuss Joint Action

[Our Newspaper] London, Second Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Byrnes met today to discuss the Palestine report.

[Reuters London Second Telegram] British Prime Minister Attlee told the Lower House yesterday that the British government will now negotiate with the US government on the Palestine issue to discuss the necessary joint action. The government now recognizes that this matter is extremely urgent. However, fulfilling the terms in the report will become a major task, so the British government hopes to find out how much responsibility the US government can share in military and economic terms, and then make a decision as soon as possible. It is deeply hoped that Jewish and Arab leaders can be patient.

[United Washington First Telegram] The US Prime Minister advocated that the United States provide military and financial assistance to prevent disturbances in Palestine, but the US Congress expressed opposition. Some congressmen believe that if Britain wants any military assistance, it should seek it from the United Nations organization, not from the United States.

### Germany Laments Many Unmarried Women; Marriage Advertisements Offer a Wide Spectacle; Some Even Refer to Themselves as "Dark Beauties"

[United Press, Frankfurt, Germany, 1st] The marriage market in Germany is currently quite lively. In Frankfurt, many places where advertisements are posted have announcements for selling goods on one side and marriage proposals from single men and women on the other. Some newspapers' classified ad sections are also filled with these small marriage announcements. Due to the large number of men who died in the recent war, there is a phenomenon of more women than men in Germany. In the American occupation zone, among Germans aged 19 to 45, there is only one man for every four women. Because there are more women than men, most of the people posting marriage advertisements are women. However, the number of men seeking marriage is increasing day by day, as more Germans are released from prisoner-of-war camps and want to start a new life. People of all ages are seeking marriage, from young women not yet twenty years old to elderly men and women in their sixties. Many women became widows at a young age because of the war. Women's marriage advertisements often emphasize that they have housing and furniture, as these are not easy to obtain in Germany. A 29-year-old widow referred to herself as a "dark beauty" in her marriage advertisement and specifically stated that she owned furniture. Another 40-year-old widow claimed to be "good-looking" and have a very beautiful 19-year-old son, and added that she had a house and garden in Oberden. Many women declared themselves very healthy in their advertisements, placing appearance in a secondary position. Even women ten years older stated: "Intelligent and lively, willing to be paired with a partner of appropriate age." Men's advertisements are not as verbose as women's, but some specifically stated "I am not a member of the National Socialist Party."

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, from United Press] Former Foreign Minister Togo, after being certified by the American military doctor as capable of enduring prison life, was imprisoned on the night of the 1st.

### Watch How Tojo Defends Himself

[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] Hideki Tojo, the instigator of the Japanese war, broke his long silence today, stating that his defense will declare the entire history related to his personal involvement in this war, and may verbally criticize the actions of the UK and the US before the war. It is said: "I will proclaim to the world that this war was Japan's war of self-defense." Tojo will appear in court tomorrow as the head of the "militarist warlords" to be tried for various charges, from individual murder to conspiracy to dominate the world.

Tojo issued a written statement to a United Press reporter, outlining his intended defense points as follows:

Proclaiming Aggression as Self-Defense

(First) Japan is an independent country, and given the situation in 1941, there was no other way but war for the sake of "self-defense." As for the question of when I believed that a war with the United Kingdom and the United States was inevitable, I will further elaborate in court. (Second) Japan "did not want to invade any Eastern country," but only to "liberate" them. As for the use of each country's resources and the implementation of various restrictions on the rights of the people, it was necessary for the prosecution of the war, but only for the duration of the war. (Third) In my position as Prime Minister, I hoped that the Washington negotiations in 1941 would be successful. All the orders I issued were conditional, that is, if the Washington Conference achieved success, these orders should be revoked. (Fourth) In my position as Prime Minister and concurrently Minister of the Army, I "in principle" agreed to withdraw troops from China. This was a major obstacle to the negotiations, but withdrawal could only be implemented under "certain conditions," one of which was a peace agreement with China.

Exposing the Inner Workings of the Military

Tojo also answered questions directly in a stern manner, saying that at the beginning of the war, "I naturally believed that Japan would win." Tojo's statement shows that he will dispute every charge with the prosecutor. Tojo also admitted that he opposed Japan's surrender, stating, "I expressed this view in the meeting of senior ministers, but did not take any action to prevent the surrender." However, his son-in-law, Major Koga, committed suicide by seppuku after initiating an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the Japanese Emperor from surrendering after the Potsdam Declaration. Tojo also stated that he would present in court the long-standing conflicts between the Japanese Army and Navy before the war. Regarding the question of whether Tojo would have changed his attitude if the entire Japanese Navy had resolutely opposed him in 1941, instead of just individual opposition, he will answer in court.

Still Wants to Live a Humiliating Life

Other Japanese people said that Tojo's appointment as Prime Minister in 1941 was a premeditated plan, but Tojo claimed, "I was very surprised when I received the imperial order to form a cabinet on October 10, 1941, but once I became Prime Minister, I had to do my best." Tojo, who both initiated the war and caused it to fail, believes that the outcome of the war is "regrettable." At this moment, he hopes that Japan can "revive under a new banner." He no longer intends to commit suicide and clearly stated in his answers that he will fight during the trial.

### Various Countries Celebrate Labor Day: Exaggerations, Disturbances, and Talk of War Vary Widely

[United Press, London, 1st] During the celebration of Labor Day in various European countries, exaggerations, disturbances, and talk of war varied widely.

Paris, Rome, Berlin, Moscow

In Paris, 500,000 French people marched, with banners proclaiming "Complete severance of relations with Franco" and attacking the current Spanish regime, calling Franco a "murderer of democracy."

Although Mussolini is dead, his fanatical followers briefly harassed the headquarters of the Communist Party in Rome and the Communist Party's socialist newspaper, and once "occupied" the Rome radio station, forcing it to broadcast Fascist songs.

Hundreds of thousands of workers in Berlin marched through the ruins with red flags leading the way, without any militaristic overtones, but their bombastic speakers demanded support for "the only true socialism," reminding people of Hitler's crowd psychology.

All cities throughout the Soviet Union had grand celebrations, with the celebration ceremony on Moscow's Red Square being the most prominent. It gathered the largest peacetime force to boast military prowess. Premier Stalin and the crowd listened quietly to the speech of Soviet hero Marshal Rokossovsky, who said: "We should not be complacent. International reactionary forces have repeatedly raised their heads, plotting to undermine the cooperation of freedom-loving nations and struggle for peace and security." The British Labor Party stipulated that Labor Day would be officially commemorated on Sunday.

### Japanese Liberal and Socialist Parties Reach Compromise

Hatoyama May Succeed as Prime Minister

[Special dispatch from our Tokyo correspondent, May 2nd] The outgoing Prime Minister will dispatch Foreign Minister Yoshida to meet with MacArthur within days, recommending Ichiro Hatoyama as the successor. If MacArthur accepts this recommendation, then Shidehara will pay respect to the Emperor and make the same recommendation. Three committee members of the Socialist Party's Central Executive Committee met with Hatoyama this morning. According to Hatoyama, who was interviewed by our reporter afterward, the Socialist Party has abandoned its demand to appoint the Prime Minister, but the Liberal Party will recognize the Socialist Party's economic policies.

### Security Council Scheduled to Reconvene on the 6th to Hear the Soviet Union's Withdrawal Report; Subcommittee Investigating Spain to Meet

[Central News Agency, New York, 1st] The discussion of the agenda by the Security Council has come to a conclusion. The Council will begin its recess today, which may last until May 6, as the Soviet Union plans to report to the Security Council on whether Soviet troops have completely withdrawn from Iran at that time.

[United Press, New York, 2nd] The subcommittee investigating the Spanish issue today urged all members to provide information about Spain and asked the Franco regime and Spanish Republican exiles to present their conflicting views. The committee, after holding its first closed-door meeting yesterday, welcomes information from any party.

### Glass Car Appears in the United States

[United States Information Service, Detroit, 1st] The first glass car in the automotive industry, invented by Stout, was unveiled in Deupont, a suburb, on April 29. Stout invented a method of manufacturing fiber glass for automotive bodies and believes that his invention may revolutionize the automotive industry.

### Can the Foreign Ministers' Conference Resolve the Many Complex Problems in Europe?

— Xueyan, Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in London

Although the end of the European war was nearly a year ago, sorting out the postwar mess and defining the future relationships between the defeated countries and other nations are still being explored, and the situation is still unclear. This cannot be blamed on the parties involved being negligent, but rather because the issues are too complex. With conflicting interests and differing opinions, no one is willing to compromise easily, so the issues are naturally not easy to resolve. Last September, the five major powers' foreign ministers met in London to discuss this matter, but the results of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, as everyone knows, only resulted in heated arguments, and the results were almost equal to zero. Later, in December, there was the Moscow Conference of Three Foreign Ministers, which continued to discuss this matter. The transformation from a five-foreign-minister conference to a three-foreign-minister conference was itself a compromise. One of the main reasons for the London conference failing was the Soviet Union's opposition to China and France's participation. Indeed, China and France were not included in the Moscow conference, and no matter how the UK and the US explained it, Soviet diplomacy had achieved an actual preliminary victory. At the Moscow conference, regarding the European peace, it was decided that the foreign minister representatives of the countries participating in the establishment of the Foreign Ministers' Conference agreement in the Berlin conference would immediately draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. After the draft peace treaties are completed, a peace conference will be convened to formally sign them. After the method of drafting the peace treaties was decided, the representatives of the four foreign ministers began working in London. As for how the progress, because each party was very secretive, outsiders do not know the details. However, the authorities of various countries occasionally express complaints, and some news is inevitably leaked. Generally speaking, the achievements of the four foreign ministers' representatives over the past three months are that there are more points of disagreement than points of agreement. Bernardes suggested that the foreign ministers of each country personally come forward again to hold a four-foreign-minister conference in Paris on April 25, hoping to resolve the disputes. This proposal was immediately approved by the UK, France, and the Soviet Union, so the Foreign Ministers' Conference was held in Paris as scheduled. However, whether the disputes of various parties can be resolved as planned, we cannot say too early. What are the points that the four major powers are unwilling to compromise on? Because the negotiations are in progress, all parties are keeping secrets, and it is difficult for us to know the details. However, by piecing together what has been directly and indirectly revealed by various parties, we can barely understand an outline. In the Foreign Ministers' Representatives Conference, the first thing discussed was the draft of the treaty clauses with Italy. For example, regarding how to solve the issue of Italian colonies, the UK originally advocated not negotiating for the time being. Later, due to opposition from various countries, it seemed to abandon its original proposal on its own initiative. The Soviet Union requested to hand over Tripolitania to the Soviet Union for trusteeship, which was strongly opposed by the UK and the US. As for France's attitude towards this, we have heard very little. Why did the UK advocate not negotiating for the time being? Because most of Italy's colonies are currently under British military occupation and are practically the same as British colonies. Others may have doubts about the British occupation and management, but the UK itself has no doubts or fears and is fully confident that occupying them for one more day will definitely not be a loss for the UK, so it advocated discussing it slowly, and delaying it as long as possible. Perhaps for this reason, various countries expressed opposition. Why did the Soviet Union request trusteeship of Tripolitania? Naturally, it was not because it liked to make trouble for itself. Trusteeship is a new system under the current United Nations organization, and how it will actually evolve in the future, we naturally cannot predict. However, the trusteeship system is derived from the mandate system of the League of Nations and has been improved. The achievements of the mandate system are readily available today. Not to mention the islands mandated to Japan in the Pacific, let's just talk about the territories mandated to the UK and France in South Africa. How different are they from colonies? It is also difficult to estimate. Therefore, we guess that the Soviet Union's request for trusteeship of Tripolitania has a mandate territory in mind first, or it will not be too wrong. As for why the UK and the US opposed it? As far as the UK is concerned, the Middle East and the Near East have always been considered the UK's transportation hub to the Far East and India. When the power of a strong country extends into this area, the UK identifies it as a competitor. Imperial Russia, France, and Italy have all successively or simultaneously competed with the UK in this area. Now the Soviet Union's power has penetrated the Balkans, infiltrated Iran, and is also demanding free access to the Dardanelles Strait. If it establishes a foundation in East Africa and unites into one, it is simply a threat to the heart of the British Empire, and opposition is natural. The Iranian issue has caused unrest among its neighbors, and this is also one of the main reasons. Although the issue of Tripolitania is silent, the UK's opposition is probably no less than that of the Iranian issue. The US has many theories about the trusteeship system, but there are few places in the world where it can put its ideals into practice. Now that it has discovered that Italy's colonies are still ownerless, it feels that it is an opportunity and advocates trying out "international co-management trusteeship" in Italy's colonies. Therefore, just from the issue of the disposal of Italian colonies, it can already be known how different the opinions of various parties are. There are even more complex issues.

Should Italy pay reparations? How much should it pay? How should it be allocated? These are all issues that the foreign ministers' representatives should resolve. The current policy of the UK and the US is to stabilize the situation in Europe and promote the economic recovery of various countries. Italy is not as terrible as Germany, but it is also one of the major European countries, so it attaches great importance to Italy's economic recovery. If Italy's economy can recover as soon as possible, then the demands for reparations from it should not be too harsh. The UK, the US, and France themselves seem to not demand reparations from Italy, but they believe that the Soviet Union's demand for one hundred million US dollars in in-kind reparations for its own country and two hundred million US dollars in in-kind reparations for Yugoslavia, Greece, and Albania is too harsh, hindering Italy's economic recovery, and they strongly oppose it. As for the disposal of the remaining Italian fleet, it is said that the Soviet Union demanded one-quarter, which was also opposed by the UK, the US, and France. Furthermore, regarding the future military equipment of Italy, how to restrict it, the opinions of various countries are also inconsistent. France has been invaded by strong neighbors several times, suffering greatly, and is most afraid of having strong neighbors around it. Therefore, regarding the issue of restricting Italian military equipment, it is said that France has the most opinions. In addition, France also demands some strategic locations on the Franco-Italian border to secure its defense. As for the disposal of places such as Trieste, it is currently awaiting the investigation report of the four-nation committee, but that is a long-standing dispute, and it is difficult to expect a perfect solution. Now, in the draft peace treaty, in addition to Italy, it is said that the issue of Hungary has been discussed. Hungary is now the Soviet Union's ally, and it signed a separate treaty with the Soviet Union last year. The UK once opposed it. Recently, the Hungarian Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and several other ministers went to the Soviet Union together and signed multiple treaties. Therefore, in the eyes of the Soviet Union, Hungary is no longer an enemy country. Moreover, any concessions made by Hungary to the UK, the US, and other countries directly or indirectly affect the Soviet Union's acquired interests. Therefore, it can be predicted that the Soviet Union will protect Hungary in the peace talks. The UK and the US have always believed that Bulgaria and Romania are not democratic enough and that the government should accommodate people from other parties. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, is very close to them because of similar ideologies, so it is unquestionable that the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union will have different views. The simplest is the treaty with Finland, because there are only the UK and the Soviet Union, and the issue is easy to resolve. It is said that there has been considerable progress in the discussions, which is the most successful part of the peace treaty draft discussions. From the above analysis, we know how complex the issue is and whether the four foreign ministers can completely resolve it. It is difficult to predict now. It is said that if it fails, the UK and the US are prepared to make peace separately with Italy and other countries. This is of course the last resort, a measure of last resort. I think that even if the UK and the US currently have this preparation, it is only for contingency purposes. Moreover, although there are many points of conflict, it is not completely impossible to compromise. Or, first choose the parts that can be compromised, draft a compromise proposal, and leave the parts that cannot be compromised to be resolved later. This may not be a solution, and from all aspects, it seems to be the most likely solution. (Sent from London on April 23)

Scum of the Journalism World

### Xu Liqun on Trial: Double Puppet, Confesses to Being Dragged in by Traitor Lin; Just a Mouthpiece

[Report from this Newspaper] Xu Liqun, a member of the Shanghai journalistic community who was once prominent during the enemy's occupation, began trial at the High Court yesterday morning at around 10 AM. Xu, as acting president of "Zhonghua Daily," the organ of traitor Wang Jingwei, published absurd remarks to confuse the people's consciousness. Yesterday, Judge Qiu Huan-ying opened the first court session for interrogation. Xu was short in stature, wearing a gray-black long gown, with glasses on his nose, a sullen face, and very slow movements, and his voice was low and stuttered. According to his confession, he was from Zhongshan, Guangdong, 43 years old this year, and lived at 1711 West Aisi Road. He joined "Zhonghua Daily" in 1932. After the newspaper defected, "for the sake of livelihood," he was dragged into it by the puppet propaganda minister Lin Baisheng. The presiding judge asked him: "Why did you publish so many absurd remarks?" Xu immediately admitted that he was a puppet and said: "All the newspaper's affairs were originally the responsibility of Lin Baisheng himself. All the remarks were sent directly from Nanjing. I was just nominally a mouthpiece. However, I wrote articles scolding Chen Binhe." The presiding judge asked: "Why did you attack each other when you were in the same camp?" He replied: "I fundamentally opposed Chen Binhe's absurd remarks. Originally, I was preparing to go to the mainland, but transportation was difficult, and I couldn't find any connections. I was afraid that I would be arrested by the government for having served in a puppet position, so I didn't go and could only scold Chen Binhe." He asked: "When did you attend the "Greater East Asia" News Association?" He replied: "In the winter of 1944." He asked: "You also served as the chief director of the puppet News Association?" He replied yes. He asked: "Who took over the puppet Zhonghua Daily?" He replied: "It was Wu Shao Shu of the City Party Department. However, one day after the victory, I published the 'Peace Extra'." The presiding judge said sternly: "Does publishing a 'Peace Extra' mean you are not a traitor? You are just quibbling!" Then he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, pending rescheduling for further interrogation. Xu did not retain a lawyer to defend him in this trial, and no family members were in court to listen.

Traitor Yang Zhiwei Still Trying to Evade Responsibility

The case of Yang Zhiwei was also tried. Yang was from Wuxi, 28 years old. In 1935, he studied in Japan. In July 1941, he took the exam for special agents at "No. 76" in Shanghai and was accepted as a translator. He was assigned to the Suzhou Office of the Puppet Qingxiang Committee as an assistant secretary. The following spring, he was promoted to a recommended secretary of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government. In August 1943, he was transferred to the secretary of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government's Construction Department and concurrently the deputy director of the Suzhou Office of the Puppet Rice Grain Control Committee. From January to April 1945, he served as a major staff officer of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Security Command and other puppet positions. After the victory, he was arrested and delivered to court by the Military Intelligence Bureau. When questioned yesterday morning, traitor Yang was still trying to evade responsibility, so the court ordered a rescheduling for further interrogation.

### Kang Sidan Dingni Actually Claims to Have Assisted Our Underground Workers

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the Provisional Criminal Court of the High Court, presided over by Judge Qiu Huanying, opened the trial of Kang Sidan Dingni, an Italian fascist party member, for the crime of communicating with the enemy and endangering the country. The defendant hired lawyer Cai Xiaobai as his defense counsel. Surprisingly, he also confessed to having assisted our underground workers in their activities in Shanghai and contributed to our Republic of China. Judge Qiu, believing that the case required further investigation, ordered a postponement for further hearings. Kang Sidan Dingni, 45 years old, came to Shanghai in January 1930 and engaged in legal practice. He also held positions at the Italian Embassy in China twice. In 1941, he served as the political secretary of the Shanghai Fascist Party and was once an advisor to Wang Jingwei, a traitor, engaging exclusively in liaison with the Japanese invaders. Even after Italy's surrender, he continued to lead the Shanghai Fascist Party, building a Japanese-organized Fascist volunteer army to fight alongside the Japanese army. Unfortunately, his good dream did not last long, and he was arrested by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters after the victory. After a detailed investigation by Prosecutor Lin Wopeng of the High Procuratorate, eight charges were listed. However, Kang Sidan Dingni claimed that he had assisted the Central Government in establishing a secret radio station in Shanghai, and Mrs. Zhao Ziyou could testify to this. The veracity of this claim is still awaiting verification.

### Occupying Enemy Overseas Chinese Houses: Forced Eviction

The Housing Allocation Committee for Shanghai Agencies under the Executive Yuan will actively launch a campaign of forced eviction against unscrupulous individuals who illegally occupied houses during the evacuation of enemy overseas Chinese. To prevent all malpractices, the committee has specially printed a five-part form for execution orders for use during enforcement. The execution work will officially commence within days. The five parts of the form are: the first part is the stub, the second part is the execution order, the third part is the execution report form, the fourth part is the opinion form signed by the subject of execution, and the fifth part is the execution notification.

### Measures for Handling Traitor Property Expected to be Decided Soon

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, trials of treason cases have been actively underway in various regions. However, there are still no clear measures on how to handle the property of traitors. Therefore, the reporter visited the responsible officials of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. I was informed that the number of traitor cases that have been definitively adjudicated is still small. The bureau has repeatedly consulted with the Shanghai High Court on the handling of traitor property. According to legal regulations, it should be handled by the court. However, since the bureau and the Ministry of Judicial Administration both belong to the national agencies under the Executive Yuan, and the courts have a limited staff, handling this huge amount of traitor property may be difficult in practice. Therefore, the solution to this problem will likely be one of the following three options: (1) handled by the court; (2) change the legal regulations and let the Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau handle it, but this will take a long time and may be too late to be of any use; (3) the court entrusts the Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau to handle it, or the court and the bureau jointly form an appropriate joint agency to be responsible for supervision. It is said that Bureau Director Liu has decided to ask President Song for instructions on the measures, and a decision will be made soon. As for the property of some unadjudicated suspected traitors, the bureau has followed President Song's instructions and entrusted the Central Bank to take care of the gold, silver, and jewelry, entrusted the Central Trust Bureau to take care of the real estate, and handed over the materials to the Customs to take care of them, all without any processing. If the court declares the suspected traitor innocent, the bureau will immediately return the property. Furthermore, the Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau will be abolished in the short term, and the complete conclusion of the trial and adjudication of traitor cases may take a considerable amount of time. It is currently undecided how the traitor property section of the bureau will continue to work.

### Public Trial of Wu Songgao This Afternoon; Lin Kanghou and Others Have Also Been Indicted

[Report from Our Newspaper] Lin Kanghou, Tang Shoumin, Su Chengde, Dai Ailu, Cheng Weisheng, Huang Fusen, Wang Dakun, Yang Zhiwei, Guo Ming, Chen Zujian, Zhao Xilin, and others have been indicted by the High Procuratorate after the conclusion of the investigation on charges of treason.

Yesterday, the High Procuratorate also questioned Chang Yuqing, the leader of the "An Qing Association", Dai Yingfu, the former head of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, and Huang Yuan, Zhou Wenrui, Ni Aifu, Shao Hongzhu, and Lin Yifu to investigate their crimes. Wu Songgao, who has served as the former Minister of Justice Administration and the former Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, will be publicly tried at the Tilanqiao High Court at 3:00 PM today. In addition, the case of Liu Huizhai is also scheduled for trial today.

### Measures for Handling Materials in the Jiang Gongmei Case Have Been Decided

[Report from Our Newspaper] The main points of the interrogation in the Jiang Gongmei case the day before yesterday included the embezzlement part, the dereliction of duty part, and the suspected crime part that is still under investigation. However, Jiang resolutely denied all points and shirked responsibility. In the dereliction of duty part, regarding the point that Jiang arrested criminals during his tenure and released them directly without transferring them to the court for handling according to law, his confession was vague. In addition, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters has decided on the handling of confiscated materials in the case. It is reported that those belonging to the public will be returned immediately, and those belonging to the private sector will be verified and handled. As for enemy and puppet materials, such as rice, flour, sugar, and fish, which are easily moldy, they will be publicly auctioned and preserved at a converted price.

### Glamourous Corpse Case: Main Suspect Transferred to Court

[Report from Our Newspaper] The main suspect in the Glamourous Corpse case at Taishan Apartments, after being transferred by the police station to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for interrogation, was transferred to the local court for trial yesterday as an ordinary criminal.

### The Registered Amount of Puppet Currency in This City Reached 2.7 Billion Yuan; Handling Methods Are Still Awaiting Instructions from the Ministry of Finance

As of the end of last month, the remaining amount of the puppet Central Reserve Bank notes that were directly registered with the Central Bank totaled 2.7 billion yuan, excluding the amount registered in other cities. As for how to deal with it, relevant parties stated that once the reports from other cities arrive successively and are compiled, they will then request instructions from the Ministry of Finance for handling.

### Factory Resumption of Work: Measures for Bidding and Sale Passed

The Enemy and Puppet Industry Review Committee of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District passed the following yesterday: (1) Measures for the bidding and sale of factories that have resumed work. A. All assets such as real estate, machinery, equipment, and decoration that are not affected by the resumption of work will still be listed in a list according to previous methods, and bidders will evaluate and bid, and the highest bidder will win the bid and purchase the entire factory. B. All raw materials, finished products, materials, accessories, etc., which are assets that change due to the resumption of work, shall be based on the quantity at the time of the winner's receipt of the factory, and the winner shall purchase them according to the evaluation of the evaluation committee, and the winner shall not raise any objections. C. If the factory that has resumed work has any uncompleted orders and contracts, they shall be inherited by the winner. (2) Return the Xing Guangying small steamer of the Shanghai Qingji Steamer Bureau, the Dafeng steamer of Dafeng Company, and the welding boat of Huaxin Electric Welding Company. (3) Return the machinery of the branch of the British Lee Hachem Motor Company, the real estate of the Christian Glory Society, the real estate of Hong Xiuzhen, the warehouse and stored materials of Haijing Foreign Company, the materials of Ba Bo Ge Boiler Company, the wood of the British Marler Company, and the stored black tea of Guanghe Company.

### Good News Amidst the Housing Shortage: Golden Houses Will Arrive Soon

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Mobile Golden House Investment Company of this city has recently successively ordered mobile golden houses from Montgomery Ward of the United States to supply the needs of the city's citizens. At this time of severe housing shortage, these light-use houses can solve part of the housing shortage after they arrive in Shanghai. According to the company's general manager, Zhang Huanzhang, who told reporters yesterday afternoon, the first batch of golden houses will be shipped to Shanghai in forty days, which were custom ordered by the company itself, but they can still be sold after they arrive. It is currently planned to order more than one hundred houses, all of which will arrive in February. It is expected to order two thousand houses within this year.

This house is composed of "units". Each unit is eight feet wide, twenty feet long, and seven feet high. The roof slopes four inches every twelve inches. The roof and walls are made of specially made 24-gauge lead sheets embedded and nailed together. The roof frame is made of steel and coated with two layers of paint, baked in a radiant heat furnace, and will not rust. The doors are equipped with wooden doors and other metal parts; the windows are made of steel frames and chemical glass and other metal parts; each window is equipped with bronze or copper venetian blinds. The floor is a steel frame with steel trusses and wooden boards. All the houses are equipped with half-inch-thick, hard insulation boards to isolate sound.

The price of the house is US$846.90 for each end unit and US$700 for each middle unit. Each set has two end units and one middle unit, totaling US$2,393.80. The largest empty house currently available can add another middle unit. As for the payment method, 50% of the price is paid first, and the remaining amount is paid upon delivery, but the dock customs duties are borne by the ordering customer.

Hoping that the Banking Industry Will Invest to Allow Citizens to Pay in Installments

Zhang continued to say: If the ordering customer has their own land after the houses arrive in Shanghai, it would be even better. The company is currently in contact with the Municipal Government's Standing Bureau and may allocate some vacant land in the former French Concession and Hongqiao area for citizens to rent or purchase, and the price will be lower than that of general real estate developers. At the same time, in order to enable the general public to solve the housing problem, it is hoped that the banking industry can invest in purchases and allow citizens to pay in installments, which can reduce the burden on residents.

Zhang also said that the United States itself does not have a housing shortage, so other wooden mobile houses cannot be supplied to foreign countries. The company is still making every effort to contact the United States to request as much supply as possible.

### The Results of the Vote Counting in Penglai and Hongkou: Yao Mulian, Wang Zhuyi, and Others Elected; The Date for Re-election in Changning and Yulin Is Undetermined

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Civil Affairs Office recently explained the situation of the dispute over the vote counting in the fourth district (Penglai) of this city. According to reports, there were a total of ten ballot boxes in the district. When the eighth box was opened, a certain candidate suddenly expressed disagreement and requested the vote counters to stop counting and send the ballot boxes to the court for identification. At that time, other candidates were also present and believed that this was inappropriate and expressed their opposition, requesting that the vote counting continue. The Bureau Chief, in order to respect the majority's opinion, allowed the vote counting to proceed. As a result, the elected candidates were Yao Mulian, Yao Baozhen, Zhu Liangcai, Xu Zexiang, Ye Fenghu, Zhao Yangxiong, Fan Xipin, Wang Guoxian, and Li Kaidi (the elimination of the latter three names is still subject to verification, but it is unlikely to be a problem). The date for the re-election in the ninth district (Changning) and the nineteenth district (Yulin) has not yet been determined. However, the advertisements published by the Youth League in various newspapers regarding the election dispute in the nineteenth district are completely untrue, according to the Civil Affairs Office. According to reports, the situation at the time was indeed riots by thugs, which ultimately made the election impossible to proceed. As for the election in the sixteenth district (Hongkou), the Civil Affairs Office believed that there were still some disputes, so eight ballot boxes were concentrated in the municipal government for vote counting. Now that all the circumstances have been investigated clearly, the vote counting in the district was held in Room 199 of the municipal government yesterday, with officials from the Civil Affairs Office monitoring the vote counting. More than 20 district representatives and candidates were present. The elected candidates were Wang Zhuyi, Wang Weiyin, Li Baiqing, and Zhu Hongyi. The alternate candidates were Qian Naiwen, Zhang Tianbai, Jin Qijing, and Yang Yinpu. It is also learned that the alternate candidates for the second district (Laozha) are Xu Wenzhao, Lü Guangbiao, Wang Yangzhen, Liu Zhifang, and Huang Xiaowen. The alternate candidates for the fifth district (Taishan) are Zhu Su'e, Qu Zhenhua, Hu Guopan, Du Weifan, Zhu Kongjia, Dong Kechang, Li Tianzhen, Hu Huaitian, Liu Zigang, Yin Yong, Guo Lanxin, Cao Yaxia, and Fang Yida.

### The Authorities' Painstaking Efforts to Adjust the Prices of Public Utilities: Water, Electricity, and Other Companies are Losing Huge Amounts of Money Every Month; Current Increases Can Only Take Care of Minimum Maintenance Costs

— Our Reporter Canglong

The wave of prices seems to have calmed down. Public utilities did not let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The new prices for streetcars, buses, water, and electricity have been approved by the authorities and implemented successively. This is a "painstaking effort" by the authorities, because they have said that public utilities are often affected by prices, rather than prices being affected by public utilities. They also said that public utilities should aim to serve society and reduce the burden on citizens, while still enabling them to obtain the minimum maintenance costs to continue operating continuously… It is certainly not an easy task to set a price that takes all aspects into account under these contradictory premises. The reporter would like to discuss the situation of this adjustment with the readers based on the information collected from various sources.

Third-Class Streetcar Increases by Three Thousand Times

First of all, let's talk about streetcars. If we compare the pre-war fares of the British streetcars in this city with the recent adjusted prices, we can see that the increase rate of the lowest fare is particularly sharp. According to the investigation, before the war, the highest price for third class was 27 copper coins (equivalent to nine cents), and the lowest was six copper coins (equivalent to two cents). Now the highest price for third class is 120 yuan, an increase of 1,333 times. The lowest price for third class is 60 yuan, an increase of exactly 3,000 times. Let's talk about first class. Before the war, the highest price was 33 copper coins (equivalent to 11 cents), and the lowest was eight copper coins (a little less than three cents). Now the highest price for first class is 200 yuan, an increase of 1,818 times. The lowest is 90 yuan, and the increase rate has exceeded 3,000 times. This is an interesting comparison. Hearing the increase in the lowest fare may scare you, but after all, the base price in the copper coin era was too low. Even if it is increased by thousands of times now, it is still more than enough compared to the rickshaws and pedicabs that haggle all day long. Please see that the carriages are still crowded as usual. Although the passengers will instinctively complain about the price increase, they still know that it is cheap and good!

Different Increases in Water and Electricity Prices

Let's talk about water and electricity. Before the war, the water fee of the British Shanghai Water Company was 7.5 cents per 100 gallons. Now it is 54 yuan and 55 cents, an increase of 726 times. The French Water and Electricity Company uses cubic meters as the unit of calculation. Before the war, the water fee was 8.75 cents per cubic meter. Now it is 120 yuan, an increase of 1,370 times. In terms of electricity, before the war, the American Shanghai Electric Power Company charged 16.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Now it is 50 yuan (referring to small users who consume less than 10 kilowatt-hours), an increase of 299 times. The French Water and Electricity Company charged 18.2 cents per kilowatt-hour before the war. Now the price is the same as that of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, an increase of 274 times. Comparing these two aspects, although the French Water and Electricity Company's water fee has a larger multiple increase, the electricity fee seems to be the cheapest when looking at the multiple increase!

Gas and Telephone are Extremely Cheap

The telephone fee has also been adjusted now. Before the price was adjusted, an employee of the American Shanghai Telephone Company jokingly said to the reporter that if the cost of installing a telephone in the company is calculated at the current rate (the installation fee is 5,000 yuan, and the deposit is 10,000 yuan), as long as there is a telephone in the company, people from all walks of life can have one per person. As for the cost of calls, before the war, a business telephone cost 10 yuan for 100 calls per month; now (referring to before the most recent adjustment, same below) the fee is 1,500 yuan, an increase of 150 times. Before the war, a residential telephone cost 6.5 yuan for 65 calls per month; now the fee is 975 yuan, also an increase of 150 times. Compared with the multiple increase in water and electricity, it is even cheaper. As for gas, the British Shanghai Gas Company charged 28.5 cents per degree (100 cubic feet) before the war. Now the fee is 190 yuan, an increase of only 666 times. The above prices are based on the previous month's calculations.

Loss Figures of Public Utilities

Looking at the deficit accounts of other public utilities, the British Streetcar Company lost 180 million yuan in March, accumulating a loss of 960 million yuan; the French Yongdian Company lost 170 million yuan in March, accumulating a loss of 787 million yuan; the American Shanghai Telephone Company lost 150 million yuan in March… However, in order to take care of the burden on the vast majority of common people, the authorities have limited the price adjustment of each company to obtaining the current minimum maintenance costs. The so-called maintenance costs are limited to wages, fuel, and necessary business expenses. All depreciation, official interest, and dividends are temporarily not included. We understand the depression of the current situation of various public utilities, and we experience the painstaking efforts of the authorities to adjust the prices. Therefore, so far, the prices of public utilities are still a paradise in the raging tide of prices. Let us pray silently that this paradise will prosper and grow day by day, to save prices from collapsing!

### Mayor Qian Sends a Telegram to Congratulate the National Government's Return to the Capital

Because the National Government is about to return to the capital, Mayor Qian Dajun sent a telegram of congratulations yesterday. The text of the telegram is as follows: Respectfully to the Nanjing National Government, having read the clear order announcing the return to the capital, I rejoice in the revitalization of the national territory and remember the restoration of the Divine Land. The universe is celebrating and hundreds of millions of people are rejoicing. Tracing back to the Japanese warlords' aggression, the government, for the sake of a protracted war of resistance, moved away from the capital to the western frontier, making it the center of the whole country and the model for the military and civilians. Now, fortunately, the national foundation has been re-established, the enemy and puppet regime have collapsed, and they have returned in triumph, eliminating the flaws and fulfilling the hopes of the people across the sea, and tying the hearts of international admiration. Shanghai is close to the capital and is pleased to inherit the legacy. I respectfully send this telegram to congratulate you, hoping you will be mindful of it. Mayor of Shanghai Qian Dajun.

### Tang Enbo and Wang Maogong's 20 Hours in Nantong Animated the Hearts of the Ancient City's People

— Nantong Dispatch on the 24th, Sent by Leng Bing

A few days ago, news spread in Nantong that a senior military and political official would be arriving, which was a stimulant for the local people, invigorating their hearts and opening up the current situation. Everyone on the streets and in the alleys was asking, "Has that senior official arrived?" or "Has so-and-so official come yet?" Our colleagues, the reporters, became the target of their inquiries. They fully believed that news reporters had the skill to hear from all directions, and that some clues could be discovered in this way. But, to our shame, our ears were too short, and we answered them with a "don't know"!

Missing Northern Jiangsu, Taking Time to Swiftly Arrive

Lieutenant Colonel Deng Ke's arrival in Tong by plane made everyone nervous again, thinking that "this time it must be a senior military and political official." But the newspaper reports said "the person who came is not he," which was another disappointment. The Huaiyin team flew to Huaiyin the next day and went to Xuzhou.

Finally, the rumors were confirmed, and there was more than one senior official arriving—Wang Maogong, the Chairman in charge of the entire province, and Commander Tang, who established outstanding merits during the War of Resistance and is now stationed in the Beijing-Shanghai area. They have not forgotten Northern Jiangsu, and they are always thinking of the suffering compatriots of Northern Jiangsu in deep water and fire. Therefore, despite being caught up in military and political affairs, they took time to come to this ancient city—Nantong. This is even more precious news,

A piece of news that is enough to invigorate people's hearts!

The reporters received the good news the night before last that General Tang and Chairman Wang would arrive in Tong by special ship from Cheng. Yesterday (the 23rd), we received a notice from the relevant departments to attend the welcome meeting for all sectors of society at the Gengsu Theater at 10:00 AM. For the sake of our duties, we arrived at the venue very early.

Holding a Forum, Comforting and Encouraging

General Tang Enbo and Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong landed at Ren Gang at 6:00 PM on the evening of the day before yesterday (the 22nd) on the Minquan warship from Cheng. All stores, residents, and households in the city were decorated with bright and brilliant national flags to show their welcome. The roads were heavily guarded, and the order was good. Liu Division Commander of the 105th Division, Commissioner Xu, County Magistrate Yang, Secretary-General Ji, Chairman Gu of the Journalists Association, and Chairman Qian of the Business Consolidation Committee all rushed to the port to greet them. The two military and political leaders took a special car to Taowu Road Tao Zhi Hua Hall for a brief rest, then met with local government leaders to listen to work reports. At 8:00 AM on the 23rd, a forum was held at the headquarters of the 105th Division. First, Commander Tang and Chairman Wang gave speeches of comfort and encouragement, followed by Chairman Qian of the Business Consolidation Committee and Wang Yundian, the magistrate of Rugao County, who presented their opinions. The meeting then adjourned, and they went together to the welcome meeting for all sectors of the county at the Gengsu Theater. The audience upstairs and downstairs was packed, which can be called an unprecedented scene. At 10:00 AM, the military band played loudly in the venue, and Commander Tang and Chairman Wang arrived one after another. Mr. Tang was wearing a yellow military uniform, and Chairman Wang was wearing a dark blue Zhongshan suit. Both were energetic and dignified. In the solemn welcoming procession of the crowd, they stepped onto the stage, and the two officials humbly smiled and returned the salute.

Complete Construction, Absolutely No More Fighting

After Commissioner Xu delivered the opening remarks, Commander Tang was first invited to give a speech. The commander began to speak amidst enthusiastic applause. His attitude was so calm and excited, and his words were so passionate and clear that every sentence and every word strongly struck everyone's heart. He first explained that the victory of the War of Resistance was obtained through arduous struggle, and it was an even more glorious thing to defeat the well-prepared Japanese invaders with a backward China. The current unreasonable phenomena and sufferings are inevitable phenomena after the war and are expected. We can only grit our teeth and continue to work hard to complete the construction. Therefore, in this period, we must not be pessimistic or discouraged, let alone waver. He clearly indicated our future goals. In the future, fighting is not a solution to any problems, let alone fighting again. Therefore, the solution is not "fighting" but "struggling," and we must fight for what is right. Furthermore, in the future, we should follow the instructions of the Chairman and the national policies of the country, under the principle of the nation first and the nation supreme, and move towards the road of peace and national construction. Because we have not only won the victory but also won the peace. A burst of loud applause erupted from the crowd. Finally, he further pointed out the importance of Nantong's economy, culture, and industry in Jiangsu and the whole country. To revitalize Nantong, the first thing to do is to consolidate public security, and then everything else will be possible. He sincerely, solemnly, and responsibly stated this.

Anyone Who Disrupts Public Security Will Be Severely Punished

When Commander Tang gave his speech, he was full of vigor, his voice was loud, and his intonation was moving. His gestures and actions showed his skill. When he said, "No matter who disrupts the public security of Nantong, they will be severely punished, severely punished..." he especially showed the brave and decisive demeanor of a tiger general.

Finally, he had great hopes for Nantong and hoped that the Party, government, military, and groups would work together to build a new Nantong and a new China. There was another thunderous applause. This is exactly what we urgently need at present.

Recognize the Times, Place High Hopes on Young People

Next, Chairman Wang began to speak: He instructed us to recognize the times, and that China today is in a great era of moving from destruction to construction and from war to peace. If anyone tries to destroy it, they are the national traitors and the public enemies of the masses. The government has not forgotten to save the compatriots of Northern Jiangsu and announced the provincial government's policy: to restore order, stabilize people's livelihood, establish autonomous institutions according to the procedures of national construction. Genuine public opinion is created by genuine organs of public opinion, which is the genuine democracy of the Three People's Principles. Finally, he placed his most earnest hopes on the next generation of young students who will bear the burden of building a new China. Because they are the new institutions, the new cells, and the grassroots of the next generation, their responsibility is heavy. They should study with peace of mind, believe in the Three People's Principles, promote the Three People's Principles, and practice the Three People's Principles, and then they can become new cadres, successors of the next generation, and masters of Jiangsu Province. Teachers of all schools must have spirit, be diligent and thrifty, endure hardships, and be confident, and not lose their ambition due to lack of materials.

After the Meeting, They Visited and Boarded Ships Southward

Then, Commissioner Xu expressed his warm regards to the commander and Chairman on behalf of all the people, and everyone stood up and bowed three times. Because of the time, Commander Tang was anxious to return to Wuxi, and the meeting was declared over in a warm and exciting atmosphere.

After the meeting, Commander Tang took a special car with Division Commander Liu, Deputy Division Commander Yu, and others to visit the Dasheng Yarn Factory in Tangzha, accompanied by Mr. Wu [name unclear] who took them on a tour of the workshop. The reporter followed them. At 1:30 PM, Commander Tang, in a hurry to return to defense, turned to Tianshenggang, boarded a speedboat, and sailed to the Renjiagang warship. After the meeting, Chairman Wang, accompanied by Commissioner Xu, County Magistrate Yang, and others, went to the Commissioner's Office, the County Government, the County Health Center, the County Party Headquarters, the Bus Station, and other agencies for a week-long inspection before taking a special car to Renjiagang to board the ship southward.

### A Pilgrimage to the Highest Institution of Learning on Treasure Island, The Cradle of Taiwan's Medical Community

— Dispatch from Taiwan on the 28th, Sent by Our Correspondent Mu Yun

As the highest institution of higher education in Taiwan, National Taiwan University has a history of eighteen years. It is not only a precious land on the beautiful treasure island, but also occupies a lofty and superior position in the academic world of the Far East. The reporter arrived at the University Headquarters in Suido-cho on a sunny morning and made a general tour.

The predecessor of National Taiwan University was Taipei Imperial University. Eighteen years ago, it only had the Faculty of Science and Agriculture and the Faculty of Arts and Politics. The Faculty of Medicine was established ten years ago, and the Faculty of Engineering was added one year ago. After the takeover, except for the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Law, which will be established in the autumn, all other faculties have been put on the right track.

A Deep Sense of Wilderness

The reporter walked through the stone road under the coconut grove and entered the university, where the ink marks were not yet dry. Rows of red Western-style buildings stood quietly in the smoky grassland. On the old red walls, there were bullet marks everywhere. The broken glass windows have now been replaced with wooden boards, but the glass shards are still deeply planted on the tops of the weeds. The Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Science First Hall, Second Hall... were all quietly staying put. In the agricultural chemical laboratory, a small number of students were doing calm experiments in the messy pile of instruments. On the bulletin board of the Faculty of Engineering, there were notices such as "Students of the academic department from October of the 34th year to March of this year should quickly pay 60 yuan in tuition fees" and "The semester ends on April 20th, the semester exam is from the 22nd to the 28th, and the second semester begins on May 2nd." Sparse students in black uniforms were walking, dragging wooden clogs. A deep sense of wilderness came to my heart, making me realize that the diluted academic atmosphere and the university were still lingering in the wartime stage!

Dr. Tu's Leadership

The leading faculties are not the other faculties, but the Faculty of Medicine, which focuses on both research and practice. The current dean is Dr. Tu Tsung-ming, 57 years old, who is the authoritative leader of the local medical community. He not only leads the students studying at the Faculty of Medicine and the 2,000 alumni of the Faculty of Medicine's predecessor, the Medical Specialty School, who are practicing medicine, but also serves as the person in charge of the Tropical Hospital Research Institute and the First Affiliated Hospital of National Taiwan University (with 100 doctors working for hundreds of patients every day in this hospital covering 15,000 square meters) and the Second Affiliated Hospital (formerly the Japanese Red Cross Hospital). The medical community in Taiwan will not forget Dr. Tu, and in the kind demeanor and calm character of Dr. Tu, the old professor, one can see the depth of the local people's pursuit of medical and scientific development.

He told the reporter how they tried their best to preserve the crystallization of the Faculty of Medicine and the entire university—machinery, books, medicines, specimens... during the bombing and evacuation period. They evacuated to Daxi, a suburb of Taipei, and continued their research and study in a national school for nearly half a year, and more than 90% of the essence was preserved.

In the past, the proportion of local students in the entire university was very small, but there were more local people studying medicine. Today, the Japanese students have scattered with their parents, and now all are local and a few other provincial students, totaling 200 people. Dr. Tu is now busy arranging for the local young students who have been sent back from Tokyo to continue their studies. He said with great interest that the Japanese professors who were requisitioned are still retained, totaling fourteen or five people. The total number of local people serving as professors, associate professors, and lecturers is more than thirty or forty.

In the past, National Taiwan University established graduate schools and research departments, and more than 400 people obtained degrees. With this change in organization, it will give a Bachelor of Medicine degree after graduation, just like universities in the mainland.

Under the practical leadership of Dr. Tu, in addition to the more than 100 students of the Faculty of Medicine, there are three or four hundred workers who are doing in-depth research on medicine. They are the saviors of local patients and will also be the cradle of the medical community in the new China in the future.

Academic Exchange

In medicine, they are generally researching tropical diseases such as malaria, anthropology, parasites, snake venom, Chinese medicine, opium, experimental pathology, nutrition, tuberculosis, and thyroid disease. Many of them are already well-known figures in the province. In the branch of the Tropical Hospital Research Institute in Shilin Town, a suburb of Taipei, they have successfully developed sera, vaccines, and injections for typhoid fever and cholera. In particular, sera can be produced to supply injections for 5 million to 10 million people each year, which means that each of the 6 million people in the province can get two injections a year.

For vaccines, they have invented not only liquid vaccines but also dry vaccines, which can be planted by soaking them in water when they are used. This is a revolution in vaccines.

In the Tropical Hospital, the other main tasks are the Chemical Department for inspecting medicines, the Tropical Disease Department, the Tropical Hygiene Department, the Public Health Department, and the Chinese Medicine Department, which focuses on analyzing and testing the efficacy of Chinese medicine. Regarding Chinese medicine, Dr. Tu stated his opinion, saying, "Originally, the problem of Chinese medicine is the medical theory passed down since the Huangdi Neijing (Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon) and the Taisu Jing (Great Simplicity Canon), but on the one hand, it uses yin and yang, the five elements, and the five movements and six qi to explain abstract philosophical theories, which is also an idealistic theory. But if you study it further, in fact, the treatment methods of Chinese medicine, such as Zhang Zhongjing's 'Treatise on Febrile Diseases,' are actually practical and effective theories and treatment methods. So I very much agree with using Chinese medicine as a reference." Then he said, "Truth is one. If Chinese medicine can avoid going around in circles in a limited circle and go through modern scientific methods and scientific education, it can definitely achieve greater results."

He specifically pointed out that more than two kinds of special medicines have already achieved results. One is to extract an effective ingredient from the snake venom of the Cobra as an analgesic, which obtained a patent four years ago. The other is Kushenzi (Sophora flavescens) as a special medicine for dysentery. This research report will be publicly released at the Taiwan Medical Association on the afternoon of the 20th. Regarding Chinese medicine, they will not only not give up but will strengthen research and prepare to establish a Chinese medicine treatment department, responsible for clearing and promoting the heavy responsibility of Chinese medicine.

Dr. Tu solemnly explained the four missions of the Faculty of Medicine of National Taiwan University: (1) To select local doctors and specialized talents as much as possible to engage in health work in the mainland; (2) To welcome doctors and scholars from the mainland to come to the province for research; (3) To transport research products to the mainland; (4) To organize purely academic research associations with specialized scholars in the mainland.

This academic exchange will affect the medical community in the mainland and will further enhance the position of the Faculty of Medicine of National Taiwan University. It is firmly believed that with Dr. Tu's perseverance and spirit, success can be expected.

Searching for American Pilot Graves in Taiwan

Members of two Chinese battlefield patrol teams are searching in Taipei for the graves of American pilots who were shot down during air raids. The headquarters of the U.S. military patrol team is located in Nanjing, and ten teams are scattered throughout China, Vietnam, and neighboring islands to thoroughly investigate the cause of death and burial sites of more than 700 American soldiers who were registered as missing in action with the U.S. Department of the Army.

### Housing Crisis in Hangzhou

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng Reporting from Hangzhou, 29th of this Month

Hangzhou rioted against rice shops due to the rice shortage. But now, Hangzhou is also facing a housing crisis. Who will they riot against this time?

An individual working in the provincial government told the reporter, "In Hangzhou, finding a wife is easier than finding a house." Every day, as we walk the streets or sit in tea houses and hotels, we see people looking for houses or discussing housing matters. This isn't just among those from other provinces, but also many Hangzhou locals; not only those without houses but also those who already own them.

Before the war, Hangzhou's population peaked at 788,000. There are no accurate statistics now, but it is said to be only over 400,000, a decrease of 300,000. Very few houses in downtown Hangzhou were destroyed; perhaps only one-twentieth were damaged. But the population has decreased by far more than one-twentieth. Even if many houses in Nanxing Bridge and the gate area were destroyed, causing the population to concentrate in the city center, old-timers in Hangzhou say that the population of Nanxing Bridge and the gate area wouldn't exceed 100,000, and that rough estimate of Hangzhou's population of over 400,000 already includes them.

We can say this: Hangzhou does not really have a housing shortage. Even if there aren't enough houses, it shouldn't be this severe. So where is Hangzhou's housing shortage coming from? An old Hangzhou resident said, "There are empty houses in Hangzhou, but people would rather leave them empty than rent them out!"

Before the war, it was easy to find houses in Hangzhou. Many stone-framed doors had "For Rent" signs posted. During the war, Hangzhou was occupied, and the enemy and puppet regime forcibly seized many houses, using some as warehouses to store goods and others as residences for enemy and puppet officials. After the war, our troops came to take over, driving out all the Japanese, Japanese soldiers, puppet soldiers, and puppet officials living in civilian houses. They were replaced by many dependents. Later, the troops left, but the dependents didn't. Some even had one or two people living in a large house. Some landlords made agreements with others, but when the tenants came to move in, they were shouted out and got nowhere. Some tenants moved their furniture into the house and tried to reason with the people living inside, but the unwelcome occupants threw the furniture into the street. They wanted to reason with them, but the other party was wearing disheveled military uniforms, and the insignias were unclear. They spoke more forcefully than the landlord and were more fierce. The house seemed to be theirs.

Without a solution, they asked some other respectable people to negotiate. The people living in the house then said, "I don't like this house at all. I'm going to move, but houses outside require gold bars, 'digging fees,' and rental deposits. How can we 'poor civil servants' afford to rent them? I'm looking for a house now, and I'll move as soon as I find one." They were truly confident and righteous.
"When will you move?"
"That depends on when I find a house." They still got nowhere. Some people said that the only way to get a house is to use "power." For example, if a high-ranking official wants a house, then a low-ranking official has to try his best. How does the low-ranking official try his best? He still has to ask the people for it. When the people have no choice, they have to ask the low-ranking official to ask the high-ranking official to plead on their behalf and send gifts. This is the bureaucratic way of handling housing disputes. There are simply too many such examples.

Another type of house is one where the owner went to the interior with the war of resistance and entrusted the house to a caretaker. Over the past seven or eight years, the caretaker has become the master. He lives in the best house, takes deposit fees, and takes "digging fees." When the owner comes back and wants to live in the house, he says that the house has already been rented out to others. There are quite a few examples like this.

There are also house brokers who specialize in house trading. After they find out about a house, they solicit people who want to rent it. The tenants pay a high price to "dig" and a high price for a deposit. These brokers profit from it.

The people of Hangzhou have a reputation for being "iron heads." They can smash rice shops out of anger, but they cannot smash the houses of those who live in them unreasonably out of anger. Although rice is a matter of food, which is of utmost importance to the masses, housing is a matter of living, which is also of concern to the masses. However, houses are one by one, building by building. People who forcibly occupy houses can only be defeated one by one.

"Clothing, food, housing, transportation" are the four basic needs. We want the government to solve these four basic needs for the people with rice. But does the government have a solution? More than 400,000 citizens of Hangzhou are watching with wide eyes!

### Peiping Union Medical College Seeks to Reopen as Soon as Possible

[United Press, New York, 2nd] A spokesman for the China Medical Board announced today that the Peiping Union Medical College, which was occupied by the Japanese army in 1941, has now been recovered and efforts are being made to reopen it as soon as possible. However, it is unlikely that it will be fully restored to its original state this year. The Rockefeller Foundation, which founded the Peiping Union Medical College, has reportedly held several meetings to prepare for the reopening of the school. Discussions have included the difficulty in obtaining important new equipment and securing pre-arranged transportation. Post-war surveys show that most of the school buildings are intact, but much of the laboratory and other equipment is missing or severely damaged. The Japanese used the school as a hospital and for experiments. The spokesman said that according to the planned schedule, the school will be expanded as soon as more new equipment is obtained. Before the war, the school primarily admitted Chinese students, with a small number of foreign students admitted only if there were vacancies.

### Japanese Education Must Be Completely Reformed, Advocates Dr. Compton of the United States

[United States Information Service, Pullman, Washington, April 1] Dr. Compton stated in a speech to the Washington State University conference on April 25: I believe that the only answer to the Japanese problem is to improve public education. Dr. Compton, President of Washington State University, was a member of the education mission recently sent by the Army Department to investigate the Japanese school system. Dr. Compton said: Japanese education, from elementary school to university, is concentrated in the center, so it is very easy to be a tool for politicians and warlords. The Japanese themselves call their education "feudal, military, and bureaucratic." We (the US education mission) suggested to General MacArthur and, through MacArthur, to the Japanese government, to completely reform not only the goals of Japanese education, but also the organization and structure of Japanese public education, so that Japanese schools at all levels become tools for democratic education, not tools for war.

### Hunan's Education Recovery

— By Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in Changsha, Gao Yuanli

"In the recovered areas, only Hunan's teachers and staff have not been screened, and only Hunan's students have not been classified. This is truly Hunan's glory, and it proves that Hunan's education indeed has achieved this." Mr. Wang Fengjie, the Director of Hunan's Education Department, said this to reporters. He also emphasized that in the vast occupied territories, only Hunan did not establish a puppet provincial government. The reason for this is that there were quite a few righteous people who valued moral integrity. In the final analysis, it is because decades of education have not wasted effort.

The development of Hunan's education must be attributed to the advocacy of the late President Tan Yan, [庵]. When Tan governed Hunan, not only could applications for registration be approved, but spiritual and material assistance was also provided. Therefore, schools also developed a kind of atmosphere. In twenty years, the number of private secondary schools alone increased to about two hundred. Most high-ranking officials participated in Changsha's education. At that time, Changsha's music never ceased, and on weekends and holidays, the city was full of students in cloth uniforms, which was once praised as a beautiful sight.

In the early years of the War of Resistance, Hunan's education experienced some disturbances. When Wuhan fell, Changsha's situation was precarious. For safety reasons, the school authorities almost entirely moved west, with most concentrating in Anhua Lantian and some moving to Yuanling.

After the Great Fire of Changsha

After the Great Fire of Changsha, the situation gradually stabilized. Schools were able to resume classes, with Yuanling and Lantian as the center, gradually developing. This phase lasted until June of the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944].

During this phase, it can be said that Hunan's education was at its peak. The provincial education authorities made considerable efforts in higher education, secondary education, vocational education, normal education, and national education, achieving the expected success.

In higher education, three provincial-level vocational schools of agriculture, industry, and commerce were established in the 30th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1941]. All campuses were located in Mount Heng. The agricultural school had three departments: agronomy, forestry, and agricultural economics. The industrial school had four departments: hydraulic engineering, architectural engineering, chemical engineering, and mining and metallurgy engineering. The commercial school had three departments: banking and accounting, statistics, and business administration. Although equipment was lacking during the war, classes started under extremely difficult circumstances, which was truly commendable.

In secondary education, the province was divided into school districts starting in the spring of the 30th year. The province was divided into ten school districts according to the administrative inspectorates, with the principle that each district would have a provincial-level secondary school, normal school, and vocational school. This plan was not only completed but also exceeded in a short period of time. By the first semester of the 33rd year, the total number of secondary school students in the province was 200,000.

In national education, development has been quite rapid since the 29th year. By the first semester of the 33rd year, out of the province's 1,600 townships, over 1,500 townships had established township-level central national schools, with 97 branch schools. Out of the province's 21,290 *bao*, over 20,300 *bao* had established *bao*-level national schools, with over 4,800 branch schools. Adding the 6,000+ private primary schools and 19 provincial primary schools, there were a total of over 26,300 schools, with 2,659,000 children enrolled.

The above three figures may reveal the progress of Hunan's educational development. In particular, the development of primary and secondary schools is even more astonishing. The reason for this is that after the outbreak of the war, the rural areas were quite prosperous, and food prices rose. Even families with modest means had the surplus to allow their children to attend school. (To be continued)

Lianghua Defeated

After the break, Lianghua's lineup slightly improved. The battle was then [reversed] by the Giant team. Shen Yu replaced Ge Ke, making the score 39 to 41, a difference of two points, with some hope. Unfortunately, Guo Jie was ejected after committing five fouls. Zhuo Guorong was [hurriedly] entered into the match, but there were only two minutes left before the end of the game.

### Overnight Positions Difficult to Arrange; Gold and Cash Continue to Fall; Allotment Price Also Reduced to 1.65 Million

Yesterday, the [Illegible] was tight on off-market positions, and there were many bounced checks. Both the gold and securities dealers were seeking to make up overnight positions. Physical goods continued to be sold off. To the point that those who registered with the Bank of China for allotment, except for the jewelers, were almost zero. The market price, under conditions of oversupply, gradually went downstream from 1.73 million. After 10 o'clock, it hovered around 1.65 million. The Bank of China allotted to registrants at a price of 1.65 million. The industry was too busy taking care of themselves, and very few registered, only 82 individuals, mostly jewelers. Speculators were scrambling for funds. Physical goods were being sold off relentlessly. At noon, it had approached 1.6 million. In the afternoon, funds were slightly easier, and there was a slight rise. As a result, the closing price fell another 50,000 compared to the previous closing. Ornaments closed at 173,000, silver at 1,700, and silver dollars were stable. The unofficial interest rate was unusually tight in the morning, with the unofficial interest rate at over 22%, but turned slightly easier in the afternoon, with interest rates from 18% to 20%. Funds for cigarettes and miscellaneous lines of work were still tight. Because of the severe drop in gold prices, the overall situation has changed. Although the source of cash will inevitably be greatly affected in the future, the authorities' measures for management will definitely be even stricter. Holders are also mostly closing out positions. In addition, the Bank of China, due to the booming gold rush, has had to make it extra convenient for those applying for foreign exchange. Importers are satisfied with the amount they receive, so there is no need to search for expensive US dollars. Yesterday, US dollars became even more deserted, gradually becoming oversupplied from 2,400 yuan, falling to below 2,230 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it was stable. As a result, it fell another 130 yuan compared to the previous close. People are affected by the US's increase in gold and silver prices, and are once again favoring cash. The spread for hedging against gold has widened to around 730 yuan. Hong Kong dollars also fell 20 yuan, Hong Kong exchange rate was 440 yuan, Rupee was 50 yuan, the US exchange rate was still stable, and the settlement of accounts was quiet.

At noon, it had fallen to around 5,150 yuan, and then slightly rebounded. The afternoon closing price hovered around 5,350 yuan. The underlying trend still favored sellers, falling 650 yuan compared to the previous close. Bonds A, B, and D fell 700 yuan each, and Bond E fell 800 yuan.

Sesame seeds of medium and low quality also fell 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Corn fell another 1,000 yuan. The oil market continued to decline due to the continued arrival of large quantities from Qingdao. It gradually went downstream, falling another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. According to the rice market information, yesterday, the city received over 3,000 *shi* of seven types of rice, including polished *jeng*.

### Yarn Market Flat and Weak; Cotton Transactions Still Smooth

Yesterday, the yarn market lacked the strength to rise. In the early morning, it still felt firm, but then some dealers were forced to sell due to financial difficulties, and prices showed signs of collapse. The two *gan* yarns once rose to 1.95 million, but ultimately closed at 1.92 million. The other brands slightly decreased by 5,000 to 30,000 compared to yesterday's market. The 42-count double-ply yarn fell by as much as 80,000 to 90,000, with little trading. The trend seems to be weakening.

Yesterday, the New York US cotton telegraphic report fell 13 to 21 points, with the near-term price at US$27.40, the forward price at US$27.52, and the Mitin spot price at US$28.07. Local spot cotton transactions were still smooth. The privately-owned Shenxin No. 9 Factory uniquely handled 1,200 bales of Mitin and Pengjiapo brands. In addition, the First Factory imported 500 to 600 bales of Indian NT and Taicang cotton, and the Nantong Dasheng Factory imported Jia Li La, etc. Market prices were similar to before.

### Tight Credit, Position Shortages, and Many Bounced Checks; Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets Sluggish

Chinese stocks yesterday experienced a large shortage of positions at the clearing houses of smaller banks. The unofficial interest rate was raised to over 25% the night before. Many of the checks issued by some clients were bounced. The securities industry was the first to bear the brunt. Yesterday, they scrambled to remedy the situation. Buying interest became even more sluggish, and the overall trend was extremely unfavorable. Besides closing out positions, holders had no other options. This is because the industry is clearly unable to fully handle it and cannot advance funds to customers, which is the reason for this. As a result, the highest opening prices in the morning were 650 yuan for Yong Yarn, 4,850 yuan for Meiya, 83 yuan for Jingfu West, 390 yuan for Xinguang, and 323 yuan for Qinyu, and they gradually fell. Near noon, it was even more [illegible], almost all closing at low prices. The afternoon closing was down about 5% for each of the five [illegible] compared to the previous close. The less popular stocks each experienced small declines. The overall market was slightly higher. Foreign stocks were also caught in the [illegible] vortex. Many were selling off. Yisha repeatedly fell from 15,600 yuan and closed near noon at a similar price. The less popular stocks showed signs of having supply without demand. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha fell 1,000 yuan, steel fell 10%, and the rest fell about 5%.

### Reduced Sales of Woolens

The business of woolen merchants has been reduced lately. This is because buyers of dark-colored autumn and winter woolens are waiting for overseas imports to arrive, so neither local nor out-of-town dealers are interested. In addition, women's cheongsam materials are also falling in popularity because of the hot weather. The only items with some transactions are seasonal summer goods such as gauze, calico, white straight tributes, vanilla, white broadcloth, feather yarn, pyroxylin, fanliskag, etc. However, due to the extremely [illegible] environment, the trading power is inferior to that of previous years. Apart from [illegible], there are very few entrepreneurs in the same industry.

### Artificial Silk Continues to Fall Slightly

Yesterday, the artificial silk market saw 120-count Tian [Illegible] open at 1.56 million yuan and close at 1.52 million yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to trade at the level of 1.51 million to 1.52 million yuan, falling 50,000 yuan short of the previous day's price. 150-count shiny Peacock and Earth brands traded at 1.52 million yuan. Dachang offered 2.5 million yuan for 81-minute evenness factory silk and foreign goods, but no transaction was made. Yesterday, user silk was bid up by about 50,000 yuan, but the price of Zijing did not rise or fall, and there were no transactions. Silk goods Meiya bedspreads continued to fall sharply. Yesterday morning, the market closed at 1.13 million yuan. In the afternoon, the crepe trade association market traded at 1.065 million yuan, falling 150,000 yuan on the day. The Dachen Pattern [Illegible] closed at 3,880 yuan in the morning and traded at 3,750 yuan in the afternoon.

### Sugar Market Weak

Yesterday, the sugar market was weak due to watching and waiting for actual sales and tight credit. The trend was even weaker, and it continued to decline. The public association [Illegible] sugar fell from an initial 62,750 yuan to 62,000 yuan to 61,000 yuan, and finally to 60,500 yuan to 60,000 yuan, falling 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Raw sugar was 58,000 yuan. The three-and-a-half early white sugar was initially 68,000 yuan and later 65,000 yuan. Only 20,000 bags of three-and-a-half early white sugar were sold by tender at 65,000 yuan and 50 bags of raw sugar at 54,000 yuan.

### Dye Orders Busy

Because textile factories' desire for dyes allocated by the Deutsche Fuel Company was not [Illegible], they ordered the goods from major American trading houses. It is reported that although Hengxin Trading House accepts orders from various dyeing and weaving factories, it is unable to supply them in large quantities and distributes them on a pro rata basis. The Mayhe Trading House also offers preferential terms of promissory notes, so users are even more eager. (Wu)

### Zhuji Roasted Green Tea on the Market

Roasted green tea has considerable consumption at home and abroad over the years after being roasted. The new goods from Lvxing Zhuji have recently appeared on the market. However, because the cost is huge, it is said that the opening price is 70,000 yuan per *dan*. As for other varieties, the demand from Suzhou and Tianjin is extremely strong. People frequently [Illegible] strengthen, and the market is moving forward. In addition to the continued rise in the price of some kinds of tea, the rest have a stable base. The special tribute green tea, which is most appreciated by European and American countries, is still being absorbed by traders due to the fact that the selling price is still palatable, so they continue to export it.

### US Wheat and Lumber Imports Again in Large Quantities

[Reported by this newspaper] The Fumi Steamship Company's Houston Vero Tel brought 2.5 million feet of lumber from Seattle. In addition, the Pillingham Victory also brought more than 8,000 tons of wheat from Seattle. It arrived at Wusong Port the day before yesterday. Because the Huangpu River lacks wharf pontoons, it is anchored outside the port.

### Commercial Bank Deposits in Four Major Cities in April

The Central Bank's Financial Inspection Department has detailed monthly statistics on the total number of commercial bank deposits in this city and other major cities at the end of each month. And stipulates that each commercial bank must pay a deposit reserve to the Central Bank, the amount of which accounts for 20% of the total deposit. The deposits of each region in April are listed below:

City Name Total Deposits

Shanghai 55,329,857,264

Qingdao 1,170,775,458

Tianjin 13,869,231,012

Nanjing 2,533,017,430

### Few Exports, Uneven Imports

Embroidery Due to domestic goods often being more expensive than foreign goods, recent export trade is extremely light. According to a person in charge of Huili Import and Export Company, the company's export goods were originally mainly lace, hairnets, [Illegible] flower handkerchiefs, etc., but currently the price of American lace is cheaper than domestic lace. Only hairnets and [Illegible] flower handkerchiefs still have a small profit to be made. It is also said that the embroidered handkerchiefs produced in Shantou are the best, but the number of exports has been very small recently, often due to inconvenient transportation and lack of production.

Wool The total number of British wool imported in the first four months of this year has exceeded 110,000 bales. The company's orders account for two-thirds of the total.

Western Medicine Regarding the import of Western medicine, it is said that most of the recent arrivals of Western medicine are vitamin ABC injections from American pharmaceutical companies such as Parker, Mauff, Western Medicine, Standard, Pujiang, International Vitamin, and Norway. However, the quantity of Crane milk powder is also quite large, but one-pound packages are extremely scarce on the market. Although the price has begun to fall back, it is difficult to [Illegible] small because the US dollar fluctuates uncertainly.

Cement Regarding building materials such as cement, 10,000 barrels have arrived recently, but there is no profit to be made. This is because the customs duty has increased from 10% to 30%.

Radio Regarding radios, currently, many import and export companies are accepting orders. However, according to a telegram sent yesterday from the United States, it will be difficult to ship various radios to Shanghai within four months. The company has wired the American manufacturers to instruct them to collect all kinds of radios from various department stores and ship them to Shanghai as soon as possible to meet urgent needs.

### Ministry of Finance Issues Simplified Tax Collection Methods: Category One Business Income Tax and Excess Profits Tax During Extraordinary Periods

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Finance has issued the simplified methods for collecting Business Income Tax and Excess Profits Tax during extraordinary periods. The Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau has also issued a notice to various industries to declare and pay taxes. The original text is as follows:

(1) The collection of Category One Business Income Tax and Excess Profits Tax during extraordinary periods shall be handled in accordance with tax decisions and the simplified methods outlined in these measures.

(2) All taxpayers shall, within one month after the end of each year's settlement, declare their income to the local direct tax authorities in accordance with the law. Each business association shall, within one month of the beginning of each year, report a list of its members to the local direct tax authorities.

(3) The direct tax authorities shall determine the standard taxable net profit margin based on the income statements of individual taxpayers, according to the following methods:

(1) Based on the income statements of taxpayers in each industry, randomly inspect 5% to 20% of the businesses with complete and accurate accounting records to determine the standard gross profit margin on sales, expense ratio, and gross profit margin on capital for each industry, in order to estimate the standard net profit margin on sales and the standard net profit margin on capital for each industry.

(2) For industries without sufficient or incomplete accounting records for random inspection, the standard net profit margin on sales and the standard net profit margin on capital may be estimated by referring to the figures approved in the previous year, taking into account the actual business conditions and price changes of the current year. In areas recovered after the victory against Japan, where there are no approved figures from the previous year, the standard net profit margin may be determined based on the actual business conditions of each industry in the current year, with reference to industries of similar nature.

(3) The standard net profit margins mentioned above may be graded according to the capital and business conditions of manufacturers and distributors.

(4) After the direct tax authorities determine the standard net profit margins for each industry, they shall send them to the review committee for review and approval, along with the supporting documents. Upon receiving the aforementioned documents, the review committee shall convene a meeting and make a decision within ten days.

(5) When the review committee holds a meeting, representatives from the direct tax authorities, local chambers of commerce, and industry associations may attend to present their opinions and provide consultations.

(6) The direct tax authorities shall first calculate the net profit margin on sales and the net profit margin on capital for each industry based on the income statements. If the net profit margin declared by the taxpayers in each industry meets the standards stipulated in Article 3, their declared income shall be used for tax calculation in accordance with the law. If it does not meet the standards, their income shall be calculated according to the standards stipulated in Article 3 for tax calculation in accordance with the law, and no further accounting audits shall be conducted. For businesses that have already been audited, taxes shall be calculated according to the results of the audit in accordance with the law. If any concealment or false reporting is found during the audit, in addition to the penalties stipulated in Article 19 of the Income Tax Law and Article 11 of the Excess Profits Tax Law during extraordinary periods, their income and tax payable shall be determined accordingly.

(7) For those who fail to report within the prescribed time limit, the direct tax authorities may calculate their income based on the standard net profit margin of the respective industry and collect taxes in accordance with the law.

(8) In areas recovered after the victory against Japan, the local direct tax authorities may first determine the various standard net profit margins for each industry in accordance with the provisions of Article 3, and calculate the income of each business and merchant in accordance with the provisions of Articles 6 and 7. Then, add up the income of each industry to determine the total income tax amount for the city or county. Based on this income tax amount and with reference to the budget amount of tax revenue for each city or county, calculate the tax payable by each business and merchant, prepare a list, and send it to the review committee for review and approval within two months in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Articles 4 and 5, along with the supporting documents.

When the review committee reviews and approves the tax amount for each city and county mentioned above, it shall take into account the distribution budget of each city and county. The direct tax authorities shall make a final decision on the tax amount approved by the review committee.

(9) After the direct tax authorities determine the tax amount in accordance with the preceding three articles, they shall immediately issue a tax payment notice and deliver it to the taxpayer, specifying the time limit for payment.

(10) If the business premises of the head office and its branches are not in the same location and the capital has not been divided, their income shall first be calculated separately in accordance with the provisions of Article 6, Paragraph 4, and then the head office shall calculate the tax on the total income in accordance with the law.

(11) Temporary business operations and businesses that have ceased operations shall declare their taxes to the direct tax authorities at any time. The direct tax authorities shall investigate and determine the tax amount at any time.

(12) If a taxpayer is dissatisfied with the tax payment notice, they may pay the tax within the prescribed time limit and submit relevant accounting books and documents to apply for a review. Taxes shall be calculated in accordance with the results of the review. However, those who fail to report within the prescribed time limit and those whose taxes are calculated in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 may not apply for a review.

(13) This method shall be implemented upon approval and promulgation by the Executive Yuan.

Spring and Autumn

### The Inevitable White Man

— (Continued from Last Issue) Original by Jack London, Translated by Lu Mang

"What Saxe Daofu was fortunate in was that the black men only shot accurately at close range. They did not put their guns to their shoulders. They waited until they were close to a person, and then they put their guns on their hips and fired. When his rifle got too hot, Saxe Daofu switched to another one. That's why he brought two rifles with him.

"What was astonishing was the speed of his shooting. Also, he never missed. If there was anything inevitable, that was it. What made the massacre so horrifying was the speed of his shooting. The black men had no time to think. When they were about to think, they all rushed to one side of the boat, naturally capsizing the canoe. Saxe Daofu never stopped. The water was full of black men, still bang, bang, bang, he shot his bullets into their bodies. Not a single one missed, I could clearly hear every bullet penetrate into the flesh with a thud.

"The black men scattered and swam towards the shore. The water was a layer of trembling heads. I stood up, as if in a dream, and watched all this - the trembling heads and the heads that stopped trembling. A few distant shots are very boastful. Only one person reached the shore, but just as he stood up to step onto the shore, Saxe Daofu hit him. It was beautiful. And when two black men rushed over to drag him out of the water, Saxe Daofu also hit them.

"I thought everything was over, but just then I heard the sound of a rifle again. A black man crawled out of the entrance to the main cabin, ran towards the railing, and fell halfway. The main cabin was packed full of them. I counted twenty. They came up one at a time and rushed towards the railing. But they never got there. This reminded me of skeet shooting. A black body would crawl out of the entrance to the main cabin, Saxe Daofu's rifle would bang, and the black body would fall down. Naturally, those below didn't know what was happening on deck, so they continued to crawl out until the last one was shot dead.

"Saxe Daofu waited a moment, seeing that there were definitely none left, before descending to the deck. He and I were the only two left of the entire crew of the Duchess, I was too badly injured to move, and he was now useless after shooting. At my direction, he washed the wound on my head and sewed it up. A large gulp of whiskey made me stand up resolutely. There was nothing else to do. Everyone else was dead. Saxe Daofu tried to raise the sail, he pulled, and I held the rope roll. He had become a stupid, ignorant sailor again. He was worth less than a penny, and when I fainted, it seemed like we were all done for.

"When I woke up, Saxe Daofu was sitting on the railing, at a loss, waiting, asking me what he should do. I told him to check the injured to see if there were any who could crawl. He gathered six together. One, I remember, had broken a leg; but Saxe Daofu said his arms were still good. I was lying in the shade, chasing away flies, and directing how to bandage, while Saxe Daofu was in charge of his group of treated. If he hadn't found the hoisting rope and raised those poor black men onto every rope of the lanyard platform, I would have been endlessly grateful. One of them came off the rope halfway up and fell dead on the deck; but Saxe Daofu forced the others to hold on to their positions. When the foresail and mainsail were raised, I told him to cut the rope tying the anchor and let the ship untie. I got myself to the stern helm and planned to steer her forward. I couldn't guess how he did it, not only did he not cut the rope, but he lowered the second anchor, making us doubly anchored.

"Finally, he managed to cut both ropes, raised the jib and headsail, and the Duchess was on her way. Our deck was truly a spectacle. Dead and dying black men were everywhere, several of them shot in the most unimaginable places. I called Saxe Daofu and his cemetery group to lift them up and throw them off the side of the ship, the dying and the dead. The sharks had a feast that day. Naturally, our four murdered Yong sailors were treated the same way. However, we put their heads in a sack, and put in some heavy things, so that they would not drift to the shore. And fall into the hands of the black men.

"I decided to use our five prisoners as sailors, but they decided the opposite. They waited for their chance and jumped off the boat. Saxe Daofu hit two in mid-air with his pistol, and there were three more, if I hadn't stopped him, he would have already killed them in the water. I was a little tired of the slaughter, you understand, and, also, they were helping to get the boat out. But this kindness was in vain, because the sharks swallowed all three of them.』

『We couldn't see land, but I had a bit of a fever in my head. Anyway, the Duchess sailed for three weeks before I got myself up, and then we made her slowly sail to Choudni. Anyway, those Malu black men learned a permanent lesson, that there is no good in fooling a white man. In this matter, Saxe Daofu was really inevitable.』

Charlie Roberts blew a long whistle and then said:

"Well, I should say so. But what about Saxe Daofu?"

"He joined the sealing ships and became a famous expert. For six years he had a high reputation in the shipping industry in the two cities of Victoria and San Francisco. In the seventh year, his schooner was captured by a Russian cruiser in the Bering Sea, and all the crew, according to popular legend, were imprisoned in the Siberian salt mines. At least I have never heard of him since."

"Cultivating the world," Roberts murmured. "Cultivating the world. Well, this is for them. Someone has to do it this way, cultivating the world, I mean."

Captain Woodward touches the crisscrossing scars on his bald head.

"I have done my part," he said. "Forty years to now. This will be my last voyage. Then I'm going to go home and settle down."

"I'll bet you this wine you won't," Roberts challenges. "You'll die in labor, not at home."

Captain Woodward accepted the bet immediately, but, personally, I think Charlie Roberts will win it.

### Save the Elderly

— Zhong Yuan

Someone knocked lightly on our door, (opening it) to see that it was the old gatekeeper from a certain organization next door. He saw my father and said with a worried face, "Sir, please help me, my job is gone!" Father asked him how he lost it, and he said, "They嫌 me for being old and not doing things nimbly, so they don't want me anymore!"

My friend Zhang Jun occasionally came to chat, talking about the recent situation of the hospital he served in, saying that recently the hospital laid off a group of employees over the age of sixty, because these older people are not only physically weakened, but their minds and thoughts are also mostly outdated and unsuitable for work.

A teacher who had been unemployed for a long time entrusted me to ask a certain principal to intercede, hoping to arrange a position for him. At first, the principal agreed readily, but when he asked the teacher's age, he immediately shook his head and said, "Too old, not popular!"

"Old pearls are worthless," what pitiful old people!

We often hear the calls to "save the children" and "save the next generation." That's right, children are the masters of the country's future, and the next generation is the lifeline of society. They should be valued and protected with all our strength. However, the "previous generation" who once were the masters of the country and the lifeline of society are now abandoned by everyone because they are old and useless.

Rather than saying it's a social problem, it's more of a conscience problem, isn't it?

Save the elderly!

### A Loving Couple (32)

— Zhao Qingge

Among the children, only Li Yun still retains her true and simple nature. Although she is more lonely than her companions, in her impression, her father never gave her any education, and her mother never gave her any love! She is like a small grass growing in the natural wilderness, she has never enjoyed any artificial grace. So when her parents left her and she was taken in by Mrs. Mo, she regarded Mrs. Mo as her biological mother, and she was very calm and accustomed to this new environment. Especially with Yu Hua as a companion, she felt great happiness. She did not miss her parents at all, and her feelings for her parents were very weak. She seemed to have no feelings; if she did, they were extremely floating and scattered; therefore, she had much less trouble!

Mrs. Mo's ability to manage the family is quite large. In the past six months, she has lived very comfortably. Mr. Mo's funeral was naturally handled hastily, so not only did it not cost Mrs. Mo any money, but Mr. Mo's death also saved Mrs. Mo a sum of regular food and drink expenses.

In the first six months, Mrs. Mo was busy with housework and didn't feel lonely. After six months, Mrs. Mo's housework gradually came to an end, and she gradually felt bored. Although she often went to play mahjong with her neighbors to pass the time, this could not occupy all of her time after all. When she was free, she would become impatient and restless. The Jingzhou Renewal Grand Stage came to another troupe of Beijing opera, but Mrs. Weng Er was not here, and she was too lazy to go and see it alone. For this reason, she had been missing Mrs. Weng Er especially recently. After Mrs. Weng Er arrived in Beijing, she had sent her a letter of greetings. She also sent Mrs. Weng Er a letter in return, reporting two funerals in the letter: one was Mr. Weng's suicide, and the other was Mr. Mo's death from illness. This letter was written by Bao Ling. Mrs. Mo said a sentence, and Bao Ling wrote it down. Mrs. Mo told Bao Ling to tell Mrs. Weng Er that "their old sisters are really in the same boat. They left Beijing at the beginning in the same situation; later, they lived in Jingzhou in the same situation; now their husbands have died, and they have become the same again." Speaking of this, Mrs. Mo saw that Bao Ling was a little unhappy, so she had to stop. At the same time, she was thinking in her heart: "Mrs. Weng Er has a new husband again, she should be happier than before. But I have neither an old husband nor a new husband, and I am not as good as before." A burst of sadness, and she couldn't help sighing. Bao Ling wrote the letter, but in fact he had discounted Mrs. Mo's words and did not write them completely according to Mrs. Mo's meaning. But when Mrs. Mo asked him to read it, Bao Ling still recited it to her word for word as Mrs. Mo had originally said. Mrs. Mo was satisfied and paid the postage.

### Chao Yang Drought and Famine - Please Fellow Villagers Quickly Seek Relief

— Xiao Kangshi

Yesterday, I met my friend Mr. Lin Wenyi, who talked about his hometown (Chao Yang) Since the beginning of spring, it has not rained, and early rice cannot be planted. There is a panic over the rice and grain supply, and the southern region, with transportation not yet recovered, rice sources have dried up. As a result, the price of rice half a month ago required about eight thousand yuan per bushel, and the prices of other goods also soared. In total, Chao Yang County has eight hundred villages, people are starving to death, and there are even cases of selling their children for rice and abandoning daughters in the suburbs. The tragedy is indescribable! Thinking that Shanghai still has a source of relief goods from the Allied countries, the price of rice and other things continues to jump wildly. In addition, Chao Yang is located in a remote rural area, with no relief goods to aid them. The days ahead are long, and the danger is even greater. There are many wealthy Chaozhou people in Shanghai who should think of their homeland and provide monetary and material relief, so as not to expand the disaster. Then, those who have survived the robbery will no longer be devoured by drought. It is also a duty that mankind should fulfill, not to mention the friendship with our hometown? Mr. Lin's words were full of grief, and as a person of humble status with limited influence, he tearfully asked the writer to publish an article in the Shen Bao, to cry out for help, daring to beg for relief for the entire county of Chao Yang. I hope that fellow villagers in Shanghai will quickly rise up to provide relief to their hometown, then I will be endlessly thankful.

### Nursing Home Being Sold - Elderly Residents Rise Up in Resistance

Please All Circles Provide Righteous Assistance

All the elderly residents of the Shanghai Bao'an Nursing Home sent a letter yesterday asking for justice and assistance, expressing their sincere feelings. Now, a copy of the letter to people from all walks of life: "Dear sirs: We are a group of old and pitiful people. We are currently living in the Shanghai Bao'an Nursing Home to eke out our remaining years. We heard the news last year after the victory of the War of Resistance, and we were especially pleased, fully expecting that our future lives would be stable. Unexpectedly, on March 13, Director Wu Fansun of this home, holding an official document from the Shanghai Charity Group, said: 'We have received orders from the Shanghai Charity Group to increase profits and have leased all the buildings of this home to the Apecy Candy Factory, and the old residents of this home must be moved to Nanshi this month to merge with the Relief Home.' After all the old residents gathered to discuss, they decided that they did not want to move elsewhere, because the buildings here were originally the former Qiliu Public Office, and later were taken over by the Charity Group, which was renamed the Shanghai Charity Hospital, and later the Shanghai Bao'an Nursing Home Second Branch. Because there was another Bao'an Nursing Home on Nanshi Station Road, after the War of Resistance, the South Branch moved to the Second Branch, and then merged into one in the 27th year and has continued to this day. Now the Charity Group is using the excuse of increasing profits to arbitrarily sell the buildings to others, and the original name of the Bao'an Nursing Home is being cancelled. The lives of all the old residents will be unknown in the future. Therefore, we have risen up in opposition, for the sake of maintaining all the buildings, for the sake of maintaining the lives of the old residents, and we especially appeal to people from all walks of life to provide righteous assistance. Respectfully, all the old residents of the Shanghai Bao'an Nursing Home."

Donations Delivered for Triplets

Since this newspaper published the story of a poor woman giving birth to triplets, people from all walks of life have been concerned and have donated a total of 140,900 yuan. This column sent someone to transfer the funds yesterday. The receipt is recorded below: "Now received from the Shen Bao Social Service Office a donation of 140,900 yuan in legal tender for the triplets. Please thank the enthusiastic gentlemen on our behalf. Li Weilun. Cheng Fengnv, April 29"
