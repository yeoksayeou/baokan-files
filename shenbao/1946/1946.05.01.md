### The National Government Officially Orders the Return to Nanjing on May 5th; Sichuan Experimental Zone Actively Plans for All Delegates to Fly to Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] The National Government decrees: The National Government, for the sake of prolonged warfare, moved to Chongqing in November of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937]. For the past eight years, thanks to the loyal and brave soldiers who have advanced dauntlessly and sacrificed heroically, and the officials and civilians nationwide who have endured hardship and struggled resolutely, and with the allied nations advancing together by sea and air and fighting shoulder to shoulder, we have finally brought the enemy to surrender and achieved a great victory. Now that the national territory has been recovered and is completely intact, although the task of resisting the war has been completed, the task of nation-building has become even heavier. The government has decided to triumphantly return to Nanjing on May 5th of this year to fulfill the expectations of the people. However, after the great war, the people's livelihood is difficult, and the national strength is depleted. It is urgently necessary to allow the people to rest and recuperate, restore vitality, work hard to build, and maintain the fruits of the war. It is hoped that the soldiers and civilians across the country will be of one heart and one mind, striving diligently from morning to night, so as not to betray the original aspiration of resisting the war and building the nation, and to realize the mission of the Three Principles of the People. Recalling these eight years, the enemy penetrated deeply, causing significant losses. If it were not for relying on the vast population of our western region and relying on its abundant land resources, how could we have laid the foundation for today's great victory? Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance," is the root of national strength. Chongqing, with its strategic location encompassing the two rivers and controlling the north and south, was able to safely weather the crisis and achieve victory. Its great contribution to the nation will forever shine in the annals of history and never diminish. Now that the return to the capital is imminent and Zhongling [Nanjing] is in sight, recalling the difficulty of recovering the two capitals, we feel even more the importance of the relationship between Bashu [Sichuan]. The government previously issued an order in September of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940] designating Chongqing as the auxiliary capital. Recently, it has designated Sichuan as a national construction experimental zone. Its system should be adopted, and its name and reality should be respected. The Executive Yuan is hereby instructed to supervise the relevant provincial and municipal governments to carefully plan and actively implement it, so that Sichuan will forever be the center of the country's stability and serve as a model for national construction. Great expectations are placed on this. This order.

### Marshall and His Wife Arrive in Nanjing; Said to Be Preparing for a Two- to Three-Month Stay; The Three-Person Group Consultations Will Continue

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] Special Envoy Marshall (see picture), accompanied by his wife, flew to Nanjing on a Constellation aircraft at 10:30 AM on the 30th and arrived at the Dajiaochang Airport at 3:25 PM. Those who came to welcome them included He Yingqin and his wife, Chen Cheng, Jiang Menglin and his wife, and Lieutenant General Gillen. After Marshall and his wife disembarked, Mayor Ma's wife, Shen Huilian, presented flowers to Mrs. Marshall. Marshall greeted the welcoming guests one by one and repeatedly expressed his thanks. He did not express any opinions to the journalists who came to visit, only saying that he would be staying in Nanjing for two to three months and that the US military headquarters would be moved to Nanjing in its entirety. The weather in Nanjing this morning was gloomy and hot. After Marshall's special plane took off from Chongqing, there was a brief shower in Nanjing, but as the Constellation aircraft approached the skies of Nanjing, the rain suddenly stopped and the clouds dissipated, and a moment of sunshine was seen. Marshall's facial expressions after disembarking did not give the journalists any indication, but insightful observers all said that Marshall's dignified and amiable appearance was as always, but tonight, on the soft grass of No. 5 Ninghai Road in quiet Nanjing, the light and peaceful laughter of this peace envoy was faintly heard. Marshall will wait for the Chairman to return to the capital (on May 2nd) before discussing the Northeast issue again. The situation has clearly told the reporters that only in peace and composure can this difficult and long year be spent to reach the shore of peace. Therefore, the National Assembly may have to be postponed beyond "July 7th."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] On the eve of the National Government's promulgation of the order to return to the capital, US Special Envoy Marshal George Marshall flew to the capital for the second time on the 30th. Marshal Marshall and his wife took a C-45 silver giant special plane to Nanjing at 10:30 AM (Chongqing time) on the 30th and arrived safely at Guanghuamen Airport at 3:15 PM. Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin and his wife, Minister Chen Cheng and his wife, Director Zhou Zhirou, Secretary-General Jiang Menglin and his wife, Mayor Ma Chaojun and his wife, US Chargé d'Affaires Smers, and the head of the US Military Advisory Group, General McClure, and his Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Brunco, all went to the airport to welcome them. Marshal Marshall wore a US Army general's uniform, and Mrs. Marshall wore a sky-blue dress and a sky-blue elegant small hat with a black veil. After disembarking, she gladly accepted the flowers presented by Secretary-General Jiang's wife and Mayor Ma's wife and expressed her gratitude. Marshal Marshall shook hands with Commander-in-Chief He, Minister Chen, and others one by one. After the band played the national anthems of the United States and China in succession, Marshal Marshall and his wife, accompanied by He and Chen, reviewed the honor guard and then drove into the city, going directly to the official residence at No. 5 Ninghai Road. Li Zhishan, the director of the Nanjing District of the Battlefield Service Corps, who was responsible for arranging the official residence, told reporters that Marshal Marshall and his wife were satisfied with the arrangement of the official residence. In addition, Marshall's aide-de-camp, Captain Wu Guoqing, said: Marshal Marshall will rest at the official residence tonight. It has not yet been decided whether he will receive reporters in the coming days. However, starting from the 30th, Marshal Marshall's headquarters will be moved here. Colonel Ke Yi, Marshal Marshall's personal chief of staff, also arrived in Nanjing on the same plane.

[French News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] According to sources close to Special Envoy Marshall, although the negotiations on ending the conflict in the Northeast have not yet yielded any concrete results, there is still room for optimism in resolving this issue. The government representative of the military three-person group, General Xu Yongchang, Minister of Military Affairs, and the CCP representative, General Zhou Enlai, will travel together from Chongqing to Nanjing this week. Once they arrive, the negotiations will resume. The loss of life, damage to property, and suffering of the people are increasing every day. We urge you to take immediate measures so that the groups that are ready and waiting for definitive instructions can begin work to restore peace to the people of the Northeast and restore unity to China. Signed by Detreille and others of the 27th group.

### Chairman Chiang Flies to Xi'an; Received National Assembly Delegates Before Leaving Chongqing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Chairman Chiang and his wife left the anti-Japanese headquarters of the past eight years – the auxiliary capital – at 3:00 PM on the 30th on the Meiling aircraft. At 11:00 AM, the Chairman met with National Assembly delegates Wang Zhaorong, Wang Puhan, Shi Tiyuan, and Zeng Jikuan in Chongqing at the Zengjiayan official residence, explaining the process of the government's explicit order to postpone the National Assembly and the government's efforts to seek peace and unity and accommodate the opinions of all parties. He earnestly hoped that this intention would be conveyed to the National Assembly delegates in Chongqing. Minister of Civil Affairs of the National Government Wu Dingchang and Chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee Shao Lizi accompanied the meeting. Hours before leaving Chongqing, the Chairman slowly toured the rooms of the official residence and rested for a moment on the balcony of the Linyuan, seemingly deeply attached to and reluctant to leave this second hometown. At 3:00 PM, the Chairman and his wife drove directly to the airport from Lingyuan, boarded the plane, and flew to Shaanxi. Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the National Government Yu Jishi and more than 20 others accompanied him.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 30th] Chairman Chiang and his wife arrived in Xi'an by special Meiling aircraft at 5:30 PM on the 30th. Yu Jishi and others accompanied them. Bai Chongxi, Hu Zongnan, Zhu Shaozhou, and others were all at the airport to greet them. Chairman Chiang will stay here briefly on his way back to the capital.

### Northeast Group's Work Stalled; US Team Leader Requests Swift Action

[This newspaper, Beiping, 30th] The Northeast Executive Group, which was ordered to depart without a solution to the Northeast problem, is currently frozen in the Northeast. The 27th and 28th groups have already departed for Kaiyuan, but like the 30th reserve group staying in Shenyang, they have nothing to do. The 27th Northeast Central Group, which is responsible for commanding the members, is even more distressed. Recently, Detreille and others, the US team leader of the group, sent a letter to General Bailud, the US Chief of Staff of the Executive Department, requesting instructions for their work and expressing their inner pain. The original letter is recorded below: Chief Bailud, We, the government, CCP, and US representatives of the 27th group in the nine northeastern provinces, believe that due to our responsibility to China, we must report to the responsible authorities that we urgently need to obtain a clear explanation and order, so that the groups in the nine northeastern provinces can begin constructive work. While this issue is unresolved, the war is underway in various parts of this area and is becoming increasingly fierce. There has already been much bloodshed among the Chinese people, and unnecessary destruction of houses and equipment is continuing. Therefore, the people of Jiudong Province are suffering and may continue to suffer for many years to come. With each day of delay, the loss of life, damage to property, and suffering of the people will increase. We urge you to take immediate measures so that the groups that are ready and waiting for definitive instructions can begin work to restore peace to the people of the Northeast and restore unity to China. Signed by Detreille and others of the 27th group.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] After learning about the increase in train fares, the councilors of the Beijing-Linqing Council generally believed that the price increase of state-owned enterprises would only cause prices to rise further and affect people's livelihood.

[United Press, Beiping, 29th] News reports from Pan Yang state: The Communist Party recently revealed that 26 government military and political officials have been captured in Changchun, including Chen Jiazhen, the major general of the Changchun Garrison Command.

### National Army Enters the Urban Area of Sipingjie; Fierce Fighting South of Gongzhuling; Soviet Troops Have Not Withdrawn from the Border Cities of the Northeast

[This newspaper, Beiping, 30th] The tug-of-war in New Sipingjie is still ongoing. Official sources received information last night that the National Army had occupied the urban area of New Sipingjie on the 29th, and the vanguard troops had reached south of Gongzhuling and were engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist troops. Official sources explained that the slow progress of the National Army going north was due to the continuous reinforcements from the Communist troops in northern Manchuria going south. At the most tense moment of the war, a brigade was moving south almost every day. Today, a reporter saw a map of the Northeast war at a certain place. At present, the armies of both sides in the Northeast are intertwined, almost in a mixed war state. One route of the National Army going north is following the Changchun Railway north, and the other route is going north from the Changchun Railway side. The two routes meet south of Gongzhuling, but these two blue lines pointing north still intersect with some red lines of unsuppressed Communist troops, such as the Communist troops still in Luopingjie and Lishu.

[This newspaper, Beiping, 30th] It is rumored that the National Army has entered the entire urban area of Sipingjie this morning.

[This newspaper, Beiping, 30th] Xinhua News Agency said: (1) The Northeast Democratic Allied Army has entered Harbin on the 28th after the withdrawal of Soviet troops. (2) The Communist and National armies had a fierce battle in the eastern suburbs of Sipingjie on the 26th. (3) After occupying Changchun, the Communist Party strictly guarded the central part and replaced the mayor of the city with Liu.

[United Press, Chongqing, 29th] Generals Zheng Dongguo and Liang Huasheng returned here from the fierce fighting on the front line of Sipingjie. They said they were confident that the recovery of Changchun was only a matter of time. They also said that the six divisions of the National Army determined to reach Changchun have placed the Communist troops in the Sipingjie area under intense artillery fire.

[United Press, Beiping, 30th] Today is the last day scheduled for the Soviet army to complete its withdrawal from the Northeast. According to fragmented reports obtained by the Beiping government: The Soviet army has withdrawn from the main cities and railway lines in the interior of the Northeast, but has not withdrawn from the border cities of the Northeast, including the free port of Dalian. Since the Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 9th last year, the Soviet army has occupied the Northeast for 264 days. Although the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship signed on August 14th last year clearly stipulated that the Soviet Union should transfer Chinese territorial sovereignty to the Chinese government, at the time of the Soviet army's withdrawal, the area controlled by the central government accounted for only 5% to 8% of the entire Northeast region.

### Visiting Mogan in the Misty Rain

— Chu Yusheng

Legend has it that during the Spring and Autumn period, Helü, the father of King Fuchai of Wu, ordered Gan Jiang to cast a sword on a mountain in the southwest. When casting the sword, the molten iron would not flow. His wife asked, "The molten iron won't flow, is there a clever plan?" Gan Jiang said, "The great master Ouyezi couldn't melt his sword either, only by marrying a woman to the furnace god can it melt." Moye, upon hearing this, jumped into the furnace, and the molten iron flowed out, and two swords were forged, the male named "Gan Jiang," and the female named "Moye." Later generations, to commemorate the hardship of Gan Jiang and Moye in casting the sword, named the mountain Mogan Mountain. Since then, some families have lived on the mountain. During the Qing Dynasty, there were many temples. After the Taiping Rebellion, Mogan Mountain was also devastated by war and became desolate. Forty years ago, the American Meiteng Gen came here to hunt in the mountains and found the scenery beautiful. He wanted to gather local people to develop this mountain. Coincidentally, many workers from Anhui passed by. After he called for help, everyone worked hard to develop it. Later, it slowly became a famous scenic area. Mr. Huang Yingbai here did indeed put in a lot of effort. By around the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the name of Mogan Mountain had spread far and wide, becoming an internationally renowned summer resort.

During the eight years of arduous resistance against the Japanese, Mogan Mountain also spent its days in the flames of war. After the victory, the revival of Mogan Mountain became a political and economic issue in Zhejiang. However, news of unrest on the road to Mogan Mountain was frequently heard. In order to truly understand its current situation, I decided to travel to Mogan Mountain.

That day, it was raining, and the ground was very muddy. We set off in a 1940 "Pierce" sedan. Passing through Gongchen Bridge, we slid onto the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. This road was exceptionally smooth before the war, but now it has simply become a rugged mountain road. Our car was constantly bouncing, the sound of stones hitting the steel plate under the car, and the splashing mud, like the sound of a boat sailing in the waves, really made people doubt whether we could reach Mogan Mountain? Each wooden bridge was made of four or five wooden planks nailed together. One of them had half of its bottom plate collapsed, with a few wooden planks suspended in the air. To pass over it, you would really sweat for the driver.

Passing Xiahe Liangzhu, we arrived at Pingyao, where there were only some merchants buying and selling wood. Then, passing Penggong and Dongzha, which used to be lush with forests and bamboo, making passersby feel like they were in a painting, it is now a desolate scene. The poplar and willow trees planted when the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway was built were more than ten feet tall, but unfortunately, only a few remain on both sides. The rest, I heard, were cut down by the enemy and puppets. Passing Shangbai, that was a "problematic" place. On the mountains in the distance, you could see the blockhouse buildings left over from the war. Arriving in Wukang, it no longer looked like a county town. Almost all the houses were destroyed by artillery fire, with broken walls and ruins everywhere, leaving a desolate impression. Some small markets were makeshift houses. The county government was temporarily set up in civilian houses. The entire county had only more than 50,000 people. The devastation after the war, like Wukang, would really take some time and effort to restore to its former appearance.

The car crossed Sanqiaobu and arrived at Shou Village, which is at the foot of Mogan Mountain. Some old people pointed out to me where the parking lot, the horse stable, the sedan chair stop, and the tourist registration office used to be. Now, only some dilapidated houses remain. It is said that the enemy had been here several times and fought with the guerrillas. Later, the New Fourth Army came again, and many houses were destroyed by artillery fire or demolished. There used to be five or six thousand people at the foot of the mountain, but now there are only five or six hundred. Because the people of Anhui put in a lot of effort in the development of Mogan Mountain, there are many people from Anhui. Among the current five or six hundred people, two-thirds are from Anhui. They cut some firewood every day and carry some things for people to make a living.

At the foot of the mountain, there is a very well-built primary school, named Mogan Primary School. The school's facilities are also good, with more than 300 children. Most of their parents are farmers near the mountain. It is said that during the war, they never stopped classes. When the enemy came, they hid in the mountains and continued to have classes. When the enemy left, they moved back, until the New Fourth Army came before the victory. When the enemy came, the guerrillas also came, and only then did the singing and music stop in the chaos.

We walked up the mountain, first taking the new road. This road was built in the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929), like a small road. Cement water pipes and iron water pipes can be seen on the road, but they are already silted up and dilapidated.

This is truly a well-deserved scenic spot, with layers of peaks and lush trees. Occasionally, there are wisteria petals falling by the roadside, and roses and wild roses hiding in the weeds. The pomegranates are also showing off their beauty, but they are just growing. It is said that the roadside used to be planted with famous flowers, but now they are incomplete.

Although it is still raining, and the view is hazy with mist, the scenery before us is enough to make us linger.

Passing Tianchi Temple, there is a distinction between the new and old Tianchi. The new Tianchi is next to the temple, a small pond. It is said that colorful small fish can be caught here endlessly. The old Tianchi is in another place, with a monument erected by Zhou Qingyun to record it. Zhou once washed his eyes in Taoguang in Hangzhou and took golden lotuses to plant there. Now there are still a few lotus leaves.

Climbing further up, looking down, you can see green trees like clouds, rising and falling. On the mountainside, someone carved the words "Brushing Clouds." Then, to the Sword Pond, where Gan Jiang and Moye forged their swords. There is a sword-sharpening stone and a pool of water, making people think of the situation of the ancients. Then, to Luhua Marsh, where the water is extremely clear. It is said that drinking it can prolong life. The mountain people say that foreigners come here and take the water back to cook rice.

Another place is Stone Temple. Between two stones, there is a jade-like stalactite. Next to it is a temple called Shi Yi Temple. Then, to the Lotus Society, a place for prominent figures to practice piety. The building is of a new type. Wealthy people and prominent figures who come to the mountains in the summer must come here to practice piety. Zhang Jingjiang, Dai Chuanxian, and others all have records of it.

Far and near along the roadside, there are rows of newly equipped, ingeniously designed Western-style buildings, imagining the prosperity of the peak summer season. We visited the Mogan Mountain Administration. According to the person in charge, to revive Mogan Mountain, the first thing to do is to repair the roads, and the second is to strengthen security. There are more than 300 families on this mountain, with the houses numbered up to 623. There used to be many construction factories, many coppersmiths, and post offices, telegraph offices, and a large-scale Railway Hotel on the mountain. There was a ball field and a swimming pool, but now everything is abandoned. At the moment, there are already six or seven families who have started repairing their houses on the mountain. I hope that everyone can come back one after another to revive Mogan Mountain. The northwest of the mountain is Xiaofeng Anji, and the northeast is Wuxing, which can be said to be the key to Hangzhou.

We returned along the old road. The old road is also paved with cement stone steps, which shows the attention to detail in the management of this mountain at that time. Along the way, the trees are lush, and the bamboo forests are everywhere, making people reluctant to leave.

Returning, we still stepped on this bumpy road that was as uneven as sailing in the waves. I thought that Mogan Mountain is a beautiful summer resort, but to revive Mogan Mountain, it is necessary to repair the roads and strengthen security forces.

I heard that Shen Honglie, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, has decided to repair the roads and strengthen security forces to revive this summer resort. (Posted on the night of April 28)

Brief Biography of Special Envoy Hoover

In 1897, Hoover was hired to Australia to investigate mining, and he engaged in mining there. In 1899, he returned to California and married Laura Henry, a classmate from Stanford University. During the Boxer Rebellion in China, Hoover was hired by the Tangshan Mining Bureau in China as the chief engineer, and he and his newlywed wife sailed from California to Tianjin. Shortly after Mr. and Mrs. Hoover arrived in Tianjin, the city was besieged by the Boxers. Mr. Hoover assisted in food supply and handled refugees. At that time, the British, German, and Belgian creditors of a certain coal mine, railway, and shipping company in coastal China hired Hoover to clear the accounts. After the matter was completed, he returned to California. In 1901, Mr. Hoover came to China again, serving as the chief engineer of the above-mentioned company, reforming the internal organization and employing more than 25,000 people, asking to build the Qinhuangdao seaport.

Wu was absent due to going to Shanghai, and Chen Lifu and Chen Cheng presided over the meeting, attended by more than 300 people. Chen Lifu, in his speech, first expressed his welcome, and then explained that the association requested a postponement because various parties had not yet submitted their lists, and Chairman Chiang finally made this decision. Your disappointment and Chairman Chiang's pain are the same. He hoped that the representatives would exchange opinions before the meeting so that they could be conveyed to the government. Chen Cheng used the saying "good things take time" to explain the postponement of the conference, hoping that the representatives would still actively work together to promote national construction. Subsequently, the representatives spoke, and they all believed that the National Congress had been in preparation for ten years. Now that it has been convened, it is now postponed again. The government should not postpone it due to the problems of a few parties, which would affect the government's prestige and the work of formulating the fundamental law of the country. They intend to unanimously request that the meeting be held at a fixed date. Give military representatives transportation convenience to come to Nanjing. The Constitution is a function of the National Congress itself and should not be subject to any interference. When the Shandong representative spoke, he described the various atrocities of the Communist army in Shandong, and eagerly hoped that the government would quickly rescue the people from the depths of water and fire. Fu Da replied that he should respond to various requirements and submit them to the government.

[Another telegram] The National Congress representatives will hold a preparation meeting at 10:00 AM on May 2.

### Suzhou High Court President Sun Honglin Discusses the Exemplary Punishment of Traitors Chen and Miao: Chen Biqun and Chu Minyi Have Not Yet Requested a Retrial

[Report from this newspaper, Suzhou, 30th] After the verdicts of traitor Chen Biqun and traitor Chu Minyi were announced, today is the eighth day. People from all walks of life believe that when traitor Chen was interrogated in court, he said that revolutionaries only have two paths when judged by national law: death or innocence. The court sentenced me to death, and I am willing to accept it. If I am sentenced to imprisonment, I will not accept it. Therefore, there are various rumors about whether they have applied for a retrial, and there is no consensus. The reporter specially visited President Sun Honglin of the High Court at around 4:00 PM on the 30th and received the following statement: The High Court has not yet received the retrial application forms of Chen and Chu. However, according to regulations, there are still three days before it is considered abandoned. Regarding the application for a retrial by traitor Chen Gongbo and traitor Miao Bin, the Supreme Court's reply has not yet been received. According to the express provisions of the Special Criminal Procedure Law, the Supreme Court usually completes the review procedures within 20 days after receiving the detailed document from this court, but there are also delays due to other reasons, and it is not convenient to make a judgment. However, in my opinion, traitors such as Chen are the main culprits of treason. Even if they contacted the central special agencies to protect patriots, their declaration of war against Britain and the United States indicates their hope that the United Nations would be destroyed. If our central government no longer exists, how is this different from directly undermining the foundation of the country? Therefore, their merits and demerits are vastly different and cannot be offset. Although it is said that the law is not beyond human sentiment, it is important to be impartial and not to take a light approach. If we do not impose severe penalties, then how can we determine the severity of punishment for those below? Public opinion is the mouthpiece of the people, and we should advocate that the public understand the legal point of view and not speculate.

### Capital High Court Announces Public Trial of Traitor Mei the Day After Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Zhao Chen, President of the Capital High Court, officially announced this morning that the public trial of traitor Mei Siping will be held at 9:00 AM on May 3 in the court's First Tribunal.

[United Press, Beiping, 30th] Wang Yitang and other nine important Chinese traitors in North China will be escorted to Nanjing by plane for trial. The second batch of traitors is scheduled to be transferred from the Army Prison to the court detention center tomorrow. A total of 392 puppet officials have been captured in Hebei Province, and 198 in Shandong Province, including two former puppet provincial chairmen, four puppet bureau chiefs, 26 puppet county magistrates, and nine generals who surrendered to the enemy.

### Implementation Measures for Demobilization of Female Volunteer Soldiers

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The Ministry of Education has formulated implementation measures for the demobilization of female volunteer soldiers: (1) Students and staff will be reinstated in their original schools and original service units by the Military Affairs Commission, with opportunities for promotion and upgrading, or they will be given a subsidy to return to their hometowns, or they will be introduced to various agencies for priority employment, allowing them to choose freely. (2) They will be issued three months of their original salary and travel expenses according to the rank of junior lieutenant; officers will be issued eight months of their original salary and travel expenses. (3) They will have priority in taking transportation. (4) Demobilization matters should be completed by the end of this year in various garrisons. (5) The government will grant female youths and their families all military preferential rights, which will be terminated from the date of demobilization.

### Chongqing Headquarters Established Yesterday, Zhang Qun to Take Office Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] The Chongqing Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission was ordered to be established on April 30 at the old site of the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission. Zhang Qun, who also serves as the director, is scheduled to take the oath of office at 3:00 PM on May 2 in the headquarters auditorium.

### Governor of Hong Kong Takes Office Tomorrow

[Report from this newspaper, Hong Kong, 30th] The Governor of Hong Kong, Young, arrived in Hong Kong Island today by plane from England via India. Government officials and civilians went to the airport to welcome him enthusiastically. The Governor is scheduled to hold an inauguration ceremony in the Hong Kong government tomorrow, marking the end of military government.

### Grain Prices in Hangzhou Soar, Exceeding 40,000 Yuan

[Report from this newspaper, Hangzhou, 30th] It has been raining in Hangzhou for several days, which is beneficial to agricultural crops, but grain prices have risen particularly sharply. White rice has already exceeded the 40,000 mark. Rice merchants are still saying they have no goods. The Grain Association said that the prices in the Xia Shi and Wuxi production areas are higher than those in Hangzhou, and that the reserves can only last for ten days, and requested the Hangzhou Municipal Food Regulation Committee to hold an emergency meeting to adjust grain prices, causing citizens to panic. This reporter recently visited an authoritative economist in Hangzhou, who said that the world is experiencing a food shortage this year, and China is no exception. The Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has requested relief from the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, but the results have not been satisfactory. Coupled with the unstable situation in Nantong, it is possible that these factors have caused grain prices to rise. Judging from the facts, the food situation in Hangzhou has not reached an extremely alarming level, so the sharp rise in grain prices is largely due to human factors.

Editorial

### The First Labor Day After Victory

Today marks the first Labor Day after our eight-year victory in the War of Resistance!

Today marks the first Labor Day as we begin postwar construction!

As we celebrate Labor Day this year, which marks the beginning of nation-building after the victory of the War of Resistance, we are filled with boundless enthusiasm and unprecedented joy. We extend our sincere and candid best wishes to the working class nationwide.

Looking back at the past eight years, working compatriots across the country, along with soldiers fighting on the front lines, cultivated this magnificent and vibrant flower of victory with boundless "blood" and immeasurable "sweat"! The entire nation, both soldiers and civilians, endured countless hardships and pains through heroic sacrifice and tireless labor, striving to achieve a glorious victory!

During the War of Resistance, we witnessed:

(1) Our industrial working compatriots, following the relocation of factories inland, left their homes and families, venturing into the mountains and valleys. Utilizing dilapidated machinery and rudimentary equipment, they diligently increased production under frequent enemy air raids, supplying the needs of the front lines and sustaining the livelihood of the rear. Regardless of the cold or heat, day or night, living on meager meals and wearing tattered clothes, they remained steadfast industrial fighters in the national War of Resistance. They had no disputes, they were never afraid of hardship, and they never engaged in strikes or work stoppages!

(2) Our mining working compatriots, for the sake of resource development, crossed mountains and ridges, using crude tools to venture into deep mines. Amidst freezing weather and miasmic conditions, they diligently developed resources, strengthening economic warfare, and proving themselves worthy as a vital force in the economic mobilization of the national War of Resistance. They had no resentment, they were not afraid of shrinking back, and they never engaged in strikes or work stoppages!

(3) Our transportation working compatriots, to meet military needs, devoted themselves to road construction, traversing long distances and braving the elements. They built highways in towering mountains and drove frequently breaking-down cars through treacherous valleys. Regardless of fierce winds and heavy rains, scorching heat and freezing cold, they strengthened frequent military transport, even living primitive lives of hunger, cold, and raw sustenance, forming the vital transportation artery for the national War of Resistance. They felt no indignation, they did not try to escape, and they never engaged in strikes or work stoppages!

Today, it has been nine months since the victory of the War of Resistance. The contributions of our working compatriots across the country to the nation and the country are truly immense! To be honest, our War of Resistance did not rely on abundant material resources or substantial financial strength, but solely on the human power of our many who shed blood and sweat! Therefore, the merits of working compatriots across the country are comparable to those of soldiers who fought and bled. Today, it is exceedingly meaningful for friends in the labor movement to enthusiastically celebrate Labor Day!

In today's world, humanity is advancing towards the great road of peace, democracy, prosperity, and happiness. Today's China, the entire nation is striving to build a new country of freedom, independence, prosperity, and well-being. Working compatriots across the country, today, all recognize your important responsibilities and will all exert their full efforts to promote the glorious history of the War of Resistance and continue to work towards building a modern, industrialized new China. National prosperity and the well-being of the people are the goals of our Three Principles of the People, which are also the fruits that the working class across the country will reap through hard work.

Looking back at the past and looking forward to the future, we cannot help but frankly review. We wish to express, with an open mind and sincere expectations, a brief overview of the dark clouds hanging over the current Chinese industry.

At the beginning of recovery and the start of nation-building, Shanghai, which had been occupied for eight years, returned to the embrace of the motherland, becoming the economic heart of the country once again. In recent months, due to soaring prices, the people's livelihoods have become difficult, and working compatriots in Shanghai naturally feel the same deep pain. We dare to assert that today's pain is by no means limited to the labor movement. Except for national scum, national thieves, and social criminals who are making "national disaster fortunes" and "victory fortunes" and still indulging in extravagance and pleasure, everyone is in pain. We dare to say further that today, there are still people whose pain is deeper and greater than that of working compatriots! If Shanghai wages can be adjusted according to the price index, then compared to the treatment of general military, civil, and educational personnel, it is still barely satisfactory. Many working compatriots in Shanghai are discerning, and there is no need to elaborate. Moreover, such pain is inevitable after a major war. Looking at the world from afar, which country's citizens are not in pain except for the uniquely endowed United States? China is poor and in the aftermath of war, how can it be an exception? Since victory, labor unrest in Shanghai has surged, and disputes have been incessant, all stemming from one word: "poverty". Prices are rising daily, and life is becoming increasingly difficult. We have infinite sympathy for the urgent demands of working compatriots across the country. However, when we think of the future of Chinese industry, we cannot help but say a few words of warning and encouragement amidst the celebrations:

Today's situation is indeed a great opportunity! We believe that:

First, Japan has been defeated, and Chinese industry should be able to rise. After the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japanese industry flourished, plundering China's cheap raw materials and using its own low-cost labor to develop light industry, especially the products of the textile and chemical industries, dumping them on the Chinese market. Before September 18, Japan's trade with China even ranked first, surpassing Great Britain, while the United States lagged far behind. After September 18, Japan further oppressed the development of Chinese industry with its "industrial Japan, agricultural China" policy, the so-called "Sino-Japanese economic cooperation," this set of economic aggression. Now that Japan has been defeated, our Chinese industry has eliminated a formidable enemy, and the future development of Chinese industry is infinitely bright.

Second, unequal treaties have been abolished, and after a century of constraint, there is a one-time liberation, and Chinese industry should be able to become autonomous. In the past, China's economy was too heavily constrained by unequal treaties. Foreigners in China, based on special privileges, used China's low-cost labor and further utilized Chinese raw materials. As long as they brought capital equipment (machines, etc.) and technology, they could freely establish factories in China for manufacturing, and the taxes on foreign goods imported from overseas were even lighter than those on domestic products, so that remote areas all became markets for foreign goods. Now that the unequal treaties have been abolished, our Chinese industry should be able to reduce external pressure.

Third, with the active assistance of the United States, Chinese industry can develop rapidly. The reason why Chinese industry is backward is that it lacks economic construction plans, scientific technology, and large amounts of capital (domestic and foreign capital). In the future, for Chinese industry, the government already has a whole economic construction plan, actively utilizes foreign capital, and has the full assistance of the United States in technology and equipment. The future development is immeasurable.

In short, the internal and external obstacles and difficulties of Chinese industry can all be overcome today. Only the development of Chinese industry is a bright and brilliant road for the Chinese labor movement. However, to expect the development of Chinese industry today, it greatly depends on the awareness and efforts of both labor and capital.

First, we wish that labor-capital disputes will no longer occur, and strikes and work stoppages will no longer be seen. Although industry is currently fraught with difficulties and lurking crises, in essence, as long as currency is tightened, the monetary system is adjusted, transportation is restored, and production is increased, prices will naturally tend to stabilize. Stabilizing prices is not an overnight achievement, but the government and the people should indeed work together to achieve it. In today's situation where prices have not yet stabilized, although there is temporary pain and it is impossible to actively and rapidly restore the pre-war standard of living, as long as everyone strives to increase production, the government can resolve wages and living standards in a reasonable manner. Strikes and work stoppages will only reduce production. How can a country become wealthy with sharp declines in production? In Shanghai, wages in various industries have recently been largely readjusted, with increases and decreases based on the cost-of-living index. If capital has made concessions by increasing wages and reducing working hours, then the labor movement must pay close attention to factory discipline and work efficiency. If the increase in work efficiency can be directly proportional to the increase in wages, then the increase in wages along with the price index is not a major concern for industry, or may even stimulate improvements in industrial management methods. Therefore, today's issue is not as much about wage disputes as it is about the importance of work discipline. We absolutely do not want to see the Chinese labor movement, which has always been known for its diligence, acquire the habit of resorting to strikes and work stoppages, causing Chinese industry to be in a predicament again, with many factories closing down and workers suffering unemployment!

Second, we wish that labor treatment will be improved through industrial development. Sun Yat-sen said: "Chinese workers must increase their status, and there are two conditions: First, the independence of the entire nation, and second, the development of domestic industry. If the entire nation is still under the oppression of imperialism, it is impossible for workers to demand separate liberation. Therefore, first, we must enhance the status of the nation; there is no workers' benefit without national interest. Second, we must seek the improvement of the lives of Chinese workers from the development of Chinese industry. The happiness of Chinese workers cannot be realized one day without the development of Chinese industry." Today, the Chinese nation has gained independence, and the first condition can be said to be met. Therefore, the improvement of labor life and treatment should be achieved through industrial development. The first article of the "Labor Policy Outline" passed by the Kuomintang's Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee last May 6 has already clearly stipulated the improvement of labor status and the improvement of labor life: "The goal of labor policy is to develop labor organizations, improve their status, improve their lives, and promote labor-capital cooperation, regulate labor supply and demand, increase labor efficiency, and strengthen international labor ties in accordance with the principles of national supremacy and the spirit of international cooperation, so as to ensure social security and meet the needs of national defense and people's livelihoods." Other proposals can also be said to be perfect for improving labor welfare. From now on, all that is needed is for the entire nation to work hard to implement it. The recent suggestion book provided by the U.S. State Department for the International Trade and Employment Conference to be held this summer has a passage on "Relieving Worries about Production and Employment Disruptions": "If a country can engage in regular and comprehensive production and foreign trade increases day by day, this is the greatest benefit that a nation can give to producers all over the world." On the road to nation-building, we do not have the ability to sell industrial products overseas, but at least we should have the effort to manufacture industrial products for our own consumption. We should not have the fear of "unemployment" at this time, but why is there unemployment? It can be seen that the damage suffered by Chinese industry is very serious. We wish that after the establishment of labor-capital appraisal committees in major cities across the country, all labor-capital disputes can be rationally agreed upon and legally mediated, so that Chinese industry can breathe a sigh of relief in a peaceful and stable environment, and then take the road of gradual development under the conditions of striving for excellence in technology management and all other aspects. Only in this way can Chinese industry have hope, and the Chinese labor movement will be happy.

### Byrnes Proposes Suggestion; Four Powers Conclude Treaty of Mutual Assistance; Guaranteeing German Disarmament for Twenty-Five Years; Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Agree to Discuss Furthermore

[Our Newspaper's Dispatches] London, 30th - Broadcasted: The American side suggested that the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers should discuss the issue of the Four Powers concluding a twenty-five-year treaty of mutual assistance for the occupation of Germany. The Soviet side has already agreed to this. On the other hand, the American side will also express concessions to the opinions of the Soviet side.

[United Press, Paris, 30th - Electrical Dispatch] American Secretary of State Byrnes announced last night that he had proposed that the four countries of Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States should conclude a treaty of mutual assistance for a period of twenty-five years to guarantee the disarmament of Germany. If this proposal is passed by the U.S. Senate and approved by Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the United States will continue to participate in maintaining European security with military force for at least twenty-five years after the current state of military occupation of Germany ends. Byrnes said: Last Christmas, he discussed the Four Powers Treaty with Stalin in Moscow. Stalin agreed with this idea, and he himself had a strong belief, so he proposed a draft of the Four Powers Treaty. Byrnes made this suggestion at the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers. At that time, the meeting had decided to include the entire German issue on the agenda and had begun to discuss the disposal of Italian colonies. It took five hours to complete the discussion. After the meeting, Byrnes met with journalists and elaborated on the long-term policy of the United States on Germany and European security. The draft treaty stipulates that the four countries will implement a supervisory system on Germany to confirm that the German army, general staff, stormtroopers, secret police, etc., have been "completely disarmed, demobilized, and disbanded, and that there is no military equipment manufacturing or import." Byrnes also said that a similar treaty has been drafted for Japan and submitted to the Pacific countries, but it has not yet been discussed with those countries, so he is unwilling to comment. However, the Four Powers Treaties regarding Germany and Japan are completely unrelated to the peace treaties with Germany and Japan. The United Nations Charter stipulates that it has the right to conclude agreements of this nature, and they can be extended for another twenty-five years after the expiration date. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault both supported Byrnes's suggestion to include this treaty on the agenda of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov disagreed, saying that the meeting should discuss the entire German issue, and that the Four Powers Treaty was premature. It might as well form a supervisory committee to determine the extent to which Germany has been disarmed. Bevin and Byrnes replied that the Allied Control Council for Germany was already carrying out this task. Byrnes then requested the meeting to be adjourned, and the issue of the Four Powers Treaty remained unresolved. At tonight's meeting, before raising the German issue, the following suggestions will be heard first:

(1) Immediately allow Libya to become independent and establish a new country in northeastern Africa, to be administered by Great Britain under trusteeship.

(2) The Soviet Union had previously requested to administer Tripolitania in North Africa under trusteeship and now proposes a compromise solution.

(3) The United Nations Security Council decides on the trusteeship of Italian colonies.

(4) The Dodecanese Islands are handed over to Greece.

[United Press, London, 30th - Electrical Dispatch] A British Foreign Office spokesman recently stated that Great Britain agrees in principle with the American suggestion that the Four Powers conclude a treaty to supervise German disarmament, but it is not fully supporting it at present. Great Britain would rather include this matter on the agenda for general discussion.

### Main Points of the Draft Treaty Proposed by Byrnes

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th - Electrical Dispatch] The draft treaty proposed by Byrnes for concluding a mutual assistance treaty with various countries includes an introduction and five articles in the main text. The main points of the articles are as follows.

Article 1: The contracting states shall ensure the elimination of all German military groups, the prohibition of manufacturing and importing war materials, and the prohibition of using any factories or laboratories for military purposes, by means of disarming Germany, demobilizing the German army, and disbanding the German general staff.

Article 2: The Four Powers Control Commission for Germany shall carry out inspections within the stipulated period to supervise the correct implementation of the above clauses.

Article 2: The four contracting states shall each ensure the disarmament of Germany within their occupied zones, and the period of occupation of Germany shall be extended until Germany accepts Articles 1 and 2.

Article 4: The four contracting states shall communicate information at any time through the Control Commission so that action can be taken in the event of Germany violating the treaty. Six months after the signing of this treaty, the four signatory states shall declare what troops will remain to maintain the implementation of the various clauses.

Article 5: This treaty shall come into effect upon signature, and its effective period shall be twenty-five years.

### No Agreement Reached by Four Powers on the Disposal of Italian Colonies; Decision to Include the German Issue on the Agenda

[United Press, Paris, 29th - Electrical Dispatch] At tonight's meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, which lasted for five hours, no agreement was reached on the disposal of Italian territories, but the entire German issue has been included on the agenda. Today's meeting first discussed the most serious issue on the agenda: the disposal of Italian colonies and the control of the eastern Mediterranean. The issue of the Trieste and the Italian-Yugoslav border is listed as the second item on the agenda and is scheduled to be discussed this Tuesday.

[Reuters, Paris, 30th - Electrical Dispatch] At last night's meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, the positions of Great Britain and the Soviet Union on the disposal of Italian colonies were very different from those at the London Conference in September last year. Byrnes reiterated the plan announced in London in September last year, advocating that Italian colonies should be placed under international trusteeship. Molotov then stated: The Soviet Union now proposes that Tripolitania and Cyrenaica should be governed by the United Nations, but Tripolitania should have one Soviet administrator and one Italian deputy administrator, assisted by a consultative body composed of one representative each from Great Britain, the United States, and France, and two representatives from local residents. After the foreign ministers spoke in succession, the meeting still had no resolution. Yesterday's meeting also discussed the Dodecanese Islands and the Austrian issue.

[United Press, Paris, 29th - Electrical Dispatch] It is heard that Bevin has brought from London the entire policy of the British Empire on Tripolitania and other Italian territories, the Dodecanese Islands, and the lifeline of the British Empire in the Mediterranean. Great Britain opposes the Soviet Union's request to administer Italian territories under trusteeship, and its attitude has become stronger after talking with Smuts.

### Italian Fascist Remnants Still Trying to Revive

Public Commemoration of Mussolini's Death

[United Press, Rome, 29th - Electrical Dispatch] Mussolini's body is missing, and the nationwide search is still underway. Today, newspapers reported that Fascists publicly commemorated the first anniversary of Mussolini's death twice yesterday. In Rome, three hundred young people prevented a Mass at the Church of San Carlo, singing Fascist songs praising Mussolini, and then marched in the city center. In Florence, a Fascist black flag was found flying on the bell tower of the Duomo Square yesterday morning. In several other locations, leaflets were found praising Fascism and attacking democracy and the current government. At the same time, according to one newspaper, investigators searching for Mussolini's body believe that Mussolini's body has probably been reburied somewhere near Milan, mostly because the previous tomb was often desecrated by passersby.

### Iranian Government; Azerbaijan Province; Kurdish Tribes; Hold Secret Meeting

Soviet Troops Formally Withdraw from Azerbaijan

[United Press, Tehran, 29th - Electrical Dispatch] Representatives from the Iranian central government, Azerbaijan, and the Kurdish tribes held a secret meeting today in a walled village five miles northeast of here. Gendarmes with fixed bayonets guarded every entrance and exit of the village. The Azerbaijan delegation was led by Prime Minister Bishi-vali. The Kurdish representative, Saif Ghazi, went directly to the village from the airport yesterday and has not gone anywhere else. On the central government side, Prime Minister Shana and the ministers of finance, mines, public works, and construction participated in the meeting as representatives. It is heard that the Azerbaijan representatives insisted that Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and Director of Propaganda, Firoos, should be dismissed.

[Reuters, Tehran, 29th - Electrical Dispatch] Great Britain Radio announced tonight that Soviet troops formally withdrew from Azerbaijan today.

[Reuters, Tehran, 30th - Electrical Dispatch] The Tehran "Saba" newspaper reported that the Soviet Embassy has notified the Iranian government that Soviet troops will withdraw from Azerbaijan before the stipulated date of May 6.

[Reuters, Moscow, 30th - Electrical Dispatch] The Soviet News Agency's Tehran dispatch stated that Iranian Prime Minister Shaddana has been elected as the honorary chairman of the Soviet-Iranian Cultural Association.

### Security Council Passes Australian Proposal to Investigate Franco Regime; Report Due by the 31st of this Month; General Assembly Adjourns Indefinitely

[Special Dispatch] San Francisco, 30th (Broadcast): The Security Council's Subcommittee on the Spanish Question held its first closed-door meeting this afternoon. The US representative will submit confidential documents for the committee's review. According to well-informed sources, the US documents were mostly obtained from Germany and contain both favorable and unfavorable information regarding Franco.

[US Information Service, New York, 29th]: The UN Security Council today passed the amended Australian proposal by a vote of ten to zero, with the Soviet Union abstaining. The amended proposal acknowledges the Security Council's "unanimous and moral censure" of the Franco regime and mandates the subcommittee to investigate whether the regime threatens international peace and security, submitting a report to the Security Council by May 31st. Chairman Dr. Aranha appointed Australia, Brazil, China, France, and Poland as members of the subcommittee. The Security Council then adjourned indefinitely. The chairman stated that it would reconvene "when more matters are ready."

Soviet Representative Gromyko stated in the meeting that he had decided to abstain from voting because voting against it would prevent the Australian proposal from passing. However, he reserved the right to oppose it in the future and reiterated his stance that he opposed the investigation. He stated that the Security Council already had sufficient evidence to warrant the United Nations immediately severing relations with Franco. Australian Representative Hasluck convened a meeting and announced the following three points: (1) The subcommittee will hold its first meeting on Wednesday afternoon and will subsequently hold regular and frequent meetings. (2) The meetings will be closed, but discussions will be open during the "initial stage." (3) The subcommittee will request that all United Nations members submit useful information regarding Spain.

### Plot to Assassinate MacArthur Discovered on the Eve of May Day; Mastermind and Accomplices Still at Large; Japanese Government Sincerely Apologizes to GHQ

[Special Correspondent Dispatch, Tokyo, 30th]: Allied Headquarters announced this afternoon that a plot to assassinate MacArthur had been discovered. The mastermind behind the plot is Hideo Takayama, who intended to carry out the conspiracy during the May Day rally. This person is still at large, and other accomplices are currently being sought. However, MacArthur was not shaken by this incident and decided to attend the May Day parade as originally planned, without guards.

[United Press, Tokyo, 30th]: The news of the Japanese plot to assassinate MacArthur, announced by MacArthur's Headquarters today, spread rapidly, with deep concern that the US military might strengthen its occupation policy as a result. The Japanese government urgently apologized to MacArthur's Headquarters. Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshida sent representative Okazaki to visit Headquarters at 5:00 PM, but he did not get to see MacArthur himself, only meeting with Headquarters officials, two hours after the announcement of the assassination plot. According to Colonel Wheeler of Headquarters, Okazaki expressed "deep regret and concern," saying that the Japanese government was "deeply apprehensive" that the Japanese had such a plot. Earlier, Prime Minister Shidehara held a meeting with Foreign Minister Yoshida and Interior Minister Mitani to discuss the plot and its possible repercussions, and to prepare to step up precautions to prevent any out-of-bounds actions during the May Day parade.

Japanese Communist Party Declares No Involvement [Special Dispatch] San Francisco, 30th (Broadcast): Regarding the plot to assassinate MacArthur, a spokesman for the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement today denying any involvement.

### Control Commission for Japan; Chinese Representative Proposes Establishing Four Subcommittees

[United Press, Tokyo, 30th]: The Four-Power Control Commission for Japan met this morning to discuss the Japanese food problem. US Representative Atcheson bluntly stated that the question of whether the United States should ship grain to other countries instead of to Japan was entirely outside the purview of the committee. The meeting continued in the afternoon to discuss rural reform, the Japanese education system, and how the Japanese government is implementing orders from MacArthur's Headquarters. The two-hour meeting proceeded smoothly and was relatively calm. Earlier, Chinese Representative Zhu Shuming proposed establishing four subcommittees for military affairs, politics, economics, and education. British and Soviet representatives expressed their support, but Atcheson announced that he did not "fully agree" with the work of these subcommittees (which may involve investigation).

### General Manager of the New-New Company, Li Ze, Case to be Sentenced on the 7th; Defendant Says He Did Not Do Anything Against His Conscience; Lawyers Zhang Chen and Guo Offer Sharp Defenses

[Special Dispatch] The case of Li Ze, the general manager of the New-New Company, which caused a sensation in Shanghai, was heard for the fourth time yesterday afternoon in the High Court's Provisional Criminal Court. The public gallery was completely full, and the aisles were also packed. At 3:00 PM, Judge Liu Yugui, together with Judges Qiu Huan and Cao Jun, opened a joint trial and announced a renewed hearing. Li Ze was brought to the dock. Informants Shu Yueqiao, Han Wucheng, Yao Zhuoren, and Ye Qiubin were all present in court. After Judge Liu questioned them one by one, lawyers Chen Tingrui and Zhang Shijian defended Li Ze with sharp arguments. At 6:20 PM, Judge Liu announced the end of the debate and set the sentence for 2:00 PM on May 7th. The details are recorded as follows:

Yesterday, when Li Ze arrived in court, he was wearing a gray-green gown, yellow leather shoes, and black-rimmed glasses. He walked in with his head held high. After listening to the clerk read the previous record, he said, "I have nothing to say." After the clerk finished reading the record of the previous court hearing of the informants, which was confirmed by Shu Yueqiao and others as accurate and signed in order, Li began his defense: (1) Regarding the false business consolidation association, he stated that the association was entirely initiated by the false Ministry of Industry, and all founders, preparatory committee members, and directors were entirely determined by the false government without seeking consent in advance. At that time, he was oppressed by the enemy and had no choice but to act as a director. The business consolidation association itself was also a "passive organization" that nominally governed all material control associations and had the power to oversee all materials, but the heads of the material control associations were directly appointed by the false Executive Yuan, so he could not be held responsible for the material control. As for the purchase of cloth, it was decided by the Japanese military and the false Executive Yuan. At that time, Chairman Tang Choumin strongly opposed it, but he was forced by the enemy's power and eventually failed. However, thanks to the efforts of the business consolidation association, the purchase method was changed, "reducing the suffering of merchants." The effects were: first, silk and hemp were not included in the purchase; second, cotton yarn was not purchased in disassembled packages; third, the goods used by factories for three months were not purchased; and fourth, the inventory needed by stores for one month was not purchased. Only more than sixty pieces of cotton yarn were taken away by the Japanese army in Tang Shouchang's hands. It is said that Lan Ting did not give the Japanese a single yarn or cloth after taking over. (2) Regarding the New-New Company hiring Japanese Ito as a consultant, Li Ze replied: The Japanese once wanted to buy the company for 10 million yuan but failed. Later, they wanted to change it to a Sino-Japanese joint venture but also failed. When the Pacific War broke out, the Japanese took the opportunity to cause trouble, and he had no choice but to hire a Japanese consultant to deal with it, in order to protect the company's assets and maintain the safety of his colleagues. (3) Regarding the dedication of scrap iron for use by the enemy army, Li Ze firmly stated that it was sold to Sen Dai, and there were receipts and account books as proof, and both witnesses and material evidence were available, so he would not say more.

However, Shu Yueqiao said: In 1936, when the boycott of Japanese goods was at its fiercest, Li Ze went to Japan to purchase goods and even evaded taxes at customs. His character is already unworthy, and what he said is all a strong defense. The evidence he presented is also false, and so on. Han Wucheng said: Li Ze's description of the business consolidation association's affairs is so detailed that it is clear that he must bear actual responsibility, so he requested the court to pronounce judgment as soon as possible. Li Ze heard this and said that he had done nothing against his conscience or against the country. He was willing to accept the most severe sanctions, so he also sincerely hoped to end the case as soon as possible.

Judge Liu then ordered the debate to begin. Prosecutor Rong Duo then stood up and announced two counts against Li Ze: (1) The nature of the false business consolidation association was to "have Chinese people come forward to handle affairs, which is more convenient than the Japanese," to replace the Japanese military's task of controlling the economy. Its main tasks were: first, the collection and distribution of materials in East China; second, the control of material movement; third, the control of material exchange and trade in Central China, South China, and North China; fourth, the management of factory materials; and fifth, the management of military supplies. These tasks were all beneficial to the enemy and harmful to the people, and Li Ze participated in them from preparation to the end, so his crime is clear. (2) During the war, the enemy army was in urgent need of steel, and Li Ze transported a large number of water ting by Japanese yellow military vehicles to aid the enemy. Therefore, he should be punished according to Article 2, Section 1, Clause 4, and Article 3, Section 2, Clause 5 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. Judge Liu asked Li Ze, do you have anything else to say? He replied: "His words are all ideal. The judge should make a judgment based on the facts." Then Li Ze retreated to the side seat, crossed his arms in front of his chest, and looked around with his head held high.

Lawyer Chen Tingrui presented three pieces of evidence at the beginning of the hearing, namely public letters from the Military Statistics Bureau, the Loyal Salvation Army, and the Refugee Relief Association, proving that Li Ze was indeed meritorious to the country. His defense stated: "China now needs the rule of law the most. Without the rule of law, China cannot exist. The law is the spirit of China, so I want to defend Li Ze." He also said that the informants only had oral and unreliable testimony, while the defendant had witnesses and material evidence, so the alleged crime cannot be established and he should be found not guilty. Lawyer Zhang Shizhao then defended, using historical examples and legal principles to prove that the defendant should be acquitted. Finally, Li Ze added: "If Chairman Chiang recognizes me as a traitor, then I am a traitor, but otherwise, I will never admit it." At this point, Judge Liu announced the end of the debate and set the sentencing for 2:30 PM on May 7th.

### Summary of Lawyer Zhang's Defense

Lawyer Zhang's defense highlights:

The indictment focuses on two points: one, the defendant served as a director of the puppet merchant association; two, the company sold old Yongting assets to the enemy. Such cases can be discussed in terms of three aspects: (1) criminal intent, (2) circumstances, and (3) actions. The defendant happened to be a leader in the department store industry, and by virtue of his position, he was assigned as a director of the puppet merchant association. Although the nominal position differs in scope from that of ordinary citizens and ward chiefs, the constraints imposed upon him by the puppet regime were the same. The defendant was located in Shanghai, which was entirely under enemy control, and the circumstances were unique, so he cannot be equated with traitors in the Greater Rear Area. The defendant's involvement with the puppet merchant association was only nominal, with no practical involvement; he was present in the midst of it all, yet he harbored the heart of [unclear], and reported any underground work opportunities. He spared no effort to rescue and offer aid. To the best of his ability, he was willing to risk his life. When the Allied forces planned to land at the Shanghai Mausoleum, the defendant, along with others, directly supplied the landing forces with materials, amounting to a massive sum of 300 million, a matter for which the Statistics and Investigation Bureau and the Chairman's Representative Office commended and requested awards. He also raised 150 million yuan for the Pudong Loyal Salvation Army, which fully proves the defendant's patriotic intentions and his covert efforts to save the country. In summary, the defendant's criminal intent was nonexistent, the circumstances were indeed compelling, and his actions clearly revealed the opposite of aiding the enemy. The legal provisions set by the members of the Supreme National Defense Council clearly define these three aspects, each with its own reference, therefore, the defendant is innocent.

### The National Assembly Must Be Convened as Scheduled; A Swift Resolution to National Affairs Must Be Sought

Shanghai-Based National Assembly Representatives Issue Joint Declaration

Elected representatives to the National Assembly from various regions have come to Shanghai, exchanged opinions, and issued a joint declaration that states: (1) Convening the National Assembly is a consistent proposition of the founding father, Sun Yat-sen. Parties with military power are using excuses to coerce and delay the National Assembly, seize political power, and divide the country. The government has compromised for the sake of peace, but after several months of delay, the situation has worsened. Therefore, the National Assembly must be convened as scheduled, based on the public opinion of the people, and seek a swift resolution to national affairs. (2) The government's convening of the National Assembly has been delayed to the point where there is no further room for delay, and finally, through negotiation, it was decided to be held on May 5th of this year. Now, due to the selfish intentions of a few parties, the laws have been changed. The representatives who accepted the people's trust must correct this immediately. (3) The Republic of China was founded 35 years ago, but the fundamental law to ensure the long-term stability of the country is still pending. Those who harbor wild ambitions can take advantage of the absence of a common law, create chaos, and distort the truth. Therefore, the National Assembly should be convened immediately to formulate a constitution, realize democracy, select the virtuous and capable according to constitutional norms, and be strictly supervised by the people to ensure a clear division of powers and responsibilities, so as to ensure the unity of the country and promote lasting peace. (4) The representatives share the fate of the nation and the people, so they must urge the government and all parties to be finally vigilant. The representatives' specific opinions, as mentioned above, are aimed at respecting public opinion and maintaining the integrity of the country. In order to fulfill their mission, they have decided to attend the meeting as scheduled, with no turning back, so as not to fail the trust of the people.

### Mayor Inspects the Seawall

[Report from this Newspaper] The seawall in Pudong, Shanghai, is severely damaged, posing a great danger. Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau is extremely concerned about this. Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, he specially invited Mayor Qian, Deputy Mayor He, Ma Shaohao, Director of the United Relief Shanghai District, Shi Konghuai, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, relevant authorities, and newspaper reporters to conduct an on-site inspection. They departed from the pier of the Bund Waterside Hotel on the municipal government yacht "Xidu" and sailed directly to Gaoqiao.

After arriving at Gaoqiao, they boarded three cars and headed straight to the former seaside bathing area. Along the way, Mayor Qian personally observed the situation with the locals, who were overjoyed and shouted slogans to welcome him. The police station also played music to welcome them. The seaside bathing area was desolate, and the scenery was completely changed. The seawall had been in disrepair for many years, causing it to lean and collapse, posing a danger to nearby houses. According to local residents, seawater often flooded the [unclear] during high tide, forcing them to evacuate temporarily. However, they could not allow the fertile land left by their ancestors to be sacrificed to the floods.

At noon, Mayor Qian and others returned to Shanghai due to urgent matters, while the rest of the group continued to inspect the 15-mile seawall, which had as many as eight breaches and was extremely dangerous. According to Director Zhao, the emergency repair project may begin within two weeks and is expected to be completed before the end of September. Otherwise, the coastal farmlands of Pudong will be unimaginable. The repair cost will be 300 million yuan, which will be borne by the municipal government, the United Relief, and the Executive Yuan Relief in equal shares.

It is said that the construction of this seawall dates back to the Southern Song Dynasty and has been passed down to this day, but it stopped after August 13th. There are still stone tablets along the coast for examination. The tour concluded at 7:30 PM and they returned to Shanghai.

### Tight Gunfire on Fuzhou Road: Deserter Killed for Resisting Arrest

[Report from this Newspaper] Guo Xunzhang, a 30-year-old sergeant from Hebei Province and a member of the Pacification and Discipline Corps of the Jinghu Garrison Command, deserted on the 26th after selling public property. He fled to Shanghai and hid at No. 55 Qichang Hotel, Zhejiang Road, Hankou Road. The leader of the third team of the corps, Captain Liang, learned of this and came to Shanghai yesterday with a soldier named Zhang Chaolong to the hotel. They confronted him for several hours. It was not until 9:30 PM that they tricked him out and walked together to the entrance of Xiaoguanghan at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Fuzhou Road. A traffic police officer directing traffic saw two men in military uniforms (Liang and Zhang) holding guns, escorting a man in a dark Chinese tunic suit (Guo) from north to south. Suspecting something was amiss, he stepped forward to inquire. Before he could finish speaking, the man in the tunic suit fled, pulled out a Mauser pistol, and fired wildly at Liang and Zhang. Fortunately, they were alert and dodged quickly, avoiding being hit. They also returned fire. The two sides fought fiercely, firing over 50 shots. Bullets flew everywhere, sounding like firecrackers. At the same time, members of the security corps guarding nearby, Zhang Jianjiang and Yang Bingxiang, also helped chase him. The deserter Guo Xunzhang was shot in the head, feet, abdomen, and other places and collapsed at the Southeast Hongqing Restaurant at No. 99 Hubei Road and died. Zhang Chaolong and others seized a Mauser pistol with serial number 30916 and 20 rounds of ammunition from the dead man's hand, and two wallets were found in his pockets. During the gunfire, a pedestrian named Lu Fuhao (23 years old, residing at No. 25 Hamilton Mansion, Jiangxi Road) was wounded in the left leg by a stray bullet. Guo's body and the injured person were taken to Renji Hospital by police car.

### Inspector Zhang Returns to the Ministry After Inspecting Education in Jiangsu Province

Shanghai's Secondary School Buildings and Equipment are Excellent

Local Education Funds are Insufficient Due to Exemption from Land Tax

[Report from Nanjing by This Newspaper] Zhang Xiang, an inspector from the Ministry of Education, recently returned to Nanjing to report to the Ministry of Education on the educational inspection of Jiangsu, which lasted for more than a month. According to Inspector Zhang's inspection of primary and secondary school education in Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Kunshan, Nantong, and other places, as well as provincial secondary and primary schools in Shanghai, the reporter asked about his impressions of the inspection, and he replied as follows:

Provincial Schools Regarding provincial schools, the Shanghai Provincial High School's school buildings were newly built in Longhua before the war and are grand in scale, almost surpassing Nankai University. During the occupation, it was converted into an internment camp for British and American expatriates, so 70-80% of the buildings are intact. The factory equipment was preserved because the head of the engineering department was able to find a way to avoid enemy targets and relocate the equipment properly. Machinery ordered from Europe and the United States before the war arrived during the war and remains unopened to this day. Therefore, the school's equipment, if properly reorganized and restored, has considerable potential for development. As for the school buildings of secondary schools, normal schools, and vocational schools in Zhenjiang and Suzhou, many have been damaged, and their vitality will be difficult to restore for some time. Although there are 170 million yuan in educational reconstruction funds, the 50 units of the provincial education authorities are mostly allocated for repairs and are insufficient for reconstruction.

Local Education Because of this year's exemption from land tax, local education funds are scarce, resulting in teacher living allowances of only 24,000 yuan (Zhenjiang) or even 16,000 yuan (Kunshan), and base salaries are only calculated at 70 times, which is not enough to live on. Schools have no choice but to collect miscellaneous fees or subsidies, ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 yuan per student, to supplement the funds. This may not be in accordance with the law, but it is really a last resort. Fortunately, the parents of the students are able to understand this situation, and the teachers are able to endure hardship and persevere in their lives and adhere to their posts. There are bound to be problems with teacher qualifications. Except in Nantong, where there are many qualified normal school students due to the promotion of normal schools by Zhang Jian in the past, most primary schools in Tongyi still have qualified normal school graduates. Zhenjiang is closer to the capital, and those with sufficient ability to become teachers have mostly moved to neighboring counties for higher-paying jobs, affecting the quality of teachers, which is slightly lacking in uniformity. For the sake of future education, teachers' salaries should be raised and protected by law.

### Anhui Education Department Orders All Counties to Strengthen the Practice of Students at Simplified Normal Schools

### French Educational Reform Plan

— Translated by Hu Pinqing

The special feature of today's France is the profound and sincere desire for reform. Among all the matters that people discuss, one is the issue of education: "Our house is on fire, but there is a piece of furniture that needs to be rescued, and that is the intelligence of our children." We often like to say that French middle schools and universities are factories for manufacturing fools and parasites, but in fact, the graduates of French schools are no worse than others. This is because the French like to belittle themselves, are dissatisfied with reality, and hope to achieve perfection.

Now people have a new concept in education. After two wars, the French deeply know that they must make the best use of everything and make the best use of everyone's talents.

Therefore, Professor Langevin and others presented an educational reform plan to the Constituent Assembly in February. The main purpose is to enable every young person to have the opportunity to develop his talents as much as possible and to promote compulsory education at all levels.

In the educational reform plan, one of the most important points is to eliminate the traditional degree system. This kind of degree is a symbol of the end of secondary education, because this system has many drawbacks. A young person often lives in fear in order to cope with the degree exam. They only bury themselves in their studies, so that they lose their thinking and curiosity. This secondary education system not only prevents the natural development of intelligence, but is also very unfair, because at the end of the study period, the exam is held in the school, and the examiner is a teacher who knows the students well.

The original system was that after graduating from middle school, students could directly enter the university without taking an exam. However, most people feel that the level of recent middle school graduates is not high enough, so Langevin advocates setting up a "three-level" system at the university. Students who transfer to the "third level" need to take an entrance exam. Some of the students in the "third level" are preparing to enter the Higher Normal School and various art schools, and others are entering ordinary universities. The university graduation exam is not held separately by each school, but is a unified exam held by all universities in the country.

Finally, there is the "fourth level", which is the real higher education. Only a few universities have fourth-level education, and the purpose is to cultivate scientific talents. Fourth-level education focuses on the natural development of intelligence, and there are no restrictions on exams and degrees.

These are the main points of the Langevin educational reform plan. Its main purpose is to develop students' thinking and intelligence, so that they are not restricted by textbooks and exams.

### Bank of China Supplies Without Restriction Gold Price Turns Flat After Rising Recovers 90,000 Yuan Lower Than Before Allotment Price Changed to 1.85 Million

Yesterday, speculators made a desperate gamble, which caused President Bei of the Bank of China to be in a bitter battle. The allotment was 1180 bars, and the price was raised to 1.85 million. The speculative psychology initially achieved great success, thinking that the future was unlimited. Those who borrowed money to play the stock market saw that the situation was not good, and short squeezes arose, so that after 10 o'clock, the price was shouted to a high of 2 million, creating a new record. Under this crisis, the Bank of China had to use the last resort, declaring an allotment price of 1.85 million, and continuing to register and supply without restriction. The tide of rising wind began to change and fall back. Those who saw the opportunity to escape emerged, almost ending at a low price, and the fiery and enthusiastic situation gradually became calm. The morning opening was still raised to beyond the 1.9 million mark. After the opening, the price gradually fell back from 1.94 million, struggling between 1.83 million and 1.86 million around 10 o'clock. The allotment price of the Bank of China was announced, raised to 1.85 million, and the buyers were quite satisfied. The general sellers of gold to buy stocks were on the verge of desperation, fearing that the Bank of China would be defeated, and that a step-by-step rise would develop, and the long side would have the opportunity to take advantage of it, making every effort to force a short squeeze. So, shortly after the allotment, the price jumped to a new peak above 1.97 million. Some of those who were anxious to make up for it even traded at a price of 2 million. At this point, the pressure on the Bank of China increased again and again, hoping to turn the tide, and the recovery began. On the one hand, it was also reported that the Bank of China could continue to supply without restriction at the original price of 1.85 million on the same day. The high-spirited bulls began to feel tight and did not dare to do as they pleased. At the same time, the silver root, which was looser in the morning, gradually tightened after that, so that those who sold gold to buy stocks fell back to within 1.8 million at noon before slightly stabilizing. However, the recovery power was weaker, and it was difficult to exceed the allotment price after that. The long side continued to close positions, and continued to fall weakly to below 1.75 million in the afternoon. As a result, the closing price was 90,000 yuan lower than before, and the decoration gold was listed at 190,000 yuan. The sales of patterned silver in Jiangbei resumed vigorously, rising to 1,800 yuan. Silver dollars were around 1,100 yuan. The secret break of silver roots was erratic, and the interest rate ranged from 1.6 cents to 2 cents. In the afternoon, it was even more chaotic, and some even shouted as high as more than 2 cents.

### Public Debt Continues to Decline Slightly Speculative Nature Clearly Revealed

The trend of public debt followed in the footsteps of the Chinese stock market. Speculative funds withdrew and turned to gold, so that it wanted to rise but lacked stamina in the middle, and finally ended at a low price. Tong Bing opened at 6,100 yuan in the morning, and stepped up to 6,800 yuan after opening. Speculative funds shifted to gold, so that the long side sold off in unison. At noon, it fell to 5,600 yuan. As a result, the closing price continued to fall 550 yuan lower than before. Due to the time constraints, Jia, Yi, Ding, and Wu only fell 250 yuan.

### US Dollars Follow the Gold Market As a Result, the Price Was Squeezed Down by 200

The US dollar is not as sharp as gold. It is heard that the Bank of China has recently simplified the procedures and quickly approved those seeking to settle US exchange. Legitimate applications from importers are convenient for settlement, and unqualified goods have also calmed down slightly, so that the US dollar has completely shifted with the gold market. The exchange rate for gold has also been pulled up to 725 yuan per ten taels. The morning opening retreated from 2,700 yuan to 2,550. Buyers maintained support at the low, and the gold price indirectly boosted the price, and rose again to 2,750 yuan after 10 o'clock. When the gold market changed color, it broke into 2,500 yuan at noon. Although there was some slight struggle after entering, the gold price had fallen back again and again, and it finally ended at a low price. As a result, the closing price was 200 yuan lower than before. Hong Kong banknotes were stable but tired and fell back 15 yuan. Hong Kong Power Law fell slightly by 5 yuan, and the US exchange rate was still flat.

### Spot Cotton Trading Progresses

Yesterday, the New York American Cotton Telegraph reported a decline of 8 to 13 pounds, with the near-term at US$27.76, the far-term at 27.90, and the Mitterlin spot at 28.41. The local spot cotton trading has seen further progress. Private yarn mills such as Hongzhang and Shenxin's 16th Factory have made purchases, with a total of 1,200 to 1,300 bales traded. The market price of seed cotton is the most sought-after, rising by 3,500 yuan alone.

### Bituminous Coal Dust Gradually Active

Outer-port merchants are still actively searching for bituminous coal dust, and trading is gradually becoming active. In particular, Kailuan No. 2's Pudong wharf receipts are the most popular, with transaction prices between 160,000 yuan and 165,000 yuan, while the spot price in Shanghai is still only 170,000 yuan. Another 7,000 tons of Hongji medium-sized white coal continues to be shipped from Annam and is currently being unloaded and transported. In addition, the People's Livelihood Coal Management Office has now completed the handling of civilian coal for cooking, which was originally set at 5,000 tons. There are still more than 1,000 tons left. The remaining coal will be distributed to fellow coal industry service workers at a price even cheaper than the flat price, so the market price of white coal may fall again.

### Sharp Fluctuations in the Yarn Market

Yesterday, the yarn market experienced a sharp rise and fall. Initially, continuing the upward momentum of the previous day, it rose in a straight line. 20-count yarn once reached a new high of 1.38 million, and 16-count Guangming yarn also jumped to 1.1 million. In an instant, dealers profited and began selling off their holdings. The former then fell back to 1.26-1.27 million, and the latter to 1.02-1.03 million. This drastic reversal was rare in recent days. All yarn types closed at the day's low, resulting in a final market situation similar to yesterday, with no major changes. Although transaction volumes were not large, the market was relatively stable.

### Significant Rise and Slight Correction in the Sugar Market

Yesterday, the sugar market, after several days of excessive price increases, saw sluggish sales, with some sellers pulling back. As a result, market momentum flattened. The guild's initial price quote in the morning was 69,000 yuan, which then dropped to 68,000 yuan, 67,000 yuan, and 66,000 yuan. Finally, it rebounded slightly to 67,500 yuan. The morning trend remained flat at 66,000 to 67,000 yuan. These were all guild warehouse receipts, which were 2,000 to 3,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Other spot goods also saw price easing.

### Northern and Southern Goods Market Rebound

The Northern and Southern goods market had been weak for a long time. Recently, due to the rebound in other commodity prices, it also rose. For example, dried longan has risen by more than 10,000 yuan. Yesterday, Xinghua longan even exceeded the 100,000 yuan mark. Longkou vermicelli rose to 90,000 yuan, and high-quality hand-picked jujubes were priced at 45,000 yuan. The first batch of new spring sprouts was once priced as high as 200,000 yuan, but recently more supply has arrived, and the current price is 140,000 yuan. Fuling pickled mustard tubers are priced at 72,000 yuan.

### Grain Loans and Rice Awaiting Further Instructions; Rice Prices Stabilized at a High Level

[Our Report] The rice market resumed trading yesterday morning, with good order and firm prices. The price was approximately 42,000 yuan per dan, and trading was brisk. According to the market负责人 (fù zé rén, person in charge), about 5,000 dan of rice were registered at the market yesterday. The rice purchased with the rice loan will not be traded on the market but will be directly supplied to rice stores to meet retail needs. However, the Grain Administration Commissioner's Office had not yet received the rice yesterday, so distribution may take some time. The Grain Administration Commissioner's Office issued Public Notice No. 11 in the rice market yesterday, stating that all rice purchased by grain merchants with loans must be reviewed and have sales methods determined by the Office in conjunction with the Municipal Provisional Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Social Affairs Bureau before being announced to the public.

Yesterday, the rice market supply was acceptable, and warehouse inventory was average. There was little excitement at noon, and no significant gains or losses. It is necessary to observe future market changes. After a sharp drop in flour prices, warehouse inventory slightly recovered, rising by 300 to 400 yuan. However, miscellaneous brands of flour remained flat. The oil market remained soft, continuing to weaken by 500 to 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran fell by another 200 to 300 yuan, and soybean cake gradually decreased by 300 to 400 yuan. The yellow bean customer market was suspended, and local merchants were picking up the higher prices. The market was rising rapidly and then dropping. High-quality goods held steady, while medium and low-quality goods fell by more than 2,000 yuan, with limited transactions. Raw peanuts were similarly priced, while red sorghum prices dropped by a little over 1,000 yuan with no buyers. Corn also decreased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The peak for all grains has passed, and the market is now in a state of fluctuation.

### American Goods Imported in Succession: Wheat...Fruit...Iron Wire

The Pacific, belonging to the 天祥 (Tiānxiáng) Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai for the first time after the war, bringing over 9,000 boxes of oranges and other fruits, 450 tons of iron wire, and over 200 boxes of cigarette paper, totaling approximately 5,400 tons of miscellaneous goods. In addition, the company's 脱库拉 (Tuōkùlā)号, which loaded over 8,000 tons of wheat from the United States, arrived at the Wusongkou yesterday noon. If it could not be imported yesterday, it was scheduled to enter the Huangpu River this morning, with plans to dock at buoys 39 and 40 for unloading.

### New Cantonese Rice Quotation: 68,000 per Stone; Price Control Measures Ineffective

[United Press Guangzhou, 29th] Although rain has been beneficial to crops, the rice market here has skyrocketed to a new high of 68,000 yuan per stone today. All price control measures have been ineffective, and the impact on people's livelihood will be severe.

### Stable Leather Market Conditions

[Our Report] The leather industry is one of the four major light industries. Since the victory against Japan, domestic leather manufacturers have faced a lack of raw materials, high expenses, and heavy costs. Furthermore, European and American leather has been continuously imported, and its price is even lower, causing a significant blow to domestically produced leather. Many manufacturers have been selling at a loss, making it difficult to maintain operations. It is now known that a large quantity of European and American leather raw materials are about to arrive, which will reduce the cost of leather production and prevent further losses. Therefore, the recent leather market conditions have gradually stabilized.

### Silk Market: To Be Seized by Rayon; Different Views Between the British and Americans

[Reuters, 30th, by Michael Smale] American sources recently expressed the opinion that the pre-war silk market has been permanently seized by rayon, and believe that if silk can continue to gain a foothold in the Western market, it should quickly take advantage of the current shortage of fabrics. However, British silk merchants do not agree. Manufacturers here point out that similar speculation occurred after the First World War, when rayon was still in its early stages of development. However, between 1924 and 1939, silk consumption increased sevenfold. According to a director of a merchant firm here, butter and margarine are similar situations. Citizens buy the latter because there is more of it, not because it is cheaper. Similarly, if silk production is relatively abundant and prices are fair, it is inevitable that citizens will choose silk over rayon.

### Floating Capital Favors the Gold Market; Chinese and Foreign Stocks Both See Decline

Although Chinese stocks showed signs of activity, the speculative power focused on gold, and the efforts were insufficient. They had no choice but to continue to sell stocks and buy gold. At the same time, the gold market was booming, and those who borrowed money to play the stock market were forced to cover their positions urgently. Under these two-pronged circumstances, the chips finally loosened. After opening, there was a rebound. Yongsheng Yarn reached a high of 6,100 yuan, Meiya 5,100 yuan, Jingfu 505 yuan, Xinguang 440 yuan, and Qinxing 345 yuan. Subsequently, they fell into a gradual decline. Near noon, the low prices were Yongsheng Yarn 5,600 yuan, Meiya 4,700 yuan, Jingfu 465 yuan, Xinguang 395 yuan, and Qinxing 315 yuan. Then it stabilized slightly. The noon closing was generally flat compared to the previous closing. Xinguang, Qinxing, Xinhe, Zhongfang, Da Zhonghua, and Rongfeng all saw slight increases. Some stock market players tended towards smaller old stocks, choosing cheap ones. Both the Sino-French Underwear Company saw rises due to people buying them up. However, Xin Asia failed to enjoy the same treatment due to the absence of the leader. Old stocks continued to make progress. The situation with foreign stocks was no exception. Floating capital was flowing rapidly towards gold. Yisha once broke through the 15 mark, resulting in a decline of about half a percent compared to the previous closing. The scattered asking prices in the aftermarket slightly increased the prices of both Chinese and foreign stocks.

### Tea Market Revival

The tea market, which was on its last breath, gradually saw a revival yesterday. The old goods of various qualities, in addition to the Suzhou merchants continuing to quietly absorb them, also saw increased demand from Tianjin and other regions. At the same time, local shops also saw sporadic sales. Prices, however, remained stagnant. According to news from Tianjin merchants, they are planning to start a large-scale purchase of green tea soon, collecting as much as possible. As for the new Longjing tea, the supply continues to arrive, but the market sentiment remains stable. However, due to the varying quality, the transaction volume was lower than the previous day.

### Silk Weaken Again

Yesterday, the price of the rayon market fluctuated uncertainly and eventually declined. No. 120 Tianjin Bridge opened at 1.8 million yuan and closed at 1.77 million yuan. It had previously been bid at 1.82 million yuan, but it was even lower in the afternoon, trading at 1.7 million yuan, which was 150,000 yuan less than the previous day. Factory silk, with a high uniformity of 81 points from foreign firms, was offered at 2.58 million yuan, but the rest was generally flat. However, the general sentiment was quite weak. The silk goods market saw slight increases in prices yesterday. Meiya quilt covers rose by 40,000 yuan per hundred, and Dacheng checkered crepe rose by 30 yuan per yard.

### Tung Oil Market Slightly Firmer

Commodity prices have generally been trending upward in recent weeks, but tung oil has remained unchanged. Although market sentiment has been slightly firmer, it cannot withstand the repeated telegram reports of price drops in the Hankou market. Yesterday, a telegram from Hankou stated that white tung oil had fallen, reportedly to 50,500 yuan, and the situation remained depressed. Therefore, even if the Hangzhou market appears tight due to scarce supply, prices will still flatten out if the supply increases slightly. Shenxing currently sells white tung oil at 72,000 yuan per dan, West Auxiliary Hongjiang oil at 85,000 yuan per barrel, and local Hong oil at 60,000 yuan.

### Woolen Cloth Orders About to Arrive

The woolen cloth market remained flat and weak yesterday. Apart from some sporadic sales of seasonal summer white goods, there were no significant transactions. Standard prices mostly remained unchanged. News from Baoda Foreign Firm indicated that the foreign goods initially ordered would arrive in Shanghai in succession within ten days. Therefore, those who placed orders in the industry are all buying US dollar tickets. It is reported that most of the goods being shipped are seasonal goods for autumn and winter sales.

### Spring Cocoon Loan of 20 Billion; Planned Purchase of 80,000 Dan of Dried Cocoons; Worth US$20-30 Million

The Four Banks Joint Office's cocoon loan, approved by President Song, is 20 billion yuan. It is designated that, in addition to the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, the loan can be co-managed by the China Trust and Savings Bureau and commercial banks in Shanghai, which can form a syndicate to provide loans in shares. The syndicate will jointly form this year's Spring Cocoon Management Office with the China Silk Company, assigning staff to various cocoon-producing areas to closely supervise the loan's approval, recovery, auditing, and collateral management to prevent the loan from being used for other purposes. The cocoon collection business will be handled by the China Silk Company in conjunction with various factories in their respective producing areas. As for the price of cocoon collection, it will be calculated based on the actual cost of the cocoon farmers, plus a legitimate profit, so that cocoon farmers can benefit from this cocoon price to encourage rural industry production.

To reduce manufacturers' production costs, the loan management office plans to negotiate with the fuel authorities to allocate fuel coal to factories at official prices. It is reported that the China Silk Company will be responsible for manufacturing technical guidance to improve the quality of raw silk in various factories. Cocoons with diseased silkworms will not be purchased and will be burned immediately to prevent adulteration and maintain standard quality.

As the cocoon season approaches, the syndicate is actively preparing and will be established in the coming days. The loan management office plans to start operations in early May. This year, the planned purchase amount of cocoons is 80,000 dan of dried cocoons (equivalent to 240,000 dan of fresh cocoons). According to the silk industry, these 80,000 dan of dried cocoons can produce 17,000 to 20,000 dan of raw silk (the cost of raw materials, processing fees, etc., for each dan of silk is approximately 2.5 million yuan; the current Shanghai price is 2.7 million yuan (referring to 83 points)). At the current New York silk market price of US$11.50 to US$12 per pound for 83-point silk, the total sales value can be US$20 to 30 million. Therefore, after the loan is approved and issued, it will greatly benefit the replenishment of foreign exchange reserves.

Spring and Autumn

### The Inevitable White Man (Continued)

— Original by Jack London, Translated by 鲁莽 (Lǔmǎng)

"The four sailors, including Sachsdoff, were scrubbing the stern deck. The fifth sailor, holding a rifle, was standing guard near the water filler at the base of the main mast. I was going to add some water to the jib boom. Just as I was walking to get the water hose, I heard a gunshot from the shore. I stood up and looked. Something hit the back of my head, almost knocking me out and knocking me to the deck. I immediately realized something was happening; but just before I was knocked to the deck, I heard the rifle fire on the rowboat, and quickly turning my head, I only caught a glimpse of the sailor standing guard. Two big black men were holding his arms, and another black man was chopping his head with a battle axe from behind.

"I can still see clearly now, the water filler, the main mast, the group holding him, the axe chopping his head from behind, and everything shining in the sunlight. I was imagining that death. It seemed to take a very long time for the axe to come down. I watched it come down, and the legs in the water buckled and squatted down. The two black men held him up, and he was chopped twice more. Then I was chopped twice more in the head, and I certainly thought I was dead. The bastards who chopped me must have thought so too. I had no strength to move, and I lay there watching them cut off the guard's head. I must say they did it very quickly. They were old hands at this sort of thing.

"The rifle fire on the rowboat had stopped, and I was sure they were out of bullets and everything was over. It was only a matter of time before they came back to chop off my head. They were clearly taking the sailors' heads on the stern. Heads are valuable in Malaita, especially white men's heads. They have their respected places in the saltwater natives' canoe houses. I don't know what special decorative effect the jungle natives get from them, but they value them as much as the saltwater natives.

"I had a vague intention of escaping, so I used my hands and elbows to crawl to the edge of the winch, where I managed to pull myself up. From there I could see the stern and saw three heads on top of the cabin—the heads of the sailors who had been taking my orders for months. The black men saw me stand up and charged at me. I reached for my pistol and found they had taken it. I can't say I was afraid. I had been close to death several times, but it seemed I had never been closer than this time. I was half dizzy and it seemed nothing mattered.

"The leading black man was armed with a butcher knife from the ship's kitchen, and he made an ugly face like an orangutan as he prepared to cut me down. But that was never accomplished. He suddenly fell to the deck, and I saw blood gushing from his mouth. I vaguely heard a rifle firing and continuing to fire. The black men fell one after another. My consciousness began to clear, and I noticed that every shot hit. Every time the rifle fired, a black man fell. I sat down on the deck, beside the winch, and looked up. Hidden in the masthead was Sachsdoff. How he managed to climb up there, I can't imagine, because he took two Winchester rifles up with him, and I don't know how many ammunition belts; and now he was doing the only thing in the world he was suited to do.

"I saw the shooting and slaughter, but I had never seen anyone shoot like him. I sat by the winch and watched the scene. I was weak and a little dizzy, and it all seemed like a dream. Bang, bang, bang, bang, his rifle firing, Pak, pak, pak, pak, black men falling to the deck. It was a little surprising to see them fall. After they charged at me, about a dozen had fallen, and they seemed paralyzed; but he never stopped working his gun. At this time, many canoes and two rowboats came over from the coast, carrying breech-loading rifles and Winchester rifles, which they had seized from the two rowboats. They all fired rapidly at Sachsdoff, which was truly extraordinary. (To be continued)

### Impressions of Two Exhibitions

— 溫肇桐 (Wēn Zhàotóng)

1. The First Joint Exhibition of the Shanghai Art Writers Association

Painting is the use of a certain medium to express the author's emotions, thoughts, and imagination. The choice of medium is only a necessary means of expression, and it is by no means a mechanical determination that only brushes, ink, and rice paper should be used for painting within the country, and anything else is a radical innovation. We can prove this with the First Joint Exhibition of the Shanghai Art Writers Association held at the Daxin Gallery from the 22nd of last month.

The gentlemen of the Shanghai Art Writers Association each used their favorite materials to create paintings, including so-called Chinese painting, oil painting, watercolor, sketches, woodcuts, cartoons, and patterns. We did not feel that everything other than Chinese painting was inappropriate. On the contrary, we can see that each author carefully selected materials and carefully used the tools to achieve the effect of artistic expression.

In the First Joint Exhibition, we can also clearly distinguish two major types of artistic tendencies. One type is the works of writers who returned to Shanghai from the inland areas, which are full of a realistic atmosphere. The other type is the writers who stayed in Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War, who are working on the skills of expression.

The former, because they have experienced actual life, made the content of painting absolutely exclude fantasy. At the same time, in their works, what we should pay more attention to is the establishment of a new expression technique that abandons Chinese and Western paintings. There are firm and dense lines, as well as the light and color of yin and yang, and even a grand and magnificent style. It seems that it has reached the path of creation, and is an emerging national painting. Because the content is close to reality, perhaps it is quite appropriate to call it New Realist Painting. This may not be the new life that the Anti-Japanese War gave to art. If the works of the writers who stayed in Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War are compared with the former only in terms of content, most of the works feel insufficient. However, the cultivation of skills is, after all, an important factor in artistic expression. Therefore, we should also pay attention to the works that are composed of superb and excellent techniques, forgiving their inability to expand their scope of life.

2. Zhang Naiyi's Oil Painting Solo Exhibition

Zhang Naiyi's oil paintings exhibited at the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association are following a road of technical research, and are also following the road taken by the emerging paintings of the early twentieth century in Europe. From the perspective of artistic research, it is correct and gratifying not to take the path of rigid and dull depictions of form.

The philosopher Nietzsche once distinguished art into two major types of opposition, namely, the Apollo type and the Dionysus type. The former expresses reason, while the latter expresses emotion. Cézanne, Derain, Picasso, and others can be included in the former type, while Matisse and Vlaminck belong to the latter type. The former often constructs works through careful thinking, while the latter is often an expression of momentary emotions. Therefore, rational art emphasizes form, while emotional art emphasizes color.

Because Zhang has a precious talent, a keen sense, and abundant emotions, his works often tend to be spontaneous works made up of a unique composition of colors. In the words of Chinese painters, it is: "What is meant by being born unintentionally is often when one concentrates one's spirit and thoughts, looks around and moves one's wrist, and at first does not intend to be like this, but suddenly it is like this. If it is said to be sufficient, then it is not really sufficient; if it is said to be insufficient, then there is nothing to add. It is uniquely obtained outside of the sentiment and interest of the brush and ink, which is the bursting forth of the heavenly opportunity." - Zhang Geng's "Pushan on Painting," so it should be included in the category of emotion. "Dahlias," Wang Lan, "River Trees," etc., are indeed clear evidence.

Unfortunately, Zhang only devotes himself to color and brushwork, and his grasp of the sense of form seems to be insufficient. We hope that Zhang will do more research on sketching, especially research on human body composition. If you do not want to deny that art should be close to reality, then strong form, plus sufficient color and brushwork, with such an expressive effect, will it become the most excellent painting.

### Double Flying Together (31)

— Zhao Qingge

(8)

Since Old Master Mo passed away, the Mo family has been at peace!

Madam Mo no longer has anyone to quarrel with, and there is nothing in this house that she dislikes or hates! Life is so peaceful that she sometimes feels lonely, perhaps even a little uneasy. This unease stems from her understanding that Old Master Mo's illness was caused by her; during his illness, she did not fulfill even the slightest responsibility of care; and even after his death, she initially did not shed a single tear, only sobbing a few times because she saw the children crying so sadly. However, she would never tell anyone about these feelings. Moreover, she constantly complained about how Old Master Mo had wronged her when he was alive. These complaints aroused the children's dissatisfaction, and Bao Ling once protested to her, saying, "No matter how bad Dad was, he is dead now, so stop constantly complaining about him!" Bao Ling's words made her quite ashamed! She knew that the children could not forgive her indifference towards Old Master Mo. In order to win over the children's affections, she henceforth avoided mentioning Old Master Mo. She secretly repented to Old Master Mo while concentrating her efforts on reorganizing the household affairs.

The children lost Old Master Mo, and each of them was like a lost lamb. Especially Li Hua, she would start to cry as soon as she picked up a book! She hadn't finished reciting "The Daughter's Classic" before Old Master Mo left her! No one else taught her, and Bao Ling was rarely at home, and was neither as patient as Old Master Mo, nor could he explain things as clearly as Old Master Mo. In addition, Madam Mo forbade her from studying and wanted her to learn needlework together with Li Yun, so she severed her connection with books from then on! All this made her unhappy and made her deeply mourn Old Master Mo!

Bao Ling was about to graduate from junior high school. Originally, when Old Master Mo was alive, he had promised him that he would let him finish junior high school and go on to senior high school no matter what. Graduating from senior high school was equivalent to being a "Juren" in the late Qing Dynasty, and then he could become a teacher and support himself. Because Old Master Mo did not want his son to follow in his own footsteps, he never planned to let Bao Ling go into government service after graduating from senior high school. Bao Ling understood Old Master Mo's intentions. Old Master Mo's painful confession seven years ago had been firmly engraved in Bao Ling's mind and had deeply influenced him. Therefore, he piously decided to fulfill Old Master Mo's expectations in the future. However, now Old Master Mo was dead! Old Master Mo and his own fantasies had all turned into bubbles! He could no longer go on to senior high school, as Madam Mo had already stated that he would not continue his education after finishing junior high school. Because there was not enough money to support his education, he could not become a teacher, and naturally, there was no question of "entering government service." But what was he going to do? He was very confused! He was also very distressed! So since Old Master Mo passed away, he left early and returned late, spending all day in school. On the one hand, he wanted to make the most of this brief educational opportunity to study hard; on the other hand, he was afraid to go home, back to that house without Old Master Mo!

### Education Loan Still Not Received Student Letter Questions Association, Requests Public Reply

Mr. Editor: I am a student, and today I am saying a few words from a third party perspective:

I started registering for this "Education Loan" before the start of this semester, but so far there has been no news. Now the second installment of tuition has increased again. The "Education Loan" that I have been eagerly waiting for has not been issued yet. Many poor students are worried about not being able to pay their tuition. I do not know when they will be able to receive their expected "Education Loan". Please answer, has the "Education Loan" been fully issued? Furthermore, the school has issued blank receipts for the "Education Loan" to the general beneficiaries, asking them to fill them out, and also requiring parents and guarantors to sign and seal them, and they have been informed of the specified amount of assistance. The general beneficiaries thought that they could get the money as soon as they submitted the receipts, but they have been waiting for about a month and there is still no news. What does this mean? The "money" has not been received, but they are busy writing receipts first. Is this what the "Education Loan Committee" has specified? (Reader: Ji Si)

Reply: We have received your letter of April 23, along with a letter from reader Ji Si. Thank you for your kindness. After investigation, the applications for loans from students in various schools have been approved and entrusted to the schools for distribution. If the student knows that a certain student has completed all the procedures and the school has not forwarded the loan, please provide the real name and the school attended, and we will thoroughly investigate. This is a reply to the Social Services Department of Shen Bao (attached return letter). Respectfully, Zhou Feicheng.

### Replies to Readers

Wang Jingquan asks: My nose is often blocked, and there are green sticky clumps with a fishy odor. I have suffered from this disease for nearly ten years. I first consulted at the Red Cross Hospital, and they said it was atrophic rhinitis. At that time, there was no radical cure in medicine and it did not affect my health. I would like to ask if there is now a cure and a specific medicine?

[Reply from Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine]: There is no special treatment for atrophic rhinitis. Crusts and fishy odor can be treated with nasal washes, using a 3% saline solution. The crusts can be removed by a otolaryngologist using a nasal packing method, which often has miraculous effects. You can also try vitamin A, C, and D preparations, Prostiguim, and hormones.

Zhang Qiwei asks: My father suffered from severe neurasthenia before the war due to excessive work. He was treated by famous doctors in Nanjing, but he was not cured. When the war broke out, he fled to Lihuang, the provincial capital of Anhui. His illness was cured during the escape, so he continued to serve in the education field. Until last year, due to excessive work, the old illness relapsed. Because I think your newspaper has always been enthusiastic about social services and has a long and glorious history, I have listed the symptoms below and ask for a cure. If necessary, my father can also come to Shanghai for treatment. According to a friend, injections of Bayer's "Complon" (a) or "Optarson" can cure the disease and have special effects, but my father is very cautious, because he does not know their functions, he does not dare to use them rashly. Is it appropriate? I also ask for your advice.

[Reply from Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine]: It is more certain to come to Shanghai for treatment. The two injections you mentioned can be tried. It is best to have a blood test to check the source of the disease. You can try sulfate preparations and Touophosphan injections first.

Cao Ming asks: I have had an eye disease for more than ten years. The symptoms include squint, nearsightedness, and astigmatism. I am afraid of strong sunlight during the day and often tear easily. Recently, I have found it very difficult to read newspapers and books. I would like to ask if there are any specialist ophthalmologists in Shanghai who can treat the above symptoms completely or not. How much will it cost approximately? Also, I am currently a soldier, and I will be engaged in education work after I retire, so my financial strength can be imagined.

[Reply from Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine]: Strabismus can be treated with surgery, and astigmatism and nearsightedness can be corrected with glasses. Tearing and other symptoms may be caused by trachoma, which must be radically cured. Specialist ophthalmologists in Shanghai can be consulted. The cost of surgery should be discussed in person.

Lost Gold Ring: At around 7:30 AM on the 24th, on the Route 17 trolleybus at the intersection of Caishi Road and Kangti Road, a lady found a gold ring and handed it to ticket seller number 173. The owner can report the style and weight to collect it from the trolleybus company.

Lost and Found Book: On the morning of the 27th, a reader found a junior high school new chemistry textbook on Jiaozhou Road and West Beijing Road. The name on the cover is "Tao Moli". Please claim it at the Social Services Department of this newspaper.
