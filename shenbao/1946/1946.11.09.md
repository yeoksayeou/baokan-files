### Chairman Issues Order for National Ceasefire to Show Government's Peace and Tolerance; Officially Implemented from Noon on the 11th

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th, 8 PM] Chairman Chiang issued a ceasefire order to all military and political leaders on the 8th. From 12:00 noon on the 11th, all troops across the country will cease fighting and remain in their original defensive positions. The original order is as follows: Immediately upon receipt, Commander-in-Chief of the Army Headquarters, Gu; Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Headquarters, Gui; Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force Headquarters, Zhou; Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, Huang; Directors of all Headquarters; Directors of all Pacification Commissioner Offices; Commanders of all War Zones; Commander of the Capital Garrison; Commanders of all Pacification Zones; Commanders-in-Chief of all Army Groups; Commanders of all Garrison Commands; Chairmen and Mayors of all Provincial and Municipal Governments, and to be forwarded to all Army Commanders: Since the enemy's surrender last year, the government's consistent policy has been to strive for peaceful unification and democratic construction, to resolve domestic disputes through political means, and to lay the foundation for national revival before the National Assembly. Although the Communist forces first attacked our national army in various places, forcing us to implement self-defense, our established policy of political resolution has remained consistent. Therefore, we have repeatedly exercised restraint, resulting in two ceasefires in January and June of this year and the postponement of the National Assembly. In order to demonstrate the government's commitment to its original policy, we hereby issue another order to cease conflict. We hope that you will quickly relay this to your subordinates, ensuring that all troops across the country cease fighting from 12:00 noon on November 1st, and remain in their original defensive positions, to show the government's utmost sincerity in peace and tolerance. Please strictly abide by this order without fail. Chiang Chung-cheng, on the evening of the 8th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Peace talks reached their highest point of stagnation on the evening of the 7th, but took a sharp turn for the better on the morning of the 8th, and the situation immediately unfolded. At 2:30 PM, the government issued an order to cease military conflict, and at 6:00 PM, the Minister of Information held a press conference to announce the Chairman's statement on the issuance of the ceasefire order. Chinese and foreign journalists gathered at the Central Daily News building at 6:00 PM, waiting for Mr. Peng's arrival and preparing to film the event. The room was filled with a bright and cheerful atmosphere. At 5:50 PM, Peng arrived with the Chinese and English versions of the Chairman's statement and immediately announced it. The room was filled with the sound of cameras and flashing lights, creating a very grand atmosphere. After Peng finished reading, our reporter asked whether this kind of ceasefire was permanent. Peng said: Yes, if no one else attacks, we will never retaliate. The press conference ended at 7:10 PM.

### Chairman to Issue Special Statement Reaffirming the Scheduled Opening of the National Assembly and the Preservation of Seats for All Parties; Hoping the CCP Will Attend the Three-Person Meeting

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th, 7:10 PM] The Ministry of Information held an impromptu press conference at 6:50 PM on the 8th, where Minister Peng Xuepei read Chairman Chiang's statement, announcing that he had ordered the national army inside and outside the passes to cease military operations. The full text of Chairman Chiang's statement is as follows:

On October 16th of this year, I issued a statement on the government's handling of the current situation, including eight proposals as the basis for a ceasefire agreement. I originally hoped that this statement would receive a response from the CCP to achieve a comprehensive ceasefire. Now, on the eve of the opening of the National Assembly, I reiterate that the government's consistent policy is to promote domestic peace and national unity in order to achieve the goal of ending political tutelage and beginning constitutional government. The government sincerely hopes that our country can achieve lasting peace and political stability. To realize this hope, we have ordered the national army inside and outside the passes to cease all military actions, except those necessary for defending current locations.

According to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the National Assembly was originally scheduled to convene on May 5th of this year. However, the CCP and other parties refused to submit the names of their representatives. On July 4th, the government announced that the National Assembly would convene on November 12th, so that all parties could have four months to discuss and prepare. However, the various parties expressed disagreement, stating that the steps agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference to reorganize the government had not yet been implemented. However, I would like to explain that in the six months since the Political Consultative Conference closed, the general situation has changed greatly. Serious fighting broke out in the Northeast outside the passes and then spread to North China. The reorganization of the CCP's troops has not yet been implemented according to the agreed plan. Under these circumstances, the political agreement failed to achieve results. Now, the representatives legally elected to the National Assembly have reported as scheduled. The National Assembly cannot be postponed any longer, as this would increase political and military instability and deepen the suffering of the people. Moreover, convening the National Assembly is the only legal step for the government to return power to the people, and it cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, the government has decided that the National Assembly will convene as scheduled on November 12th.

### After the National Assembly Opens, the Ambassador Decides to Go to Beiping

[Reuters, Nanjing, Entry Date] Ambassador Stuart stated in response to a reporter's question on the 8th that he did not believe the National Assembly would be postponed. He added that once the National Assembly opened, he would implement his plan to go to Beiping, which had already been postponed three times.

### Negotiating a Ceasefire

My statement on October 16th already expressed the greatest degree of tolerance. I hope the CCP will accept it to resolve all outstanding issues. The government expects the CCP to follow the path of democracy with all parties, and that militarily, no political party should possess troops, and all troops should be national troops.

Therefore, the government has reserved the number of representatives that the CCP and other parties should attend in the National Assembly, still hoping that they will participate in the constitution-making at any time. At the same time, it hopes that the CCP will immediately send representatives to participate in the military three-person group meeting to discuss ceasefire measures based on the points raised in my October 16th statement, as well as the future allocation of troop locations, the restoration of transportation, and the reorganization and unification of troops, so that they can be implemented as soon as possible.

### The Question of Reorganizing the Government

Regarding the reorganization of the National Government Committee, we hope to reach an agreement as soon as possible so that it can be formally reorganized and established. As for the Executive Yuan, it is the institution actually responsible, and its reorganization must be even more cautious. Therefore, this major change cannot be made rashly until the National Assembly closes. Regarding the constitutional government, it intends to submit to the National Assembly the uncompleted revised draft of the Constitutional Draft Review Committee. Within six months after the National Assembly closes, a national general election will be held in accordance with the Constitution. All parties and the people of the country can freely participate in the election to produce the next National Assembly, which will exercise its statutory powers in accordance with the Constitution. Therefore, if any party has opinions on amending the Constitution in the next National Assembly, it can still propose amendments in accordance with the law. These few weeks are a crucial turning point in the rise and fall of the nation. If we can do our best, it will not be difficult to establish a strong, prosperous, and democratic China. We must overcome any prejudices, suspicions, and hatred, and transcend all difficulties to contribute to the interests of the entire people. Today, the most urgent need of the people of the country is peace and stability. I deeply hope that my party comrades, people from all parties, social elites, government colleagues, all officers and soldiers, and all relevant parties must unite sincerely and cooperate fully to achieve the goals of "political democratization" and "nationalization of the army" in a peaceful manner. (End)

### The CCP's View: The Prospects for Peace Talks Are Not Optimistic

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Communist Party representative held a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters at the Meiyuan New Village office at 11:00 PM on the 8th, expressing the following views on the Chairman's statement on the 8th: The National Government's unilateral announcement of the "cessation of other military actions" was not consulted with the Communist Party representatives beforehand, and the exception of "necessary for defending current locations" can still be used as an excuse for all military actions. All the political solutions proposed are contrary to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and its procedures. Therefore, the future of negotiations is not optimistic.

### Wu Tiecheng's Remarks

Hoping All Parties Will Continue to Strive for Peace

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Government representative Wu Tiecheng said to reporters after the Chairman issued his statement: Mr. Shao and I went to Shanghai last month to invite representatives from all parties to return to Nanjing, hoping to promote negotiations and achieve peace as soon as possible. After the representatives of all parties returned to Nanjing, they worked hard. It was once suggested that the Chairman make a concession to the eight principles. The government has repeatedly expressed restraint, but the Communist Party has not yet agreed, which is regrettable. Now that the National Assembly is about to convene, the government has automatically issued a ceasefire order. This kind of painstaking effort to love peace is witnessed by compatriots across the country. I hope that people from all parties will consider the overall situation, seize the opportunity, and continue to work for peace.

### The National Assembly Preparatory Committee Holds a Tea Party to Entertain Representatives Reporting from Various Locations; The Chairman Personally Attends to Meet with Everyone

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] As the opening of the National Assembly approaches, representatives from various places are enthusiastically reporting to Nanjing. Feeling that the national situation is uncertain, they all want to meet with the Chairman to state their opinions. After Hong Lanyou, the secretary of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, met with the Chairman on the evening of the 7th, it was decided that the Preparatory Committee would invite representatives who came to Nanjing to hold a tea party at the Lixing Society on the morning of the 8th, and respectfully request the Chairman to deliver a speech. From 8:00 AM, 600 representatives successively arrived and were hosted by Hong Lanyou, who also freely expressed their opinions. The Chairman arrived at 10:30 AM, and the entire venue stood up to pay their respects and applaud to welcome him. After taking their seats, Hong Lanyou first delivered a speech, saying briefly: The representatives have successively arrived in Nanjing and have given instructions on the various facilities of the Preparatory Committee, which is very grateful. The gentlemen have instructed us to convey their respects to the Chairman and hope to have the opportunity to visit him, which has been conveyed one by one. The Chairman gladly attended the talk on the 8th and gathered with the gentlemen. Please give instructions from the Chairman, and we also hope that the representatives will express their high opinions. After the report, representatives Wang Puhan, Liu Guanxun, Fang Shaoyun, Li Hongru, and Chen Zifeng expressed their opinions. The opinions expressed are summarized as follows: (1) Since the National Government has scheduled the opening of the National Assembly, it should be held as scheduled. The National Assembly is the only way to achieve peaceful unification. The colleagues hope that all parties and factions can participate. (2) The government has always adopted a consultative attitude, which the colleagues understand deeply. They hope that before the National Assembly is convened, if the parties concerned are sincere and submit a list of representatives, they can ask the government to follow its past attitude of generosity and tolerance, consider ceasing military actions, and continue the spirit of consultation, so that the National Assembly can be convened in a harmonious atmosphere. (3) In terms of the Constitution, it is hoped that it will not violate the principles of the Three People's Principles and the Five-Power Constitution. After listening to the opinions of the representatives, the Chairman stood up three times to deliver a speech, saying briefly: I am very pleased to be able to meet with all of you today. This National Assembly is related to the rise and fall of the nation and the honor and disgrace of the people, and has a huge impact on the future of national construction. The responsibility of the representatives is also very heavy. I hope that they can truly build a constitutional foundation and set a permanent example, so that the people who have suffered long-term trauma can obtain true welfare and seek the long-term prosperity and happiness of the country. The Chairman also replied that the first and second points are willing to be seriously considered by the government colleagues in order to adopt the opinions of the representatives. On the third point, the constitutional issue, if you have better opinions, please submit them as much as possible during the meeting. The tea party ended at 11:30 AM.

### The American and British Ambassadors Visit the Chairman; The CCP's Response to the Eight Principles is Delivered to the British Ambassador; Sun Ke Invites Representatives to Discuss the Procedures of the Comprehensive Meeting Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Special Envoy Merrell visited Ambassador Stuart at 9:30 AM on the morning of the 8th and talked for about an hour and a half. Then, at 11:30 AM, he and Ambassador Stuart visited the Chairman together and talked for an hour before leaving. The Chairman immediately hosted a banquet for government representatives Wu Tiecheng, Sun Ke, Chen Lifu, Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Lei Zhen, Bai Chongxi, and Chen Cheng at 1:00 PM and talked for over an hour.

The Military Three-Person Group meeting may be held in the afternoon.

### After the Chairman Issues a Statement, Parties Present Their Views; Providing Explanations on the Constitutional Draft and the National Assembly

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] After Chairman Chiang issued a statement, Zhang Junmai, Zhang Shenfu, Shen Junru, and Luo Longji of the Democratic League, Zuo Shunsheng and Li Huang of the Youth Party, and Miao Jiaming, Hu Zhengzhi, and Mo Dehui of the social elites held a meeting at the Bank of Communications at 6:00 PM and invited Zhou Enlai, Li Weihan, and Deng Yingchao of the Communist Party to attend. First, the Communist Party's response to the eight principles proposed by Chairman Chiang on October 16th was discussed. The Communist Party also decided to deliver it to Special Envoy Merrell that evening. Then, Zhou Enlai and others left first and continued the meeting to study the statement issued by the Chairman on the 8th. After the meeting, at 10:00 PM, an impromptu press conference was held, where Xi Longji read their opinions on the Chairman's statement as follows: "General opinion, because of the urgency of time, the entire text has not been studied in detail. The point of ceasefire is in line with the wishes of the people of the country, but in terms of the scope involved, it is considered that all the methods mentioned in the statement are very different from the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and its procedures. Moreover, according to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the sole authority of this National Assembly is to formulate the Constitution, and its nature is sacred and solemn. In this statement by Chairman Chiang, there are doubts about the National Assembly and the Constitution. (1) Since constitution-making is a century-long undertaking, the move to reserve seats for national representatives not only sets an unprecedented precedent in the history of constitution-making in the world, but also loses the dignity of the law-making conference; (2) The constitutional draft comes from an agreement. Now that the agreement on the constitutional draft has not been completed, handing it over to the National Assembly for a decision will inevitably lead to endless disputes in the future; (3) The amendment of the Constitution should stipulate the amendment procedures in the Constitution. Now that the law has not yet been determined, the possibility of amending it in six months is reserved. How can this fundamental law, which is so unstable, ensure the adherence of the people of the country?"

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] After the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social elites expressed their opinions on Chairman Chiang's statement, reporters visited government representative Zhang Lisheng to ask for his thoughts on this opinion. Zhang refused to answer and seemed relaxed, as if he did not take it seriously. (There is also a special feature on "The Process of Negotiations Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party" on page 2.)

### The Communist Army in Northern Shanxi Launches an Offensive; The Situation in Taiyuan is Extremely Tense; Sun Lianzhong Goes to the Pinghan Railway Northern Section to Inspect

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 8th] After the Communist Army withdrew from Suiyuan-Chahar-Jehol, it has transferred most of its forces to Shanxi. The pressure of the Communist Army felt in Shanxi Province has become increasingly serious. According to Taiyuan News, the Communist Army is now invading the periphery of Taiyuan. After Yuancun Town was captured a few days ago, the Communist Army successively captured Zhuangmo Town (northwest of Pingyao) and Fenyangling (southeast of Pingyao). Xinxian, north of Taiyuan, has been captured by the Communist Army's encirclement. The National Army is now marching north from Taiyuan to provide assistance. It is said that more than 30,000 Communist Army troops are under the command of Peng Dehuai, attempting to cut off transportation and isolate Taiyuan. The situation in Taiyuan is now extremely tense.

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 8th] The Communist Army north of Taiyuan has begun to stir again. Xinxian has been besieged, and more than 10,000 people are detouring west, attacking Yuanping and Fenyangling near Pingyao. The Communist Army has gathered 30,000 troops in the area of Xiyang and Heshun south of the Zhengtai Railway, seemingly trying to cooperate with the Pinghan campaign.

In the afternoon, he went to Gaobeidian and Dingxing to inspect the defenses. He stayed overnight at the front and may take a car from Dingxing to Baoding. The train is now open to Dingxing, and the Pingbao Highway is clear. The state of stalemate in Yi County has persisted for days. The vanguard of the National Army is still stationed near Huduizi Mountain, 20 miles east of Yi County. The opportunity for development in the southern section of Baoding has not yet matured.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 8th] The battles in Yi County and Laishui are deadlocked. The threat to the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has not been completely lifted. After the Pingbao Road was opened, there are still a large number of Communist troops in the 20-kilometer area east, west, and south of Baoding.

### External Spokesperson Talks to Reporters: The True Spirit of the Sino-American Treaty; Clear Explanation of the Meaning of Most-Favored-Nation Status

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] After the signing and public announcement of the Sino-American Treaty on the 4th, various circles have had different criticisms. In order to understand the true spirit of the treaty and the official explanations regarding certain comments, our reporter made a special visit to the external spokesperson to inquire about several key points. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:

(Question) Is there any protection for the occupations of our citizens? (Answer) Article 2, Section 2 stipulates that citizens of the other contracting party may only engage in occupations not exclusively reserved for citizens of the contracting party, and may only enjoy such rights in their individual capacity. If a contracting party deems that a certain occupation should be reserved for its own citizens, it may at any time stipulate this by law.

(Question) Is there any protection for our legal persons and organizations? (Answer) Article 3, Section 3 stipulates that legal persons and organizations of the other contracting party should generally enjoy the same treatment as legal persons and organizations of the contracting party when conducting various businesses in accordance with the law within the territory of the contracting party. This does not apply if the laws of the contracting party stipulate otherwise. Therefore, either contracting party may still grant certain necessary special treatment to its own legal persons and organizations, which is completely the same as the provisions of Article 297 of our Company Law.

(Question) Is tariff autonomy affected? (Answer) Article 16 of this treaty stipulates that the tariffs paid on goods from the other party entering this party shall not be higher than the national taxes paid on goods from any third country. Under this provision, if our country deems it necessary to raise tariffs to protect domestic industries, it will not be subject to any restrictions, except that it must give the United States most-favored-nation treatment, that is, equal treatment. As for imported goods, regardless of whether they are imported by foreigners or Chinese, they must pay the same import tax. This is not only our current tariff practice but also a common practice in all countries of the world.

(Question) Why are there provisions on immigration in the treaty? (Answer) The United States Congress passed a bill in 1923 stipulating that all commercial treaties must expressly state that they shall not affect existing immigration laws and the right to enact immigration laws in the future. Since 1923, the United States has had the above-mentioned reservation clause in all its commercial treaties, without exception. Therefore, the first sentence of Article 2, Section 4 of this treaty is not a provision specifically for our country. Although our country does not yet have an immigration law, if it is deemed necessary in the future, our country has the freedom to enact such a law at any time. Moreover, the United States' law of February 5, 1917, restricting the entry of people from certain regions, has been expressly stated in this treaty not to apply to Chinese people. This provision can also serve as a guarantee that Chinese people should not be discriminated against.

(Question) What is the meaning of the most-favored-nation clause in this treaty? (Answer) According to common practice, the treatment granted by any treaty is either national treatment or most-favored-nation treatment. There is no other standard. When stipulating most-favored-nation treatment, there are two meanings: (A) it means that national treatment cannot be granted; (B) it allows being on an equal footing with third countries and not being subject to discriminatory treatment. Although there is a most-favored-nation clause in the treaty, if we do not give any special preferences to any country, then this clause will not be effective. As for which items in this treaty should be given national treatment and which should be given most-favored-nation treatment, this Ministry, together with relevant agencies, carefully reviewed them before making a decision, and repeatedly negotiated with the United States to reach an agreement. Moreover, because international business relations are ever-changing, the effective period of this treaty is only five years, at which time the effect of implementation will be used as the basis for whether to revise a new treaty.

### Discussing the Implementation of the Vietnam Agreement: Sino-French Talks Began Yesterday; Technical Issues Will Be Discussed in Vietnam After Results Are Obtained

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Sino-French talks on the implementation of the agreement on Vietnam held their first meeting this morning. After detailed discussion of the meeting agenda, a concrete decision was made, and subgroup meetings will be convened soon. The first meeting this morning was held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The chief representative of the French side, Mr. Maux, represented Fontanges and one secretary.

This Sino-French meeting is only to discuss technical issues regarding the implementation of the agreement on Vietnam and does not involve the political issues of Vietnam. The scope of the discussion includes the following five items: (1) Valuation of the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway; (2) Repair and opening to traffic of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway; (3) Measures for facilitating passage through Haiphong and agreements on special zones; (4) Liquidation of enemy property in northern Vietnam (China and France will conduct this directly in Vietnam); (5) Settlement of China's military expenses in Vietnam. The Chinese and French delegations are currently discussing the first three items in Nanjing. Once considerable results are obtained, technical issues of implementation will continue to be discussed in Vietnam. As for the property rights of the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, according to the Sino-French agreement of February 20, the Chinese government will redeem it in advance, and the cost will be borne by the French government as compensation for the losses incurred by our country's use of Haiphong and the transport of government and people's materials on that road during the war. According to the agreement, China and France will organize a liquidation committee to liquidate enemy property in northern Vietnam, which will be held in Vietnam soon.

### 国共商谈经过

— 本报资料室特辑

Since the establishment of the Political Consultative Conference, the government has repeatedly sought an early resolution to national affairs with a broad and tolerant attitude. However, extraneous matters have repeatedly arisen, leading to delays until the present day. Now, the government, accepting the resolution of the National Assembly representatives, has ordered the cessation of military actions and has acted with openness and candor, as all the world can see. We now trace the course of negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party as follows:

The convocation of the conference was based on the "Record of Unity Talks" signed by the Kuomintang government and the CCP representatives in the 34th year of the Republic (1945). It stipulated that the National Government convene a consultative conference, inviting representatives of all parties and social elites to participate, to discuss national affairs and formulate a peaceful nation-building plan.

On January 6th of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), the methods for convening the conference and the list of members were approved and promulgated by the Chairman of the National Government. On the 10th, the Political Consultative Conference opened in the auditorium of the National Government in the temporary capital, Chongqing, and concluded on the 31st. After repeated meetings and group discussions, five agreements were established: on government organization, the National Assembly, the program for peaceful nation-building, military affairs, and the draft constitution. During the conference, the government and the CCP authorities separately ordered their subordinates to cease conflicts and restore transportation. Subsequently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek announced that the government would immediately implement "guarantee of people's freedom," "recognition of the legal status of political parties," "universal suffrage," and "release of political prisoners." The people of the whole country were overjoyed upon hearing this.

On February 15th, the Military Tripartite Group meeting, composed of Zhang Zhizhong, Zhou Enlai, and Marshall, formally signed the basic plan for the reorganization of troops and the integration of the CCP's troops into the national army. It contained two important provisions: (1) Command authority - the Chairman of the National Government is the supreme commander of the Chinese army, navy, and air force. (2) Organization - the national army will be reduced to 108 divisions, including 18 divisions of the Communist army. This plan served as the basis for implementing the agreement on military affairs in the Political Consultative Conference. However, the CCP side was unwilling to implement the unified reorganization, continuing to disrupt transportation and seize cities. When the National Army went to the Northeast to take over territorial sovereignty, they were repeatedly obstructed, leading to full-scale conflict. Military negotiations came to a standstill. Through the efforts of Special Envoy Marshall, the long-dormant political negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party began on May 25th at the private residence of Mr. Shao Lizi in the capital. The government representatives were Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, and Wang Shijie, and the CCP representatives were Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, and Lu Dingyi. The two sides exchanged views on the issues of ceasefire, truce, and restoration of transportation, but no concrete decisions were made.

In order to promote peace, the government issued an order on June 7th, ceasing military actions in the Northeast for fifteen days. However, the CCP still showed no sincerity, and by the 22nd, the deadline expired without any progress. The government, seeking to preserve the overall situation, ordered an extension until the end of June.

On June 23rd, the Military Tripartite Group meeting officially resumed. The CCP representatives put forward a counter-proposal on troop reorganization, and the government also proposed a new plan for troop reorganization. Special Envoy Marshall tried his best in the meeting to reconcile the views of both sides, but it was still not easy to reach an agreement. In the end, because the CCP expressed its inability to accept the issue of Marshall's arbitration power, the meeting ended without results.

On July 3rd, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek met with CCP representative Zhou Enlai, reiterating his consistent stance for peace. That night, the representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party began direct negotiations, but because the Communist side insisted on holding the Political Consultative Conference first, while the government representatives advocated conducting military negotiations only, the talks once again came to a stalemate and broke up on the 8th without results. Afterwards, although Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart tried hard to mediate and held sporadic talks, they were intermittent and unproductive.

On July 26th, Zhou Enlai met with Special Envoy Marshall in Nanjing, and then Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Special Envoy Marshall exchanged views in writing. The negotiations seemed to have a turning point, but because the CCP insisted on a so-called unconditional ceasefire, peace talks were once again obstructed.

Thereafter, although Marshalls and Stuart made efforts to pursue peace and held repeated negotiations, they were unable to reach a solution. The crux of the matter lay in the CCP's demand that after the CCP army withdrew, the withdrawn area would still maintain the CCP's government organization. This would hinder national unity, and Marshall's mission was unsuccessful.

On August 13th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a public message to the nation, outlining six points on how to handle the current situation in the future. He expressed his sincere compliance with all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Regarding political disputes, he would still adopt political solutions, but the Communist Party's army should abide by the agreement on the nationalization of the army. Once this was guaranteed, the government could discuss all unresolved issues in concrete terms at any time. Through repeated consultations, both sides agreed to start negotiations by reorganizing the government. On August 29th, Marshall met with Zhou Enlai to discuss the exchange of opinions on the reorganization of the government by a five-person group consisting of two representatives from both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and one American representative. However, on September 6th, the CCP representatives suddenly raised the so-called "ceasefire guarantee" requirement, creating unnecessary complications, and the five-person group became inactive. On September 13th, CCP representative Zhou Enlai suddenly suggested to Marshall that the Military Tripartite Group meeting be restored, believing that a ceasefire was a prerequisite for peace and that the military group could discuss the ceasefire issue, which was simpler than discussing the political five-person meeting. However, Marshall had previously traveled back and forth between Nanjing and Lushan several times, mainly advocating that political and military negotiations should proceed simultaneously, and this now became a dispute between the "three-person" and "five-person" groups. On September 17th, Zhou Enlai went to Shanghai and gave a speech to foreign reporters on the 20th, stating that the CCP would withdraw from political negotiations, further deteriorating the situation. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek returned to Nanjing on September 27th and expressed to Marshall and Stuart that he agreed to convene both the five-person meeting and the three-person meeting at the same time to show the government's sincerity in hoping for peace. Zhou Enlai also had no objection, and the peace negotiations seemed to have a turning point, but the CCP suddenly emphasized the military conflict in Zhangjiakou, submitting a memorandum to the government, which cast a shadow over the atmosphere of peace. On October 8th, Marshall put forward a new suggestion for a limited-time ceasefire. The government expressed its agreement and, at the same time, hoped that Zhou Enlai would return to Nanjing to participate in the negotiations. Marshall came to Shanghai to urge him to do so. Representatives from the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and others also tried their best to mediate, hoping to save the overall situation. Sun Ke stayed in Shanghai, delaying his return to Nanjing, hoping to break the deadlock. On the 17th, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, and Lei Zhen, government representatives to the Political Consultative Conference, came to Shanghai one after another, inviting people from various parties and factions to go to Nanjing for negotiations, and jointly urged the CCP representatives to go to Nanjing together to discuss the major plan for peace. Zhou Enlai then returned with the mediators on the 21st to discuss the grand plan for peace.

Before the government representatives to the Political Consultative Conference came to Shanghai, the government had explained the eight basic points of the negotiations, and the CCP side had put forward two more demands. When Zhou Enlai and his party arrived in Nanjing, the two sides were still not close. However, the National Assembly was imminent, and the whole country yearned for peace. The government was generous and expressed its willingness to reorganize the National Government Committee immediately and has now issued three ceasefire orders. The prospects for peace talks may be seen at the opening of the National Assembly.

Editorial

### The Issuance of the Final Ceasefire Order

Yesterday, the Chairman of the National Government issued a ceasefire order, instructing all units of the National Army, Navy, and Air Force to cease fighting at 12:00 noon on the 11th of this month and remain in their current defensive positions, in order to demonstrate the government's utmost sincerity in seeking peace and tolerance. This ceasefire order, which has been desired by all parties, has finally been issued. There is no doubt that the issuance of this order will have a positive impact on the domestic situation. In the ceasefire order issued by the Chairman of the National Government, we see the following words: "Since the surrender of the enemy army last year, the government's consistent policy has been to seek peaceful unification and democratic construction, to resolve domestic disputes through political means, and to lay the foundation for national rejuvenation before the National Assembly. Although the Communist army has launched unprovoked attacks on our National Army in various places, forcing us to implement self-defense, our established policy of political resolution has remained consistent. Therefore, we have repeatedly shown tolerance, resulting in the two ceasefires in January and June of this year and the postponement of the convocation of the National Assembly. In order to demonstrate the government's commitment to implementing its original policy, we hereby issue another ceasefire order." Indeed, the issuance of ceasefire orders did not begin today, but the issuance of this ceasefire order has a particularly profound significance.

Since the surrender of Japan, our government, with the people as its priority, has been committed to seeking peaceful unification and democratic construction for the domestic situation. Therefore, we have repeatedly held discussions with various parties, factions, and social elites, hoping that agreements can be reached through consultation, mutually observed, and lead the country to a state of peaceful unification. Unfortunately, before the ink on the agreements was dry, new offensives were launched again. In order to protect the interests of the people and for the sake of self-defense, the government had no choice but to respond to force with force; the so-called agreements became mere pie in the sky. However, the government still adhered to its consistent policy of tolerance for the sake of the country, resulting in the two ceasefires in January and June of this year and the postponement of the National Assembly. However, the government's good intentions were not fully understood by all parties. As a result, as soon as the ceasefire order was issued, the Communist army's military offensive resumed. Recently, after the National Army recovered Zhangjiakou, some people believed that this situation could not be allowed to continue. Therefore, they worked to mediate, believing that if the government could issue another ceasefire order, it would be of great benefit to the overall domestic situation. Peaceful unification and democratic construction have always been the government's consistent policy, and a ceasefire has always been what the government has sought day and night. Therefore, after accepting this suggestion, our Chairman issued a public message, stating eight points. If this position is understood, the government will immediately issue a ceasefire order. The meetings between the government and various parties in the past ten days have also been focused on this. Now that the government's ceasefire order has been issued, the improvement of the domestic situation can certainly be expected. We hope that the issuance of this ceasefire order will be the last ceasefire order, and that the domestic situation will no longer resort to force.

There is no doubt that the issuance of this ceasefire order will be of great benefit to the current situation. The convocation of the National Assembly has been postponed before, and it cannot be postponed again now. From the nature of the National Assembly, the National Assembly represents the political parties that represent the people. This is a National Assembly of people's representatives, not a National Assembly of party representatives. In theory, the convocation of the National Assembly has nothing to do with party disputes. However, we cannot deny the objective facts of the current political situation. The government's tolerance for the sake of the country has been proven by numerous facts, and the issuance of this ceasefire order is the culmination of it. Due to the issuance of this ceasefire order, the government has done everything possible to fulfill the requests of all parties with great tolerance. How the situation will unfold in the future depends on the sincere cooperation of all parties. Standing from the perspective of the people, we hope that all parties can also express their sincerity in cooperating with the government with facts. For example, all parties and factions can participate in the convocation of the National Assembly and jointly resolve national affairs. The National Assembly is the center of peaceful unification and the beginning of democratic construction. The government respects the opinions of all parties, and now that it has issued a ceasefire order, the convocation of the National Assembly should be able to proceed in an atmosphere of peace. As for the military reorganization and other political issues, those that have already been agreed upon should be implemented promptly, and those that have not yet been agreed upon should be resolved in the peaceful atmosphere created by the ceasefire order.

May the issuance of this ceasefire order bring peace and brightness to the domestic situation that has been delayed for more than a year!

### Stolen Package, Jumping from Train to Escape: New Gang of Thieves on the Jinghu Line

[Zhenjiang Dispatch] Recently on the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) railway line, incidents of thieves jumping from trains and stealing passengers' belongings have occurred frequently. Previously, two travelers from Zhenjiang, Liu Zhaorong and Zhou Peiyi, had their packages stolen by thieves jumping from trains, each losing tens of thousands of yuan. Yesterday, Mei Guangzhong, a partner at the Dajixiang cloth store in Dashikou, Zhenjiang, went to Shanghai to purchase cotton cloth. He boarded train No. 54 from Shanghai to return to Zhenjiang, purchased baggage tickets as required, and carried four pieces of cotton cloth. Because there were no seats or lights in the fourth-class carriage, he temporarily used the packages as seats. Unexpectedly, two passengers in the same carriage, one claiming to be Jiang Youhua, asked to sit on Mei's other package. Mei refused, but Jiang Youhua insisted that he was also traveling to Zhenjiang and that the packages would be safe under their bodies and that he would take care of them. Mei then trusted him. Unexpectedly, as the train passed Zhenjiangguan and was moving, the passenger sitting on Mei's package suddenly threw the package out of the train and jumped down to escape. The other passengers were greatly shocked, thinking a passenger had fallen off the train. Mei checked and found that one package of cotton cloth (14 bolts) he was carrying had been stolen by someone jumping off the train. At this time, Jiang Youhua, who had been sitting on the package, looked frightened but had not escaped. Mei knew he was an accomplice and immediately apprehended him. When the train arrived in Wangting, he was taken to the local police station for questioning and then sent to the Shanghai Railway Police Station for legal processing.

Our Ambitions—A Record of a Group of Idealistic and Passionate Young People Coming Together

From elementary school to university graduation, I have had hundreds of classmates and nearly a hundred friends, but here I want to talk about only eighteen. Currently, there are only eighteen, but I believe that number will definitely increase in the future.

I am very happy that I now have eighteen young friends with shared ideals. They have each had difficult and arduous experiences in school. Some have already graduated, and some are still in school. We all agree that China needs reform. We hate the remnants of feudalism that are still active and the emerging evil forces that keep appearing. We despise everything undemocratic, falsely democratic, unequal, unfree, and the endless selfishness and exploitation in this era. We witness foolishness and blindness, and we sympathize with those who suffer and the endless sorrow. We feel the need to reform them, overthrow them, and establish our new, reasonable world. We cannot and dare not believe that others will truly complete this mission. We have the courage and ambition to do our best, and we believe that we can do better than others. So we united, which took some effort in building friendship and undergoing a necessary period of doubt, but in the end, we became very good friends, very good comrades. I believe that our union is not a temporary emotional impulse, nor a blind action, but the result of our meticulous reason and calm observation.

We have three criteria for finding like-minded friends. First, we need him (or her) to be relatively intelligent, to have a mind capable of understanding complex problems, and to have the courage to take on difficult tasks. Second, our friends must have lofty ideals. Regardless of what ideology they believe in, as long as their ultimate goal is to build a strong and equal new China, to have a conscious sense of responsibility for the revitalization of the country, and to have ardent and strong confidence in their career, we do not want those hesitant and sorrowful types. Third, our friends should not be too selfish. Of course, everyone has some selfishness, more or less. We do not need to be harshly looking for friends who have no selfishness at all, and in fact, it is impossible to find them. However, selfishness must have a limit. In other words, we are willing to sacrifice for the country and for our friends, for the sake of the country.

Among the nineteen of us, I believe that I am the most inept one, but precisely because I am the most inept, I am also the most fortunate. I can learn from each of them their experiences and characteristics, and they can all sincerely understand my shortcomings.

This young group of us all grew up in this era.

This is the most unfortunate era, but also the most fortunate era. Why? We live in this turbulent, uneasy, poor, difficult, and depressing era and, even more unfortunately, grew up in China during this era. Not only have we suffered from material panic and torment, but our souls have also been shrouded in tragic and dark shadows. Our hearts are wounded. We are not only worried about everything in our motherland, but we are also concerned about the future of so-called civilized humanity, which is turbulent, cruel, ignorant, and blindly follows others. Therefore, we bear a double burden, causing us to lose many bright laughs and the enjoyment of peaceful and comfortable minds. We are troubled, we are in pain. In fact, we could choose not to bear this excessive spiritual pressure. We can escape thinking about it, caring about it, and even indulge in the illusion of narrow personal happiness, but we cannot get rid of it no matter what. Every day's newspaper is like a huge voice, calling you. The injustice and misery of the human world that we see is like a giant hand grabbing you, telling you to think about it, to care about it, taking away the peace of your innocent soul, taking away sweet dreams, and giving you excessive burdens and torment.

However, we are also fortunate to be born in this era, and even more fortunate to be born in China during this era. Because we never wanted to be ordinary people who lived a mediocre life. We are truly fortunate to be born in this land that can accommodate us to develop and create. Our entrepreneurial spirit is extremely strong and passionate. We are like a group of young, lively, and innocent craftsmen holding axes and saws, hoping to transform or build something, seeing an old and dilapidated house that needs to be rebuilt. We are full of eager anticipation. We are truly fortunate to be born in China, in China during this era! All the material and spiritual torments have only strengthened our strength and increased our perseverance. Our minds have become calmer, and our vision has become sharper.

We are definitely not the kind of young people who have no social experience and only a heart full of enthusiasm, nor are we worldly and gloomy people. I believe this myself, and I believe that every one of our friends is the same.

Although we have a grand common ideal, we all start from the most practical places. The first step is to cultivate our own love, sincerity, and trust for our friends. We trust every friend and help our friends as much as possible when necessary. This is the first test. If this step cannot be achieved, what are we talking about, let alone ideals like the nation?

Each of us regards the success or failure of our friends as our own success or failure, and the fortune or misfortune of our friends as our own fortune or misfortune. We encourage each other, we criticize each other kindly, we each hate our own shortcomings, and we also forgive the shortcomings of our friends.

Each of our friends plans to start working from his own position, establish a personal economic foundation. One friend who studies engineering has already started with a small construction factory. His ideal is to establish a modern, large-scale construction engineering enterprise. A friend who graduated from a Jiangxi agricultural college is preparing to reclaim land in Yunnan after graduation. Every friend works in his own position, develops his career, and establishes his economic foundation. We have good communication and travel methods to maintain our friendship, and in ten years, we will coordinate our respective achievements to achieve a comprehensive success.

I am really happy that our current friends are already distributed in important locations within China, such as Shenyang, Beiping, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Chengdu. From the names of the schools, there are Northeast University, Tsinghua University, Peking University, Zhongda University, Lida University, Wuhan University, Jiaotong University, Aurora University, Zhejiang University, and Sichuan University. In terms of departments, there are engineering, law, literature, education, economics, agronomy, politics, and aeronautical engineering. Some friends have not graduated this year. In two years, every friend will be able to enter society.

This is a scientific mass era, and fighting alone cannot achieve great success. Therefore, we will work hard to find our friends in the future, rationally discover our comrades. In five years, our friends will not only be all over the country, but also all over the world.

I believe that this large group of young friends is the true new blood of China, and only this group of young people is the reformer of China. At the same time, the reconstruction of China can only be undertaken by our young and righteous union.

My words are very self-assertive, no, simply arrogant, but I would rather be self-assertive and arrogant than retreat and be inferior.

Finally, I wish my friends good health! (Pan Xingzhao, October 35th,)

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Encounters Another Obstacle: Completely Opposing Opinions on the Italian Peace Treaty from the US and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Bloc Opposes US Trusteeship of Pacific Islands.

[News Agency Report] San Francisco, 8th, Broadcast: The four foreign ministers encountered another major obstacle at their meeting this afternoon. The discussion today was on the Italian peace treaty, in which five major points were opposed by the Soviet Union. (1) Western European countries suggested that the Austrian treaty be included in the Italian peace treaty. The Soviet Union expressed its opposition. (2) The US suggested that countries previously allocated Italian territory should guarantee human rights to ethnic minorities. The Soviet Union expressed its opposition. (3) The French suggestion on the status of Trieste was also opposed by the Soviet Union, representing Tito. (4) The US suggested that Italy should compensate Yugoslavia, Greece, and Albania. The Soviet Union believed that the amount of compensation to Yugoslavia should be greater than that to other countries. (5) The US suggested that if they do not sign the treaty, the various benefits of Yugoslavia under the treaty should be canceled. The Soviet Union also opposed this.

[News Agency Report] San Francisco, 8th, Radio News: Today, the representatives of the Soviet Union and its satellite states strongly opposed the US proposal to place the former Japanese Pacific islands under a special trusteeship system. This type of trusteeship system would allow the US to obtain permanent rights to use the islands as defense bases and would cause the UN and the five major powers to lose their veto power or control in the region.

### Trieste Exchanged for Gorizia: Italy Rejects Tito's Request: Yugoslavia Hopes for Direct Negotiations Between the Two Countries to Resolve the Outstanding Issues

[Central News Agency, Rome, 7th, Associated Press] The Italian Council of Ministers officially rejected Tito's request to exchange Trieste for Gorizia. The cabinet stated that Gorizia is part of Italian territory and has been recognized by the four foreign ministers.

[Reuters, Rome, 7th] Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia suddenly announced in New York that he was abandoning his claims on the port of Trieste during discussions of the Trieste issue, which has caused great surprise here. According to Tito's proposal, Trieste could be retained by Italy, and the plan for a free zone in the draft treaty should be abolished. In exchange, Yugoslavia requested to obtain the city of Gorizia, which was to be returned to Italy according to the draft treaty. This proposal was brought back from Belgrade by the leader of the Italian Communist Party, Tugliatti. The content is: (1) Trieste is retained by Italy, but it should be given local autonomy similar to the Austrian district. (2) The city of Gorizia, which has a majority of Slavic people, is incorporated into Yugoslav territory. (3) Italian minorities remaining in Yugoslav territory have full civil rights and can establish Italian-language schools, etc. Italian prisoners of war still in Yugoslavia are immediately sent back to their country. (4) The two countries sign a commercial treaty, with Yugoslavia providing Italy with timber and other raw materials in exchange for its industrial products. Yugoslavia will accommodate Italian workers to alleviate the overcrowding in its country. The Italian cabinet has been discussing this proposal all day. However, right-wing elements have expressed opposition, accusing Tito of being generous with other people's property, and saying that Yugoslavia's proposal to abolish the free zone plan in Trieste is intended to allow the Allied forces to withdraw from the Trieste area so that it can carry out its conspiracy against Italy.

[Reuters, Rome, 8th] The Italian Communist Party Committee issued a public statement this morning, declaring that Tito's proposal regarding Trieste and the eastern border of Italy is intended to resolve all issues between Italy and Yugoslavia through direct negotiations. Before the Italian cabinet meeting, it had rejected the proposal to cede the city of Gorizia to Yugoslavia, but expressed its support for Trieste to be retained by Italy.

### Our Representative Supports India's Position: Opposes South Africa's Annexation of Mandated Territories

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 7th] Chinese representative Liu Chieh, ordered to support India and the Soviet Union in the Trusteeship Committee today, opposed South Africa's request to merge Southwest Africa, pointing out that this request violates both the letter and spirit of the draft charter. Liu and representatives from four other countries also urged the UN to establish a trusteeship system as soon as possible.

### Various UN Committees Held Separate Meetings Yesterday

The joint committee represents the Budget Administrative Committee, the Legal Committee, and common issues between the two committees.

Five-Nation Membership Case: Discussion Inconclusive

[Reuters, New York, 7th] A subcommittee of the Political Committee held a secret meeting today to discuss the matter of the application for membership of the five countries of Albania, Outer Mongolia, Ireland, Portugal, and Jordan being rejected by the Security Council, in order to draft a resolution and send it back to the Security Council for reconsideration.

### Hungary Lacks Ability to Pay Compensation: Will Request Dispatch of Personnel for Investigation

### The Future of World Food Is Still Not Optimistic

Girard Notifies the UN General Assembly

[Central News Agency, New York, 7th, Special Dispatch] Girard, Secretary-General of the International Emergency Food Conference, informed the UN General Assembly's Economic and Financial Committee today that the future of world food is not optimistic. Although the world's production of cereals (including rice and wheat), meat, sugar, etc., has increased slightly this year compared to last year, this small increase has been offset by the uneven distribution and production.

### The Rift Between the East and West Blocs: The Netherlands Is Willing to Mediate Between the Two

[Reuters, The Hague, 7th] The Dutch government today issued a statement on its foreign policy, emphasizing that the Netherlands can play a part in the task of mediating between the Soviet Union and the Western bloc to avoid a new war. The Dutch government will do its best to understand the Soviet Union's foreign policy and avoid actions that could widen the rift between the East and West blocs. The statement pointed out that the world has already been divided into two blocs, which is undeniable, and this phenomenon has become more apparent at the Paris Conference. The Dutch government recognizes the danger of this situation and knows that both sides must work together to maintain peace. The statement also denied rumors that the Dutch government is particularly close to Britain or attached to the Western bloc, pointing out that such major powers do not need the help of small countries.

### Italy Appoints Ambassador to the Soviet Union

### The US Transfers Several Air Bases to the Department of Commerce

[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] President Truman today authorized the US Army and Navy to transfer several air bases in Alaska and the Pacific region that are no longer needed for military purposes to the Department of Commerce. The President's order also authorized the Department of Commerce to maintain these bases through the Civil Aeronautics Administration, or to turn them over to commercial airlines or the American people. The number and location of the bases to be transferred are to be determined by the Army and Navy.

### Truman Does Not Intend to Resign: The Republican Party Will Continue Its Existing Policy Toward China: The Attitude Toward the Soviet Union Will Become More Tough

[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] President Truman will not resign, and this is being seriously considered. He believes that resigning after the Democratic Party's惨敗 is equivalent to deserting his post. Truman himself expressed silence about the election defeat, hinting that he would not make a statement until next week at the earliest. In addition, the general public seems to have agreed to the United States' existing policy toward the Philippines; most people also believe that the United States' policy on general issues in the Pacific, including policies toward China, Japan, and Korea, will continue to be implemented under Republican rule. Both the Republican and Democratic parties claim that the United States' foreign policy is a bipartisan policy and will continue to be so in the future.

[Associated Press, Paris, 7th] Newspapers run by the Popular Republican Movement Party, led by French President Bidault, today interpreted the results of the US election as "approving Byrnes and opposing Wallace." It is said that "Byrnes has won a great victory in the election. The failure of the Democratic Party should be largely attributed to former Commerce Secretary Wallace's Munich-style proposals." French newspapers believe that after the Republican Party's victory, the United States' attitude toward the Soviet Union will become tougher, but it will not return to isolationism.

Truman Can Use the Veto Power to Counterattack

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th, Special Dispatch] Several Democratic officials in the United States who are deeply dissatisfied with the results of the general election recently stated that President Truman has absolutely no intention of resigning because of the Republican Party's victory. No president in American history has resigned. We hope that President Truman will use his veto power, which is supported by the Democratic Party, to counter the opposition of Congress. People close to the White House say that the president is bound to embark on a new path of "political freedom" because he will no longer have any obligations to any powerful pressure groups. Washington is closely watching the international reaction to the Republican Party's victory, especially from the Soviet Union.

[United Press, Washington, 7th Dispatch] In order to break the deadlock with the Soviet Union, the United States has requested the cooperation of the countries on the Far Eastern Commission to draft a directive to be given to MacArthur for the distribution of Japanese reparations. Diplomatic sources announced today that, in view of the Soviet Union's unwillingness to participate in the reparations conference, the State Department is discussing the distribution of Japanese reparations with the ten countries of the Far Eastern Commission. The main points are: (1) 15 to 20 percent of the Japanese assets allocated for reparations will be immediately distributed among the countries claiming reparations. (2) The method for distributing the remaining 80 percent will be decided later. According to the US plan, the Far Eastern Commission can issue instructions to MacArthur for implementation after consultation, and then submit them to the Far Eastern Commission for review. If the Soviet Union still opposes this proposal, the plan will still be implemented.

### Overview of the Post-War Japanese Economy

[Our Newspaper Special Correspondent, Tokyo, 7th Dispatch] Although the rate of increase in Japan's production index has been slow within the past year, it has more than doubled compared to the time of surrender last August, indicating that it is gradually entering a phase of economic stability. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, using the average from 1931 to 1933 as 100, the production index in September of last year was only 20 percent, while in August of this year it was 54.4 percent, an increase of 2.7 times compared to last year. According to statistics recently released by the Bank of Japan, using March of this year as 100, July was 156 percent and August was 166 percent. The volume of freight transported by national railways has also been increasing daily. According to Toyo

Economic Statistics,

using 1941 as 100, last September was only 8.3, while August of this year was 76.3 percent. In terms of prices, there is also a trend towards stability. According to a survey by the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, using last November as 100, the black market price index in September of this year was 127.3 percent, a decrease of 5.7 percent from August's 135 percent. Prices peaked in April of this year, rising to 141.3 percent, and have gradually declined since then. Statistics recently released by the Bank of Japan also show a gradual decline in the black market. Using March of this year as 100, September was 89. Conversely, official prices have increased significantly, tending to

approach black market prices.

Using March of this year as 100, September was 2.4 percent. In terms of the amount of currency in circulation, the rate of increase has also slowed down. After the Japanese government implemented the Financial Measures Order in March of this year, the amount of Bank of Japan notes in circulation at the end of March was reduced to 23 billion yen. Subsequently, due to the food panic and a surge in withdrawals related to living expenses and wages, the

currency in circulation increased significantly,

reaching 70.225 billion yen by the 27th of this month, exceeding the previous highest amount in circulation. However, the food shortage situation has recently improved, and the rate of increase in note issuance has slowed down. The increase rate in June was 18 percent, while in October it was 10 percent. The most important key to Japan's economic activity in the future is whether production can continue to rise and restore normal economic relations. Judging from

current production

conditions, it is still not possible to draw optimistic conclusions. For the past year, most of the raw materials for production have been taken from existing reserves. If materials and raw materials are not imported from abroad, they will soon be exhausted. Labor-management disputes are also an important factor. For example, coal production has only been 1.67 million tons per month since June. The production of other materials such as steel and fertilizer remains sluggish. For example, the planned supply of steel materials from July to September was 55,000 tons from production and 45,000 tons from existing reserves, totaling 100,000 tons. The supply plan from October to December is 57,000 tons from production and 16,000 tons from reserves and special items, totaling 73,000 tons, a decrease of 27,000 tons from September. Regarding the interpretation of these economic indicators,

opinions from various parties

in the government and the public vary between pessimists and optimists. Finance Minister Narahashi stated that prices have remained relatively stable since March, and that if the policies adopted in the future are not flawed, they will absolutely not lead to inflation. The "Mainichi Shimbun" refuted the Finance Minister's argument, stating in an editorial on the 25th that the

financial measures

implemented in March temporarily contracted the currency in circulation from a peak of 68 billion yen to 16 billion yen, and then re-expanded to 60 billion yen by September, after which prices stabilized slightly. This was the result of artificial emergency measures. Moreover, the Bank of Japan's index places too much emphasis on the prices of staple foods. The good harvest this year has caused the prices of staple foods to decline, but this is far from matching the rapid decline in currency value. Therefore, there is no reason for optimism regarding Japan's finances, which are about to distribute a large amount of currency. The period from March to September can only be described as a temporary lull, but the government has failed to use it to create

the true foundation for Japan's reconstruction,

and it is regrettable that Japan's economic recovery has not yet gotten on the right track. However, the Toyo Keizai Shinpo, with the Finance Minister as its patron, is very optimistic. In an article published on the 29th, it stated that increasing production is not impossible, and that as prices gradually stabilize, the profits and losses of commercial operations can be predicted. If the supply of materials and resources becomes smooth,

increasing production

will be easy. Before the war, coal production was 5 to 6 million tons per month, and production will easily increase once management is effective. However, self-reliance in seeking economic recovery is limited, because currently, raw materials and resources are not supplied domestically, but must be imported from abroad. Therefore, within certain limits, production must still be promoted on the premise of self-reliance in order to exchange for imported goods. Therefore, the current situation is less of a worsening of inflation and more of a light at the end of the tunnel, making it the duty of the Japanese to further increase the current production index.

### At 1:15 AM This Morning, Friend of China, Carl Crow, Passes Away; Funeral to be Held Tomorrow at the International Funeral Parlor, Followed by Burial; Will Stipulates Bequests to be Donated to the Zili Lifen Society and Charitable Organizations; Madame Chiang Kai-shek Flew to Shanghai Yesterday for Two Visits

[Our Newspaper Report] Mr. Carl Crow, former advisor to President Chiang Kai-shek, passed away at 1:15 AM this morning at the Hong En Hospital. The Shanghai Zili Lifen Society (2004 Nanjing West Road) has been ordered to handle the funeral arrangements. The body was moved to the International Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road today. A memorial service will be held from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 10th, followed by a simple funeral ceremony at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, and burial in the International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road on the same day. Carl Crow's will stipulates that all bequests will be donated by the Zili Lifen Society to various charitable organizations.

[Our Newspaper Special Article] The cold autumn wind brought endless desolation. Yellow leaves quietly fell from the branches, and Hong En Hospital seemed even colder than usual. For the past three days, the 71-year-old Carl Crow had been in a dying state. This warrior who fought against "death" finally faced the irresistible "inevitability."

At Gengxiangshan, several doctors had told him that there was no hope of recovery in this life. But he finally returned to the China he could not forget, and finally saw President Chiang and Madame Chiang, who had completed the great task of resisting the war. Death, for Carl Crow, held no terror. When he fell into the hands of the Japanese soldiers in Manila, who had long wanted to capture him, he had already faced the possibility of death. Then came the four long years in a concentration camp!

In fact, during the Xi'an Incident, he also had the opportunity to be killed!

Every time danger came, he simply challenged it; he won in every challenge.

But for the past three days, the excited and humorous voice had finally disappeared in the dim ward. From then on, he could no longer speak - endless silence; shadows gradually spreading; coming from eternity, and ultimately returning to eternity.

His last words were to his secretary, he asked: "What time is it?"

Why did he still need to ask the time? Was he still waiting for something?

Yesterday, Madame Chiang and Mrs. Marshall flew to Shanghai at 12:35 PM. Madame Chiang arrived at Hong En Hospital two or three minutes after returning to her residence. Carl Crow was still conscious and nodded with a smile to Madame Chiang, but - even if he had a thousand words to say, he could not say them.

For the past two days, Dr. Zheng Zumu had been constantly administering heart stimulants to him, and because Carl Crow had difficulty breathing, he had also been using oxygen. Madame Chiang arrived at the hospital at 12:50 PM, accompanied by Mr. Huang Renlin and bodyguard Chiang Xiangqing. She left the hospital at 2:10 PM in the afternoon. At 6:30 PM in the evening, Madame Chiang visited again and did not leave until 8:00 PM.

Dr. Zheng said softly: "From now on - anything is possible at any time."

Countless political secrets will disappear in silence. In the darkness, that pair of sharp and kind eyes seemed to appear before me.

(Another Dispatch) Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Madam Soong Mei-ling, considering Mr. Carl Crow's deteriorating condition, took Marshal Marshall's four-engine special plane from Nanjing yesterday morning, arriving here at 12:35 PM. Also arriving were Mrs. Marshall and Director-General Huang Renlin. Madame Chiang wore a dark coffee-colored coat with beige collar trim, and a light purple cheongsam underneath. Those who went to Longhua Airport to welcome her included Mayor Wu's wife and Commander Xuan Tiewu. After getting off the plane, Madame Chiang accompanied Mrs. Marshall back to her private residence on Dongping Road. Madame Chiang, eager to visit Carl Crow, accompanied Mrs. Marshall upstairs after arriving at the residence, and after only three minutes, she took a car with Director-General Huang to Hong En Hospital.

### River Water Gradually Receding in Winter; Upstream Suitable for Shallow-Draft Steamers; China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Sichuan River Line to be Affected

[Our Newspaper Report] As winter approaches, the water level of the Yangtze River is gradually decreasing, and the Sichuan River and Xiang River will enter the dry season. The Beiyang River in Tianjin, Niuzhuang, Andong, and other places will also freeze. According to the shipping industry, Niuzhuang will be frozen in half a month. However, the climate in Tianjin this year is different from previous years. If there is no major change in the weather, the Bai River will not freeze. The Yangtze River water level has slightly receded. Yesterday's report (7th) showed Jiujiang at 20 feet 9 inches, Hankou at 21 feet 3 inches, Yichang at 17 feet 2 inches, Chongqing at 16 feet 8 inches, and Changsha at minus 6 inches. Ships with a draft of more than 6 feet can no longer navigate. The water level of the Sichuan River is expected to continue to recede in the future, so shallow-draft river steamers are suitable for navigating the Sichuan River. Although the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has the Jiangkang, Jiangqing, and Jiangling ships, the Jiangkang ship, which is the most suitable for navigating the Sichuan River, has been purchased by the Dada Datong Joint Venture. The company has repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry, requesting the Executive Yuan to reconsider, and originally proposed to exchange it for the Anhua and other two river ships, but the result was invalid. The Jiangling ship is under repair and will be difficult to repair within the year. The Jiangqing ship is too small in tonnage and cannot meet the transportation needs. Its horsepower is also a problem when navigating upstream during the dry season. This winter, the company's Sichuan River line will be significantly affected.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Liner Also Serves Zhenhai

Another Dispatch: Shanghai-Ningbo liners, entering and leaving Zhenhai, except for the Dahua ship, which stops at Zhenhai when returning to Shanghai from Ningbo, other ships generally do not stop there. The Zhenhai Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly written to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting that the Jiangya ship stop there for the convenience of passengers. Yesterday, the company's passenger ticket department announced that it had agreed to the Zhenhai Chamber of Commerce's request for a stop. Starting next Monday, the Jiangya ship will implement this when sailing to Ningbo. In the future, passengers in Zhenhai will not need to go to Ningbo and can board and disembark in Zhenhai.

Australian Queen Ship Arrives in Shanghai This Morning

### Japanese Ship Flies Red and Blue Flag to Indicate Prisoner-of-War Ship

Loading Exchange Goods to Shanghai

According to reliable sources, at 11:30 AM on the morning of the day before yesterday, the HC29 Fourth Riki Maru merchant ship arrived at the mouth of Wusong again. At a time when rumors about the discovery of ships flying the Rising Sun flag in the Huangpu River were rife, the Naval Coastal Defense Command did not allow it to enter and monitored it. Yesterday, our reporter telephoned Director Guo of the Coastal Defense Command, who said that this Japanese merchant ship, driven by Japanese, did not fly the Japanese flag. According to an investigation by personnel sent to investigate, the ship was carrying timber for the Central Trust Bureau. When the reporter inquired with the Central Trust Bureau, they also admitted that the ship was carrying 3,000 tons of "mining timber" exchanged from Japan to Shanghai. The ship did not fly the Japanese flag, but a "red and blue flag", which means a prisoner-of-war ship. Negotiations have been made with the Navy to allow it to enter the port. It was also said that several Japanese ships had been ordered to carry exchange goods to Shanghai and had not flown the Japanese flag.

### Sichuan Chamber of Commerce Delegation, Qiu Xiufu and Others, Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday

The Sichuan Provincial Chamber of Commerce delegation, led by Qiu Xiufu, chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Chamber of Commerce, accompanied by Jiang Shucheng, standing director, and Cai Henian, director, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM after attending the National Chamber of Commerce. According to Qiu, representatives from all parties were excited about the convening of the National Chamber of Commerce, which will make a significant contribution to the future exchange of goods between various regions. The Sichuan Province delegation to the National Chamber of Commerce totaled 22 people. Qiu and his party plan to stay in Shanghai for a short time before making a trip to North China to investigate post-war industry and commerce. The remaining ten or so representatives of the chamber of commerce delegation will arrive in Shanghai in the next few days.

### Coffin of Zhao Yijian Transported to Native Place for Burial

Mr. Zhao Yijian, Director of the Fourth Hidden Department of the Ministry of National Defense, previously died in Shanghai due to thyroiditis.

People from all walks of life in Nanjing and Shanghai went to pay their respects.

### Highway Administration Dismisses Personnel; Representatives Appointed to Appeal in Various Ways

[Our Newspaper Report] The Ministry of Communications Highway Administration recently dismissed 270 personnel, giving them salaries for three months in the name of retention, and severance pay and travel expenses ranging from 24 to 60,000. All dismissed personnel, after eight years of hardship during the War of Resistance against Japan, bringing their wives and children with them and being loyal to the party and the country, had hoped for a better life after victory, but unexpectedly suffered unemployment. Moreover, they believe that although the bureau claimed that the dismissals were to reduce operations, they were actually to place private individuals. Therefore, the public was indignant and has appointed representatives to appeal to all walks of life in this city and in Nanjing, Hankou, Beiping, and other places, demanding that the severance be paid in accordance with the central government's regulations and that they be given the opportunity to transfer to other industries.

### Lost on the Atlantic, Drifting 4,000 Miles; Little Girl Returns Home After Years of Tribulation; A Legendary Tragic-Comedy in a Chaotic World

[Our Newspaper Special Feature] On the stage of life, there are originally endless tragicomedies being performed. During wartime, this stage has added countless stories of joy and sorrow, worth singing and crying about. In this, tragedy is often far greater than comedy, and in the thousands of unfortunate encounters, we rarely find one or two happy endings, which can really be considered a "miracle." Here is a true story, narrating how a loving mother and her beloved daughter were separated for four and a half years in enemy bombing, separated by 4,000 miles, with no news of each other, and finally were able to reunite. Yesterday, the home of Mr. Li Qingmao at 348 Anhe Temple Road was filled with joy and gratitude for the arrival of such a miraculous miracle.

On February 13, 1942, Mrs. Li Deqiao, Mrs. Li Yuechang (daughter of the late famous ophthalmologist Li Qingmao), who lived in Singapore, took her six-year-old daughter Bai Di and two-year-old daughter Luodi on the refugee ship "Gula" to escape the brutal artillery fire of the Japanese invaders. At that time, Mr. Li Deqiao was on another ship and had already been separated. Unfortunately, on the second day after the ship set sail, the "Gula" was bombed by enemy aircraft and quickly sank. At this critical moment, Mrs. Li could only hold her younger daughter Luodi and then tell Little Bai Di to grab the handle of a box and not let go. As for herself, she didn't know how to swim, and in a moment of dizziness, Little Luodi unknowingly slipped out of her arms.

When she woke up, Mrs. Li found that she and many other passengers had been rescued by the Japanese, but her two daughters were nowhere to be found. Three months later, she secretly escaped from the Japanese concentration camp and took a junk boat back to Singapore. From then on, Mrs. Li lived alone, shedding the hot tears of a loving mother who had lost her beloved daughter in painful remembrance and hope, dreaming of the day when her beloved daughter would return to her arms - two years, two years, and four and a half sad years passed.

Heaven finally gave her a last chance. It turned out that Bai Di relied on her life-saving object - a box - and drifted in the sea, was rescued by the Japanese, taken to Guadalcanal Island 4,000 miles away, and handed over to an old nanny in the camp. During this period, Little Bai Di suffered countless hardships. Until Guadalcanal was recaptured by the US military, local residents found an abandoned little girl in a ditch. The back of her head was injured by the butt of a Japanese gun, and both arms were stabbed by military knives. Her poor little life was already dying. The residents could not bear to watch her die, so they sent her to the US Navy camp and handed her over to the camp teacher, Gavin. Reverend Gavin had taught in China for many years and was proficient in eight Chinese dialects, but Little Bai Di still could not communicate with him and only told him her name was Bai Di, so Reverend Gavin gave her the name Patsy.

Little Bai Di fortunately gradually recovered her health and was sent by the US military authorities to two orphanages in Espiritu Santo and Efate. At that time, a New York Times reporter, Hailey, published two articles describing this Chinese girl stranded in a foreign land. At this time, Mrs. Li's younger sister, Ms. Lin Li Yuee, was studying cancer at a hospital in New York. After seeing this news in the newspaper, she guessed that it was her little niece. When the war ended in August of last year, Ms. Li Yuee immediately wrote a letter to tell her sister the good news. Mrs. Li Yuechang was filled with mixed feelings of sadness and joy and hurriedly wrote to Hailey and Gavin, confirming that she had a missing child who matched what they said.

Finally, Mrs. Li exhausted her strength and tongue and, after much torment, finally flew from Singapore to Sydney, Australia, and then took a French steamship to Vila. She brought photos and handwriting of Little Bai Di and explained that there was a small scar on the side of her left eye, proving that it was indeed her almost lost beloved daughter.

However, after four and a half years (Little Bai Di celebrated her eleventh birthday on the first of this month), when she saw her mother, she could no longer recognize her. Mrs. Li said with tears in her eyes: "I don't recognize her either." But finally, Little Bai Di was very happy and returned to Singapore in her mother's arms.

Like a general rule, this tragedy turned into a comedy. But what about Little Luodi! There is still no news. We and Mrs. Li similarly hope that a second "miracle" will come!

Little Bai Di before she was lost, only six years old

Four and a half years later, after being rescued, Little Bai Di did not even recognize her mother.

### A Job Search Ends in Death: Heartless Man and Woman Conspire to Strangle Her Husband; The Nameless Male Corpse Case in a Small Creek on Zhongxing Road Solved; Two Criminals Arrested and Detailed Confession Obtained

[Our Newspaper's Report] A male corpse, hands bound with rope, was discovered in a small creek near the entrance of the Yuying Hall on Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, on the evening of the 3rd at 8:00 PM. Details have been reported in this newspaper. At the time, Zhabei Branch police officers found a cigarette case near the deceased, containing a pass bearing the name Gu Yucai, 30 years old, from the First Bao, Fourth Jia, Xinglong Township, Chongming. The branch chief then ordered section chief Wang Shoulin to dispatch officers Shi Xueliang and Chen Fulin to Chongming to investigate. They found Gu Yucai's home, and after questioning, learned that the deceased was indeed Gu. They then brought Gu's mother, Qin (79 years old), to Shanghai. After detailed questioning by the police, it was learned that his daughter-in-law, Gu Cheng Cuiying, 30 years old, was a female worker at the Xinshen No. 9 Factory in West Shanghai. She had returned home once last month, and her son Yucai also planned to come to Shanghai to work, asking her to help find him a place to stay. She said that doing business in Shanghai required a cash deposit of one or two million. Later, she received a letter from Cuiying in Shanghai, saying that she had secured a shipping business opportunity, but he needed to bring money to Shanghai. On the morning of the 3rd, Yucai took a boat to Shanghai, saying that his daughter-in-law Cuiying lived at No. 19 Qi Chuan's house in Cunshan Lane, Caojiadu. Officers were then dispatched to investigate. According to people at that address, she had not been staying there for some time. They also searched for her at Xinshen No. 9 Factory, but could not find her. Later, a Chongming male worker, Yang Peiyu, said that he only knew that her younger brother, Cheng Xijie (21 years old), was an apprentice at the Fuchang New Flour Mill on Wan'an Road, Jiangwan. Xijie was then brought to the police station for questioning and confessed that his sister was at No. 4 Tan Jiaqiao, Zhabei. On the 7th, he was taken to that location, where the woman and her lover, Xu Meifang, were arrested and taken to the station for preliminary interrogation, where they finally confessed the truth. According to Xu Meifang, 38 years old, from Suzhou, he ran a barrel-making shop at No. 4 Tan Jiaqiao. In July, after his first wife died, he began living with Cheng Cuiying. Cheng Cuiying confessed that Gu Yucai was killed by her. She had discussed it with her lover beforehand, fearing that her relationship would be difficult to keep secret when her husband came to Shanghai. Xu then suggested killing Yucai after he arrived in Shanghai. For days, he ordered Cheng to wait at the pier. On the afternoon of the 3rd, she went with a close female friend, unaware that Xu was following them. Soon after, the ship arrived in Shanghai, and Yucai disembarked. After they met, the two women left. She and her husband went to see a play at the Xianshi Amusement Park, and then went out for dinner, while Xu followed closely behind. Then she lied, saying that a business deal had been secured and that they needed to go to the North Station to meet the introducer in order to get the job. Yucai trusted her and took a streetcar to Xinzha Bridge and walked north. When they reached Zhongxing Road, it was exceptionally dark. Xu saw that no one was around, took out the prepared hemp rope, and put it around her husband's neck from behind. Her husband, caught off guard, immediately fell to the ground. She tightened the rope, and he quickly died. Then she bound his hands and dumped him in a nearby small creek. After recording their statements, they were sent to the judicial authorities for further investigation.

### Ju Feng Silver Store Commits Deceit: Inlaid Gem Rings Switched

[Our Newspaper's Report] Hao Shaoxi, a refugee from northern Jiangsu, went to Jufeng Silver Store on Sichuan North Road, near Old Baz Road, at 5:00 PM on the 24th of last month with his friend Zhang Guoxiang. He requested that two gold rings be inlaid with a yellow gemstone (commonly known as cat's eye) and a red gemstone (rose purple), respectively. The employee Bao Baokang negotiated and agreed to deliver the goods in six days, and then took the receipt and left. When he went to pick up the rings, both gemstones were not the originals, and he refused to accept them. According to the owner, Wang Yiqi, one cat's eye gemstone had been lost by the silversmith, but the silversmith had just left Shanghai to return to his hometown. Hao said that the two gemstones were ancestral heirlooms. Before the war, they were estimated to be worth one hundred shi of rice. The red gemstone is currently worth five to six hundred thousand yuan at market prices. He reported the situation to the Hongri Branch, and Section Chief Shi immediately ordered police officers to arrest Wang Yiqi and Bao Baokang for questioning. They were evasive. Section Chief Shi believed that Hao Shaoxi was a country bumpkin who could be deceived, and that they intended to take possession of the gemstones. He ordered their detention and transfer to the local prosecutor's office for further investigation.

### These Days, Dance Hall Business Is Not What It Used to Be: Many Are Converting to American Goods Stalls; Dancers Are Retiring Daily

[Our Newspaper's Report] As of yesterday, there are a total of 3,115 registered dancers in the city who have obtained permits from the police station.

According to Bao Tianyi, the chief of the Zhengsu section, 18 people have applied to retire this month, and the number was the highest in the previous month, reaching over a hundred. In order to remedy the dismal business situation, dance halls have also been using their venues to sell American goods, but these stall licenses still need to be approved by the relevant authorities.

### Eliminate Theft on the Huangpu River: Pay Attention to Workers

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the rampant theft on the Huangpu River, a reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Water Police Branch, who said: There is absolutely no problem with theft on the water. Theft on green boats can be divided into two types: (1) Dock workers, because of low wages, cannot make a living and often take advantage of their work to steal goods when they finish work. Although the quantity is not large, the total is considerable. The branch is currently working to eliminate this, and the first step is to strictly control the foremen. Whenever workers finish work, plainclothes officers are dispatched to the scene to monitor. If such an incident occurs, they will be arrested and investigated. (2) Thieves mix in with the workers to steal. Whenever foreign ships arrive at the port to open their holds and unload goods, detectives are secretly dispatched to check the workers' badges one by one. Anyone who is not a worker and is found mixed in the hold will be arrested and interrogated. Recently, the branch has decided to eliminate theft on the Huangpu River and hopes that all shipping companies will assist at any time to facilitate progress. If an incident occurs, you can call 88867 or 88061.

### General Manager of Yi Taixing Weeps Inconsolably; Shen Jinzhou Denies Aiding the Enemy; Sentencing Scheduled for the Morning of the 15th

[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court concluded the trial of Shen Jinzhou, general manager of the Yi Taixing coal briquette factory, on charges of being a traitor, yesterday morning and scheduled sentencing for 9:30 AM on the 15th. Shen is currently 60 years old, a native of Yuyao. After the victory, he was reported, alleging that after the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source of coal in Shanghai fell into enemy hands. The incoming coal was controlled and operated by the Coal Association organized by Japanese companies such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Yamashita. Shen Jinzhou and 16 fellow merchants of Dachang pooled funds to organize the Dazhong Lian Coal Company. Shen was elected as chairman and purchased coal from the Coal Association. Because the quantity was insufficient, he supplied it to the city through an allocation system. In 1933, the coal company was reorganized into the Da巾Lian Coal Company Unified Distribution Office, and Shen was re-elected as the managing director. His business remained the same as before. From January 1934, because the enemy was losing the Pacific War and lacked shipping, the coal company sent civilian ships to Qingdao to transport coal to Shanghai, half of which was used by the enemy military and half of which was supplied to the city.

Since the case was prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office, the High Court has held several hearings to investigate. Shen has denied aiding the enemy with coal. When he was brought in for questioning yesterday, he was already in tears before he could speak. He testified: After the outbreak of the Pacific War, all the coal in Shanghai was controlled by the Coal Association, causing a great shortage of coal on the market. The shops had no goods to supply, and the citizens had no coal briquettes to burn. At that time, the person in charge of the original trade association had dispersed, so many fellow merchants came to me and asked for ways to help. So, I organized the Dazhong Lian Coal Company Unified Distribution Office, registered with the Coal Association, and after being allocated coal, distributed it to fellow merchants for retail to citizens. Because there were more monks than porridge, the distribution could not be averaged, causing jealousy among a few fellow merchants, which led to the occurrence of this case. As for saying that coal was transported from Qingdao to Shanghai to aid the enemy, that is not the case. He asked the court to declare him innocent.

### Qian Zhongdao and Ma Wenlin Indicted by the High Court

[Our Newspaper's Report] Qian Zhongdao, 50 years old, a native of Ningbo, has been practicing law in this city. After the victory, he was reported by the lawyer's anti-traitor group, alleging that Qian had successively served as the director of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, the secretary of the puppet Municipal Administration, and the chief advisor of the puppet Stamp Tax Bureau during the Anti-Japanese War. He was also hired by the puppet court to take over the Shanghai Bar Association. The case has been investigated and concluded by the High Prosecutor's Office and has been formally indicted. Qian is now detained in the Shanghai Prison.

Ma Wenlin, 45 years old, a native of Henan. After the victory, he was reported as being suspected of being a traitor. He was granted bail during the investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office. When Chang Mabu returned to the prison, his relatives set off firecrackers in front of the door to show their welcome. The prosecutor saw this and re-detained Ma for investigation. A public prosecution was filed recently. The indictment alleges that Ma colluded with the enemy military police Kubota, served as the intelligence director in that team, provided intelligence, and also served as the liaison director of the "East Asia Alliance," and opened gambling houses to extract commissions.

### Wang Yanfu Assisted the Enemy in Implementing the Poisoning Policy

Wang Yanfu was engaged in the opium business. He was accused of running the Yuan Tai Tu Hang for the enemy puppets in 1931, when the enemy puppets occupied Shanghai and were in charge of opium. It was located in Yan Hai Lane, Nine Mu Block, Nanshi, and was dedicated to handling opium registration and allocation for the enemy puppets, promoting the enemy's poisoning policy. When the High Court opened the trial yesterday, the defendant only admitted to working as a Yuan Tai Tu Hang employee but resigned immediately. Therefore, the facts stated in the indictment are all fabricated, he said. The case was adjourned for another hearing.

The cases of Zhang Suxing, the director of the puppet Shanghai Anti-Smoking Bureau Nanshi Inspection Office, which was remanded for retrial, and Chuan Guangyao, the merchant who purchased copper coins for melting and aided the enemy, were inquired yesterday afternoon and both were detained pending another hearing.

### Thugs Indicted in Extortion Case of Yuan Xuefen

### Suspicion of Theft of Materials on Fuxing Island: Local Prosecutor's Office Sends Letter to General Assistance for Investigation

[Our Newspaper's Report] It is said that before the victory, the Japanese army hid materials worth hundreds of billions of yuan in underground tunnels on Fuxing Island in Wusong Town. The tunnels were later discovered by the General Administration of Agricultural Committee when building livestock houses on the island, but all the original hidden materials were gone. The staff of the association did not report to their superiors when they were found, so they were secretly reported and accused to the Cleaning Team, saying that the staff of the association were suspected of embezzling the materials. The case was transferred to the local prosecutor's office by the Cleaning Team, and prosecutor Gu Hongbiao is investigating. Because the circumstances are complicated and bizarre, he has sent a letter to the General Administration requesting assistance in investigating the truth of the case. He also summoned the original secret reporter to court for questioning on the 17th of this month.

### Welfare Soy Sauce Factory Forged Account Books to Evade National Taxes

Factory Owner Gui Zuren Detained, Accountant Allowed to Provide Written Guarantee

[Our Newspaper] Gui Zuren, the factory owner of the Welfare Soy Sauce Factory located at the intersection of Zhonghua New Road and Baochang Road in this city, was reported by his business director, Jiao Rongjun, for forging account books in an attempt to evade national taxes and reduce employee bonuses. The district court held a hearing yesterday. Based on calculations from the three genuine account books seized, covering the period from August 10th to the 20th, the factory's business revenue for those ten days amounted to 7,750,950 yuan, while the forged account books showed only 2,053,400 yuan. From this, it was inferred that the amount of evaded national taxes must be substantial. Therefore, Gui Zuren was immediately detained in court. The second defendant, the factory's accountant surnamed He, was allowed to provide a written guarantee and will be interrogated again at a later date.

### Four War Criminals Identified, Military Tribunal Files Public Prosecution

[Our Newspaper] The four Japanese war criminals identified by comrades who suffered during the War of Resistance against Japan, namely Kanzaburo Sugawara, Masuhiro Hirara, Daizo Nitta, and Sadakichi Numano, have been thoroughly investigated by Prosecutor Lin Wopeng of the First Pacification Zone Military Tribunal, and a public prosecution was filed yesterday. The four defendants were formerly chiefs and sergeants of the Japanese military police in the western part of Shanghai. On April 10, 1945, Yu Peng, an intelligence officer of our underground work, was arrested by the enemy in Qingpu and sent to the Shanghai West Military Police Team. The defendants used torture to extract information and sent him to the military court for sentencing. After the victory, the defendants were detained by the War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense. Not long ago, Yu Peng went to identify them.

### Two-Thirds of Foreign Resident Certificates Issued

Korean Registration Involves More Steps

[Our Newspaper] According to statistics, there are over 60,000 foreign residents in this city. The relevant department of the police bureau has been actively registering households and issuing foreign resident certificates for several months, and two-thirds of the process has been completed. In addition to those who have been repatriated, there are still approximately 1,000 Koreans remaining in Shanghai. The management of Koreans is slightly different from that of other foreigners. Their household registration was originally handled directly by the police bureau, but after consultations between the Korean delegation and our government, the process was changed to require the delegation to conduct a general registration first, then forward it to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and then to the police bureau. This involves more steps. Therefore, as of now, the police bureau has issued residency certificates to only over 200 Koreans.

### Spanish Jai Alai Players in Shanghai Find New Outlets: New Courts Being Established in the United States Recruit in Shanghai; Many Have Accepted and Gone to the United States to Showcase Their Skills

[Our Newspaper] Among the Spanish expatriates in Shanghai, there are a number of former jai alai players. Since the jai alai courts were banned from operating, these individuals have lost their livelihoods and are in dire straits. These players used to have high incomes and extravagant lifestyles. Now that they have lost their jobs, many are at a loss. Some have turned to brokerage and other occupations to make a living, but most are even struggling to make ends meet. However, it has recently been learned that they have found new outlets. A large jai alai court has recently opened in Miami, USA, and is recruiting a large number of players. As a result, many of them have received employment contracts and are preparing to go to the United States to showcase their skills. Heroes finally have a place to use their talents. The total number of Spanish expatriates currently in Shanghai is over 400, mostly engaged in business.

### Police Bureau Repairs Police Bells, Charging Each Household 20,000

[Our Newspaper] The Police Bureau held a Police Bell Promotion Committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Fang Zhichao, the director of the bureau's administrative department. The following resolutions were made: (1) The police bells installed in Huangpu District have become ineffective after prolonged exposure to wind and rain and must be repaired urgently. The total cost is estimated to be over 24 million yuan. It was decided that each household that originally had a police bell installed will pay 20,000 yuan. The committee members of each trade association will take turns sending two representatives to collect the fees together with personnel dispatched by the local police bureau. (2) As the winter defense season is approaching, the installation of police bells in the Lao Zha District is of utmost importance. It was resolved that the municipal council should first notify the member stores of each trade association to undertake the installation. At the same time, the municipal government should instruct the district baojia chiefs to encourage all merchants to install the devices. The required cost will depend on the number of households installing them and the effort is being actively promoted.

### A Former Enemy Military Police Officer in Jiujiang Who Murdered Our Patriots Was Interrogated by the District Prosecutor's Office Yesterday; He Persistently Denied Knowing Anything

[Our Newspaper] The former enemy military police officer, Chuyo Masayoshi, was summoned by the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday.

Therefore, the District Prosecutor's Office will notify the War Criminals Management Office to investigate Ogasawara.

### Tuberculosis Rampant Since Victory A Year Ago (Part Two)

Of those examined, only two-fifths had normal hearts and lungs, while 795 people, or 24.65% of the total, suffered from lung diseases, a shockingly high number that broke all previous records of the hospital. The age of tuberculosis patients ranged from one year old to 59 years old, with the highest number being 22 years old, accounting for 54 of the 795 patients. The next highest group was 23 to 26 years old, each accounting for over 40 people. From 18 to 33 years old, the peak period for tuberculosis patients, accounted for a total of 582 people, or slightly less than 73% of the total, indicating that these are the most dangerous years of life. The intensity of the tuberculosis offensive in this city is evident here! It is hoped that all parties will pay close attention and work together to prevent this great threat to the health of the city and the nation from intensifying. At the same time, the masses living in this metropolis should be aware of the lurking dangers of tuberculosis and be prepared for new offensives that may attack our health. Everyone should undergo early check-ups, both to give patients the opportunity for early recovery and to cut off the source of infection, and to enable people to know how to prevent and avoid infection. For the sake of public and personal interests and for the sake of public safety, these wise measures should be taken.

According to Dr. Shando, a UN tuberculosis expert, at a press conference in London, Chinese students have a particularly high rate of tuberculosis, four to five times higher than young adults in other parts of the world, because China has failed to obtain basic sanitary facilities and individual preventative examinations, millions of people will die of tuberculosis. It can be seen that the destruction of youth by tuberculosis is truly alarming. Students are mostly at a dangerous age during their studies and live in a city where tuberculosis is rampant. If they do not have check-ups early, not only will their lung health be unknown, but those with latent tuberculosis will mistake themselves for being healthy, delay treatment, and make unnecessary sacrifices. Should our young students not be vigilant?

### Reader Consultation: Medicine and Health

(1) Mental Disorder

Yang Yihe asks: My daughter is already 30 years old and has not yet married. She suffers from a mental disorder. Every week before her period, she feels a headache. Her words and actions gradually become abnormal. Her liver fire rises. When her period arrives, she enters a comatose state, appearing drunk. She does not respond to conversations, but her diet is normal, and her appetite increases. She returns to normal three or four days after her period. Her intellect is clear, and she treats people and handles matters thoroughly. This disease started four years ago when she was teaching at Qixia Elementary School. She then went home to recuperate and did not seek treatment. It took two months for her to recover. Since April of last year, it has been recurring regularly every month. Is this disease related to marriage issues? Is there any special treatment? Please advise.

### City Council's New Site Issue: Some Councilors Favor Building a New Building

The City Council decided to purchase the former Japanese Residents Association site on Peng Road from the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau for its new location. However, it is currently being leased by the U.S. military for use as a U.S. Sailors' Club. According to various sources, although the lease is about to expire, it is likely to be renewed, and the council will continue to fight for it. Another group of councilors believes that the council urgently needs a fixed location. The reconstruction of the American racecourse is uncertain, and the recovery of the former Japanese Residents Association site is also problematic. They propose to use a vacant lot of approximately eight and four-tenths mu (unit of area) at the corner of Linsen Middle Road and Avenue Road (formerly French Concession) as the site. The building equipment has been well-planned by the previous Provisional Council. The planned site is a two-story building with a capacity of 350 seats downstairs and 250 seats upstairs, along with a conference room, offices, councilor's lounge, library, cloakroom, telephone room, and men's and women's restrooms. The construction cost is estimated to be 950 million yuan.

### Wholesale and Retail Profits are Limited, Cotton Yarn Market Transactions are Sluggish, High-Priced Goods Have to be Shipped and Sold to Other Places

[Our Newspaper] After Mayor Wu summoned representatives of yarn merchants the other day and instructed them to strictly abide by the negotiated price trading of cotton yarn, Tang Zhiliang, the chairman of the Yarn Merchants Association, notified all members of the association yesterday morning to conscientiously comply. At the same time, the association posted an emergency warning, stating: "Yesterday, we received Mayor Wu's personal instruction: 'Yarn merchants should abide by the price limit of cotton yarn, with a wholesale profit of 5% and a retail profit of 10%, and must not exceed these regulations. Those who violate these rules will be severely punished. You are hereby instructed to inform your colleagues and comply accordingly.' This is an emergency warning, and we hope that everyone will comply." In other words, the price of 20-count yarn should not exceed 1,837,500 yuan for spot transactions on the association's market. However, not only is it difficult for guest merchants to purchase spot goods, but even people in the industry find it difficult to purchase from yarn factories at this price limit. As a result, a stalemate has formed with a lack of transactions. Only 10-count and 16-count yarn have small-scale transactions. As for 20-count yarn and above, because the refunds have not been fully cleared, most of the yarn in the hands of yarn merchants was traded outside the customs for 2 million yuan. It is estimated that the goods with warehouse receipts traded at that price are over 10,000 pieces and are awaiting clearance. As for other spot goods traded outside the customs for 2 million yuan, they can only be shipped and sold to other places. Yarn merchants have indicated that they will abide by the negotiated price trading of cotton yarn in this city from now on. It is also heard that various textile and construction private factories also shipped many pieces of cotton yarn to other places yesterday.

Also, at around 4:00 PM yesterday, Liu Wenteng, the director of the Business Department of the Textile Management Committee, summoned yarn merchant representatives Tang Zhiliang and Zhou Jiasheng to inform them of the various important cases decided by the Textile Management Committee the other day and instructed them to comply. Tang and Zhou proposed two points: (1) The yarn and cloth sold by the Central Trust Bureau as an agent of the government's material sales have always been sold at the highest black market price. Can the premium on this batch of cotton yarn also be refunded? (2) The British-owned Jardine and Lundon factories in this city have always opened yarn at market prices. Can they also be compensated for overpayments and underpayments according to the negotiated prices? It is heard that the Textile Management Committee has not yet considered this, so there was no definite answer, but it was promised that the opinions would be recorded and discussed.

It is also learned that the total monthly yarn production of national and private factories in this city is currently 65,000 pieces. Of this, 36% is allocated to various reproduction industries, 35% is used by yarn factories with weaving machines, 8% is shipped and sold to South China, and 21% is shipped and sold to other places by national and private factories.

### Edible Oil Issue: Mayor Wu Convenes Meeting, Prohibits Arbitrary Price Increases, Uniform Distribution Agency to be Established Soon, Loan Issues to be Discussed at Meeting Today

[Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu, angered by the recent surge in oil prices, convened a discussion meeting with various parties related to edible oil at the municipal government conference room at 2:30 PM yesterday. Those in attendance included Xie Yuxiang, Wang Shuxin, Zhang Derun, Zhang Chao, Ji Mingzhai, Huang Jiaju, and Chuan Changyu. Mayor Wu was extremely angered by the recent sharp rise in oil prices. He earnestly advised the oil merchants that if they had difficulties, they should raise them as much as possible and discuss solutions. If the oil market continues to rise arbitrarily, the authorities will take decisive action. The representatives then presented their opinions. The discussion process and its decisions are recorded as follows: (1) This city needs 36,000 dan of edible oil every month. Of this amount, China Edible Oil Company and China Vegetable Oil Factory will each allocate 10,000 dan. The remaining shortfall will be borne by eight private factories. Zhongshi (China Edible Oil Co.) allocates oil every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Zhongzhi (China Vegetable Oil Factory) allocates oil every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The private factories allocated 720 dan yesterday and will allocate 700 dan every day starting today. All oil allocations from the factories will be based on negotiated prices, namely 98,000 yuan per dan for soybean oil, 99,000 yuan per dan for raw oil, and 92,000 yuan per dan for sesame oil. (2) According to the manufacturers, the cost of oil extraction is 28,000 yuan per dan for soybeans, 3,500 yuan per dan for extraction labor, and each dan can extract 10 jin (Chinese pounds) of oil and 48 jin of soybean cake (equivalent to nine sheets). The problem is that soybean cake is not in season, cannot be sold, and is subject to interest charges. It is hoped that the soybean cake can be shipped to Taiwan. Also, the cost of raw oil from Qingdao also exceeds the current official price. Mayor Wu stated that the 1,500 barrels of raw oil that arrived from Qingdao the other day should still be sold at the official price first, and then a solution would be discussed. (3) The vegetable oil factory intends to request an increase in electricity in order to increase production. Mayor Wu stated that the electricity problem could be resolved by the end of November. (4) The profit margin for wholesale oil merchants was decided to be 3% above the negotiated price. Retail oil merchants have higher costs, so the profit margin is 10% above the negotiated price and must not be exceeded. (5) The city bank will loan 500 million yuan for private oil factories to purchase raw materials. However, the extracted oil should be sold as it is extracted and directly allocated to retailers.

It is heard that the authorities will soon establish a central oil distribution agency to unify the oil distribution process. All oil produced by national and private factories will be centrally allocated by this agency. Mayor Wu will convene representatives from the Central Trust Bureau, the city bank, the Taiwan Trade Company, the Taiwan Sugar Company, and the Oil Extraction Industry Association this afternoon to discuss issues such as loans and the shipment of soybean cake to Taiwan.

The oil market was slightly calmer yesterday. However, merchants from Guangdong, Shantou, Xiamen, and Ningbo made substantial purchases, which had an impact on market prices. However, the prices of various edible oils were still lower than the previous day. Raw oil was 120,000 yuan, and soybean oil was 112,000 yuan, both 2,000 yuan lower than the previous day.

### More Rice Arriving in Market, Japonica and Indica Rice Unchanged

Over 11,000 shi (unit of volume) of rice arrived in the north and south markets. Stores were still quiet. The north market was firm in the morning and stable in the afternoon, with no changes. The south market continued to decline by 1,000 yuan due to the continuous arrival of goods from the south. High-quality japonica rice in the north was still stable, while indica rice softened. The price of white rice saw little fluctuation, and that of unpolished rice also remained unchanged. A large amount of soybeans arrived in the market, but sales in other places were stagnant. Oil factories had poor demand, and the price fell by another 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake was suspended in Shantou, with no sales, and the price remained flat. The same was true for bran. The flour market was sluggish, declining by 100-200 yuan. Wheat continued to fall by 300-500 yuan. Sesame seeds were popular and dry, rising by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts from Shandong, Henan, and northern Jiangsu arrived in the market but remained stagnant, falling by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Red beans continued to fall by 2,000-3,000 yuan.

### Central Bank Continues to Sell, Gold Price Slightly Lower Than Before

Yesterday, the price of gold reversed its trend. It opened at around 2.42 million. The central bank continued to exert pressure. Silver shops, due to the proximity of rationing, temporarily adopted a wait-and-see approach. The price soon broke into 2.4 million, falling to 2.38 million before temporarily stabilizing. After 10:00 AM, the central bank sold 60 bars at a price of 2.395 million. Afterwards, investors continued to absorb. The price soon rose again to over 2.4 million. In the afternoon, intraday trading was slightly bullish. After the central bank sold futures as much as possible, the price fell back to under 2.4 million at closing, resulting in a decrease of 18,000 compared to the previous close. Ornaments were 254,000, silver remained flat, and silver dollars decreased slightly. Interest rates on the black market were stable, remaining at around 1.5 jiao (unit of currency).

Foreign currencies were stable. The black market price of U.S. dollars was around 4,100-4,150 yuan, the same as the previous day. Hong Kong dollars also hovered around the previous price, resulting in the same as the previous day. The Hong Kong exchange rate remained weak due to sluggish sales, with no demand. It was sold at 870 yuan yesterday. The Indian exchange rate was 1,055 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 14,100 yuan, all selling prices. There were even fewer transactions. The official U.S. exchange rate remained stagnant with no transactions.

### Issue of Japanese Cocoon Imports into China: Center of Gravity Has Shifted From Tokyo to Washington

[Our Newspaper] Negotiations for the import of Japanese cocoons into China have been transferred to the State Department because MacArthur's headquarters believes that the matter is related to the U.S. national economy and should not be decided by the headquarters. Therefore, the focus of the negotiations has shifted from Tokyo to Washington. The person in charge of the China Silk Corporation visited President Song in Nanjing on Monday to request instructions and returned to Shanghai on Wednesday. In the future, the matter will be directly negotiated by our embassy in the United States with the U.S. government. The representative of the China Silk Corporation in New York will also participate when external assistance is needed for consultation. Relevant sources told reporters that the outcome of the negotiations is difficult to predict, and our country will do its best. However, two facts should be noted: First, the United States has a fixed policy of supporting the Japanese silk industry, and large-scale Japanese cocoon imports into China are contrary to this policy. Second, if Japanese cocoons are used to supply our country's silk weaving industry, the quality of the products will be inferior to that of Japanese products, which does not meet the needs of the United States. At the same time, the market for our country's silk is not limited to the United States now or in the future. Therefore, for the United States, it is certainly not as easy to control as Japanese silk. When asked if our country's manufacturers are already feeling a shortage of raw silk, the answer was that there are factories lacking silk, but the situation is not serious for the entire industry.

### Rumors of Delivery Again, Chinese Stocks Change From Weak to Stable

The Chinese stock market was volatile yesterday. The short sellers were nervous because borrowing goods was difficult. No. 176 sold in large quantities, the price went up and then came back down, and the situation was unstable. The market opened with generally weak stocks. After opening, the prices went down slightly. Maintained at low prices by No. 171, No. 232, etc. They gradually improved. The surface changed from short to long, and the outside market also began to squeeze the shorts. Soon, a buying spree began, and Yong Yarn returned above the 600 yuan level. After the high point, it gradually hovered and then returned within the level. No. 176 repeatedly sold Yong Yarn and Xinhe, and the surface gradually loosened. No. 198 also sold, and it gradually weakened. There was no such thing as No. 176, and the retail investors were unstable, and there were more and more cuts. Near noon, there were low prices. After 11:15, there was replenishment outside the market, and No. 232 continued to absorb. The noon closing showed a circling pattern. Yong Yarn, Jingfu, and Xinguang fell slightly compared to the previous closing, and Meiya, Xinhe, and Qinxing rose slightly. Among the cold stocks, the ups and downs varied. In the afternoon, the market was enthusiastic because of the intraweek delivery. In addition, there was talk that "delivery" could be implemented next Wednesday. The shares once rebounded, but No. 198 and short selling outside the market were not completely wiped out and were unable to rise further. Finally, due to the gathering of retail sales, they fell again. Near the closing, they gradually stabilized. As a result, Yong Yarn, Jingfu, and Xinguang fell slightly compared to the previous closing, while Meiya, Xinhe, and Qinxing rose slightly. Among the cold stocks, Jin Silk fell to a standstill, Wuhe fell by more than 10%, and the rest saw slight ups and downs. The total transaction volume was 12.46 million shares, and the stocks outside the market also fell again.

There were still many sellers of foreign stocks, and the buyers were watching from the sidelines. There were not many transactions. Paper was almost on the market but not sold. Wheelock was still stable, while the rest weakened due to multiple settlements. As a result, Industry Wide and Wheelock were stable compared to the previous closing, Jardine and British-American Yarn fell slightly, and the rest fell by about half a percent.

### Cloth Market Sales Gradually Active

The cloth market showed a slight upward trend. Due to the welcome activities for Japanese sales, Tianjin merchants absorbed a huge amount. General observations show a thriving trend. However, the rise was not strong due to large-scale sales by textile companies. The leading fine cloth in the market opened at 83,000 yuan yesterday. The Four Gentlemen old-fashioned serge cloth was 94,000 yuan. However, the Changzhou goods rose sharply by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. The Jia Guan fine cloth rose by 10,000 yuan compared to the previous low price, with a shout of 69,000 yuan. The Elephant Head shouted 72,000 yuan.

### Arrival of Melton at Wholesale Prices

American Melton cloth, currently holding a very important position among woolen fabrics, enjoys robust and unparalleled market demand. Wholesale transactions within the industry, aside from direct orders from foreign firms, offer little profit. Commission for brokers typically ranges from only one to two hundred or fifty yuan per yard. Due to the high volume of transactions and strong demand, all transactions must be conducted in cash. Industry insiders thus refer to it as "gold bars," signifying its immediate convertibility. However, the abundant market supply keeps prices consistently moderate. White-edged cloth was sold for 33,000 yuan yesterday, pink-edged for 32,000 yuan, and natural-colored for 31,000 yuan.

### Reliance on Old Iron Due to Limited Supply of Pig Iron - Destruction of Ma'anshan Mine and Scarcity of American Goods - Market Prices Rise with Difficulties in Rationing

[Our Newspaper Reports] The pig iron market has recently become lively due to the scarcity of incoming goods and the extremely thin reserves in the city. The price of new pig iron is between 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan per ton, while old pig iron also reaches 1 million yuan per ton. Before May, the price of both new and old pig iron was only around 300,000 yuan per ton. According to a responsible person from the Iron Industry Association speaking to our reporter, the main source of domestic pig iron is the iron mine in Ma'anshan, Jiujiang. The mine has abundant reserves but has been damaged by the war and cannot provide normal supplies for the time being. Otherwise, its production could have met the national consumption needs with surplus. After the victory, the main source of new pig iron in this city was mostly from orders placed in America. However, the US export licenses for pig iron are intermittently issued, resulting in a very limited supply. In total, only about five to six thousand tons of pig iron have been shipped from the US since the victory. Currently, in addition to placing orders in America, pig iron merchants occasionally initiate orders from Hong Kong, where the pig iron mainly comes from Britain and India. Currently, due to the shortage of pig iron in the city, the iron merchants mainly rely on searching and purchasing old pig iron from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Suzhou to meet the demand. Although there have been requests for pig iron rationing, the possibility seems extremely slim.

### Bond Market Rebounds Midway

Government bonds gradually stabilized yesterday. Unified Class C bonds opened at 1,180 yuan in the morning, offered by Fuyuan and others. Large investors such as Siqi and Qilou were quite interested, causing the price to initially drop to 1,140 yuan. However, it rebounded to around 1,350 yuan midway, fluctuating between 1,310 yuan and 1,340 yuan at noon. As a result, the closing price was 100 yuan higher for Class A, unchanged for Class B, 80 yuan higher for Class C, 110 yuan higher for Class D, and 90 yuan higher for Class E compared to the previous day's close.

It has issued instructions to education departments and bureaus in various provinces and cities to comply immediately. The main points are as follows: (1) Educational films will be sent by the ministry to education departments and bureaus in various provinces and cities for distribution to audiovisual education institutions for application.

### Zang Qifang Arrives in Nanjing to Discuss Impressions After Inspecting Education in the Northeast - The Japanese Did Not Succeed in Their Enslavement Education in the Northeast

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 8th] Zang Qifang, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Education in the Northeast, recently came to Nanjing for official business. He told reporters about his impressions of inspecting education in the Northeast, stating: The Japanese did not succeed in their enslavement education in the Northeast. The more they oppressed, the greater the resistance of the youth. Therefore, the patriotic sentiment of the Northeast youth is definitely not inferior to that of the inland youth. However, the Japanese policy of educating the people in ignorance in the Northeast has had a considerable impact. The enemy and puppets in the Northeast focused on practical sciences, such as agriculture, industry, and medicine, and did not pay attention to liberal arts. It can be said that the enemy only focused on skills and did not focus on academics. They did not want the Chinese people to have patriotic ideas. Therefore, regarding the education of Northeast youth, it is not as important to focus on history and geography knowledge to inspire their patriotism as it is to focus on liberal arts to cultivate their thinking ability and awaken their spontaneous spirit.

### Academic Awards for the 35th and 36th Years - Applications to Begin on the First of Next Month

[Our Newspaper Nanjing] The Academic Review Committee of the Ministry of Education held its 16th regular meeting of the 2nd session on the 6th, approving the qualifications of teachers above the college level and deciding that the academic awards for the 35th and 36th years will be held jointly.

According to Zhao Shanji, the chief secretary of the committee, the Ministry of Education's academic awards for the 34th year received more than 150 applications from the domestic academic community regarding "writings," "inventions," and "art." Because it was the time of victory in the Anti-Japanese War and repatriation, the expert review committee members were mostly in various places, busy with repatriation, so the conclusion was later due to various transportation reasons. It is estimated that the review meeting can be held within December of this year to determine the amount of the awards. The amount of the awards was originally set at 100,000 yuan for the first prize, 60,000 yuan for the second prize, and 30,000 yuan for the third prize, as well as the winners. The academic awards for the 35th and 36th years will be held jointly. The application period is set from December 1 of this year to the end of June next year.

(3) to participate in the Paris Peace Conference as a Chinese consultant, specializing in collecting two boxes of information from various countries.

It is reported that the school's books and cultural relics were destroyed by the Japanese army in the past. The auditorium lacked the school motto plaque. President Ling of the school requested President Chiang to inscribe calligraphy, which has been approved and will be inaugurated at the same time to show solemnity.

### Football Friendly Match - Railway Triumphs Yesterday

2-1 Victory Over British Navy

In the football friendly match, the Railway team played against the British Navy yesterday afternoon at 3:30 at Jinyuan Park. The Railway team had Han Longhai, Zhang Lingen, Li Yao, and Fei Chunhua playing, and their momentum was very strong. After two defeats, the British Navy had adjusted its lineup and its skills were gradually becoming more refined. The two sides played a close match and the competition was quite fierce. As a result, the Railway team defeated the British Navy 2-1.

After the contact, the Railway's attack was blocked, and the British army launched a counterattack. Betz broke through the center and opened the scoring first. After losing a city, the whole army rose up. In the middle, Zhuan Longhai rushed up and headed the ball, and the ball bounced back off Hohut, hitting Xiao Ziwen who was waiting in the right position, and he pushed it into the empty goal, making it a 1-1 tie. Fei Chunhua continued to work hard, Hohut failed to catch the ball, and Xiao Fei lifted his foot and hooked the ball, and the ball flew into the net. After that, the two sides were in a stalemate, and the Railway team took the lead with a score of 2-1, ending the first half. In the second half, the four knights of the Railway team, Han, Zhang, Li, and Fei, retired, and alternative troops were dispatched to replace them. The situation of the two teams became more balanced. At 15 minutes, Daonalai scored a goal, but it was rejected for offside. After that, neither side made any progress, and the game ended hastily. As a result, the Railway team defeated the British Navy 2-1.

Railway Team: Liao Xiong, Yue Renxiao, Cao Liming, Lu Bingsheng, Zhang Lingenshang, Wu Jiabangxia, Lu Qingxiangs Shang Xu Chenyuanxia, Li Yaoshang, Wu Binghaoxia, Xiao Ziwen, Han Longhaishang, Zhang Jiexia, Wu Binghaos Shang, Lu Qingxiangxia, Fei Chunhuashang, Lin Dianyixia.

### Football Players' Out-of-Bounds Behavior - Football Committee Rectifies Discipline - Sends Letters to Teams Asking for Attention to Restraint

The Shanghai Football Committee, in view of the recent accidents on the football field and the out-of-bounds behavior of many players, which is contrary to sportsmanship, sent a letter to all member teams yesterday, urging them to maintain discipline. The original letter is recorded below: "Dear Sirs, Only two weeks after the start of this year's league, players' actions have been rough, their behavior has been undisciplined, or they have ignored the referees in various competitions. These bad phenomena are obstacles to the future of sports and are deeply regrettable. The purpose of participating in the competition is to seek progress in sports and to connect feelings. Since it is a competition, winning or losing is inevitable and not worth much. The actions of the players on the field are responsible for the reputation of the club and themselves. Being unruly and undisciplined is enough to cause ignorant spectators to follow suit and create disputes on the field. It is contrary to the purpose and loses morality. The responsibility of this committee is to do its best to rectify it. In addition to appealing to the press, referee associations, and police authorities to assist in correcting this situation, we are sending this letter to you, hoping that you will uphold the purpose of improving amateur sports, exhort your players to restrain the team, and prevent them from being indulgent, so as to maintain discipline together. Shanghai Sports Association Football Committee."

### Gu Yuxiu Went to Beijing Last Night - Describing the Experience of Overseas Inspection Before Departure

Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Shanghai Education Bureau, was ordered to go to Europe in early August of this year to attend the International Scientific Conference. He has completed his official duties and returned to China from the United States on November 1. He arrived at Longhua Airport at 6:30 PM the day before yesterday (7th). The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is reported that Gu went to Beijing last night to visit Minister Zhu and report on his trip to Europe. He will report to the National Congress on the 11th. Before leaving, Gu briefly described the general situation of the overseas inspection to reporters as follows: After departing from Shanghai, he first went to the western United States and visited the University of California (Atomic Energy Research Center) and the California Institute of Technology (Scientific Research Atomic Energy, Radar, Aviation), all of which were large in scale. Then he went to Switzerland, where he was invited to participate in the 300th anniversary of the Swiss Science Conference. Those who were invited to participate were the former President of the British Royal Society, the President of the University of Paris, and I, representing the President of the National Central University. The mood was warm and I was excited. I was also received by the President of Switzerland to discuss scientific issues between the two countries. Then I went to Paris to attend the International Scientific Conference and the International Applied Mechanics Conference. After the meeting, I stayed at Oxford University in London, England, and visited the vice presidents and deans of various colleges to study academics, and visited Cambridge University. Before leaving, I paid a special visit to the 90-year-old writer Bernard Shaw to pay my respects, and then packed up and took a flying boat from London, passing through Egypt, Cairo, Calcutta, and Hong Kong before returning to Shanghai.

### To Mr. Mao Zedong, A Frank Letter

— Advisor, Zhu Yaotian (Part 1)

Mr. Zedong:

Originally, I intended to go to Yan'an, but due to transportation difficulties, I stopped in _____. Over the past year, apart from receiving permission from your senior cadres to use the name "_____" in _____, I also engaged in two commercial ventures myself: one was the National Grand Theater in _____, and the other was the _____ Antiquities Gallery, dealing in ancient and modern cultural relics. Seeing this, you might say, "Another selfish fellow!" But you might not believe it: if I hadn't engaged in these two commercial ventures, in the "Liberated Zone" where "entry is allowed but exit is not," I would have had absolutely no way to get out. For my own freedom, and for the freedom of many friends who walked down a dead end because of "hearing people say," I had no choice but to do this. In fact, I had to do it. I hope you'll show some mercy in your words!

Participated in Hundreds of Gatherings and Visits

During this year, in my capacity as an advisor, I participated in dozens of large and small gatherings in Central China, and personally made hundreds of visits to various parties. Because of my businessman's guise, I received heartfelt disclosures from all sides. I firmly believe that these are more genuine and reliable than the comrades you send who eat public rations and wear public uniforms. Originally, I planned to publish a critical journal, using the titles you gave me, such as "democratic personage" and "progressive element," publishing articles according to the severity of the matter on a regular basis. However, in the "Liberated Zone" where freedom of speech is absolutely forbidden, one can only keep words deep in one's belly. Otherwise, a warning is a small matter; if one is labeled a "special agent," then only heaven knows what will happen!

I left Huaiyin on the morning of August 17th and only arrived in Shanghai in early September. Because I had tasted the bitterness of the difficult roads in the "Liberated Zone," I felt rather unwell after returning. Therefore, this "frank letter" that I had long wanted to write to you is only being written today. Before getting to the main topic, it seems I should make a statement to you to avoid misunderstandings. I am a person who has dedicated my life to cultural and educational endeavors. I have never participated in any political party, and I am certainly not the "special agent" that your cadres constantly talk about. At the same time, I am also confident that I am neither the "stubborn element" you constantly mention, nor the "reactionary" you shout about in your dreams. I am taking a stand as a pure Chinese cultural figure, saying what a Chinese cultural figure should say. If you truly practice "the speaker is not to be blamed, but the listener should take it as a warning," then this "frank letter" of mine will not only be beneficial to the general intellectuals and semi-intellectuals who "hear people say," but also to the future of the Chinese Communist Party.

Let's start with theory. Never Produced, Yet Revolting Against Others

I think the sole viewpoint of Mr. Marx in writing the doctrine of communism should be the word "exploitation," and the formation of the state of "exploitation" should be the word "production," and the bearers of the word "production" should be the genuine workers and farmers. That is to say, the blood and sweat earnings of a worker or farmer are "exploited" by a non-worker or non-farmer, creating a phenomenon where the producer is starving and freezing, while the non-producer, the "exploiter," is well-fed and warmly clothed. The result of this phenomenon expanding is the formation of class antagonism, which leads to class struggle, which leads to socialist revolution, and then to communist revolution. If my statement is correct, then the prerequisite for a revolutionary should be a genuine producer with absolute nature. Otherwise, there would be no formation of "exploitation," no formation of class antagonism, no class struggle, and of course, no socialist revolution or communist revolution. If someone has always been a non-working, non-farming, free-loader, that is, someone who has never produced, I think that kind of person is only qualified for others to revolt against him, and is absolutely not qualified to revolt against others. However, the Chinese Bolsheviks you lead seem to have not paid attention to this point.

Let's take a typical example. Eating Public Rations, Wearing Public Uniforms: Who Is Exploiting Whom?

How many of the senior cadres under Mr. Mao are production elements who came from worker or peasant backgrounds? If they are not production elements who came from worker or peasant backgrounds, then eating their fill of the public rations of good, honest people and wearing the public uniforms of good, honest people, they swagger around shouting the slogan "Those who obey me prosper, those who resist me perish" and start a revolution. Who is "exploiting" whom here? I think that apart from the saying "revolution is a newly emerging profession in modern times," I really can't find a second explanation. As for the "New Democracy" you crafted, which is neither rent reduction nor interest reduction, it has already become a 100%, 1000% empty signboard for your cadres at all levels to use in external speeches! In fact, you have not implemented even half of it, so I cannot bear to say it, and I need not say it!

Suwan Border Region Postage Stamps (Sent by Wang Hanou)

Let's talk about party affairs again. "I'm the Greatest Under Heaven," "Today's Weather, Haha!"

"Firm belief" internally and "penetrating thinking" externally: this is the central task of the Chinese Communist Party under your leadership for its internal and external work. The senior cadres responsible for this central task are selected from those who have working ability ("talent"), are absolutely selfless ("virtue"), and have been party members for a long time ("seniority"). One cannot say that this method is not thorough, but in terms of results, it produces many problems. The result of "firm belief" among party members at all levels is mostly the problem of "I'm the greatest under heaven," and the ending of "penetrating thinking" almost 100% becomes the façade of "today's weather, haha!" Because the words and deeds of people within the party have already become 100% "I'm the greatest under heaven," people outside the party have to be sensible, and everyone unanimously says "You're the best" and "He's no good." Under the smiling circumstances, this great historical task is completed satisfactorily. As for the standards of "talent, virtue, and seniority," in fact, it should be said that "seniority comes first, talent and virtue come second," because I have personally seen that the old cadres who participated in the Long March, that is, the people who moved from Jiangxi to Shaanxi, are now all remarkable figures. Whether they all possess the conditions of "talent" and "virtue," please look at the ironclad facts below.

Let's give a few typical examples. The Most Wonderful Talks of Long March-Era Cadres

There is a Mr. Yang in the Central China Military Region. He is an old cadre who participated in the Long March. He told me twice that he has a younger brother who was adopted by his three uncles, what is commonly called "one son for three houses." During the War of Resistance, this younger brother of his was the county magistrate of Zhengyangguan. Mr. Yang's most wonderful quote is this: "Damn it! He works for the Kuomintang, I work for the Communist Party. One day I'll take a short gun, and I'll shoot him, damn it. He ran in front, I chased behind, chasing for more than ten miles in one breath. Damn this dog, he jumped into the river. I don't know how to swim, otherwise, I would have killed him that day..." This fact can be considered a typical example of "firm belief" within the party.

The host of the Central China Journalism College is Mr. Fan Changjiang, who is now in the Nanjing CCP delegation. In order to penetrate the thinking of all the students, the school put forward a topic "What is a People's Newspaper?" at the student life review meeting and handed it over to the student life review meeting for review. It was reviewed for a whole week, which shows that many students' thinking had not yet been penetrated, because different opinions were put forward. While this was not being decided, several students whom I had taught before came to chat at my place. I knew they had changed as individuals. They were all powerful figures who had raised different opinions. At that time, I said to them, "Why bother? A wise man doesn't suffer immediate losses. As long as you can say 'The best' and 'No good,' can't any problem be solved?" Two days later, they came again, and the correct conclusion of "What is a People's Newspaper?" was also passed. This great historical document, like the red characters "Leader of the Chinese People, Mao Zedong" next to your several-meter-high portrait on the walls of various cities in the "Liberated Zone," the original text is "Only the Communist Party's newspaper is a people's newspaper." This fact can be considered a typical example of your "penetrating thinking" of people outside the party.

Zhang, the regimental commander who now works on special tasks in the Central China Military Region, came from the Green Forest bandits in Taihu Lake. In order to show his personal "virtue" to the party, he has donated all his fields. But on the other hand, he opened two distilleries of kaoliang liquor that the common people are not allowed to build, and Commander Zhang builds them in large quantities. In addition, he bought several boats and houses. I personally saw that he has two wives. There are often opium pipes openly displayed in the mansion, and the orderlies are lined up. When he speaks, the arrogance of "I'm the greatest under heaven" seems to surpass that of General Zhang Zongchang, the long-legged general of many years. This fact can be considered a typical example of a Communist Party member's "talent" and "virtue."

Let's talk about politics again.

An American Colonel Is Not as Smart as the Communists

In order to illustrate the situation of your two-faced politics, let's first cite a fact as the basis of "New Democracy" on the outside and "Communism" on the inside. The matter is like this: This spring, Mr. Tan Zhenlin, the political commissar of the Central China Military Region, said at a representative conference, "Colonel A of the US Executive Group said to me, 'Your various base brigades are very good, but there is one thing I disagree with: you are now implementing "New Democracy," which is rent reduction and interest reduction, and is not communism. You are targeting farmers. You should change your name to Farmers' Party, or the Farmer-Worker Party, or the Socialist Party, or the Progressive Party, etc. Why must you call yourselves the Communist Party, which scares people?'" As soon as Mr. Tan finished speaking, all the representatives burst into laughter at the same time. At this time, Mr. Tan and many senior cadres on the stage were also laughing heartily. From this everyone's laughter, it is very clear that this American colonel is not as smart as you. He can only see one side of your two-faced politics. Naturally, the general Chinese people may not even see one side, so the "rent reduction and interest reduction" of "New Democracy" has actually become the "confiscation of property" of "Communism"! A hero does things like a hero should. I tend to agree with that. You now feel that "liquidation" and "struggle" are a bit too troublesome. It is better to simply have a "land donation," which is actually "land distribution." The Communist Party talks about communism, which should be reasonable in theory, but is it allowed in the real environment of China? Do the political work cadres of the Communist Party possess the conditions that party members should have? Are the old people in Chinese rural areas happy to accept it? In the "Liberated Zone" that has undergone "accounting" and "struggle" and "land donation," with everything returning to a primitive state, can it survive freely in the international community of the 20th century? These real-world problems can be answered by the following facts, and I also ask you to answer them.

Let's give a few typical examples. Holding a Tenant's Waist, Forcing Him to "Turn Over"

First, let's talk about "rent reduction" and "land donation." The 25% rent reduction mostly starts from the 25th year of the Republic (1936). I personally saw your cadres forcibly holding the tenants' waists, ordering them to "turn over." Thus, the tenant's whole family lined up. In front, cheerleaders beat gongs and drums; behind, hangers-on carried bamboo baskets. Amid shouts of "Long live the Communist Party," the landlord was carried to the "town government." The result of settling accounts for ten years of 25% rent reduction is that selling all the land is not enough to refund the expenses of ten years of 25% rent reduction. In the end, one can only say nice words and "donate" all the land to finish the matter. This was the old method before this summer. After this summer, they simply "put away" the "New Democracy" side of the two-faced politics, that is, the "25% rent reduction" side, in silence. The remaining side, although there is also the saying "those who till the land own the land," in fact, it has thoroughly implemented the "land distribution" of communism.

What is the situation in your "Liberated Zone" after "land distribution"? Perhaps the report you receive must be the word "very good"? But in my eyes, there are many serious problems. As long as you and your many cadres, no, it should be said that the universal cadres, do not have the same "revolution is to overcome all difficulties, because there are difficulties, so revolution is needed, as long as you are willing to be revolutionary, as long as you are constantly revolutionary, no matter failure or death are successful." "I'm the greatest under heaven" mentality, then this ironclad fact cannot but be paid attention to. The fact is this:

Your "land distribution" method takes the village as a unit. It's not about how many people there are in the village, how much land there is, adding up the number of people and the amount of land, and then "distributing land according to population." According to the general situation of each village, rich peasants are the fewest, poor peasants are the second fewest, and middle peasants account for the majority. For example, a middle peasant who has twenty mu of land has a family of five. According to the total number of fields in this village, each person can be divided into three mu, and a family of five can only be divided into fifteen mu. The remaining five mu are taken away by the so-called poor peasants for nothing. Think about it, will this self-cultivating farmer, who has absolute productivity in the village, be lazy from now on? And yesterday, they sold their land and made trouble, and today they took it back for nothing. The village ruffians, that is, what you call "good-for-nothings," because they can't produce, they sold their family property. Now they have got extra money, and they are the same as the self-cultivating farmers who have been bleeding and sweating for years. That is to say, yesterday he squandered the money from selling the land, and the money has not been spent today, and the sold land has flown back. The most wonderful thing is that these bad guys are mostly assigned by your cadres to be something like village chiefs and something like members. Under the new situation of gaining both fame and fortune, they grab the pigtails of the rich peasants with both hands and ride on the shoulders of the middle peasants. They also strut around the countryside as revolutionaries. Thus, the middle peasants and rich peasants are secretly killing plowing cattle, destroying farm implements, and dismantling waterwheels and carts. In the countryside, there is already a feeling of insufficient farm implements. Although it has not yet reached the point of completely getting rid of them, at least they are becoming increasingly scarce. May I ask, Mr. Mao, what will you use to drive the "Great Production Movement" you are calling for?

The True Face of "Struggle"

In the "Anti-Traitor Struggle", a Five-Act Play Was Performed Continuously

Now let's talk about the "struggle" of "Those with money are all bad guys, those with no money are all good people." Mr. Liu, the vice chairman of your "Suwan Border Region Government," said at a conference, "In the countryside, use settling accounts to achieve the goal of fundamentally turning the masses over; in the city, use anti-traitors and anti-evil bullies to achieve the goal of fundamentally turning the masses against feudalism..." This statement was made during the period when you were greatly talking about "New Democracy" externally, so the four words "basic masses" are used to represent the term "proletariat." Now you are thoroughly engaged in the "land revolution" in the countryside, and naturally you have to thoroughly engage in anti-feudalism in the city! The following facts, although they are "yesterday's news," can still be used as a reference for your thorough governance. The matter is like this:

In Huaiyin Central Street, there is a Xu Jiucheng who runs a tea and snack shop. His family has a mother in her seventies, as well as a wife and a daughter. In addition, there are two shop assistants. During the enemy-puppet period, there was a "Second Emperor" battalion commander who forcibly stored six boxes in Xu's shop. After you "liberated" Huaiyin, this "Second Emperor" battalion commander was captured, and the six boxes were also carried away by someone sent by your New Fourth Army regimental commander. This happened last autumn. This spring, the urban anti-feudal "struggle" began. Thus, several basic masses who were eating and drinking saw that Xu Jiucheng had a house and a tea and snack shop, so they turned their minds to "struggling" against him. Several bad guys said it, and the struggle committee member listened, and the case was considered established. Thus, a large group of basic masses beating gongs and drums came to Xu Jiucheng's door. In the lyrics that were sung after the gongs and drums stopped, the main ones were these two sentences: "Xu Jiucheng is a traitor, quickly hand over the six boxes!" Perhaps Xu Jiucheng's life should not have ended. When your New Fourth Army regimental commander sent someone to carry the boxes, there was a porter who led the way, and he knew Xu Jiucheng. After repeated requests, the porter of the Jiangbei Hotel finally spread the word. This porter had a great sense of justice. He explained on the spot the situation of the New Fourth Army regimental commander living in his shop and the process of sending someone to carry the six boxes. Not only was he willing to testify orally, but he was even willing to testify in writing. At this point, the group of basic masses who had changed their minds were all speechless to each other. At this time, your "instructor," in announcing Xu Jiucheng's innocence, ended the first act of the "anti-traitor struggle."

Then the second act began. The time was that same evening. Two basic masses went to Xu's house. After talking a lot, they forcibly took 300 yuan of "anti-Japanese currency" from Xu Jiucheng (at that time, pork was 4 yuan per pound, so you could buy 70 to 80 pounds). With the assurance that there would be no trouble, the second act was considered finished. The next day, the third act began. Xu Jiucheng was summoned to the "town government" again. Your "instructor's" opening lyrics were "The Jiangbei Hotel porter was someone you spent money to recruit. Now you can only write a 'letter of repentance' and pay a fine to finish the matter..." Then Xu Jiucheng put his fingerprint on the already written "letter of repentance," and he also added his fingerprint to the 3,000 yuan "anti-Japanese currency" fine ticket. With the announcement that it had to be delivered within seven days, the third act closed!

The title of the fourth act was "Mr. and Mrs. Xu's Flight." Because Xu Jiucheng was unwilling to take out the 3,000 yuan fine, and in fact could not take it out, he painfully abandoned his family and fled seven days before the deadline. When the seven days were up, Mrs. Xu was summoned to the "town government." Your "instructor" explained again, "...Seven days have passed, Xu Jiucheng ran away secretly. Now the fine has been doubled. You must hand over 6,000 yuan within three days, otherwise your property will be confiscated..." Amid the "yes, yes, yes" sounds, Mrs. Xu also followed in her husband's footsteps overnight, abandoning her family and fleeing!

In the fifth act, because the male and female protagonists ran away, I automatically participated in the performance, knowing that it was "doing the impossible," The plot is like this:

On the afternoon of the third day, the "town government" sent eight skinny men, who came to Xu's house talking to each other, registering all the belongings on one side, and shouting loudly to the old Mrs. Xu, "Don't move anything, your entire family property will be confiscated tomorrow!" Due to the explanation of a businessman friend, as the eight skinny men were about to leave, I came to Xu's house in person! From the old Mrs. Xu, the businessman friend, and two neighbors, I learned the truth of the matter from beginning to end. Immediately, I volunteered to visit the "instructor" in charge of the "struggle" in the "town government." After expressing my dual advisor status, I had this conversation, "...If Xu Jiucheng should die, then you should have shot him the first time. Why did you announce his innocence the first time, swindle 300 yuan the second time, and then he was guilty the third time, fining him 3,000 yuan, and doubling the fine the fourth time, fining him 6,000 yuan, and confiscating all the property the fifth time? I am a northerner, let me say a northern slang. Are you ever going to be done with it?" Finally, it was transferred from the "town government" to the "district government." Fortunately, it ended without a conclusion. But when I left Jin Yin, Mr. and Mrs. Xu were still guests in other villages.

A New Page of "Forced Into Liangshan"

All Pawn Tickets Are Invalid, Redeem Items Based on "Conscience"

Let me tell you another "redeeming items based on conscience without pawn tickets" story. Li Yushu, who opened a pawnshop in Huaiyin, was sentenced to life imprisonment by your cadres at a so-called "public trial." A few days later, your civil affairs cadres convened a gathering of "demanding Li Yushu to compensate for losses," that is, a meeting of "redeeming items based on conscience without pawn tickets." Your "instructor's" statement was like this, "...Li Yushu set fire to the pawnshop. Now the government and the masses have sentenced him to life imprisonment and confiscated all his property. In order to take into account the losses of those who pawned things, you can bring it up. As long as everyone is conscientious, pawn tickets are not necessary. My stamp is the same as proof..." Thus, those who had never worn fur coats insisted that they had pawned fur coats, and those who had never worn silk fabrics also insisted that they had pawned silk pants. A seventy-year-old lady who had been chanting Buddha for many years, that is, the old lady who explained this story to me, she was unwilling to obtain this unconscionable wealth. When she replied to me that she had not pawned anything, the village chief nudged her secretly, whispering, "Just write something casually." Finally, the village chief wrote something casually, but this old lady swore to me that she would never want this ill-gotten wealth. However, who is working hard for whom in the end, the tune that is reported and taken down?

Finally, let me tell you one more story about a political deception. Your liaison personnel stationed in Nanjing and Shanghai, in order to show their achievements, in order to receive funds, they often distribute pamphlets, newspapers, magazines, and theoretical books to the prepared revolutionaries who have already made contact, that is, those who "hear people say," and they constantly boast about how good the "Liberated Zone" is, welcoming people outside the "Liberated Zone" to visit, study, and work there. We provide transportation, food, and lodging. If they are willing to stay for study and work, the school will provide food, clothing, housing, and books. There are generous salaries for employment. If they are willing to come back, we will be responsible for sending them back, and so on. Thus, many people, especially young people, under the emotion of "seeking truth" and "upholding justice," are escorted to the "Liberated Zone." In order to illustrate the truth that "escorting" represents "welcoming," let me cite two examples to prove it.

Ten students whom I taught before are now working at the Heping Daily. In June of this year, _____ and three others were welcomed to the "Liberated Zone." I don't know why, this student's thinking is the same as mine, and it has never been penetrated. On the night before he was about to "return to Beijing," no matter what, not only was he not sent off, but he was not even issued a road pass. The next day, I was just about to find a senior cadre to _____ to deal with it, when another student came to tell me that this classmate had set off empty-handed before dawn. As for whether he was able to walk out of the "Liberated Zone," there is still no news to this day.

There was also a classmate who was welcomed to Huaiyin and assigned to work in the "Suwan Border Region Government Public Security Bureau." Because he couldn't live the life of eating public rations, wearing public uniforms, and sleeping alone all day long, he also had the idea of "returning home." After repeated requests for leave were denied, this classmate hung up his public uniform and flattened his seal of office, using the method of "If you don't send me off, I'll leave by force." As a result, he was escorted back when he reached Baoying. Without asking a question, he was imprisoned for more than two months. Later, his wife also came, and that's when he regained his freedom, but with the condition that the two of them could not leave Huaiyin far away. Now Huaiyin has changed, and I don't know where this pair of couples who were "forced into Liangshan" are now wandering!

Let's talk about economics again. "Everything Is for the People," This Statement Is Not Consistent with the Facts

I don't want to talk about your economic theories, and in fact, there is no need to talk about them. Over the past year, from various observations, your true economic policies can be divided into the following two categories:

1. The economy of the Party taking from the people.

2. The economy of the Party distributing to merchants.

Let's first talk about the economy of the Party taking from the people. The economy you take from the people has about the following four types:

(1) Collecting public grain

(2) Issuing paper money

(3) Collecting commodity taxes

(4) Confiscating property

According to your statement, the above four economic measures are "all for the people, and the Communist Party members never want a penny."

At present, Communist Party members are less likely to be major corruptors. This is a fact. Whether this is due to the current poor economic environment, although it cannot be confirmed, it is an ironclad fact that petty corruptors are everywhere. In the future, when peace is realized and the economic environment changes, will this petty corruption that is everywhere become bigger or smaller? I think anyone can draw a conclusion on this question.

Perhaps my statement is a bit too subjective? I feel that the saying "everything is for the people" should be changed to "everything is for the Communist Party," and "Communist Party members never want a penny" should also be changed to "Communist Party members never lose a penny." Only in this way can name and reality be consistent. I wonder what Mr. Mao's opinion is!

Let's give some typical examples. In the "Public Trial," the "Struggle" Reached Its Climax

Last winter, Mr. Liu Ruilong, the vice chairman of your "Suwan Border Region Government," was the central figure in charge of all the "struggles" in the "Suwan Border Region." At the largest and most lively so-called "public trial" (the reason for adding the word "so-called" to "public trial" is not that I disagree in principle, but that I feel that you have already privately tried the case beforehand, calculated the shooting on the spot, confiscated the property, and then deliberately came again, see my poem about what I have seen about public trials, the Xiong posture and great theory of Vice Chairman Liu were as follows:

Standing on a platform in the middle of the basic masses who had already been mobilized, he held a cigarette in one hand and raised the other hand over his head, shouting, "Today! Is the day when you old people turn over! Zhou Gongwang (that is, the one who was shot on the spot) forcibly collected twenty-five catties from your fields, forcing you to not be able to live! Today is the time for you to settle your blood debts. Those of you who have grievances, speak up; those of you who have enemies, take revenge..." Then, an old woman who had been arranged in advance walked to Zhou Gongwang, took out a black cake from her arms, and sent it to Zhou Gongwang's mouth, saying, "...You wanted 25 catties from us for every mu of land, forcing us to get sick from eating this thing. Damn you, you give it to us to eat, you give it to us to eat..." This scene was considered the climax of that day's "public trial" and the place where your external propaganda was most vigorous. Now Zhou Gongwang, who collected twenty-five catties per mu, has been shot by you for almost a year, and I don't know where the old woman who got sick from eating the black cake is now wandering. Taking the minimum conscience that human beings should have, the Communist Party's "collection of public grain" should in any case be less than twenty-five catties per mu, but the unexpected thing finally appeared before my eyes. Your cadres in Baoying, Gaoyou, Xinghua and other regions collected more than 30 catties of "public grain" per mu. In addition, several catties of grass were collected per mu. May I ask, Mr. Mao, how should this kind of dry method be explained?

Let's talk about "issuing paper money" again. The final unified paper money in the "Suwan Border Region" was issued by the "Central China Bank." Its true relationship with the people is about the following two items:

1. Absorbing the agricultural products of the people

2. Absorbing the metal products of the people

Your economic cadres' methods and steps for absorbing the agricultural products of the people are as follows: the first step is to prohibit the export of agricultural products from the people, the second step is to buy at a lower price than outside the "Liberated Zone," and the third step is to transport them to outside the "Liberated Zone" through special merchants to exchange for the materials you need. From this "absorption trilogy," it is clearly pointed out that my statement "everything is for the Communist Party" is not just talking nonsense. The methods and steps of your economic cadres "absorbing the metal products of the people" are as follows: the first step is to stipulate a price that is more than one-third lower than outside the "Liberated Zone" to buy them anytime and anywhere, the second step is that anyone who buys and sells privately, even if it is one silver dollar, cannot escape the fate of being confiscated, and the third step is the same as the third step of absorbing agricultural products. Naturally, the conclusion will not be different.

Spring and Autumn

### "Too Expensive"

— By L. Tolstoy, translated by Gao Fei

"Too Expensive" was originally a short story by Guy de Maupassant. Tolstoy reused its story to write about the kingdom of Monaco and how it deals with a prisoner in a foolish way. - Translator

Near the border between France and Italy, on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, there is a small kingdom called Monaco. Many small towns would proudly say that they have more residents than this kingdom. Because there are only more than seven thousand people here, and if the land of this small kingdom is divided equally, one resident would not get an acre of poor land. However, in this kingdom, there is a legitimate little emperor, who also has buildings, attendants, courtiers and bishops, as well as generals and troops.

That is not a large team, only sixty people in total, but it is still a team. In this kingdom, there are also taxes, such as tobacco tax, wine tax, liquor tax and poll tax. Although the people here drink and smoke like the people of other countries, if the king cannot find a new and special source of tax revenue, it will be difficult for him to support his courtiers, officials and himself with so few subjects. This special income comes from the roulette tables where people gamble. Gamblers gamble, and no matter what, the officials regularly draw a few percent of tax from the ups and downs, so in all his winnings, he must send a large sum of money to the country. The reason why people bear heavy taxes is that this is the only casino in Europe. Previously, there were several local governments in Germany that used to maintain such casinos, but they were banned a few years ago. The reason for banning gambling is because these casinos can cause so much damage. A person can try his luck, he will exhaust everything and gamble on it, losing all his money. Then he will gamble with money that does not belong to him, and the result is that he loses everything. Finally, in despair, he will drown himself or commit suicide. So the Germans forbid their rulers from earning money in this way. But here no one forbids the King of Monaco, and he exclusively owns this business.

So everyone who wants to gamble goes to Monaco, and whether they win or lose, the king can profit from it. As the saying goes: "A man does not get rich without windfall." The King of Monaco knew that this was a dirty business, but what else could he do? He was already alive, and collecting wine tax and wine tax was not a very pretty thing either. So he still had to live on, rule, plunder silver money, and also go to court and listen to politics with the same etiquette as a real emperor.

He has a coronation ceremony, morning court, rewards, punishments, pardons, and he also has inspections, parliaments, laws and courts, just like other countries, only smaller.

This incident happened not many years ago. A murderer in this kingdom was arrested and imprisoned. The people here were originally peace-loving, and this had never happened before. The judges solemnly gathered together and discussed the case with the most legal attitude. There were judges, prosecutors, jurors and lawyers. They debated, discussed, and finally they ruled that he should be beheaded according to law. That's it. They presented the verdict to the king, who read the verdict and wrote with a pen: "If the prisoner must be executed, execute it without error.

There was one difficulty with this matter, that is, they had neither a guillotine to cut off the prisoner's head, nor an executioner. The ministers considered this matter and decided to send a letter to the government of a certain country, asking the French government to lend them a machine and an expert to kill the prisoner, and if possible, please have the French government honestly reply to how much money they would need. The letter was sent out, and a reply came a week later, saying that the machine and the expert could be supplied, and all it would cost was 16,000 francs. The reply was placed before the king, and he considered: 16,000 francs! "That poor bug doesn't deserve that much money," he said: "Is there any way to make it cheaper? Uh! Sixteen thousand francs is more than the total amount of two francs per person in the country? The people may not want to bear it, and it may cause a riot.

Therefore, a meeting was convened to discuss what to do about this matter, and it was decided to send a letter to the King of Italy as well. France is a republic and has no respect for kings at all, but the King of Italy is a brotherly monarch, and he may be persuaded to be cheaper. So the letter was written immediately, and a reply was received quickly.

The Italian government wrote that they would be happy to supply the machine and the expert, and the total price would be only 12,000 francs, including shipping. This is naturally cheaper. But it is still too expensive. That bad guy really doesn't deserve this money. That still requires everyone to bear a heavy tax of nearly two francs. The parliament was convened again, and they discussed and thought about how to settle this matter with less expense. Isn't there a soldier who can finish him off with a rough and simple method? The generals were summoned, and they were asked: "Can't you find us a soldier who can kill people? In war, they are merciless in killing people. In fact, that is the purpose of training them." The generals repeatedly questioned the soldiers to see who could carry out this matter, but no soldier could complete the mission. "No," they said, "we don't know how to carry it out, this is not what we have been taught!"

What to do? The ministers thought and thought again. They convened a committee, a special committee and a small committee, and finally they decided that the best way was to change the death penalty to life imprisonment, which would not only allow the king to express his magnanimity, but also be cheaper.

The king also agreed, and that's how the matter was handled. There was only one difficulty, that is, there was no prison here for life imprisonment. There was a small detention center, which was only used to temporarily detain people, but there was no strong prison suitable for long-term use. Anyway, they finally found a place to deal with it. They locked the young prisoner inside and set up a guard to watch him. The guard had to monitor the prisoner and take food for him from the palace kitchen.

The prisoner was locked in prison, month after month, and a whole year passed. But when the old year passed, one day the little king checked his income and expenses and noticed an expense, that is, the cost of imprisoning the prisoner. That was not a small bill, especially with a guard and the prisoner's diet, it cost more than 600 francs a year. The worst thing was that the prisoner was still young and healthy, and he could live to be fifty years old. If you add it all up, the number is amazing. It can never be done like this, so the king summoned the ministers and said:

"Regarding this rogue, you must find a cheaper method. The current disposal is too wasteful." The ministers gathered together and considered again and again, and then one said: "Gentlemen, in my opinion, we must remove the guard." "But," another said, "the prisoner will run away." "That's right," the first speaker said again: "Let him run away, to hell with him!" So they presented the resolution to the king, and he agreed. Once the guard was removed, they waited for the scene that was about to happen. However, what happened was that in the middle of the day, the prisoner came out. He did not look for the guard, but went straight to the palace kitchen to collect his own lunch. He only took a portion freely, turned back to the prison, closed the prison door, and stayed in the house. The next day was the same: at the appropriate time, he took his own food. As for running away? He did not show any signs. What to do? They were thinking about this matter again.

"Let's tell him directly!" they said: "We don't want to imprison him anymore."

So the Minister of Justice summoned the prisoner.

"Why don't you run away?" the minister asked: "There is no guard watching you! Now you can go anywhere you want, and the king will not pursue it."

"I also say that the king will not pursue it," the prisoner said: "But I have nowhere to go, what else can I do? You have already ruined my personality by convicting me, people will abandon me, and I have lost my job. You have wronged me, that's not pretty. First of all, since you have sentenced me to death, you should execute it, but you didn't, that's one thing, I didn't complain. Later, you sentenced me to life imprisonment and asked the guard to get food for me, but after a while, you dismissed him, and I had to take my own food, and I didn't complain either. Now you want me to leave, and I can't agree to it. Do whatever you want, but I will never leave." What to do? The meeting was convened again, what method could they use? The prisoner would never leave. They thought and thought again, the only way to get him to leave was to give him alimony, so they reported it to the king. "There is no other way to do this," they said: "Anyway, we must tell him to leave." The amount was decided to be 600 francs and notified to the prisoner. "Okay," he said: "I don't care, as long as you pay on time. On this condition, I am willing to go out."

This matter was handled in this way. The prisoner took one-third of the alimony and left this kingdom. It only took fifteen minutes by train to leave the country. He settled on the border of a neighboring country, where he bought some land, opened a vegetable garden, and is now living comfortably. He often goes to collect his alimony on time. After receiving the cash, he goes to the gambling stall and throws in three or two francs to gamble. Sometimes he wins, sometimes he loses, and then he goes back. He lives in peace and comfort.

It is really fortunate: he did not commit such a crime in a country that is willing to buy a killing machine, nor in a country that can imprison for life.

### Snow Mud Painting Exhibition

— Yu Huajian

Snow Mud, Sun Hong, is an old friend of mine in Shanghai in painting circles. He is famous at the time as the manager of a certain art company, but although he is in the mundane world, he indulges himself outside the mountains and forests; he dabbles in clouds and mist, and his brushstrokes are interesting. However, because he is busy with work, he has no time to create more. Recently, he suddenly became excited and spent two months writing two hundred works, half landscapes and half plum blossoms and bamboos, which are publicly exhibited in the Chinese Painting Academy. The landscapes he creates have the bones of Shi Xi and the elegance of Xin Luo. Although they are hasty and unintentional, they can prepare the six methods outside the image. They are sparse and distant, as if they do not eat human fireworks; comparing them with those that are scarlet and red, how different are the elegant and vulgar. The plum blossoms have more branches than flowers, with iron bones and ice hearts, standing tall in the wind and snow. The spirit of not yielding, tenacity and love of fragrance is active on the paper. Yun Xi likes to create withered trees and old trees, with gnarled branches, which are extremely tortuous, simple and elegant. More than ten pots of ancient pine bonsai collected by Zheng Meiqing are also displayed in the field, which are larger than usual and thicker than an arch. The roots are like peaks standing side by side, the trunks are like dragons and snakes flying, the leaves are like gathered covers high, and the branches are like crab claws running horizontally; some are hanging upside down, like a dragon exploring the sea; some are lying up, like a phoenix flying in the sky. The surrounding area is matched with landscape paintings, as if you are in a lotus capital and forget that you are in a room. Zheng Junyun has hundreds of pots in his home. Yu Su likes to write about pine trees. Hearing this, he is happy and strange. When he has time one day, he will visit the mansion to write a portrait for the old dragon scales.

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 87

— Ye Jingfeng

We were outside the wall, took out our pistols, just in case; waited less than ten minutes, and sure enough, we heard a kind of whining sound, as if someone was wearing soft-soled shoes and walking on the sand, but after listening carefully, the sound was gone. We were just concentrating our spirits and pricking up our ears, when we suddenly heard a dull thunder-like "buzzing" sound, a dog barking, as if it was barking over our heads. We knew at once that this was a Mongolian Mastiff. When this beast's bark came, it also scratched on the stone wall with its claws. With the stature of a Mongolian Mastiff, two hind legs stood up, and two front paws could reach the top of the wall. It was scratching on the stone wall, it must be someone who held it back and could not stretch its body as much as possible. What's strange is that until now we don't hear human footsteps or other movements.

At this critical moment. Tiger Brother and I just stuck our bodies tightly to the wall, controlling our breathing, not daring to move, and concentrated our hearing and vision on the top of the wall. At this time, as long as a human head or a dog head appeared over the wall, we would have to act.

Who knew that we waited quietly for a while, and there was no movement. I was a little impatient and wanted to signal Tiger Brother to move north, but Tiger Brother had already made a gesture and told me to be vigilant. He ran past my side, attacked towards the north along the root of the wall, lightly and quickly. Less than two feet away, I saw that he seemed to still be holding the gun in his waist. He put his hands on the top of the wall and hung his body up. His head gradually appeared over the wall. He looked at my head first, then looked at the north, and let go and fell to the ground.

"Gone!" Tiger Brother ran over and pointed to the south, "It's a Japanese devil, leading a Mastiff."

After waiting quietly for a while, the damn guy had gone far away. Tiger Brother went up the wall and gave a safe signal. We flipped back into the wall again and walked north along the jungle. Tiger Brother led the way, about ten steps away from me. After walking less than ten yards, I suddenly felt startled and heard a rustling sound coming from behind me. Instinctively, I said "Huh!" I turned my head and saw a Mastiff as big as a calf rushing towards me. Behind the giant dog was also a person, like a ghost, running extremely fast, but I didn't hear any footsteps.

"Stop!" I said softly. When danger came, I felt calm in my mind. At this time, even if I drilled into the jungle, it would be useless, because dogs can drill faster. If I wanted to cross the wall, it was still more than ten feet away, and the dog could also track me. Besides, the devil might have a gun with him. At this time, my left hand had already raised the pistol, covering the enemy, and my right hand was holding the small sword. Fearing that other Japanese troops would be alarmed, I temporarily endured it and didn't fire the gun. I just whispered and planned to calm the enemy down first.

I had just said "Stop!" when a strong light shot at my face unexpectedly, forcing my eyes. It was too late to fire the gun at this time.

"Hey, good kid!" the guy said with a good Northeast accent; ten feet away from me, he restrained the dog and stopped together.

At this critical moment, I jumped violently to the road, broke out of the guy's flashlight beam, and then turned around and crouched down and drilled into the jungle. Just as I was caught by two thick winter green poles in the jungle, I heard this sound. I turned my head to look, my eyes were still flashing from the strong light just now, but I could barely see a slender shadow less than ten feet away on the road, flashing east and jumping west, fighting with the giant Mastiff. The giant Mastiff roared menacingly, and pounced east and west like a fierce tiger at the thin figure. I fixed my eyes and looked carefully, and I could see that it was indeed Tiger Brother fighting with the giant Mastiff. The devil who was leading the dog fell to the ground, like a pile of something.

Seeing this situation, I immediately withdrew from the jungle, still holding a small sword in one hand and a gun in the other, and pressed forward. When Tiger Brother saw it, he fought the dog and whispered, "Little Aunt, don't come up, let me beat this dog!" I could only stop and move slightly closer, still wanting to take the opportunity to join the battle. I saw Tiger Brother and the dog flashing left and right twice, and the dog suddenly jumped up, pounced forward, and looked like it was about to fall on Tiger Brother. I saw Tiger Brother taking a step back, propping his left arm, and his left hand slapped, with a loud sound, right on the dog's ear. Such a big Mastiff, after this slap, staggered and howled and lay down.

### Friendship in Cultural Circles

— Hualin

Last time at the World Society, when we saw Li Shuhua off to attend the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization meeting, he said that more than fifty countries would be represented, mostly by well-known figures in academic and educational circles. Therefore, the attitude of the discussions was very sincere, unlike political meetings, which are full of treachery and cunning. I also feel that people in cultural and academic circles are genuine and loyal, with compassion and a sense of justice. Even when discussing politics, their aim is to save mankind, not to compete for power and profit, with no thought of personal gain or ambition to harm others. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization may one day be able to unite the world!

We initiated the Xiangxue Garden Literary Salon and revived the Literary Teahouse in Shanghai, both purely for social purposes. There is no chairman, no one manipulating things, it is all free and unconstrained. It is precisely because there are no political struggles that we can talk about friendship and unity, and discuss the prosperity of the country and cultural construction together, further extending to universal love for mankind, and seeking world peace and tranquility. These responsibilities can only be shouldered by people in cultural and academic circles!

True friendship may perhaps see a glimmer of light in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization! Now in Shanghai, we want to breathe a little free air, so there is the "Literary Salon" at Xiangxue Garden and the "Literary Teahouse" at the fifth-floor restaurant of the Great New Company. Everyone can feel at ease to say the truth they want to say, without the need for that set of hypocritical and cunning political tactics! Starting with friendship and with cultural academics as the highest goal, world peace can be realized! Human reform can have a hopeful future!

Friends in literary and art circles! Those of you without political ambitions can join hands and come, let's walk together towards the path of light!

### Ramblings Under a Dim Lamp

Zhou Fohai's Death

Zhou Fohai has been sentenced to death. After the presiding judge announced the verdict, he said: "If you are not satisfied, you can appeal to the Supreme Court, the highest authority, they can reduce your sentence." Before being taken back to prison, our reporter asked him how he felt. He said: "This is the judge trying to ease my mind. My death was decided on the day Director Dai Yunong died in the line of duty. If Director Dai were here, he could have taken the blame for me."

The dead cannot testify, so we have to take his word for it. However, if there really is an underworld, it looks like Zhou would be ready to settle accounts with Director Dai.

According to the deputy manager of the Real Estate Department of the Trust Bureau: As of now, not a single person has applied to register their lane houses. No one is a fool, who would want to do something so foolish, spending money to get annoyed.

Real estate transactions in Shanghai have recently been almost dead. Banks cannot take mortgages, why would anyone tie up their capital in a pile of bricks and mud? Moreover, the use value far exceeds the property value. With tens of millions, putting it out for usury is more profitable and flexible, why not do that?

Another factor is that for real estate transactions, the municipal government charges 50% for property transfer taxes, plus other miscellaneous expenses. Therefore, if you spend 20 million yuan to buy a house, you would probably have to pay more than 30 million, so it is not cheap.

We are really worried about the Trust Bureau!

Random Thoughts on Current Affairs

### Laws are as Numerous as Hairs, But Difficult to Implement

— Hu Yisheng

In the view of those who study economics, any policy must have an economic foundation to be a good policy. It is easy to implement and easy to achieve results. Conversely, even with clever ideas, it will only "backfire" and is bound to fail.

After the victory, the government's policies, on the surface, lack unity, with everyone doing their own thing, exhausting the people. No wonder there is a sigh that laws are as numerous as hairs. In essence, they lack an economic foundation. Examples are readily available. The most recent are:

(1) The Ministry of Social Affairs, based on humanitarian considerations, abolished prostitution and rickshaws. The intention is good, but try to imagine what the brothels will live on after prostitution is abolished? Will the government introduce jobs or find suitable spouses? What will the rickshaw pullers and their families live on after rickshaws are abolished? If they are not transferred to legitimate occupations, are the consequences not considered? If these problems are not solved in advance, merely advocating humanitarian slogans and trying to emulate Washington's emancipation of blacks, it is appropriate for rickshaw puller groups to oppose it, only increasing social unrest. We should recognize: "The pain of unemployment is greater than everything, and unemployment is the root of all evils." Therefore, first solve the general unemployment in China, so that all citizens have livelihoods and no one is unemployed, and then take a further step to abolish prostitution and rickshaws. This is a good policy with an economic foundation, which will surely be supported by the public. (2) Recently, national conscription has been implemented. It is of course a matter of course, but there is much room for research on its methods. The position and responsibility of Chinese youth are fundamentally different from those of advanced countries in the world. In advanced countries, the cost of education is entirely borne by the state. Even after graduating from university and serving society, their salaries are not immediately relied upon to support their parents, but gradually seek to become self-reliant. Chinese youth are different: some youth completely rely on their families, do not engage in livelihood, and are merely parasites of society. Others are families that completely rely on youth. They are not given sufficient opportunities to go to school in childhood. Once they are over ten years old, they are ordered to learn a trade. The income from their apprenticeship is saved to support the family. They begin to have family burdens. In addition, the age of marriage is too early. Before the age of thirty, children are in groups and the burden is extremely heavy, old, and dying. This kind of youth actually accounts for the majority of Chinese youth, and being conscripted suddenly will inevitably cause serious problems. The authorities did not study this and suddenly carried out general conscription, so conscription became voluntary soldiers, and then turned into buying and selling soldiers. If this trend continues, it will be an obstacle to the implementation of true military service in the future. The benefits have not been seen, but the disadvantages are numerous. From the perspective of the country, at present, in the era of economic construction, all government affairs must take the expansion of productivity as the first priority, or at least maintain the existing productivity, and must never weaken it. The problem of professional youth indirectly and directly benefits the productive elements, so being conscripted is tantamount to destroying production. We often think about why the government does not first shift the conscription target to vagrants and unemployed youth? This is beneficial from any point of view.

But here, it should be stated that I am not opposed to the Ministry of Social Affairs' abolition of prostitution and rickshaws, and even less to singing different tunes on the conscription national policy, but for the lack of economic foundation of the policy, I would like to propose a long-term discussion to improve it.

### The Most Perfect Public Bus

— Translated by Da from Machinery Magazine

Lauren Couth, a third-year student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Cambridge University, is planning the most ideal public bus, which can only accommodate forty passengers.

What passengers hate the most is the noisy engine. The ideal public bus is equipped with soundproofing panels.

If the outside temperature is too hot, breaking the 100-degree mark, then the temperature inside the public bus will always be around 70 degrees, so you won't sweat like a pig. Perhaps the fog outside is too thick and the air is too humid, the humidity inside is just right.

If you are thirsty, there is sand-filtered water inside, or even whiskey, and the cups are ready-made. Just tap your hand on the faucet, and it is enough for you to enjoy!

The glass windows of the carriage are always crystal clear and have frost-proof brushes and rain wipers, which are electric. So you can sit in the seat and watch the snow scene outside.

The tires are the latest type, and the inner tube is not filled with gas, which can avoid the danger of a blowout.

There are four electric motors, each with seventy-five horsepower.

Of course, it does not use gasoline, which can avoid fire, but in case of emergency, the carriage is equipped with fire-fighting equipment, and there is also wireless telephone equipment installed, so that passengers are not bored.

If you happen to have an urgent need, there is a toilet in the carriage. This kind of public bus is very suitable for long-distance travel. The British Ministry of Transport rejected its manufacture because this kind of public bus is too aristocratic. The US Highway Administration has contacted him and is preparing to manufacture it in large quantities for practical use.

It is said that the first batch of one hundred vehicles will be traveling on the spacious highways of the United States.

Shanghai Anecdotes

### Doctor Examination

— Zheng

The Shanghai District Chinese Medicine Practitioner Examination was held from the 1st to the 3rd of this month at Guanghua University and Zhongzheng Middle School. Nearly two thousand people participated in the examination. The situation at the examination hall was quite different from other examinations. The writer will record what he saw and present it to the readers.

Among the two thousand people, the most are graduates of Chinese medicine colleges under the age of thirty, and several professors also came to take the exam. There are also many old doctors over sixty years old. Most wear casual clothes, a few wear melon-skin hats and blue robes with black jackets, and less than 1% wear suits.

On the first day, it was stipulated that they must arrive at 6:45. Therefore, before dawn, many rickshaws were seen running north on Sichuan Road, that is, three-wheeled vehicles and cars. Many people who came from other places were not allowed to take the exam because they arrived too late.

Because the seats in the examination hall were insufficient, Chinese medicine practitioners and judicial personnel were mixed together in the first examination hall in the auditorium. The second and third examination halls were in the dining hall, and eight people sat at a square table together. Everyone felt that the seats were unsuitable and suffered a lot. Therefore, the order was greatly affected. There were several cases of candidates being detained by bailiffs for passing around examination papers.

The topics of the subjects tested, such as diagnostics, prescription studies, and pharmacology, were not very difficult. Anyone with a considerable foundation in medicine could cope with them. The topic of Chinese language was "On National Health," which was also easy to develop. However, the topics for the elective subjects were more difficult to answer. It is said that the internal medicine topics were the most profound, called "Harm if excessive, controlled if inherited." Most people do not understand its exact meaning, and the answers given are also different. Some people even read the word "Nai" as "Xi" or "Qi," which is laughable.

Everyone felt unfamiliar with the subject of the Constitution. Therefore, before the temporary exam, they all held the "Law in the Period of Political Tutelage" issued by the medical school and read it.

In the gynecology topics, the diagnosis and treatment of "metrorrhagia" were not well understood. After the examination, both men and women discussed this issue without any scruples.

On the afternoon of the last day, the oral examination was divided into twenty examination halls. The chief examiners were the members of the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Examination Committee. What was tested was also questions related to diagnostics, prescriptions, and drugs. Therefore, 20% of the people gave up their rights. Some candidates and chief examiners were professors at the same medical school, and they pretended not to know each other in the examination hall.

It is said that all the examination papers were sent to Nanjing for grading, and the number of people admitted was very small, so everyone felt uneasy.

### Jiaotong University Miscellany

— Ping

The new student dormitory of Jiaotong University is about to be completed, and Zhesheng Hall has also been completely renovated. The renovation work of each dormitory room and classroom will also be completed soon, symbolizing a new and thriving atmosphere.

There is a student from Sichuan at Jiaotong University. He is usually in poor health, but he is diligent and persevering in his studies. He has won generous scholarships several times. Recently, due to overwork, he suddenly coughed up blood incessantly. His classmates rushed him to the Red Cross Hospital for emergency treatment. His condition is still very serious. His classmates are very sad, and they all call the scholarship he received "blood scholarship," because it is the "price of blood."

A large number of parasites are stationed on the campus of Jiaotong University, ostensibly for the purpose of service, but actually making profits with a black heart. For example, ×× service office, ×× dining hall, etc., are all run by merchants. Not only are water, electricity, and housing supplied by the school, but they can also evade business tax, but the prices of the goods they sell are not cheaper than the general market, and sometimes even higher. Students often complain and have launched a "boycott movement."

The trend of posting notes for buying and selling in Chongqing schools has been brought to Shanghai. Recently, the walls of the corridor of the Central and Upper Courtyards of Jiaotong University are full of notes for "cheap sales" and "solicitation." The most exciting ones are even "weeping big cheap sales" and "desperate big auctions." Looking at the items traded, they are mostly winter clothes, required textbooks, and food group meal tickets.

The coursework at Jiaotong University has always been extremely strict. In the past, at least one-fifth of the students were eliminated every year. At a recent faculty meeting, Dean of Academic Affairs Li Ximou said that the grading method of our school in Chongqing in the past was too strict, and it can be slightly relaxed in the future. Those whose failing credits exceed one-third will also be allowed to participate in the makeup examination. Generally, the students who are worried about "one-third" are overjoyed when they hear this, as if they have been granted a general amnesty.

### Filler

Zhang Qun went to the United States for medical treatment this time because he suffered from "stomach pain." A newspaper in a certain county in Jiangxi mistakenly published it as "hemorrhoids." Although it is the same disease, it is very different. This is a big joke!

### Intelligence Test Answer

(According to the test questions published in yesterday's issue)

No book has a location between pages fifty-three and fifty-four, but by chance, Cade was reading a story on page fifty-three. And found that the reverse side is page fifty-four, and there is no place to put banknotes in between. This is also something that is easily overlooked in daily life, but the servant revealed his feet!

### Weekend Chat

— Liu Sui

The weekend itself is originally very tempting. The term "Saturday" often symbolizes liberation, frankness, and comfort. However, the bleak reality in recent months has made people feel like chewing olives on weekends. The past luxury that existed in people's minds has now gradually faded. Last weekend, I counted the number of suicide and murder events that occurred in Pinghan, Shanghai, Guangdong, and other places in a week. As a result, I found that more than half of the total of 26 events were forced by life, and almost all of these people who were squeezed to the end by life were business people and public officials. Let's set aside the economic life of public officials for the time being. Just in terms of business, take a few of the most realistic examples of the Shanghai market in the past week: several large stores such as Wanguo and Heming are on the verge of closing down; tobacco companies are closing down one after another; Goshi Man and the Goldfish Restaurant have been converted into American goods markets; and only four tickets were sold for the premiere of "Phantom of the Opera" at the Lyceum Theatre. Don't look at their "price reductions" and "competitive sales" as a prosperous atmosphere. Seeing that high interest rates are about to force them to become the continuation of the former. As Su Manshu said: "Chickens in cages are close to the soup knife when they have food." Writing this on the weekend, I can't help but feel inexplicably melancholy for the day when those descendants of Tao Zhu will also have to chew olives!

Blood Suckers

According to reports, a bandit was executed in Wuxi last month. Afterwards, some people took several white steamed buns at the execution ground and dipped them in fresh brain blood and devoured them with relish. This man's appetite is amazing, and the degree of innocence is really admirable. It is originally rumored in mountain countries that "seeing blood wards off evil spirits, and eating blood prolongs life." I think this man must be suffering from poverty and illness, and he cannot eat the milk powder and vitamins that are rationed. In addition to lamenting that he was not born at the right time, he was fortunate to encounter this "good opportunity that is a pity to discard," so he gorged on fresh human blood; on the one hand, he implemented direct supplementation, and on the other hand, he wanted to get a bit of bloody air, so that he could squeeze into the so-called upper class who are full of brains and fat in society, let them verify that "it is my kind," and from then on he can openly suck the blood on others. This man's situation is of course worthy of pity, and his intentions are also bitter, but I heard that public opinion in Xidi once launched a major crusade against this matter, and advocated sanctions based on "humanity." The reason is of course very right, but I think that at present, everyone has the desire to eat blood, but it is only a matter of light and darkness. Why be surprised?

Why Bother

A few days ago, I saw many of the latest styles of this year's fashion coats published in Shanghai newspapers, which seemed like a clothing guide. However, the other side of the newspaper published a large number of photos of indigenous people taken from Luoping, Yunnan, who were completely naked, not even wearing pants. This is really not a small satire to us self-proclaimed civilized people. The same Chinese land, the eastern and western ends, are like two worlds. Someone said that the little bit of so-called civilization represented by Shanghai is completely manifested in the dazzling clothing. At first, it sounded like an insult, but after thinking about it, it is the truth. Try to open everyone's gorgeous clothes, and aren't their bodies covered with scars of cunning, shamelessness, and greed? Close your eyes and imagine those naked, dark, and healthy bodies in Luoping, containing a piece of heart that is so simple and flawless. It is indeed too fascinating! In fact, the current price of fashion in Shanghai is not something that everyone can afford, but because of face, they have to try their best to try a few sets of new ones, which is considered not to bow their heads in front of others. After careful consideration, why bother?
