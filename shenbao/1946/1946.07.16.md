[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 15th Dispatch] On the afternoon of the 14th, Communist forces approached the southern suburbs of Taixing. As of the 15th, the situation in Taixing remains unclear.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 15th Dispatch] The shift of the war's focus to northern Jiangsu has become an almost unavoidable reality. According to an urgent telegram from Yangzhou, the morale in Yangzhou and Taixian is extremely stable. This morning, our reporter interviewed the highest military authority stationed in Yangzhou, who stated: The Communist forces in northern Jiangsu have not only violated the government's ceasefire order, but are also continuously expanding their territory, attacking cities and seizing land, attempting to achieve their so-called "Northern Jiangsu Liberated Zone" ambition. In particular, in recent weeks, the Communist forces have been extensively deploying troops and generals, dreaming of attacking our Yangzhou and Taizhou areas. For the sake of self-defense, if the Communist forces rashly invade, we will deal them a head-on blow.

[Our Newspaper, Yinzhang, 15th Dispatch] Taixing is under siege by Communist forces, and the situation is increasingly tense. The county magistrate of the county, Xue Peiqi, sent a special telegram to the provincial authorities on the 15th, reporting that "Dai Xin'kuan's Provisional Second Division of the Communist forces, and six regiments of Su Yu's force, infiltrated the county from Zhangjiaqiao in the Eighth District and Daikexiang in the First District. As of the morning of the 14th, fierce fighting was still ongoing, with minor clashes in Yaojiazhuang and Shili Dian."

Another part of the Communist forces attacked the National Army near Wujiaqiao in the southwest. As of the morning of the 15th, fierce fighting was still ongoing. Within Taixian city, the sound of machine guns and artillery could be heard clearly, and a special curfew was announced in the evening. Furthermore, after the Guangfu Bridge on the Yangzhou-Taizhou highway was destroyed and cut off by the Communist forces, our National Army is making every effort to lift the siege and repair it. It is generally expected that there will be major developments in northern Jiangsu in three days.

[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 15th Dispatch] Two to three hundred Communist soldiers from Jingjiang, disguised in plainclothes with short guns, are stirring up trouble in Majing, Changli, and Zhengxin townships near the city. Their sentries have reached Sanguandian Jijiashi, twenty-three li west of the city, and the civilians have all been driven to the Huangqiao front line, with no way to escape.

[Central News Agency, Wuxi, 15th Dispatch] The Communist forces have launched a full-scale general offensive against northern Jiangsu. On the 13th, one route of the Communist army with 20,000 troops attacked the suburbs of Taixing. On the 14th, they fiercely attacked the city walls, resulting in heavy casualties for the defending National Army regiment. On the morning of the 15th, the south gate of the city was breached, and the situation in Taixing City was unclear as of noon. One regiment of the National Army stationed at Xuanjiabao north of the city was surrounded by six regiments of the Communist forces, suffering especially heavy casualties. The regiment commander, Xia Luo, is missing. Another route of about 8,000 troops is attacking the area east of Changzhou. The outskirts of Taixian are infiltrated by Communist forces on all sides and have fallen into encirclement. Another force of more than 20,000 is attacking Liuhe from the northeast, west, and south with great momentum. The Communist forces besieging Haimen continue to receive reinforcements, and the attack is fierce, with the city walls in danger.

### Communist Forces on the Front Line Increase to Over 130,000

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th Dispatch] The Communist forces have launched a large-scale political offensive against northern Jiangsu. The forces they are using on the front line have increased to over 130,000 and are now launching a full-scale general offensive in various locations. (1) The Communist forces under Chen Yusheng, who attacked Taixing City on the 13th, are continuing to advance south of Taixing along the north bank of the Yangtze River. Six regiments of their New First Division are fiercely attacking Kou'an Town (on the north bank of the Yangtze River south of Taixian). (2) A part of the Second Division of the Communist forces attacked the area east of Yangzhou on the 12th and was driven back by the National Army on the 13th. Another part infiltrated the highway between Yangzhou and Taixian, destroying the road. As of noon on the 15th, that section of the highway had been cut off. (3) The Communist forces attacking Liuhe have continued to receive reinforcements, reaching over 25,000 in the area of Shiguanji (northwest of Liuhe), Zhuzhen, Majiaji (all north of Liuhe), and Babaiqiao (northeast of Liuhe) by the 14th.

They are currently engaged in fierce battles with the National Army in the areas of Kuaihualin, Leijiahe, and Yinghe'nao in Yinxi. A part of them has been cut off into several small groups and are running around everywhere.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th Dispatch] The mediation of the conflict in the Henan-Hubei border area is being handled directly by Marshal Ma. However, the Ninth Group in Wuhan has not been able to establish contact with Li Xiannian's forces due to their unpredictable movements. Therefore, it has not yet been decided whether to designate a new stationing area for them or order them to move north. Today, a certain official spokesman stated that Li Xiannian's forces are attempting to establish their base in Wudang Mountain in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi. Another spokesman stated that Li's forces intend to cross the Yellow River to the north, but because the Longhai Railway is heavily guarded by the National Army, they are scurrying between Fuxun Mountain and Wudang Mountain.

### Datong Situation Tense; Clashes Occur Frequently in the Suburbs

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th Dispatch] Relevant authorities announced today that Communist forces have begun attacking Datong since yesterday. Our reporter went to the private residence of General Ma Zhanshan to inquire about the truth. According to a certain military officer who arrived here from Datong yesterday afternoon, the atmosphere in Datong is indeed quite tense, and clashes occur frequently in the suburbs. Yao Shan, the commander of the Communist Suiyuan-Mongolia Military Region responsible for the area, reportedly arrived at Zhoushizhuang, forty li east of Datong, on the 13th. However, as of the time he left Datong, a large-scale battle had not yet broken out. According to someone who came from Datong today, the situation there has not changed. Most of Nie Rongzhen's troops, who were originally around Datong, have moved south. The Communist forces now taking over the defense are newly transferred from Rehe, and their numbers are estimated to be about 20,000 to 30,000. The National Army currently defending Datong is two divisions of Ma Zhanshan's Northeast Advance Army and two regiments of Chu Xichun's troops, as well as some local teams. Ma's troops were originally ordered to reorganize into the Third Cavalry Brigade, but the reorganization has been temporarily suspended due to the tense military situation. Currently, code forts, barb wire and entrenchments are densely distributed in the suburbs of Datong. Ma's troops have obtained better equipment, and many munitions have been airlifted from Beiping. There is also a considerable amount of food. If the Communist forces launch a large-scale siege, they can also hold out for a considerable period of time.

### Officers and Soldiers of the New Fourth Army Defect to the National Army

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 15th Dispatch] Since Chen Yi rejected Clarmann's mediation, the stagnant situation in Shandong has suddenly become serious again. In recent days, the Communist forces within the territory have been frequently mobilized, appearing to have new intentions. However, government officials have not completely given up hope for peaceful negotiations. Commander Wang Yaowu told reporters today that "peacefully resolving the Shandong issue is the government's consistent policy, and I still have great hope and confidence in this. If Chen Yi accepts the American mediation and goes to Qingdao for negotiations, I am still ready to meet with him at any time."

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 15th Dispatch] The Communist forces' attempt to occupy Qingxian in order to cut off the northern section of the Jinpu Railway and then directly take Cangxian has completely failed due to the National Army's increased defenses. According to reports, the Communist forces once rushed to the north gate of Qingxian on the morning of the 6th. At that time, the defending troops and security teams bravely resisted and immediately repelled them. The chief of staff of their 63rd division was also killed in action. The area near Qingxian has become calm, and the two regiments of Communist forces concentrated near Cangxian have also retreated to the area of Wangshan Temple in the southeast of the county due to the National Army's increased strength. The National Army has recently garrisoned various important strongholds near Cangxian, thus strengthening the city's defenses.

### Proposal to Establish a Buffer Zone North of the Songhua River Rejected by the Communists; Doolittle-Lin Meeting Difficult to Realize in the Near Future

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th Dispatch] Officials stated that the American proposal to establish a buffer zone along the Hongwu line on the north bank of the Songhua River has been rejected by the Communist forces. The Communist forces insist that the National Army should withdraw south of the Songhua River. A certain influential person also told our reporter that there will not be major changes in the Northeast military and political personnel recently, and that Gu Zhutong will be in charge of Northeast affairs, which is not true.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 15th Dispatch] The Doolittle-Lin meeting will be difficult to realize in the near future. When our reporter visited Wu Xiuquan, Lin Biao's representative in Changchun, Wu said: "Regarding this matter, Lin sent a telegram from Harbin on the 13th, saying that he was too busy and unwell to attend the meeting as invited. After receiving this telegram on the 14th, I immediately forwarded it to the American representatives and informed the government representatives of this intention in the afternoon. However, I believe there will still be opportunities to meet in the future, and at the same time, this matter will not affect the peace in the Northeast."

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 14th Dispatch] Although the Doolittle-Lin meeting has now been postponed twice, it is learned that the American representative of the Military Mediation Department in Changchun, De Bermen, is still making continuous efforts, so it cannot be said that it has reached a state of complete despair. According to the observations of most people here, the stagnation of the Nanjing negotiations is directly related to this matter, and the anxiety of the general public is greater than in the past.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 15th Dispatch] Liao Yaoxiang went to Dehui (located northeast of Changchun) on the morning of the 15th to inspect the defenses.

He stated that maintaining a large standing army during peacetime is beyond the country's financial capacity.

Chairman Chiang has also recently instructed that the conditions for organizing and training the people must be accelerated in order to establish a sound national guard system. Mr. Bai finally expressed his hope that this system would be implemented as soon as possible in order to strengthen the country's self-defense forces and strive to protect the country's independence and survival.

### Zhou Enlai Visits Chiang Ting-fu Yesterday to Discuss the Yellow River Closure Project; Preliminary Agreement Reached on Funding Issues

[This Newspaper News] Yesterday morning at approximately 9:00 AM, Communist Party Representative Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Wang Xiaoyi, the Communist Party's Yellow River levee restoration project representative, Cheng Run, the Communist Party representative from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, and interpreter Zhang Wenjin, visited Director Chiang Ting-fu of the Executive Headquarters to discuss matters related to the Yellow River closure and levee restoration project. Those participating in the discussion included Kesick, advisor to the UNRRA Office in China, Faulkner, the representative of the acting director of that office, Glenn, an UNRRA agricultural expert, and Todd, the American engineer in charge of this Yellow River diversion project. Mr. Todd first reported on the current status of the project, stating that the Yellow River's return to its old course would soon be realized, and there would be no danger to farmers on both banks of the lower reaches. Mr. Zhou expressed deep concern that this would endanger the Communist Party areas in the lower reaches, and stated his willingness to personally inspect the actual situation at the project site in order to decide whether the closure should be carried out immediately. The Director of the Executive Headquarters suggested that the technical issues should be left to the experts to decide, and that the decision on whether to close the river immediately should be entrusted to the Yellow River Engineering Committee, to be decided by a majority vote. (Note: This committee consists of six members, including two from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee, two Communist Party representatives, and one each from the Executive Headquarters and UNRRA). Mr. Zhou believed that the majority opinion might not include the Communist Party's opinion, and that it should be effective only after unanimous approval by all representatives of the committee. The two sides failed to reach a concrete decision on the veto power issue. Mr. Chiang assured that when the levee restoration project is carried out in the Communist Party area in the lower reaches of the old Yellow River course, the Executive Headquarters will bear the cost of work relief in order to ensure that the entire Yellow River no longer poses a threat to North China. After the water is released, the Executive Headquarters will provide relief to the residents in the river channel of the old course. The discussion ended at 11:30 AM when Mr. Zhou departed. The discussion resumed in the afternoon and concluded at 6:00 PM. It is reported that the two sides have reached a preliminary agreement on the funding of the levee restoration project, namely, that a portion of the work relief funds will be allocated by the Executive Headquarters to the Henan branch and then exchanged for Communist Party currency to pay engineering wages in the Communist Party area, and the remaining funds will be jointly decided and allocated by the two parties for the purpose of purchasing post-disaster relief materials needed in the Communist Party area. Regarding work relief food supplies, experts reported in May that 6,000 tons of grain were needed. Mr. Zhou indicated that this should be increased. As a result of today's meeting, Mr. Chiang agreed to first allocate 8,600 tons of grain to be transported to the Communist Party area of the old Yellow River course to carry out work relief. As for the total amount of work relief food supplies, it will be decided next Thursday during continued discussion.

[Further News] It is reported that Zhou Enlai is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Nanjing today.

### La Guardia Sends Telegram Severely Reprimanding Branch Personnel

[This Newspaper News] After more than 300 staff members of the UNRRA Office in China sent a joint telegram to La Guardia, criticizing the unequal distribution of relief materials, causing a great uproar, Mr. Lai, the Director of the UNRRA Office in China, quietly held a very simple wedding with his female secretary after office hours, and then left for the old capital, as if to distance himself from the matter. However, he has recently received another telegram from La Guardia, severely reprimanding him, which stated in brief: "I do not approve of publishing this telegram; this kind of situation must not occur again in the future." Although the telegram praised the spirit of service of UNRRA staff in China, it also pointed out: "This kind of publicity not only hinders the spirit of seamless cooperation, but also, considering the scale of the UNRRA organization, this kind of behavior violates the discipline that is necessary in such an organization." La Guardia stated that as of the date of the telegram (July 11), he himself had not yet received the original telegram from the more than 300 staff members in Shanghai, and unexpectedly, the Shanghai side disregarded the approval of the US authorities and hastily published the telegram.

However, after 4:00 PM, the water level returned to a stagnant state, so the feeling of worry has not been completely dispelled.

### Inner Mongolian Political Situation in Turmoil: The Eastern Mongolian Side Launches a So-Called Purge Movement; Communist Party Sends Personnel to Infiltrate Western Mongolia with Great Effort

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 14th] With the flames of war still raging within the country, the situation in Inner Mongolia is becoming increasingly turbulent. According to yet unconfirmed information from Mongolian sources here, the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Movement Committee, formerly in Zhangjiakou, has moved east to Chifeng in Jehol and merged with the Eastern Mongolian Autonomous Government, with Communist Party member Yun Ze as chairman and Bo Shengmandu, leader of the Eastern Mongolian Autonomous Government, as vice chairman. In addition, an Eastern Mongolian branch of the Mongolian Autonomous Movement Committee has been established in Wangyemiao, Eastern Mongolia. The radical faction in Wangyemiao is now rising in prominence. It is said that former Eastern Mongolian representatives Mani Badar and others, who were dispatched to Beijing to petition but were prevented from doing so by the Northeast Headquarters, have been killed by the radical faction in Wangyemiao, with only Sanjie Zhabu escaping. The Eastern Mongolian side has launched a "purge" and "struggle" movement, and society is extremely turbulent. Currently, the Communist army in Western Mongolia (mainly referring to the Xilingol League area) has not yet entered the territory of the Mongolian banners, but each banner has dispatched staff to carry out propaganda and education work, but has not yet been drawn into the vortex of struggle. The banners still possess self-defense troops, and local order is very good, but after last year's passage of large armies, livestock losses have been significant, and people's lives are becoming increasingly difficult.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] Mongolian people from Chahar Province residing in Beiping, represented by Senggelingqin Bayantai and fifteen others, sent a telegram to the chairman and Mao Zedong, opposing the designation of Chahar Province as a stationing area for the Communist army.

### Provinces Exempted from Land Tax in the 35th Year Divided into Two Years for Averaged Exemption; National Government Issues Order Prohibiting Grain Administration Personnel from Harassing the People

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The National Government issued an order on the 15th: (1) Regarding this year's land tax, for the purpose of regulating food supply and stabilizing the domestic economy, it is still necessary to continue to levy in kind and purchase in kind, which is truly unavoidable. All levels of grain administration personnel must be honest and impartial in their duties and handle matters carefully. If there are any acts of corruption, self-enrichment, or harassment of the people, they will be severely punished according to law once verified, and the supervisory and public opinion and judicial organs at all levels are instructed to correct and expose them at any time in order to maintain official integrity. (2) Regarding the land tax of various provinces, it was previously ordered on September 3 of last year to exempt them from taxation for one year at different times. Now, in order to regulate food supply and stabilize the domestic economy, the method of exempting land tax has been appropriately changed. All nine provinces that were to be exempted from land tax in the 35th year, Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Fujian, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, and Chongqing City, will be uniformly divided into two years for averaged exemption.

### Reconstruction of the Qiantang River Bridge Requires 1 Billion Yuan

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 15th] The Qiantang River Bridge, which connects the eastern and western parts of Zhejiang Province, was just completed when the War of Resistance broke out. When the National Army withdrew from Hangzhou, it was damaged. Later, the enemy repaired it, and the National Army also repeatedly damaged it. This great bridge was never utilized by the invaders. After the victory, the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Ministry of Communications began to restore it. Although it can barely be used now, the bridge piers have been severely damaged. If repairs are not made soon, it may be difficult to maintain it for long. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications has drafted a plan to carry out repairs and add a motor vehicle lane. The estimated cost is about 1 billion yuan, which is currently under review by the Executive Yuan.

### Local Dispatches: Continuous Rain Causes Disaster in Northern Anhui; Many Areas Along the Huai River Become Waterlogged; Disaster Victims Desperately Await Relief

[Our Bengbu Correspondent] In recent years, northern Anhui has been plagued by natural disasters and man-made calamities. In the northeast counties, the Communist army has continued to harass them, and in the northwest counties, floods have struck again. Since the beginning of the month, continuous rain has been pouring down, and areas along the Huai River have been turned into lakes. Many fields and houses have been submerged. The affected areas include Shou County, Fengtai, Fuyang, Yingshang, Taihe, Huoqiu, Guoyang, Mengcheng, Bo County, and Huaiyuan County. The wheat harvest in these counties suffered from wind and insect damage, and the harvest was poor, with each mu not yielding enough seeds. Due to the shallow and silted riverbeds and lakes along the Huai River, water levels rise sharply and the embankments collapse when there is continuous rain. The autumn crops that the people were hoping for have all been flooded, resulting in the loss of tens of thousands of dan of autumn grain. Shou and Fengtai counties are the most severely affected, with a vast expanse of water outside the city. Many refugees are battling the storms and waves in small boats. The Longyuan area of Huaiyuan, due to its proximity to the Wo River, has downstream sedimentation, making it difficult for the turbid flow to discharge, resulting in backflow into the Huai River. More than a thousand houses have been washed away, and there are many instances of villages running out of food. In Guoyang, the floodwaters overflow, and the water is blocked by the embankment, causing six or seven li on both sides of the Fei River to be submerged. In Taihe, due to the lack of water conservancy repairs, water has accumulated in the city, disrupting traffic. Autumn crops along the Gu River, Ci River, and Bazhang River have all been submerged. The long-distance bus from Bengbu to Fuyang has been suspended for several days due to flooding on the highway. Small steamers operating on the Huai River have been extremely crowded in recent days. The restoration of the Huai River embankment has been greatly affected. The water level of the Huai River here has risen sharply by more than ten feet in recent days, and due to the current flood season, the water level is continuing to rise. The disaster-stricken counties have reported the disaster situation to the Anhui Provincial Government one after another, appealing for relief. The Anhui Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is also preparing to provide emergency relief to save the people.

Shells exploded, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. After holding out for seven hours, the National Army stationed in the city received the news and came to support, and the Communist army began to retreat. In total, the Communist army suffered over a thousand casualties, while the National Army only had five minor injuries.

### Editorial: A Longing for Sweet Rain Amidst Oppressive Discomfort

When Mr. Hu Shih arrived in Nanjing, our newspaper reporter inquired about his impressions of the "political atmosphere" in Nanjing. This former Chinese Ambassador to the United States smiled and replied, "The weather hasn't changed at all; it's stifling and hot. It needs rain." This truly demonstrates the refined and detached spirit of a scholar serving as a diplomat. Nanjing is indeed stifling and hot. Meteorological statistics show that Nanjing's average temperature is three to five degrees higher than coastal areas. It really needs some rain to alleviate the oppressive feeling of these midsummer nights. Our newspaper reporter asked Mr. Hu about his impressions of the "political atmosphere" in Nanjing. Since he mentioned "atmosphere," the temperature in Nanjing must be quite low, hence the stifling heat and the need for rain. People hope for some coolness to relieve their oppressive feelings, they hope for rain. This is true in nature, and it is also true in the "political atmosphere."

Since the surrender of the Japanese invaders until now, it has been from high summer through autumn and winter, even into the present summer. The Chinese people, especially the working class and peasantry, have endured eight years of prolonged resistance and all hope that victory can bring them stability and peace, so that they can be liberated from eight years of suffering and have a chance to recuperate. However, in this past year, the government has returned to the capital, but the people have not only failed to return to their hometowns, but even the loyal people who originally lived in the countryside have been displaced because of the victory in the war of resistance. The refugees from northern Jiangsu who fill Nanjing and Shanghai today are the fruits of the victory in the war of resistance. What makes them leave their homes and struggle with death is not the Japanese "Imperial Army," but the armed forces of the Chinese Communist Party, who call themselves "liberators." What are they "liberating"? They are stripping away all their meager private property, making it impossible for them to live in peace, and banishing them to wander in strange lands. Wander…! Eight years of prolonged resistance won victory, but it still brings them wandering. Our government should certainly feel ashamed, and even the Chinese people feel ashamed towards these displaced compatriots from Jiangdong. This is due to the people's ineffective supervision of the government, causing them to suffer displacement and hardship again after the victory in the war of resistance. However, they understand that what brings them this misfortune is none other than the gift of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party wants to "liberate" them, banishing them to live this wandering and precarious life. Not to mention other regions, "Northern Jiangsu" is close to Nanjing and Shanghai. The situation in "Northern Jiangsu" is most clearly understood by the citizens of Shanghai. They receive various reports, they understand the truth of this picture of exile, and they give their hope and trust to the government, to our great Allied nations, and to their special envoy, General Marshall. Even the "Democratic League," which has always expressed sympathy for the CCP, one of its many leaders, perhaps because he grew up in Jiangsu, is naturally more familiar with the situation in "Northern Jiangsu," and also expresses dissatisfaction with the CCP's actions in "Northern Jiangsu," hoping that they will change their ways. In this past year, from the year since the Japanese surrender, it should be well known who is harming the lives of the people and the life of the nation. The people hope that the government can save them from their plight, and that the Allied nations can understand the true situation in China. They have hoped for a year, like waiting for clouds and rain in a great drought, but the high sky is now filled with dark clouds, and the dense clouds do not bring rain. Mr. Hu Shih said, "It's stifling and hot, it needs rain." It really needs rain, but when will the rain fall, and when will it bring a feeling of coolness?

It is in this mood that we welcome the new appointment of the American Ambassador to China. The newly appointed ambassador is none other than Mr. John Leighton Stuart, an old friend of China. Mr. Stuart grew up in China, is tired of politics, and has a genuine understanding of China. Because he is tired of politics, it is really a matter of necessity that he takes on the role of ambassador at the age of seventy. He loves his own country and he loves our China. In such a time of crisis, it is truly our hope that Mr. Stuart does not decline the appointment as ambassador due to his advanced age. We hope that due to the appointment of John Leighton Stuart, hostility can be turned into friendship. Although the Chinese people have a clear understanding of the CCP, because they are all Chinese people, they always hope that the CCP can prioritize national interests. This is because China needs stability and recuperation after a long war of resistance. Therefore, although the CCP negotiates on the one hand, and creates new situations on the other hand, puts forward unreasonable and harsh conditions, and does not fulfill their promises, such as the recklessness of Lin Biao and Chen Yi, the people sympathize with the government's tolerance, because the government does not want to resort to arms, hoping that the people can have a chance to recuperate. This is a policy of appeasement, but Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and their ilk are ultimately not Hitler, and the people understand the government's difficulties. What the Chinese people do not understand is that the CCP has achieved its current position thanks to the assistance of our Allied nations, but the CCP is now launching anti-propaganda and anti-Allied propaganda everywhere. At this time, the head of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration publicly sent a letter to the CCP, giving the CCP's illegal regime a de facto recognition. The Chinese people do not understand what kind of policy this is. The appointment of Mr. John Leighton Stuart as ambassador gives the Chinese people a new hope, and gives the CCP a new opportunity. We hope that Mr. John Leighton Stuart can fulfill this hope of the Chinese people.

Here, we must frankly point out that although the people can sympathize with the government's policy of appeasement towards the Communist Party, they cannot condone the government abandoning what it should do. In the political sphere, the implementation of constitutional government and a fresh start with the people has always been the government's consistent policy, so the reorganization of the government to include people outside the Kuomintang, and the determination of the list of National Assembly representatives to formulate the fundamental law of the country, must not be delayed due to the CCP's procrastination. The CCP is ultimately a minority party in China, and we must never delay the majority because of the minority. As for the rectification of officialdom and the punishment of corruption, these are originally the government's responsibilities, and they cannot be repeatedly delayed because the political situation is not yet clear. The people sympathize with the government's policy on handling political issues, but they hope that it can have thorough and factual manifestations in its own responsibilities to strengthen their trust in the government. For example, in the Shanghai grain loan case, after many days of investigation, there are disputes between the local court and the military court, resulting in the criminals either going unpunished or not being brought to justice according to the law. How can such procrastination gain the trust of the people? Furthermore, regarding the economic construction of the Principle of People's Livelihood, it was originally passed at the Sixth National Congress, and the division between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises is clearly defined. Now, after the victory in the war of resistance, state-owned enterprises are rising up, even in the item of sugar, state-owned and provincial-owned institutions are competing with the people for profits, and the rulers of the country only believe that they are competing with merchants for profits, denying that there is competition with the people for profits. However, it is not known that merchants and the people are originally one body, the people are the merchants, and the merchants are the people. When both the upper and lower classes compete for profits, the country is in danger! We hope that the government will quickly advance what it should do within its responsibilities, and not disappoint the people again.

Stopping war to establish peace, the people's eager desire for governance is like waiting for clouds and rain in a long drought, hoping that sweet rain will fall soon, so that in this oppressive temperature, they can get some coolness. We hope that both the government and the CCP will prioritize the interests of the people and the interests of the nation. We also hope that the new American Ambassador to China can fulfill his lofty mission.

### Churchill Encourages France to Strive for Self-Improvement and Work Together to Revive Europe to Lead the Continent Back to Peace and Freedom

[Reuters, Metz, France, 14th] Former British wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill, speaking at a banquet held by the Metz City Council today, advocated the organization of a unified Europe to prevent the great new world institutions from becoming incompetent. Churchill also emphasized the necessity of a strong France, saying that the French people, after saving themselves, will be able to save Europe, and saving Europe means saving the world. Churchill said, "I have been with France for forty years. France is now in a difficult position, and I am still following her footsteps. I have come here to give you encouragement after going through a dark period together. I believe that France will be able to restore its glorious past and contribute to a reasonable and lasting peace." For decades, Britain and France have advanced together, fought shoulder to shoulder, and finally fulfilled their responsibilities and defeated the invaders. May we continue to be together and never separate.

Although France won a glorious victory in the First World War, its wounds were very serious, and almost all of its blood had been drained. We must not forget that France sacrificed two million people for the war aims of the Allies. Before the outbreak of the Second World War, it was actually possible to prevent it simply by prohibiting German armament. During the Second World War, I bore a part of the task, and I never allowed the slightest rift to arise between Britain and France. You must never let this rift occur. History has made our two great nations form an inseparable and inviolable relationship. We must not make any mistakes in the future, and future affairs should be undertaken by those who understand the meaning of history. Churchill mentioned the reason for coming to Metz, saying that at the beginning of the North African campaign, General Giraud had agreed with me to meet in Metz, and now the goal has been achieved. When General de Gaulle received me in Paris in November 1944, I also talked to him about this appointment, and he said that he would be able to fulfill it. General de Gaulle and I have never expressed disappointment in the greatness of France, and we firmly believe that the final victory must belong to us.

Finally, Churchill said that he would like to talk about two real problems. The first is the European problem. Churchill said: "We have been taken advantage of by Germany twice, and we must not let this happen again. Without a unified and united Europe, the great new world institutions, even under the leadership of the United States, will inevitably be futile." Both explosions originated in Europe, so we should first think of Europe. The second is the French problem. Without a strong France, there is no hope for the revival of Europe. No country needs to be strong more than France today. In short, we must strengthen unity and form "a unified nation." I would like to offer you faithful advice as a loyal old friend, that the nation must be united to lead Europe back to peace and freedom. If France can save itself! It will be able to save Europe, and saving Europe is saving the world.

[Reuters, Brussels, 14th] After Churchill delivered his speech at the Metz City Hall, he drove to Luxembourg. When he arrived at the town of Thionville on the border, he was surrounded by the public, and the enthusiasm was exciting.

Truman's Broadcast Greetings

Although France has encountered two misfortunes in the past twenty-five years, it still stands on the front line of the world's free nations, proclaiming the same principles of freedom as 157 years ago. I would like to take this great anniversary to pay tribute to your country on behalf of the people of your country.

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] A White House spokesman said; President Truman is expected to sign the $3.75 billion Anglo-American loan agreement on Monday.

[Central News Agency, New York, 14th Special Dispatch] The reaction here to Congress's passage of the loan bill to Britain generally focuses on the benefits of Anglo-American trade and its impact on future world economic cooperation. However, some observers in the United States also emphasize that this action by the United States contains significant political significance. They frankly pointed out that after the establishment of the Anglo-American financial agreement, Moscow will now stand in opposition to the united front of non-Soviet countries economically. These observers further stated that the Soviet Union's "belligerent" strategy in the United Nations meetings and the Paris Four Foreign Ministers' Conference convinced many members of Congress and their constituents that the world is now in a struggle between two ideologies, and that those who voted against the loan to Britain were equal to abandoning the principles of British democracy, which is why the loan supporters won.

### Developments in Europe; U.S.-Soviet Relations Deteriorate; U.S. Policy Deliberations Toward the Soviet Union May Change

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 15th Dispatch: U.S.-Soviet relations in Europe have undergone important developments today, and the results of the developments may prompt the United States to change its basic policy toward the Soviet Union. The most important development is the statement by U.S. Compensation Commissioner Pauley. Pauley recently visited Germany and Austria, and it is said that the Soviet Union has taken away various materials from Germany without authorization, which is a clear violation of the Potsdam Agreement. It is believed that if the Soviet Union continues to violate the Potsdam Agreement and insists on unreasonable compensation demands, the United States may change its basic policy toward the Soviet Union. Another important event is that of the four missing U.S. soldiers, two of whom have been proven to have been arrested by the Soviets. The Soviet side stated that these two were arrested by "some Soviet officers" because the Americans had arrested them. This point can prove the degree of deterioration in U.S.-Soviet relations in Europe. Another incident is that of Soviet Navy Lt. Letyun, who is on trial in Seattle for attempting to obtain atomic secrets. The debate has ended, and Letyun may be sentenced to death.

### Inaugural Meeting Held on August 13th, General Meeting to Open on September 9th, Provisional City Council to End at the End of July, Mayor Wu Invites City Councilors to Discuss Preparations Before the Meeting

(Our Newspaper) Yesterday, Mayor Wu held a meeting at the New Life Club for the first session of city councilors, to discuss preparations before the establishment of the city council. One hundred and sixty-one councilors attended. First, Wu Le gave a welcome speech, saying that Shanghai is China's largest metropolis, and the Shanghai City Council should serve as a model for city councils across the country. He hoped that everyone would "openly and frankly" cooperate, and the city government would sincerely accept everyone's suggestions, while also appealing to everyone about its own difficulties and hoping to be given some time to improve. If this spirit can be maintained, then "the government and the council will be one family" and will surely achieve success. The purpose of today's tea party: The central government stipulates that the inaugural meeting of the city council is to be convened by the city government. Now, a tea party is held first, so that everyone can jointly decide on the date of the meeting. Regarding the issue of the meeting venue, the city council is the highest meeting of the city, and a suitable venue should be found in the future. At present, opinions are also being solicited.

Speeches by the Speaker and Deputy Speaker

Then, Xu Qi, Speaker of the Provisional City Council, delivered a speech, praising Mayor Wu's past spirit of cooperation with the councilors of Hankou and Chongqing, and reported that the Provisional City Council should adjourn at the end of July. He proposed that the new city council be established on August 1st. As for the venue, he suggested still using the address of the Provisional City Council on Nanchang Road, or the Fuming Village on Middle Zheng Road. Later, Deputy Speaker Xi Yushu proposed the former German school on Daxi Road, where more than one hundred American soldiers now live. If a solution can be found for their accommodation, it can be used as a venue. The establishment of the general assembly should be as early as possible. He also said that with the Mayor's past experience and style, respecting the opinions of the city councilors, the formal general meeting would be established in the future, with the slogans "the government and the council are one family" and "openness and frankness", and the results will surely be satisfactory.

Various Opinions Expressed

Subsequently, Councilor Zhai expressed his opinion, believing that there should be adequate preparation before the meeting, and the meeting period can be slightly later. The city government's financial budget must be prepared as soon as possible, and should be increased to alleviate the heavy burden of life for civil servants. Zhong Keto advocated holding the inaugural meeting on August 1st, and the meeting might as well be held a little later. Gu Zhuxuan advocated that the date be decided by the mayor, without further discussion. The mayor then stated: Since taking office, seventy to eighty percent of the time has been spent on temporary problems, and municipal administration has been delayed. The preparation and establishment of the budget is now decided to be completed around the end of July. The city government is responsible for implementation, and the city councilors are responsible for legislation. If the city council is successful, it can immediately make foreign countries feel that Chinese politics is on track. Abroad, meetings are held most often in spring and autumn. Summer is too hot, and people are mentally tired, and it is easy to act hastily. Therefore, my opinion is to hold the inaugural meeting on "August 13th" to elect the speaker and deputy speaker, and to open the first session on September 1st. The city government report and budget can be submitted at that time. There are three possible venues: the Provisional City Council address on Nanchang Road, the former German school, and the former Japanese Overseas Chinese Autonomous Association, etc., but these are all practical issues, so it is advocated to authorize the City Council Secretariat to prepare. Feng Youju felt that the grand Journalist's Day would be held on September 1st, and dead journalists would be mourned, which would be very inconvenient for journalist councilors, and requested postponement. Finally, Pan Gongzhan suggested holding the general meeting on September 9th to commemorate the victory and surrender. The result was unanimously passed. After the meeting, journalist councilors Pan Gongzhan, Zhao Junhao, Shi Yong, Feng Youju, Tang Shichang and the mayor, etc., took a group photo as a memento.

### Pay Attention to Usage of Nonfat Dry Milk

Recently, the Shanghai branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration distributed milk powder to citizens in this city, including nonfat dry milk, which is used differently from regular milk powder. This type of milk powder is made by extracting cream and water from fresh milk. Every two ounces of milk powder can be mixed into sixteen ounces of milk water. It cannot be prepared and consumed like regular milk powder, but needs to be mixed with clean water into a paste, and then boiled for one minute with four times the amount of hot water. It needs to be stirred constantly while boiling in order to be drinkable. This type of milk powder should be stored tightly in a cool and dry place, and should not be exposed to the air to avoid clumping. Citizens who receive nonfat dry milk often throw it away because they do not know how to prepare and store it, which is a pity.

### Milk Powder Factory Closes Down, Unable to Withstand Foreign Competition

### Stopping Registration of Rickshaws Will Cause Serious Consequences, Rickshaw Industry Representatives Petition

In order to reduce traffic congestion and regulate urban traffic, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has ordered a halt to the registration of new private chartered rickshaws, tricycles, and motorized rickshaws. Upon hearing the news, the Rickshaw Industry Association convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors. The industry believes that this move by the Public Utilities Bureau will inevitably lead to the bankruptcy of more than seventy rickshaw manufacturing factories in the city, and materials worth billions of dollars, including finished and semi-finished products, will become waste. Moreover, thousands of technicians who have been trained in the industry for several years will have no job to change to, which will inevitably cause serious consequences. Therefore, seven representatives, including Yu Xingye, were selected to petition the Public Utilities Bureau, asking the government to show sympathy for the difficulties of businesses and provide relief, or postpone implementation.

### Large Number of Police Officers Disguised as Villagers Bust Large-Scale Drug Den, Multiple People Arrested at Renhe Hotel, Contraband Drugs Found Hidden in Toilets

On the 12th, the Taishan Police Station received a tip that a large-scale drug den was set up in the Renhe Hotel on South Guangxi Road, selling 1-2 million units of drugs daily. They immediately summoned Judicial Section Chief Zhang Rou, section members Ha Jingang, Shao Guanrong, and plainclothes police officers Chen Fusheng, Zhang Wenqi, Wang Dongwan, Jin Zhongyuan, etc., disguised as villagers who had just arrived in Shanghai from the countryside. Each carried luggage and pretended to book rooms to lay in ambush. At around 10:00 PM, they first rushed to room 311, arresting the leading drug kingpin named Dai Heshang (38 years old, from Suzhou). They found 188 packets of white powder (i.e., morphine) of various sizes around him and hidden in toilets, each packet selling for 2,000, 6,000, and 10,000 units, as well as 1,950,800 units of cash. In rooms 322 and 325, they arrested drug users Huang Gengsheng, Sun Shiting, and Zhong Zhigui, and several packets of white powder, as well as drug paraphernalia. They then arrested Zhang Xingquan, the tea house foreman, an accomplice in the hotel, and found four packets of white powder on him, as well as Ye Jinting, the tea house attendant on duty, and found three packets of white powder on him. The hotel accountant, Zhang Xiangqing, was suspected of harboring the criminals, so he was also taken to the station. After questioning, Dai Heshang confessed to privately setting up a drug trafficking organization, but claimed that the white powder was bought from a Tao surnamed person at 12 Yide Lane, Dongxin Bridge. The rest of his confession was evasive. Zhang Xingquan and Ye Jinting also admitted that they committed illegal acts because their income was not enough. They were ordered to be detained and sent to the prosecutor's office for questioning. On the one hand, Director Song commended the officers for their meritorious service in solving the case. In addition, given the hotel's audacity to harbor criminals and sell drugs, he asked whether to revoke its license and awaited instructions from higher authorities.

[Another Report] White powder king Li Atu, residing at 46 Haige Lane, Guangyuan Road, was raided by the Xujiahui Police Station the night before. However, Li was out, and only Li's concubine, Li Yindi, from Qingpu, was caught.

### Trial of She Aizhen Completed, Verdict on Zhou Yuying et al. Scheduled for the 22nd

[Our Newspaper] She Aizhen, the wife of Wu Shibin, the captain of the guard brigade of the "76" Special Operations Headquarters during the enemy-puppet period, was retried in the High Court yesterday morning. Lawyer Yu Zhongluo defended her. She wore a plain gauze short shirt and pants, barefoot, black cloth shoes, and a bun. When asked by the judge, she stated: 48 years old, from Guangdong, previously studied at Qixiu Girls' High School. Her husband, Wu Shibin, had a rough understanding of writing and worked at a gambling table in the French Concession before the war. In 1939, he was invited by Li Shiqun and his wife to join the "76" as the captain of the guard brigade. Due to the relationship between husband and wife, and for convenience of entry and exit, I also held the title of accountant, but I had nothing to do, just played mahjong and watched movies with the ladies above. Wu Shibin only took on internal work and never fired a gun or killed anyone. The "China Bank Massacre" was done by Zhang Guozhen on Li Shiqun's orders, and Wu did not participate. The rampant kidnapping and murder cases at that time were due to the chaotic world, and all the crimes were added to Wu. Later, Wu Shibin was detained by the Japanese for more than 50 days for wanting to leave "76". After being released, he suddenly died in Suzhou. His whole body turned black after death. As for saying that I was responsible for assessing the ideology of the guards, I am a housewife, I only know housework, and I have no political ideology, so how can I manage the thoughts of others? And I have never held the position of adjutant director. If I have assisted Wu Shibin, participated in opinions, or done a bad thing, you can shoot me, I will never regret it. The debate on the case was concluded, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced at 9:30 AM on the 22nd.

Also, the case of Zhou Yuying, the head of the puppet Shanghai Social Welfare Bureau, and Li Haoju et al., suspected of being traitors, has also been tried, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced at 9:30 AM on the 22nd.

Consequently, at 3:30 AM on the 12th, they rushed to Room 303 of the Royal Hotel on North Sichuan Road (formerly Route Cardinal Mercier) and arrested him. He was taken to the bureau for questioning.

His home address is No. 16, Sande Lane, Route Lűban. This young man lived in extreme extravagance, made friends indiscriminately, and indulged in debauchery. Lacking money, he had the fanciful idea of obtaining several checkbooks from banks such as Jin Cheng, Da Kang, and Zhejiang Industrial, recklessly issuing checks to conceal his empty grandiosity. Those deceived were mainly owners of high-end restaurants, hotels, and dance halls. It is estimated that he issued over three million in bad checks. Now, various victims are flocking to the sub-bureau to seek justice.

### Agreement Reached to Stabilize Sugar Prices: Aiming to Restore the Previous Normal State

After two weeks of effort, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau has achieved a satisfactory solution for stabilizing sugar prices.

In the afternoon, after 6:00 PM, he invited both parties for a meeting. Attending from the Sugar Industry Association were Li Meiquan and two others. Attending from Taiwan Sugar Corporation were Song Yixin and Jin Boxiang. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that starting today, Taiwan Sugar Corporation will allocate 15,000 bags of sugar to the Sugar Industry Association, with each bag priced at 80,000 yuan. Sugar merchants will resell to sugar shops, with each bag not exceeding 86,000 yuan. If this price is exceeded, the government will take action. It was also stipulated that every Tuesday, Taiwan Sugar Corporation will make an allocation. Next Tuesday's allocation price will be reduced to no more than 75,000 yuan. Subsequently, the weekly allocation price will be gradually reduced in order to suppress sugar prices and restore them to the normal state before the recent price surge. Sugar confectionery manufacturers can apply directly to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation for an allocation of sugar based on the company's allocation price, without going through sugar merchants, thereby reducing costs and hopefully lowering prices. It is reported that Minister Chen Lifu of the Central Organization Department was also present at this meeting.

### Shanghai Provincial High School to Recruit New Students Regularly

A Total of Nine Classes for the First Year of Junior and Senior High School

[Our Newspaper's Report] Shanghai Provincial High School of Jiangsu Province was a famous high school in the country before the war. This spring, after moving to the original school site on Wu Jialong, Hu Min Road, in Shanghai, the city actively planned post-war revival. Yesterday, the school's principal, Dr. Shen Yizhen, made the following remarks to reporters: Shanghai Provincial High School was established in the 16th year of the Republic (1927) and moved to the newly built school site in Caohejing in the 23rd year (1934). The entire school area is more than 500 acres, and all construction equipment meets the latest standards. Unfortunately, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was destroyed by enemy bandits, and more than half of the school buildings were destroyed. The loss of internal equipment was even worse. The estimate is more than 500 million yuan, even if simply. This spring, former Principal Xi Gu returned to Shanghai from Guanzhou to plan for restoration. In addition to asking the government for subsidies, he also solicited donations from all parties, reaching about 200 million yuan. Although it has not been collected yet, the school buildings have been able to be repaired initially, and daily school supplies have been able to be supplemented and added, thanks to this. I originally served in the Ministry of Education, responsible for supervising higher education work. Because of my many years of relationship with Shanghai Provincial High School, I could not bear to see such a good school destroyed by the war. I loved serving at the school in April of this year. Based on facts and needs, I formulated a revival plan. It is expected that it will be completed within the next five years, making Shanghai Provincial High School not only a national model high school but also among the world's famous high schools. Also learned: The school will recruit four classes for the first year of junior high school and five classes for the first year of senior high school in the fall. Registration will begin on the 27th at No. 560 Caishi Road. The examination period is scheduled for August 1st (junior high school) and 2nd and 3rd (senior high school).

### Citizens Apply to Change Their Names

Municipal Government Clarifies Three Points of Doubt

The Municipal Government previously received a report from the 29th District Office, stating: "Upon investigation, many residents in this district have recently applied to change their names, claiming that family members mistakenly reported information during the investigation, or that they used their original names during the occupation. Now, in order to participate in public office elections, the names recorded in the household registration are different from the names on their qualifications certificates or the names they use daily. They are requesting changes. Regarding the use of names, the National Government promulgated the "Regulations on the Restriction of the Use of Names" in July of the 30th year of the Republic, which stipulates in the first article that "The real name of a citizen of the Republic of China is limited to one. The name registered in the household registration is the real name. Those who use nicknames or other names shall indicate their real name." Can those who participate in the election use a nickname and indicate their real name according to the above regulations? This should be requested.

Can these applications to change names be instructed with 'investigation error' to correct the household registration booklet, or should they be processed in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the 'Regulations on Changing Names, Surnames, and Adding Surnames' promulgated by the Ministry of Interior on June 8th of the 22nd year of the Republic? This should be requested.

For those name changes that do not apply to the clauses of Article 2 of the 'Regulations on Changing Names, Surnames, and Adding Surnames,' should the procedures for changing names be carried out? This should be requested." The Municipal Government clarified the following three points:

### People Should Use Their Real Names in Principle

(1) People should use their real names in principle. The third item of the first article of the Regulations on the Restriction of the Use of Names, which states that one should use a nickname and indicate their real name, is only an exception. The name of a public official who is elected must be consistent with the name on their qualification certificate and the name on the household registration book (refer to the Ministry of Interior's Order Yu Min Zi No. 2150 issued on April 17th of the 21st year of the Republic). Therefore, the name on the household registration book must be consistent with the name on the qualification certificate. If someone is elected using a nickname, even if they indicate their real name, it is difficult for it to take effect.

### Changing Names and Correcting Registration are Different

(2) The change of name referred to in the Regulations on the Review and Approval of Changing Names, Surnames, and Adding Surnames by the Ministry of Interior refers to a situation where a person requests to change to another newly created name because their current name has one of the various circumstances listed in Article 2 of the regulations. It is not a correction registration as stipulated in the Household Registration Law, which is only a request for correction because the person believes that the name recorded on the household registration book is incorrect. Therefore, the aforementioned request to correct a name does not need to be processed in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Regulations on the Review and Approval of Changing Names, Surnames, and Adding Surnames. The person only needs to state the facts and attach supporting documents, and submit them to the district office in charge for correction. However, as a matter of caution, the district office should verify the documents attached after conducting an on-site investigation or review. In addition to correcting the household registration book in the district, the district office must also notify the police precinct and Bao Office in charge, and report it to the municipal government.

(3) If the district office encounters requests for name changes other than the above two situations and cannot make a decision, or if doubts arise regarding the supporting documents attached by the applicant, it should submit them to the municipal government for approval at any time.

### Central Bank Assists U.S. Authorities in Investigating Counterfeit U.S. Dollars

Three Types of Denominations Discovered; Businesses Must Seek Expert Authentication When Receiving

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division, in addition to the previously discovered 20 and 50 dollar denominations, counterfeit 100 dollar bills have also been discovered. However, only a small amount has been discovered so far. This is the first time such a large denomination counterfeit bill has been discovered in China. The printing is extremely fine. The bill is stamped with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco seal. The letter "L" is printed on the upper left of the front, and the Arabic numeral "12" is printed in each corner. Among the counterfeit bills discovered, the number "F4" is printed on the lower right corner of the front, and the number "(32)" is printed on the back. The serial numbers of the counterfeit bills are generally around L00596908A. As for the counterfeit 20 dollar bills, the paper quality is rougher, and the printing is also inferior to the 100 dollar counterfeit bills. If the following numbers are found on the front and back of a 20 dollar bill, then the bill is undoubtedly counterfeit: C18-245 C19-249 D21-251 19-213 K17-210.

In response to a request from the U.S. Treasury Department's representative in China, the Central Bank has sent a circular to all banks and financial institutions in the city, stating that when receiving 20 and 50 dollar U.S. bills, they should carefully identify them and may submit them to the authentication experts sent by the U.S. government for identification. The addresses are: (1) Captain George Plotkin, U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division, New Asia Hotel, Sichuan North Road, telephone 19790, extension 47; (2) Lieutenant H.C. Millirem, U.S. Navy Pay Office, 28 Bund, telephone 15780, extension 233. Furthermore, all designated banks and Category A licensed businesses must remove the counterfeit bills after expert authentication confirms that they are counterfeit, mark them with a "Counterfeit" stamp, and submit them to the Central Bank at any time.

Now, the United States also has coal being transported to China. The William P. Gray Ship, managed by Jardine Matheson, arrived with more than 9,000 tons of white coal from Pearl Harbor, to be unloaded in Qingdao.

The British ship Yao Hao Parker, carrying more than 8,000 tons of white coal from Seattle, is expected to arrive in Shanghai next week.

Also, the Kailuan Coal Mine's daily output has reached 12,000 tons, but due to transportation issues, it cannot all be shipped to Shanghai. In order to meet Shanghai's coal needs, it has been decided to ship 10,000 tons of coal from Keelung, Taiwan, each month to make up the shortfall. The government has also ordered 80,000 to 100,000 tons of coal from Vietnam, which will be shipped to Shanghai in batches.

### Price Controls and Negotiated Prices: Laws to Be Changed

Most of the laws and regulations formulated by the government during the war have now been abolished. However, because commodity price fluctuations have not yet ceased, the government has decided to retain all provisions of the "Regulations on the Control of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During Extraordinary Times" and the "Measures for Suppressing the Hoarding of Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times" until the situation stabilizes. In addition, the Executive Yuan previously ordered the Ministry of Economic Affairs to abolish the "Measures for Suppressing Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices During Extraordinary Times." The Ministry is now preparing measures to abolish the price limit section. The negotiated price section will continue to be retained, but the standards for suppressing violations of negotiated prices will be appropriately relaxed.

### All Factions Compete to Purchase: Yarn Market Stays Strong

Yesterday, the yarn market was quite buoyant. The Cantonese faction increased their purchases, and the Hankou faction also arrived. Customers from Beijing and Wuhu also made considerable purchases of small and medium-sized yarns. As a result, all 20-count yarns were showing a prosperous trend. The "Ma" yarn saw the largest increase, rising six to seven thousand yuan higher than last weekend. The rest rose by about two to three thousand yuan. The market was exceptionally strong. Fine yarns and threads saw little activity, and sales remained sluggish. At noon, the China Textile Construction Company opened yarn sales as usual. The prices were one to six thousand yuan lower than the previous auction. In addition, there were nine types of coarse and fine yarns and threads, which were sold in two groups by tender.

Cotton Sales Are Smooth: Trading in local cotton is quite brisk, and market prices remain firm. Shenxin No. 1 Factory purchased 200 bales of Uruguay cotton, Defeng Factory purchased 500 bales of Pengjiapo cotton, and Dasheng purchased 200 bales of Pengjiapo cotton. In addition, cotton firms also traded five to six hundred bales, with prices up one to two thousand yuan.

Cotton Cloth Is Sluggish: The actual demand for cotton cloth is quiet. Only Sichuan, Guangdong, Hankou, Hangzhou, and other places have some demand for fine cloth and serge. Other sales channels are not smooth.

### China Textile's Current Production

More Than 900 Pieces of Yarn Produced Daily; More Than 20,000 Bolts of Cotton Cloth Produced Daily

Regarding reports that the China Textile Company's production has sharply decreased due to power restrictions, according to the company's business department, the China Textile Company's entire production increase plan is being gradually promoted. In addition to the domestic market, it is also planned to expand to the South Seas Islands. The recent reduction in production is due to power supply issues. Because some boilers at the power company have been damaged, the power generation is slightly limited. According to news from the power company, the company has ordered generators from the United States that can generate 24,000 kilowatts, which will arrive in the short term. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company is also expected to increase power generation by 8,000 kilowatts starting next month. Therefore, the power supply issue will definitely be resolved at that time. As for the China Textile Company's current production, according to the person in charge, the current daily output of yarn is more than 900 pieces, and the output of cotton cloth is about 20,000 bolts.

### Gold Market Peaceful, U.S. Dollar Continues to Fall

The crude gold market opened slightly higher yesterday morning, and people's sentiment was still good. Silver shops made slight purchases, and the high price was 1.97 million yuan. After the U.S. dollar was resold, it weakened, and the gold market's upward trend temporarily came to an end. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank distributed 85 taels, priced at 1.9575 million yuan, and then it became more peaceful. Around noon, it was still hovering between 1.95 million and 1.96 million yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to be dragged down by the U.S. dollar to around 1.945 million yuan. As a result, it closed 17,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Decorative gold was 10,800 yuan, silver was 1,800 yuan, and silver dollars were sold at 1,380 yuan. The informal money market remained loose, with interest rates at 1.5 to 1.8 jiao.

The U.S. dollar continued to decline, as the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Anglo-American loan bill. Buyers turned to Hong Kong dollars. Sellers offered, and from the opening price of 2,560 yuan, it fell steadily. At noon, it had broken through the 2,500 yuan mark. In the afternoon, it continued to fall, and the result was another 70 yuan lower than last Saturday. The exchange rate for the British pound rose to 3 yuan and 7 jiao. The gold arbitrage also widened to 784 yuan per 10 taels. Hong Kong currency continued to advance, reaching a high price of 580 yuan before slightly retreating. The result was another 5 yuan higher. The exchange rate for Hong Kong was 560 yuan, Indian exchange rate was 690 yuan, British exchange rate was 9,200 yuan, and all were being sold. The U.S. exchange rate remained flat.

### Consumer Cooperatives Self-Manage Rice Distribution

More Than 10,000 Yuan Cheaper Per Stone

Mr. Li Wan-chung, Chairman of the Shanghai Consumer Cooperative, has recently been issued a purchasing certificate by the Social Affairs Bureau. He has sent personnel to various rice-producing areas to purchase and transport large quantities of rice, which will arrive in Shanghai soon. All members of the cooperative, regardless of when they joined, can be allocated at least one stone per household unit. Based on the actual cost, each stone will be more than 10,000 yuan cheaper than the market price in Shanghai. It is said that the cooperative also directly accepts commissions from schools, factories, organizations, and other cooperatives for group purchases to serve the citizens.

### Prices Rise to 35 Cents: Not Many U.S. Cotton Orders

According to cotton industry authorities, since the U.S. government lifted price controls on goods, the price of U.S. cotton has risen. Previously, orders were about 30 U.S. cents per pound, but now it is 35 cents. In recent months, orders for U.S. cotton from the industry have been more relaxed than before. The reason is that the U.S. cotton loan of 33 million U.S. dollars has little remaining. In addition, Shanghai's various firms and cotton mills estimate that U.S. cotton inventories can last until February of the following year. The recent arrivals of U.S. cotton are all previous orders.

### Warehouse Greed Opposed by Cotton Industry

The Cotton Industry Association believes that foreign merchant warehouses repeatedly make unreasonable demands, and warehouse rents are also increasing from time to time. For example, the current warehouse rent for a bale of U.S. cotton is 1.10 U.S. dollars, which is calculated on a monthly basis, but there is a possibility of an increase in the middle. When picking up goods, there are fees for opening doors and turning over goods. If the U.S. cotton to be picked up is on the bottom layer, the U.S. cotton stacked on top must be turned over first. It is said that the fee per bale is 2,000 yuan. People in the cotton industry say that these unnecessary losses are unbearable. Therefore, the association is currently discussing negotiations with foreign merchant warehouses.

### Tea Companies Hasten to Purchase High-Grade Gunpowder Tea; Ningzhou Flower-Scented Tea Nearly Sold Out

Regarding the high-grade Gunpowder green tea that is mainly sold overseas, tea companies are frequently inquiring about old stocks. Substantial purchases are already underway, awaiting export opportunities. As for flower-scented tea for domestic sales, Ningzhou flower-scented tea from Yixing has been selling briskly for days, with strong purchasing demand. However, due to dwindling inventories, further trade cannot be initiated. The sales of other teas at stores and shops on this street are quite good, especially Taiwanese black tea and Xinshao fried tea. However, prices have not increased.

### Timber Market Stable

Yesterday, in the timber market, fir prices remained stable due to a balance between sales volume and incoming supply. Although there was some arrival of foreign pine, orders from foreign firms have decreased recently, making it difficult for prices to recover. There were reports of Lauan arriving, and prices softened slightly.

### National Medicines Improve

The trade in national medicines has been quiet for a long time. Recently, large amounts of Guangbi currency have been used for transactions, with demand for stomach medicines remaining robust. Moreover, merchants from Taiwan continue to show interest, adding a noticeable boost to the market. Consequently, most goods have improved in price, particularly mountain products, which are especially strong.

### US Silver Price May Increase; Senate and House Seek Compromise; Silver Reserves Exceed 220 Million Ounces

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] The Wall Street Journal reported that the Senate, on Saturday, rejected the proposal to fix the silver price at $0.7111 per ounce by a vote of 54 to 25. It is believed that the Senate may seek a compromise with the House of Representatives and pass the Senate's proposed $0.905 per ounce. The House of Representatives initially expressed surprise at the Senate's rejection of its proposal and was unwilling to compromise. However, due to the intention of leaders from both the majority and minority parties to compromise, the matter may succeed.

[Another Dispatch] The US Treasury Department holds nearly 225,000,000 ounces of silver, far exceeding the amount needed for currency reserves. However, American industry still feels a shortage of silver because US law prohibits the Treasury Department from selling silver to industry. Senators and representatives from Western silver-producing states are demanding that the Treasury Department set the silver price at $0.903 per ounce, increasing to $1.29 per ounce after two years, compared to the current silver price of $0.712 per ounce.

### US Lacks Virgin Antimony; London Prices Higher

[Reuters, New York, 15th] Traders here believe that the current US antimony price of $0.158 per pound will soon rise rapidly. It is said that the US has a great need for antimony ore, but imports are not very enthusiastic because the London antimony price has reached £125 per ton (approximately US $0.23 per pound), which is much higher than the US market price. According to official statistics, the US needs 24,000 tons of antimony in 1945, but domestic supply only accounts for about 10%. Chinese official reports indicate that China's antimony reserves reach 2,500,000 tons.

### Plentiful Supply and Widespread Distribution; Rice Market Situation Stable; Rice Shops Ordered to Limit Retail Quantities

Yesterday, all rice shops in the city received notifications from the Rice Shop Commercial Guild, stating that for retail sales, each person is limited to a maximum of five dou (approximately 2.5 pecks) per purchase. If rice shops do not issue invoices when selling, they must record the name, address, date, and quantity purchased of the buyer in their ledgers for inspection at any time. The total registered amount of rice arriving at the North and South rice markets yesterday was 5,311 shi (approximately 28,450 bushels). Rice shops transported and sold 150 bags themselves, plus 1,439 shi (approximately 7,690 bushels). Market conditions showed mixed trends of increases, decreases, and stability. Baiyuan rice showed slight vitality, while other types lacked momentum for price increases. The allocated sale of coarse Xian rice covered a total of twenty-six districts. Rice prices in Nanxiang and Zhoupu near the suburbs fell by five to six thousand yuan. Flour prices fluctuated. Bran prices rose by one thousand yuan. Broad bean demand was stagnant, falling by approximately one thousand yuan. Bean cake for fertilizer was in high demand, increasing by another five to six hundred yuan. Raw peanuts remained stable. The supply of oil was slightly scarce, and shop demand was active, with prices rising by two thousand yuan. There were inquiries about wheat from Shantou, and sellers were firm, raising prices by one thousand yuan.

### Mr. Shen Zhennan Discusses the Sugarcane Conference

Mr. Shen Zhennan, General Manager of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, recently went to Taiwan to attend the All-Taiwan Sugarcane Industry Conference. It is said that the most important decision made at the conference was the "Sugar Distribution Method." In the past, during the Japanese era, sugar manufacturing companies determined raw material prices, which were approved by the Governor-General, and purchases from sugarcane farmers were made accordingly. This method is no longer applicable in the current period of unstable prices. Therefore, a new method had to be adopted. The principle is that the sugar company and sugarcane farmers cooperate, with a ratio of 52% of the produced sugar going to the company and 48% to the farmers. A Sugar Price Review Committee will be established by the Chief Executive Office, composed of thirteen members selected from the various units attending the Sugarcane Conference. The committee will use the monthly sugar prices from December to April of the following year as a standard and hold an evaluation meeting once a month. The company will use this standard to calculate purchases of sugarcane from farmers. This method has been approved and implemented by Chief Executive Chen. The second important issue is expanding the sugarcane planting area, possibly promoting the planting of nine jia (each jia is equivalent to sixteen mu) between July and September. It is estimated that there may be a production of 300,000 tons of sugar in the year after next. Mr. Shen continued that the conference also decided on two schemes to assist sugarcane farmers: (1) providing loans to sugarcane farmers, as farmers need substantial funds to purchase sugarcane seedlings and cultivate the land; a loan program will be established with the Bank of Taiwan; (2) applying fertilizer, which requires approximately 50,000 tons of ammonium sulfate. As it is difficult to purchase this amount immediately, it was decided to purchase various fertilizers such as soybean cake and peanut cake as substitutes.

(Additional News) The Taiwan Sugar Corporation is scheduled to continue its sixth allocation of medium-grade sugar today. All sugar industry members have been notified to apply for the required quantities for each unit as usual.

### Following the Announcement of Listing Rules, Chinese and Foreign Stocks Rebound

Chinese stocks saw short covering, and buyers took the opportunity to push prices higher, resulting in continuous gains. At the peak, Yongsheng Textile reached 525 yuan, Mei Asia 3280 yuan, Jingfu 208 yuan, Xinguang 225 yuan, and Qinxing 182 yuan. Around noon, there was some profit-taking, causing a slight pullback from the highs. Less popular but more solid stocks continued to be accumulated, showing good momentum. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yongsheng Textile rose slightly, Mei Asia increased by half a percent, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing experienced small rallies. Due to the stock exchange's listing rules not being considered too strict, each rose by 10% to 15%. Less popular small and medium-sized stocks continued to rise, while old stocks remained stable.

Foreign stocks saw buying activity triggered by reports that foreign companies registered under Chinese company law could also apply for listing under the stock listing rules. Yisha rose from 8100 to 8500 yuan, and British Alliance from 8200 to 8700 yuan before stabilizing slightly. As a result, compared to last Saturday, large stocks such as Yisha, British Alliance, and Jardine Matheson rose by 10%, while smaller stocks rose by 0.5% to 1%.

### Mexican Gold Prices Higher Than US

$40.61 USD Per Ounce

[Reuters, London, 15th] The sale of gold by the Bank of Mexico at prices much higher than the official US price has caused considerable fluctuations in the global gold market, significantly impacting the Bombay market. It is understood that Mexico has profited greatly from raising gold prices, with the selling price being $40.61 USD per ounce.

### Rescuing Northern Jiangsu Refugees; Eight Years of War Could Be Endured; One Day of Struggle is Truly Unbearable

—Special Correspondent He Xianglin

This newspaper reported from Yangzhou on the 2nd:

Northern Jiangsu is a vital part of Jiangsu Province and a crucial part of China. It has a population of eighteen million, vast fertile agricultural lands, and significant production. However, since the "August 15th" Japanese surrender, except for Yangzhou, Taizhou, Nantong, and Xuhai, most areas have been successively captured by the Communist Party. Disregarding the nation and the people's lives, they implemented the "Three Capital" Struggle and the "Three Alls" Policy, struggling until everything was destroyed and slaughtering until people were killed. Young and strong men were conscripted into their militia. For the past ten months, the people of Northern Jiangsu, who were occupied, including men, women, old, and young, have been fleeing in droves due to unbearable oppression and the inability to survive, abandoning their beloved homes and becoming refugees along the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) railway line in Yangzhou and Southern Jiangsu. They are not only crying out for food but also enduring the elements, living an inhuman existence. I have heard many refugees lamenting, "Eight years of war were easier to endure; one day of struggle is truly unbearable." How can we not express sympathy and provide rescue for such a tragic cry?

Rescue Work is Busy Day and Night

This heartbreaking displacement has aroused great concern from our central authorities. Last month, the National Government specially appointed Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs to oversee the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief effort and established a Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference in Zhenjiang. After days of planning by Minister Gu and Chairman Wang, five offices were established in Yangzhou, Taixian, Nantong, Xuzhou, and Haizhou under this powerful organization, each responsible for a specific aspect of the relief work.

The Yangzhou Office was officially established on June 20th. According to Xie Zhigang, the director of the office, Zhang Xiji, the deputy director, is the station chief of the Yangzhou Social Relief Center. Another deputy director is Li Weisun, the leader of the Yangzhou work team of the Su-Ning Sub-Administration. They were both appointed to serve concurrently as deputy directors, assisting in the work. The Ministry of Social Affairs has sent only two people, Huang Deming and Fan Peng, to serve as supervisors. In addition, three staff members, including clerks and accountants, were transferred from local government agencies to work without pay. It is admirable that these few people are able to undertake such a significant task. Under the leadership of Director Xie, they put forward an eight-character slogan: "No holidays, no set office hours." Under this slogan, everyone is working day and night, spending almost all their time at their desks except for eating and sleeping. As a result, their work efficiency is relatively rapid. At the same time, in addition to the office organization, they also established a joint relief work meeting system, inviting the heads of relevant local agencies and people engaged in relief work to participate in the meetings, which are held every Sunday to report on the work situation, review it, and promote progress. As a result, some difficulties in the relief work have been reduced. In addition, a Supervisory Committee was established, with the local garrison commander, Commander Huang Baitao, as the chairman and Commissioner Lin as the vice-chairman. Other members include local dignitaries and heads of relevant agencies. By placing the supervisory power outside the executive power of the office, it further demonstrates its openness and has gained the sympathy of more people, which is a great and powerful help to the relief work.

"Liberated" Without Clothing or Food

What is the situation of the refugees in Yangzhou? Let me give you a detailed report. Since the Communist Party implemented "liberation" in Northern Jiangsu, they have "liberated" the people of Northern Jiangsu to the point of being "without clothing, food, or shelter." They have been fleeing to Yangzhou with their children, including people from Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, Yancheng, Taixian, Huaiyin, Funing, Huaian, Suqian, Lianshui, Siyang, and Jiangdu and surrounding districts. The total number of refugees, after three registrations, was 8,357 people in the first registration last December. In the second registration this March, another 8,211 people were added. The third registration was recently conducted, with the number reaching 31,599 people. The total number of people registered in the three instances is 48,167. All these people are gathered in the city of Yangzhou, crying out for food. The exiled county governments and the Sixth and Seventh District Commissioner's Offices have all established offices in Yangzhou. The county magistrates, secretaries of the county party committees, and secretaries of the Youth League are all enthusiastically gathering exiled people from each county in Yangzhou to form post-disaster relief associations to be responsible for registering and investigating the refugees. In addition, people from each county residing in other places have formed native place associations to take charge of the matter. There are a total of twenty-three such relief organizations in Yangzhou. These twenty-three relief units, recognizing that refugees are still sleeping in the open without shelter and urgently need to be accommodated, initiated the establishment of reception centers. A total of nineteen reception centers have been established in empty houses or temples in the city. Recently, another one has been added, bringing the total to twenty. The total number of refugees in the reception centers is 2,730. The refugees living in these places include university graduates, lawyers, and primary and secondary school teachers, all sleeping on the ground without any possessions other than the clothes on their backs, a situation that is extremely miserable and indescribable. When Minister Gu and Chairman Wang inspected the refugee reception centers, they shouted "Our saviors have come," and knelt down to Minister Gu and Chairman Wang with tears in their eyes. If they still had a ray of hope, who would be willing to beg like this? Who gave them this? "The communist army of mob rule"!

Accommodating Youth and Reassuring Refugees

Let's take a look at what's going on with exiled youth and students. There are quite a few exiled young people in Yangzhou. The Youth League has set up four youth reception centers, accommodating more than 800 young people. There are more than 1,500 people who have registered but have not yet been admitted. In addition, there is a continuing education class for exiled students established by the Ministry of Education, which also accommodates 410 students. The funding for the youth reception center was specially provided by Chairman Wang and is currently sustainable. If the government does not find a way to provide funding in the future, it may be difficult to sustain. In addition to attending classes and drills, young people also assist in investigating and registering refugee work. How lovely.

Distributing Emergency Relief and Setting Standards

According to Director Xie, "Disaster relief is like fighting a fire." Sure enough, their work is also in full swing. The original allocation of relief funds for Yangzhou was 100 million yuan, which was decided by the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference to be used for relief projects. After inspecting the situation, Minister Gu and Chairman Wang believed that it was necessary to issue emergency relief and temporarily changed their minds to withdraw a portion of the relief funds to issue emergency relief. The Yangzhou Office has now formulated the following standards for distribution: (1) Elderly people over the age of 60; (2) Infants under the age of one and their mothers; (3) Those who are currently unable to make a living due to illness; (4) Those who are disabled and unable to make a living; (5) Housewives with two or more minor children who are unable to make a living as a result; (6) Unmarried women over the age of fourteen who are unable to work or support themselves; (7) Family members of active servicemen and survivors of anti-Japanese war casualties who are exiled and destitute and hold supporting documents; (8) Pregnant women who are about to give birth and are unable to work; (9) Impoverished children under the age of twelve.

Rapid Registration. More than ten of the twenty-three units have submitted their lists, and distribution will begin as soon as they are checked. The census lists are submitted by the Bao Chiefs, and more than 250 exiled youths are assisting in the work, which can be completed in two days, which is particularly fast. In order to ensure that refugees truly receive practical benefits, separate investigations are still needed. It is estimated that there are a total of 264 Bao in Yangzhou. If more personnel are dispatched, it may be completed within a week. There are also some refugees living with many relatives and friends because they did not report that they were refugees when they reported their household registration. Now, individuals have applied to the office for registration. In order to make up for this shortcoming, the office has sent personnel to conduct a review of the household registration with the county government and inquire in detail.

Improving the Method of Receiving Refugees

Regarding the improvement of the refugee reception centers, the Yangzhou Office has now formulated the following measures: The main points are to repair houses that cannot provide shelter from wind and rain, provide straw mats to those who do not have them, and set up public water tanks and conduct drinking water disinfection. Each reception center has an isolation room and one or two bathtubs depending on the number of people. Budget estimates are currently being prepared separately. Environmental sanitation is also being actively addressed. Liu Yong, a technician from the Health Department, is distributing DDT powder separately. The refugees feel quite comforted under these circumstances. In addition, the Jiangsu Agricultural Bank is actively conducting small loans. According to the report of the manager of the Agricultural Bank at the first joint meeting of the Yangzhou Office, there were 27 households in one day. Although this number is too small, it is because the general refugees are not yet clear about the loan situation, and the office is intensifying publicity. This is an overview of their rescue work, which is also their performance within a short period of ten days. Here, we would like to quote two sentences. Chairman Wang said to the refugees: "The Communist army wants you to be uneasy; I want you to be at ease. The Communist army tells you to have no food; I want you all to have food." What is said above is the "Way to Reassure the People."

Garrison Troops Practice Righteousness by Fasting for One Day

In addition to the government-sponsored relief work in Yangzhou, Garrison Commander Huang Baitao also launched a campaign for all officers and soldiers of the division to fast for one day to distribute emergency relief, giving each large household 1,800 yuan and each small household 900 yuan, and giving each large household 3.5 jin (approximately 4.6 pounds) of rice and each small household 2 jin (approximately 2.6 pounds) of rice. The number of people receiving relief reached 4,800, all of whom were extremely poor and in need of emergency relief. To this day, they are still singing praises of General Huang's kindness. The most fortunate refugees received flour specially issued by General Gu Zhutong.

It seems that there are no problems for the refugees, but unexpectedly, problems continue to arise. In the Eighth and Ninth Districts of Jiangdu County, people have been fleeing to the area near Sutu Temple and Phoenix Bridge in Jiangdu County due to oppression and persecution by the Communist army, with approximately 3,000 to 4,000 people, including county councilors, secondary school teachers, lawyers, and foreign missionaries. After receiving the news, the Yangzhou Office immediately contacted the local government agencies and sent people to rescue them. However, when they arrived at Phoenix Bridge, they only saw hundreds of people because the Communist army saw that most of the people had left their "liberated area" and spread rumors that the government's registration of refugees and such kindness was not well-intentioned and wanted to use the refugees to form a strong army. Under this rumor offensive, the refugees who had fled scattered again. It is heartbreaking! We do not know how these refugees will live a life of pain in the future. We care! We sympathize! We remember……!

### A Hospital Should Be Established Quickly in Fahuazhen

Dear Editor:

I live in Fahuazhen in western Shanghai, where most residents are poor. There have been many cholera cases recently. Today, walking in the town from west to east, I saw lime and ash circles outside of every dozen or so houses, which are clearly signs that someone has died. In the afternoon, several people in the neighboring house also had cholera. They have not received an education, so they are asking scrape-down practitioners for treatment, which will surely lead to mistakes. In previous years, local charitable organizations would come to our town every summer to set up free hospitals, benefiting many poor people. As the epidemic is increasing day by day, it would be best if the health authorities could set up a temporary charitable hospital, which is truly necessary for public safety. (Resident Qin Shang)

### Letter of Correction

Dear Sir: I have read the article "Extra Fees for Primary School Graduation" in the Reader's Opinion section of your newspaper on the 6th, which is inconsistent with the facts. After investigation, it was found that the graduating students of the sixth grade of our school voluntarily initiated a class meeting because graduation was approaching, and each person paid 10,000 yuan to prepare for taking photos and hosting a tea party, which was agreed upon by the class leader and the class teacher. The school believes that it is reasonable for students to take graduation photos and hold farewell parties for commemorative purposes, so it did not interfere. We hereby declare a correction. Sincerely, Peijie Elementary School.

### The Abstract Nature of Music

— Liang Youting

Music is an art form that is intangible and invisible, possessing an elusive abstract quality. Yet, many people, upon hearing a piece of music, invariably ask, "What does it mean?" If this question were posed to a poet or a literary figure, they might craft an answer that is exceptionally beautiful in its deception. However, if asked of someone who truly understands music, they would find it difficult to reply. When Beethoven played the piano, friends would often ask him, "What does this mean?" Beethoven would definitively say, "It means exactly this!"—this is the most honest answer.

Of course, conceptualizing music is a demand of human reason; imbuing rich melodies with rich poetry, and pairing grand poetry with grand melodies and harmonies are all perfectly acceptable. But art, to some extent, possesses "transcendence" and an inexplicable quality; if one insists on making it too realistic, it becomes extremely vulgar. For example, the sounds of a rooster crowing or a dog barking, if depicted realistically using musical instruments, feel unbearably vulgar. If the sounds of chickens and dogs were to be played in an orchestra, one might as well perform ventriloquism—why bother with music? Not long ago, a harmonica band performed in Nanjing, and one of their pieces was a "descriptive music" piece, where the sound of a rooster crowing was created using ventriloquism, resulting in laughter from the audience and completely disrupting the musical atmosphere. Therefore, "descriptive music" is essentially a game, and is not favored by serious musicians. Someone aptly said: "The highest form of art should use the most economical materials and the most suggestive methods to express something inconceivable." I believe this can also be compared to painting! When a painting is rendered too realistically, it often makes people think: why not just take a photograph, instead of painstakingly painting it? (I am not knowledgeable about art, so I don't know if this analogy is accurate).

"Flowers are not flowers, fog is not fog; they come at midnight, and depart at dawn; coming like a brief spring dream, and vanishing like morning clouds, leaving no trace!" This poem by Bai Juyi was set to music in D major by Mr. Huang Zi, and was included as teaching material in the Commercial Press's "Music" textbook. Students who sang it often asked: "Teacher, what does this actually mean?" Then the teacher could only copy Beethoven and answer: "It means exactly this"—this example can also help illustrate the abstract nature of music.

Music can only be understood with emotions; rendering it too realistic makes it feel forced and vulgar.

### Homesickness Through Paintings

— Shi Pei

Guangxi is my hometown. Since fleeing to escape the war, I haven't been back for three years. I think about it all the time: the surviving villages after the calamity and the simple, hardworking, and kind people who have suffered. But in these past few years, from letters from home and letters from fellow villagers, I still cannot clearly understand the situation of my hometown, because their letters often carry some comforting understatement, lightly passing over the tragic destruction and painful disasters, as if comforting a child, telling them not to grieve over what has been lost, but to strive for future reconstruction.

Yesterday, I went to see Mr. Situ Qiao's sketches of disaster conditions. I felt like I had returned to my hometown and taken a walk, personally witnessing the homes reduced to rubble and the people starving and dying.

Guilin, Wuzhou, Liuzhou, Weirong, Yangshuo, Quanzhou—I have been to all these places, and deep memories remain in my mind. I personally watched the construction of the Zhongzheng Bridge on the Li River and the Weirong Bridge, and even chatted with the workers driving the piles. These projects, almost built with the blood and flesh of the people, now lie broken and dismembered before my eyes.

The refugees, the starving people, the fleeing people, fathers and daughters, boat women, and old men in the paintings—I am familiar with them all, as if I have met my own family. The old people have had their life's energy drained by years of labor, yet they have no rest and will never even think of resting, except when death claims their vitality. The young children carry the worries of forty- or fifty-year-old adults in their small hearts, worrying about the family's livelihood. These are common occurrences in our hometown, but when I looked at the painting "Father and Daughter" for a long time, I could not suppress the bitter tears that flowed down silently. They are like my family. I sympathize with and pity them. I cannot bear to see their eyes, already dulled and white from the oppression of heavy disasters. People should not have such expressions and suffer such persecution!

Lijiang Spring Clarity, Yangshuo Painted Mountains, Yangshuo Rain, and Early Spring Misty Rain Crossing the Flower Bridge—these are places where I used to linger. On the banks of the Li River, watching the drizzling rain fall on the river scenery, if it were a clear spring day, the undulating low mountains would resemble the strange backs of animals, remotely lying in the rain-covered peaks, the mountains draped with strips of white clouds condensed with moisture. These scenes can be fully enjoyed simply by standing on the Zhongzheng Bridge. The Flower Bridge, Seven Star Cave, Crescent Mountain... on the opposite bank of the city, have now become ruined waters and broken mountains in the painter's brush! Mr. Situ Qiao wrote on his painting Early Spring Misty Rain Crossing the Flower Bridge, that he was unable to fully capture the essence. Mr. Situ Qiao, in order to leave an unforgettable memory and lesson of the disaster for the people forever, naturally could not leisurely engage in "xieyi" (freehand) painting like other painters. His brush was dipped in tears. Today, even if there are places where "the beautiful rivers and mountains remain intact," they carry a desolate and tragic color!

Rebuilding Wuzhou, Bombed and Rebuilt—these paintings are some messages of rebirth that the painter has reported to his hometown through a painful brush. However, in the current chaotic situation, these weak new forces should be given greater assistance. Otherwise, it will be like "patching a thatched hut," and how much practical benefit will the people receive?

Homesickness through paintings—this kind of emotion is a boundless and sour taste, like the song written by Mr. Situ Qiao's wife, Yi Mei, about the boat woman: "Clear shakes the moon, rain shakes the wind, day shakes sorrow, night shakes dreams, cannot shake off hunger and cold, cannot shake off poverty, rice prices are painfully high, taxes are painfully heavy!" The strand of homesickness that arises is like an oar, constantly shaking, shaking. I wonder when it will be quiet?

As I was about to walk out of the exhibition hall, I turned back to look at the oil painting "Put Down Your Whip," seeing the Fengyang girl, her tears rolling down. Thinking that I was originally also a singer of "Fengyang Drums," shivering, I turned around and hurried downstairs.

On the way back, I was thinking about the last painting in the Refugee Pictures, the disabled old man lying down, who said well, looking at his seven or eight children and grandchildren lying on the ground: "We have suffered, and that's that, but we should not let this group of future masters of the country suffer for another generation!" These are painful words, and also the last words I want to say in my homesick heart.

Serial Novel

### Staying Together as a Pair, Chapter Eighty-Six

— Zhao Qingge

After Lihua recovered, she immediately wanted to leave Xuzhou, and with the war spreading towards Xuzhou, Zhang Xian also made plans to move further south. But in order to scrape together some travel expenses, Zhang Xian asked Lihua to sing three more farewell commemorative performances. Lihua refused, driving Zhang Xian to almost kowtow to her. In the end, Lihua had no choice but to sing for three more days.

Next, Lihua wandered to Kaifeng. This time, Lihua declared to Mrs. Mo in advance: besides singing, she would not socialize. Mrs. Mo, learning from her last experience in Xuzhou, was unwilling to force Lihua again. All interpersonal matters were handled by Zhang Xian alone. The local customs in Kaifeng had the solemnity and righteousness of Beijing, and were relatively simple and honest. Therefore, they soon settled down.

In Kaifeng, Lihua's mood was very calm; she was able to continue reading and quietly live her own life. She quickly became accustomed to this new environment, and she quite liked this simple ancient city. She lived on Huang Da Wang Temple Gate Street in the north of the city, only a stone's throw from Huang Da Wang Temple. Inside Huang Da Wang Temple was now a private girls' middle school. This aroused Lihua's strong interest. Every day she saw groups of female students coming out of the school in groups of three or five, carrying their schoolbags and chatting happily, which made her extremely envious! She often thought: if she could be with these girls; if she could go to this school to study every day, oh God! How happy would she be! She regarded these female students as the favored children of heaven; as the high and mighty, red and bright stars!

Because Lihua admired the girls' school so much, she constantly took Liyun with her during the students' class time, sneaking in and hiding under the window outside a classroom, eavesdropping on the lectures inside. Liyun became impatient and slipped away to play on her own. The school's sports field became the place she was most interested in. As soon as the students were dismissed from class, Lihua quickly went out with Liyun. Later, she not only eavesdropped, but also took a small notebook to secretly record what was being taught. From this, she gained a lot of new knowledge.

It bound the younger brother's limbs, body, and soul tightly, tightly, until his death.

(4)

Those who seek love do not get it, and those who get love will be bound by it!...

### Investigation (Fiction)

— Cheng Fu

I don't know when it started, but people no longer called Old Yao "Old Man," but instead called him "Lord Yao." Old Yao himself couldn't quite understand whether people were respecting him or looking down on him. However, according to what he told others, based on his recent appointment as the director of the third branch of the Salt Affairs Bureau in this county, people calling him "Lord Yao" was entirely a way of expressing their utmost respect for him, and he speculated that this title even contained a bit of flattery. Therefore, Old Yao was very proud. Whenever he met old colleagues from his days in education, he would invariably say:

"Friends calling me Lord Yao is truly undeserved, but managing salt affairs is something I did over a decade ago. Teaching was just something I did when I had no other choice. Teaching was indeed a hard life, neither filling your stomach nor letting you starve. Old Yao has experienced that for a few years... Luckily, I've finally escaped and am now managing salt affairs... This time, I have to do a good job. In short, Old Yao doesn't want money, so I'm not afraid of not doing well. I'll eventually show you all something..."

Old Yao was indeed quite loyal to his old friends. For example, he helped promote two colleagues from the education field who were always on good terms with him, arranging positions for them in his office. One was appointed as a secretary, and the other as the chief inspector.

"Who else should I use but my own old friends?" Old Yao would often say with great seriousness to a group of friends he had called in, "But doing this job in public service, it's not difficult, but really very difficult. It's difficult, but really not that difficult. I did it for six or seven years before, and I only ended up as a clerk, so I didn't make much money. But that's because I didn't want money! If you want to be upright, don't earn dirty money. That's what I like to do. Like those money-grubbing guys who specialize in smuggling, making a little money and then bribing their superiors to get promoted. So, they always get promoted. But even if they become directors, so what? How ugly! I'm someone who's honest and upright, always handling public affairs cleanly... Until now, I'm still penniless, but I've still managed to become a director. And I'm not bragging, but my position as director was offered to me by my old superior because he knew that Old Yao doesn't want money and handles public affairs cleanly..."

Only Old Yao himself knew whether he handled public affairs as cleanly as he claimed. But it was a fact that his life had gradually become more prosperous since he became a director. Just look at his residence; he had moved from a low and humble bungalow to a magnificent mansion. As for clothing, he had switched from old and unsightly cloth gowns to brand-new woolen garments. As for transportation, he had a chartered car at his disposal, and he even hired a nanny for his home. Naturally, people saw that Old Yao's life had become so prosperous, and they could somewhat figure him out. But whenever Old Yao met friends or acquaintances, he would obediently make up a few sentences:

"Managing salt affairs is quite difficult. There's no funding, no housing. Recently, the bureau finally took over a house, and I was able to temporarily borrow it to live in. But it's too far from the office, so I asked someone to borrow an old car for me to get around. In short, it's all for public use. We people who work in public service must do everything 'for the public'... In short, Old Yao doesn't want money, handles public affairs cleanly, is honest and upright, and is afraid of no one?"

Old Yao was indeed afraid of no one. He felt that he didn't need to be afraid of anyone. With his old experience and old tricks, he could keep doing what he was doing without anyone knowing or noticing. Who would he be afraid of?

Day after day passed, and Old Yao continued to do what he was doing...

Before long, things went wrong. There was a record of this in the newspaper:

"Yesterday, the county police received a tip and seized a large amount of smuggled salt at the port, and apprehended several smugglers. It is said that this case is significantly related to the third branch of the Salt Affairs Bureau in XX district of this county."

The case was exposed, and things had blown up. The office staff told Old Yao the news. Old Yao was shocked, but after all, he was an old fox. He put on a practiced look of calm:

"Old Yao would never engage in smuggling. Such rumors are inevitable. Managing salt affairs is just difficult... Fortunately, Old Yao doesn't want money, handles public affairs cleanly, is honest and upright, and is afraid of no one?"

Two days later, the county police station sent two policemen with an official letter and a subpoena to find Old Yao. The official letter said:

"...We hope that your bureau will assist in the investigation of this case... Yao XX, the director of the third branch, is bold and reckless and should be strictly investigated..."

Old Yao was shocked to see the official letter from the general bureau, but he still couldn't help but pretend to be nonchalant, humming to himself, "Old Yao would never engage in smuggling. I'll go if I have to. Anyway, Old Yao doesn't want money, handles public affairs cleanly, is honest and upright, and is afraid of no one..."

Women and Health

### How to Keep My Child Healthy

— By Yan Fang

I am a mother of three children. I breastfed all of my children myself, and even with all the care, money, energy, and time I spent, they still inevitably got sick sometimes. However, in terms of development, they seem to have reached the standard level. I will share my nine years of experience with mothers who care about their children:

(1) From birth to ten years old, it is difficult for a child to avoid illness, but the diseases vary in each period—

A. Breastfed infants are less likely to get sick within six months because they have less contact with the outside world and spend their days eating and sleeping. Therefore, most babies are chubby before weaning. However, once weaned, they gradually become thinner and show signs of weakness. Colds, coughs, and pneumonia are more likely to occur. Inflammation of the lymph nodes is also most common shortly after weaning. To prevent this, pay attention to the baby's diet and hygiene after six months. In addition to milk, various foods must be added, such as vegetables and eggs, to accustom their stomachs to various foods. A new food can be added every month or every half month, and it must be nutritious and easily digestible. Start with very small portions and gradually increase them. Then, once weaned, their bodies will not be affected and they can maintain the chubbiness and health they had when breastfeeding.

B. One to three years old is the most annoying and troublesome time. They are prone to eating bad things, catching a cold, getting a cold, swallowing dangerous items by mistake, and falling from tables and cabinets. During this period, pay attention to digestion and nutrition in their food. They should not go out or enter public places on weekdays (except parks). If no one can watch them at all times, at least provide them with a safe environment, such as using wooden fences or tables and chairs to surround them, allowing them to crawl, play, walk, and jump on the ground.

C. From three to five years old, they gradually become sensible and can play with wooden cars, etc. alone. Absolutely do not allow them to eat things they cannot eat. Many habits are already obvious during this period, so you must pay close attention to their actions. Sometimes, a little punishment can be quite effective. A healthy child can control their clothing and actions during this period. If you pay special attention to their diet and be careful about the temperature, they will not easily get sick.

D. From five to ten years old, they spend most of their time at school. During this time, they have more contact with the outside world and are more likely to contract various diseases. Therefore, seasonal vaccinations and cowpox, etc., must not be neglected or delayed.

(2) Things to pay attention to every day—

A. Are bowel movements normal? Children must have regular bowel movements every day and urinate frequently. If the stool is white and abnormal, it must be indigestion. The easiest way is to reduce their food intake and drink more boiled water. If there are suspicious sticky substances, they may have diarrhea and must be treated by a doctor.

B. Sudden irritability, anxiety, or restless sleep—Children are naturally lively and happy. If there are occasional abnormalities, it must be physical discomfort. At this time, measure their temperature, check whether their throat is red and swollen, and whether their tongue coating is normal. If it is due to indigestion, give them some laxatives to clear their bowels. If it is not effective, consult a doctor.

C. Sudden loss of appetite—Do not force children to eat if they do not want food. First, change the type of food. If they still do not want to eat, leave them alone. Sometimes, older children may have a poor appetite due to too much work and mental stress. If they have normal bowel movements every day, it does not matter if they eat less. As long as the food is nutritious and clean, it will naturally be beneficial.

D. Large appetite but skin and bones—This phenomenon is because all the food they eat has no nutritional value and is only for their teeth and stomach to work on. There are parasites in the intestines, and stool must be examined. After the worms are expelled, they can gradually become healthy.

(3) Give children the best treatment—

A. Food

(1) Emphasize quality over quantity. Absolutely do not eat useless food.

(2) Eat food at regular times. Absolutely do not eat snacks.

(3) Drink more boiled water.

(4) Eat more fruits. Although Chinese people now know that fruits are rich in vitamins, they often neglect cleanliness, which leads to various gastrointestinal diseases. This is because there are many bacteria on the fruit peel, which can easily be carried into the fruit, especially bananas. Therefore, fruits must first be washed with potassium permanganate or at least soaked in boiled water before peeling and eating.

B. Sleep—Sleep is as important as food.

(1) Children under five years old must have one or two hours of sleep in the afternoon in addition to sleeping at night.

(2) Do not take children out for social events or play at night, as this will make them too excited and prevent them from sleeping peacefully.

(3) Bedding should be comfortable, and mosquitoes and bedbugs should be avoided in summer.

(4) Do not eat food before going to bed, and do not eat too much for dinner.

C. Environment—In addition to going to school and visiting parks, allow the child to have opportunities to play at home as much as possible. Give them plenty of toys, good companions, and simple sports equipment so that children can spend their time, not think about snacks, and not wander around the neighborhood. Older children can go out as small guests or be small hosts at home. Children over five years old can read various stories, which is also a way to guide them in the right direction.

D. Cooperation from family members—Elders in traditional Chinese families like to feed children, no matter the time or what it is. As soon as they see a child, they want to feed them and make them eat non-stop. Even some more modern people cannot avoid this problem, which is very unfavorable for children. This is because children's stomachs have very small capacities. Filling them with food at times other than meal times makes them lose their appetite for regular meals, which deprives them of a nutritious meal. My child can finish half a pound of fresh milk at once when hungry, but after eating two biscuits, they cannot eat lunch. Therefore, family members must cooperate. If possible, a person with some medical knowledge should lead the child and pay attention to all aspects of the child's life every day.

E. Medical advisor—Since children inevitably get sick, it is best to designate an experienced doctor to treat them. A doctor who is used to seeing your child will have records of your child, know their constitution, and their medical history. Moreover, in case of an emergency, they will not be at a loss. Because there are many kinds of infectious diseases that children inevitably contract:

(1) Measles—Although this disease is not dangerous, it has complications. The doctor can give your child a blood transfusion so that they do not have difficulty getting measles. After the measles have come out, you can take medicine to prevent pneumonia, etc.

(2) Diphtheria—Diphtheria vaccination can be given.

(3) Cowpox and vaccinations—We Chinese people now believe in this and are willing to get injections.

(4) Whooping cough—In the past, it was thought that whooping cough had to cough for a hundred days to heal, but now there are ways to prevent it. When whooping cough is prevalent, vaccinations can be given. After the disease has been contracted, seek medical treatment while paying attention to the child's nutrition to replenish the calories lost from coughing.

(5) Dangerous diseases such as meningitis and scarlet fever—When these diseases are prevalent, absolutely do not enter public places. If a neighbor has this disease, they must be sent to an isolation hospital to prevent the spread of infection.

The above points are all that ordinary and middle-class families can afford to do. However, this is by no means a one-day effort. Mothers should treat raising children as a job, as important as fathers going to the office every day. If children have a fixed time for work, play, rest, sleep, and diet, they will not only be healthy, but it will also affect their future lifestyle. If children grow up in a confused way, living with illness and prolonging life, it will be too late to have a healthy body, and it cannot be remedied by taking a few vitamin pills.

### Tomatoes

— By Mu Yan

Now is the season for tomatoes.

Tomatoes are also known as 西紅柿 (xī hóng shì, "Western red persimmons"). In fact, it would be more appropriate to call it a "persimmon" than an "eggplant" because it resembles a persimmon in shape, content, and color, but not an eggplant. However, the name "tomato" has been used for so long that I will also use this common name.

It originated in the Americas and was introduced to Europe in the 16th century. At that time, Italians called it "golden apple," and the British and French called it "love apple." As the name suggests, you can imagine how pleasing its beautiful form was.

Its flesh is thick and juicy, containing various vitamins necessary for the human body, of which vitamin A is the richest, followed by B, and C is also abundant. In addition, it also contains minerals such as iron, phosphorus, and calcium, making it an all-around nutritious food.

Eating it raw, although not as sweet as persimmons, has its own flavor once you get used to it. If you soak it in boiled water, peel off the skin, and dip it in sugar, the taste is even better. Boiling it into soup makes it very delicious.

In short, it is a delicious and highly nutritious fruit that is worth eating regularly.

### Women are "People"

— By Yan

According to a report, a businessman from Wenzhou named Lin Zhenting married eight or nine years ago and had two daughters. Using the excuse of not having a son, he took another concubine. Later, the concubine also gave birth to a daughter. Lin was angry that she did not give birth to a son and forced her to leave. Then he married a woman named Yu Xiu as a concubine. Who knew that she gave birth to two daughters in five years, without a single son. Lin was usually moody, and his wives and concubines were often abused. Recently, Yu Xiu, having found someone else she liked, filed for divorce. Lin was reluctant to let her go and begged Yu Xiu to remain as husband and wife, and said that he would accept any other conditions. But Yu Xiu was determined and unmoved, laughing at her husband's cries. As a result, the marriage contract was terminated by others, and Yu Xiu went away with her new love.

Being abandoned by a concubine after abandoning a concubine, to say it in a superstitious way, is karma. But we know that this is because times have progressed, and women have realized that they are "people," not reproductive machines.

### The Harmful Effects of DDT

— By Ru Shui

Since its introduction, DDT has been very popular and has made immortal contributions to agriculture. However, after repeated research by scientists, it is known that while it is extremely effective in killing pests, it also affects other organisms, especially when it is put into water to kill mosquito larvae, it threatens the survival of fish. If DDT is sprinkled in fish ponds, the yield of fish will be greatly reduced.

According to the example of big fish eating small fish, what do small fish eat? People who study fish tell us that small fish eat microorganisms. These things, although pitifully small, are the best food for small fish. With small fish, big fish will naturally not starve to death. If these small things all die, small fish will be difficult to survive, and big fish will not be able to be raised.

Professor Anderson of the United States recently conducted an experiment to prove that this is true. He gathered water fleas, which are so small that they are not easily noticed by the human eye, and dropped a small amount of DDT. Within thirty-two hours, more than half of these small things became rigid. He said that in DDT with a concentration between one part per billion and one hundred, microorganisms can become rigid in sixteen to thirty-two hours. If the concentration is less than one part per billion, they can still survive. He took the water of Lake Erie as an example. In some places, their lifespan can be extended to one hundred and thirty hours.

Therefore, when trying to kill mosquito larvae in water, we must consider the lives of fish in some places!

### Water

— By Shao Fu

This summer, I don't know why, floods are happening everywhere. Besides the breaches at Huayuankou and Hongze Lake, which are Communist "virtuous policies" engraved in the hearts of the people, the water level in Hankou has reached more than 25 meters, and the situation is critical. The water level of the Yellow River in Suixi is rising, and the canals are breached. Hangzhou streets are flooded like canals, and the water of West Lake is only a foot away from the shore. On the Fuchun River, you can see timber, houses, and furniture washed down. The floods in Suzhou are severe, and the ten-mile embankment from Fengqiao to Huguan has been washed away, and the land next to the embankment is a vast expanse of water. The water level of Taihu Lake has risen sharply, and the tragic scene of the great flood of 1931 is about to be repeated. In Shanghai, after the heavy rain, the area around Pubushi Road was submerged in water for many days, and even the middle section of Linsen Road was flooded. Many citizens have benefited from it.

The causes of floods are generally no more than three: flash floods, dilapidated embankments, and problems with drainage ditches and sewers, or their complete lack.

China is a country that relies on the weather to eat, but human will can conquer nature, and it is not a dream. If the embankments are strong and there are no breaches (of course, the most ideal method of water control should be "opening the flow" rather than "preventing the flow," but it is probably not possible to talk about it at present), and there are canals for drainage and channels for sewers, then even if there are flash floods, the water will return to the sea, so why would it flood? Flash floods are not as bad as breaking dikes, and other countries have them too.

Repairing dikes and channels is urgent and cannot be delayed. In the autumn of 1931, it can be said that we were too busy with the Northeast to take care of it. This year is already the second year after the victory.

### Military Officers Dismount · Civil Servants Park

— By Lu Jun

Random notes from the "Capital Hostel" in Nanjing

People who are used to living in Sichuan have a kind of apprehensive feeling about the small inns in small counties where they "seek lodging before it's late" and "look at the sky early when the rooster crows." Some small inns still use the old-fashioned large beds, printed blue cloth tents, and straw mattresses all year round. There are so many bedbugs and fleas that it is impossible to count them, making people unable to close their eyes all night. And they still hang red lanterns at the door that say "Scholars park, dignitaries dismount", which really makes people not dare to accept!

Before the government returned to the capital, there was a serious housing shortage in Nanjing. Many hotels had not yet resumed business. So, Mayor Ma Chaojun initiated the establishment of a "Capital Hostel." On the opening day, Mayor Ma himself went to preside over it.

This hostel is the same as ordinary hotels, and it also charges fees, but it charges less. The procedure for accommodation is to submit a business trip certificate or an organization service certificate, so businessmen are not entertained. The location of the hostel is very suitable, in Gongyuan Street in Confucius Temple. There are a total of fifty rooms. In the past, this was a Japanese cafe, which was quite large. The hostel used part of the rooms and the entire upper floor, and rented the bottom floor to a Jingu Restaurant to open a dance hall. The income was not bad, but unfortunately dancing is now "prohibited" in Nanjing. Jingu is about to close. The hostel is advertising for bids to rent it out again, and because summer has arrived, the cafe business is booming, even the open space along the Qinhuai River behind and the large living room upstairs are all rented out. But the first bidding had no result, and it is being re-bid.

Because this place does not entertain non-"public education personnel", some people who want to live there can only sigh at the "place". Those high officials who have just flown in from various places are entertained here. Zhu Ping, the director of the Shanghai Land Administration Bureau, lived here for half a month, and the chief of staff of the ×× army also lived here for a long time. It is really "military officers dismount, civil servants park". However, they have a regulation that after living for ten days, if they want to continue living, they have to add 40% to the price, and more than 20 days to add 60%, to show restrictions, saying that they do not welcome long-term accommodation!

The equipment inside, except that the 万象癥 downstairs has been changed from a dance floor to a singing hall, there is a billiard room upstairs and a sales department. The District Office of the Third District of Nanjing City is also located here.

Because the hostel is "officially" operated, it is exempt from taxes. They have a board of directors, and the heads of the party, government, military, and organizations are all directors. Below them is a general manager. The organization looks like an official yamen, and it does not look like a hotel at all.

### Housing Shortage in Nanjing: The Problem is Not Scarcity but Inequality

— By Lu Jin

The newspapers are printed daily with the headline in special bold type: Nanjing is suffering from a housing shortage! Government officials often give speeches: Nanjing is suffering from a housing shortage! Small civil servants who have returned to the capital shout themselves hoarse: Nanjing is suffering from a housing shortage! So, it seems very important, Nanjing really seems to be suffering from a housing shortage. Actually, no!

Why is there not enough housing in Nanjing at present? Why can't many people find housing? To put it simply and clearly: the distribution is unreasonable and unequal!

The government has completely returned to the capital. With so many institutions and yamen, so many people, big and small, plus so many wives and young masters, housing has become a serious problem. But, if you have a way, you have connections, you can still solve the housing problem. Now the large and small schools and enemy-puppet properties in Nanjing are all occupied by military units. A guard stands at the door, but in fact, the inside is empty. The former Ministry of Railways, now the large building of the Executive Yuan, is empty everywhere. An old master of ×× lives in a foreign house, and a servant also lives in a room. The wife and young master naturally have to live in three or five rooms. The puppet military school on Huangpu Road has empty houses and cannot do anything about it. It is even haunted every day. Many, many Japanese shops still have seals on them, and the inside has become a world of garbage and mice. ... With so many unreasonable things, you say: how can Nanjing not suffer from a housing shortage? Where can those small civil servants go to find houses?

Nanjing only received fifty of the mobile homes shipped from the United States. Now not only have they not been installed, but some of the materials have disappeared without a trace. Ordinary people can only sigh at the houses. There are many large and small hotels, but several thousand yuan a day is not affordable for ordinary people.

In fact, solving the housing shortage in Nanjing is very simple. I have three brilliant plans: The first is to rationally distribute the illegally occupied houses and the unsealed houses. The second is to use the empty land in Nanjing to build simple civilian houses. Nanjing has plenty of empty land. Zhongshan East Road is now being carried out. The third: it sounds relatively empty, but it is not difficult to implement. That is to requisition those unnecessary dance halls and teahouses and turn them into temporary apartments to solve the housing shortage problem for civil servants who have returned to the capital. If this is really the case, will Nanjing still suffer from a housing shortage?

— By Ying Xiang

South of the racecourse, in front of the Xipushan Villa of the Chinese Brain Hospital, the stench of corpses fills the air, and pedestrians cover their noses. This stupid person passed by twice in half a month and suffered from the foul smell, which caused discomfort. At this time when the epidemic is rampant, I sincerely hope that the authorities will pay attention!

### Indian Hands

— By Luo Ting

Indians have interesting hands. When eating, Orientals use chopsticks and Westerners use knives and forks, but Indians, like the Xinjiang people when eating "grabbed rice," use a pair of primitive hands. They grab the rice with one hand, twist it a few times with the other hand, and put it in their mouths. But these hands are not only useful when eating, but also play a great role when defecating. That is, they use their hands instead of toilet paper after defecating. After finishing their work, they wash themselves in the 簞 (dān, a kind of bamboo container) that they often carry with water. The 簞 is small and not carried in the hand when going out, but carried on the head. Sometimes we can see it in movies. But when they are thirsty, they use the water in the 簞 as a drink. This must be very strange to us, but it is a habit for them.

### Dull Theater Scene in the Capital

— By Wei Cheng

Tang Huaiqiu, the veteran of the China Travel Troupe, was truly a prominent figure in the theater world some years ago. Who didn't know him, who didn't know him? Unfortunately, he is now outdated and has to hide with his incomplete troupe in a small theater in the corner of the Confucius Temple in Nanjing, "Flying Dragon Pavilion", which can only accommodate 800 people, to make a living.

Now at the entrance of the Flying Dragon Pavilion, in addition to the name of the play being performed, Tang Huaiqiu's name is also very noticeable. Their directors are Sun Lu and Tang Qi, etc., and the main actors are Tang Ruoqing and Lin Na, and the box office is not bad. This time, the Nanjing People's Daily launched the Nanjing Twelve Celebrities election, and Tang Ruoqing was also selected.

Some of the plays being staged were written by Old Guan Tang himself. He still cannot get rid of the past "business experience" style, especially the performance of "one-act plays", which is completely the same as the style of the "Traveling Magic Troupe" ten years ago, making people laugh! Recently, the style has changed slightly. They are staging Cao Yu's famous works "Wilderness" and "Thunderstorm", etc. The tickets are 1,600 yuan each, and the business is not bad. However, their expenses are very large. It is not easy to eat. They need money to rent the venue, and the actors also need pocket money!

Everything is suffering from a recession this year, and our drama world is naturally no exception. The life of a drama actor is truly worlds apart compared to the life of a Peking opera actress, which is something that everyone is deeply dissatisfied with. The China Travel Troupe is also like this!

The China Travel Troupe is the only one performing drama in Nanjing. Therefore, strictly speaking, the results of their performances are not very good. This is called a unique business. No one competes with them, so naturally they are sloppy and perfunctory. The directing skills of several plays are considered successful, but due to the crude scenery, this defect cannot be compensated. If this were in Shanghai, there is no doubt that the China Travel Troupe would be defeated!

The China Travel Troupe in Nanjing is not considered to be very sensational, nor is it considered to have achieved anything. It is just ordinary and makes a living! Therefore, many people believe that this is the decline of the Nanjing drama world, and it is also the time when the China Travel Troupe is at the end of its rope! Judging from the past history of the China Travel Troupe, this is very regrettable!

### Voice of the Capital

—Musical Activities in Nanjing

Music and drama are both quite subdued in Nanjing; however, comparatively speaking, the atmosphere of music is slightly better.

During the period of the occupation, the puppet regime once presided over a "Capital Harmony Singing Troupe," which was a "meritorious achievement" of the puppet mayor Zhou Xuechang. After the victory, the piano of the "Harmony Singing Troupe" was taken over by the Youth League, but a new singing troupe was not organized for a while, nor was it easy to organize.

Small-scale "musical soirees," "musical tea parties," and lackluster concerts were held five or six times after the victory, but due to various difficulties and the relatively sluggish atmosphere in Nanjing, they did not attract social attention. On the contrary, ballroom "music" and popular tunes seemed particularly popular. On the streets of Shanghai, one could not hear such lively singing as in the areas of Xin Jie Kou and Taiping Road in Nanjing.

However, after the return of the capital, the musical atmosphere in the capital gradually changed. Although the Zhi Zhi Society's orchestra is still in its infancy, it has a great effect in advocating pure music in Nanjing. There are frequent performances recently, and the location of the Zhi Zhi Society is indeed not bad, and entering it is refreshing.

The most influential event in Nanjing's music scene was the recital given by female vocalist Guan Yixuan at the Zhi Zhi Society on June 18. The results were truly amazing. In particular, the several Chinese songs she selected were very pleasing, both catering to the taste and not being vulgar. "Man Jiang Hong," "I Live at the Head of the Yangtze River," "The Drinking Song from La Traviata," and "Homesick Song" all won great interest from the audience. In particular, "Man Jiang Hong" and "The Drinking Song from La Traviata" were both encored.

In addition, Wu Zhengqian recently performed once in Beijing in collaboration with double bassist Ji Hanwen.

The Music and Drama Section of the Zhi Zhi Society is working hard to promote musical activities in the capital, and I think it will definitely sweep away the dullness of the capital.

In terms of national music, the Datong Music Society has also begun to resume its activities in Beijing, and the "Chinese Orchestra" of the Central Broadcasting Station is also recovering. These are all good news for the capital's music scene.

This is a brief overview of the dynamics of the capital's music scene before I left Beijing (at the end of June).

### Letters to My Deceased Wife, Feng Ming (8)

— Zhou Shoujuan

Although you had a tendency to believe in Christianity while you were ill, you were never baptized and cannot be considered a Christian; on the other hand, you do not believe in Buddhism, nor do you believe in monks or Taoists. Therefore, it can be said that you had no religious beliefs in your life. However, Bao Mei and the others thought that following social customs, the embellishment of monks and Taoists was indispensable, so they invited three Taoists from the nearby Guandi Temple to guide you on your way, so that your newly departed soul would not get lost; that evening, they also invited five monks from the Guanyin Hall to perform Buddhist rites of remembrance, and the sound of bells, cymbals, and chanting continued until dawn. I placed all the red roses and white tuberoses that were offered in the bottle on your body. You originally loved these flowers very much, but alas, at this moment you are unconscious and insensitive, how can you appreciate their color and fragrance again!

The next morning, Zou Jinglao received the tragic news and hurried over. He accompanied Zheng Er to purchase the coffin, bedding, lotus flower hat, Guanyin bib, and other items. Because I was completely ignorant of these matters, I entrusted everything to the old gentleman. According to the Taoist priest, this day was a "day of double bereavement" and was not suitable for encoffining, so the body had to be kept at home. By evening, the three daughters, Mei, Xing, and Ying, had received the urgent telegram from the previous night and had all rushed back from Shanghai to attend the funeral. Because they had not seen you to the end, they knelt in front of your bed and cried with particular sadness. At this time, all six children had arrived at your side. If you knew in death, you should be able to rest in peace, right? After nightfall, five nuns were invited again to perform another Buddhist rite of remembrance; I was so exhausted in body and mind that I could no longer support myself and went to sleep in the Mei house.

It was said that the third day was another "day of double bereavement," and according to custom, encoffining was still not allowed, but it was okay if a mud Buddha was secretly placed in the coffin with its back to people; we decided to do as such. At seven o'clock in the morning, Bao Mei combed your hair and dressed you in newly made spun silk clothing. Then the undertakers from the Shouxing Bridge Renji Funeral Home came to take your remains away. Alas, Feng! From then on, you will never return to this home full of flowers and trees that you loved so much during your lifetime! In Suzhou, I don't have a single relative, I am truly "without relatives to look to," and even the number of friends is very few, less than twenty people in total; although I posted a funeral announcement in the Ming Bao newspaper, everyone may not pay attention. Fortunately, Zou Jinglao pulled in a few enthusiastic friends for me; at eleven o'clock, your younger brother Hongxin, nephew Yucheng, son-in-law of Mei, Jingren, and son-in-law of Xing, Junqing, arrived from Shanghai together, finally there were relatives and friends. The funeral ceremony was held at two o'clock in the afternoon. When my six children and I watched you lying in the coffin, we couldn't help but wail and weep, and we were so grieved that we wanted to die. Especially me, who had depended on you for twenty-nine years, my heart was broken, my intestines were severed, and I wished I could sleep with you forever!
