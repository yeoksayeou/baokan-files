Premier Song Ziwen attended and delivered a political report. 254 Political Council members were present. Ms. Wu Yifang, a member of the presidium, attended the general meeting for the first time today. On the benches for officials from the Executive Yuan and ministries, yesterday there were only two or three people, but today there was a sudden increase: Vice Premier Weng Wenhao, Secretary-General Jiang Menglin, Zhang Guangsheng, Chen Cheng, Chen Lifu, Yu Hongjun, Zhu Jiahua, Xu Kan, Gu Zhenggang, Wu Guozhen, Yu Feipeng and other ministers, as well as Supervisor Miao Peicheng. Upon deliberation, Chairman Wang Yunwu presided. Premier Song reported on the Executive Yuan's administration, lasting half an hour.

Finally, Premier Song gave a 15-minute oral reply and stated that the remaining questions would be answered in writing later. Today's meeting was adjourned at 1 PM because the inquiry time was too long, preventing the temporary motions of Political Council members such as Zhao Heting and the scheduled report on post-disaster relief from being presented.

### Separate Review of Reception Issues: Proposal Passed by Sixty Political Council Members

The fourth session was held in the afternoon. The agenda was a military report by Minister of Military Affairs Chen Cheng. 154 Political Council members were present, along with Secretary-General Shao Lizi and Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen. Chairman Mo Dehui presided over the meeting. After announcing the opening of the meeting, Minister Chen attended and delivered the military report. Chen provided a concise and clear explanation of military policies, military demobilization, troop reorganization and construction, and military life. He took responsibility, stating that the fundamental solution for troop reorganization has now begun to be implemented and that the goal of ninety divisions can definitely be achieved within the year. Chen's attitude was humble during the report, expressing that there were many shortcomings in the military and hoping that the Political Council members would provide guidance at any time. After the speech, the Political Council members raised 39 written and oral inquiries, the fewest inquiries in the four sessions. The inquiries mostly concerned issues such as military organizational problems, grain purchases for the military, and malpractices in military reception. After the inquiries, Minister Chen provided a brief response and promised to answer the rest in writing later. Finally, Liu Shumo, Zhao Heqing, and sixty other Political Council members, in a temporary motion, proposed that a separate review meeting be held during the conference period to discuss reception issues and requested the Premier of the Executive Yuan and various ministers to attend and answer relevant questions. The motion was passed, and the presidium was to formulate the review measures. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.

### Zaozhuang Coal Mine Resumes Production: Agreement Organization Mining Power Committee Established

Agreements have been reached between the government and the Chinese Communists regarding related issues such as transportation, currency system, and exchange of goods. The Executive Headquarters has also issued an order instructing the mine to resume production as soon as possible. It is reported that the newly formed Mine Affairs Management Committee is entirely composed of government representative Duan Zhijing, Chinese Communist representative Song Keqiang, and mine representative Krikorder (German nationality), with US representative Lieutenant Colonel Edward assisting in the matter.

Executive Group Arrives in Guangdong for Inspection

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 22nd] The 8th Group of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, government representative Major Huang Shenqin, US military representative Colonel Miller, Communist army representative Major General Fang Fang, and four others arrived here from Shanghai on January 25. They inspected the Dongjiang area and did not find any Communist troops in the area. National troops are stationed in Huizhou, but there are no combat activities. There are only some scattered bandits in the area. The so-called Dongjiang Column is actually a motley crew of bandits. According to five former Japanese prisoners of war who escaped from the Guojiang Column, including Okutsugu, the column contains escaped Japanese prisoners of war, Taiwanese, Koreans, and many women and children. The bandit leader is a woman named Lin Zhan, who lives by robbery and sets up armed checkpoints at various ferries and road intersections, forcibly collecting donations and taxes. Anyone who disobeys is shot. They did not want to join the organization, so they escaped. The General Headquarters sent a memorandum to the 8th Group yesterday, the 21st, for reference.

### French Consulate in Guangzhou Agrees to Hand Over War Criminals: General Headquarters Issues Summons for Interrogation Yesterday

Several Japanese War Criminals Arrested

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 22nd] Simon, the former Vichy French consul in Guangdong who was listed as a war criminal, had been monitored by our side. The current French consul, Wei Ying, had repeatedly refused to hand him over for interrogation by our side. Now, under the insistence of General Headquarters Director Zhang Fakui, the French government has agreed to hand over the criminal for interrogation. The General Headquarters will issue a summons for Simon to be interrogated today, the 22nd. Tang Yanguang, director of the War Criminal Investigation Group of the General Headquarters, and relevant personnel will study the evidence of the criminal's crimes in detail before sending it to the military court for trial. In addition, Lieutenant Colonel Sawada Sakae, the former director of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Macau, has recently been arrested. The criminal killed hundreds of our compatriots and endangered the entire Macau area for several years. Knowing that his crimes were heinous, he disguised himself and fled to Guangdong, hiding in the headquarters of the Japanese 23rd Army, attempting to be sent back to his country with the Japanese prisoners of war. No one knew for months until the chief of staff of the Japanese army inadvertently revealed it. The General Headquarters received the news and immediately arrested him and listed him as a war criminal for trial. In addition, four war criminals, including Lieutenant Colonel Watanabe, the commander of the 128th Battalion of the 23rd Independent Brigade of the former Japanese Guangzhou Bay, were escorted here yesterday, the 21st. As for traitors who have fled to Hong Kong and Macau, our side has sent personnel to reside in the area to conduct investigations and surveillance work, and extradite them back for trial through diplomatic channels. The first batch was escorted here yesterday, the 21st.

### US Congressman Suggests Withdrawal of Foreign Troops Stationed in China

### Rehe Provincial Administration Proceeds Smoothly: Provincial Government Requests Emergency Agricultural Loans from the Central Government

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] Senior officials of the Rehe Provincial Government who came to Beiping yesterday stated that the Rehe provincial administration is proceeding smoothly and there are no unexpected difficulties. Rehe Province has more than twenty counties in total, and the provincial government now controls seven counties: Chaoyang, Fuxin, Lingyuan, Lingnan, Pingquan, Jianping, and Ningcheng. The countryside of Chifeng is also a Nationalist army garrison area. The Communist army only occupies the area near the urban area. County heads have also been appointed to the governments of Kailu and Lubei counties. In total, the area controlled by the Nationalist army exceeds one-third of the total number of counties in the province. In terms of population, it accounts for one-half of the entire province. Rehe Province has a population of 1.7 million. The area currently controlled by the Nationalist army is difficult for the Communist army to invade and can be developed because (1) Rehe Province is vast and sparsely populated, and the land problem can be used as a rallying cry; (2) Last year, when the Soviet army passed through, the local area was emptied, and the people's suffering is still deep; (3) The Nationalist army carries its own food when marching, while the Communist army levies on the spot, and the people mostly harbor resentment towards the Communist army, so the Communist army finds it extremely difficult to develop. The current important task of the Rehe Provincial Government is post-disaster relief. The supplies for Rehe from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration have already been shipped from Beiping. With spring plowing approaching, the provincial government plans to request an emergency agricultural loan of 30 million yuan from the central government and has sent provincial government member Wang Hengsheng to Chongqing to make the request.

### The Meritorious Troops of Longling and Tengchong Will Be Transported by Sea to Reinforce the Northeast; Soviet Troops in Changchun Can Be Completely Withdrawn Before the 26th

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Chongqing News: Military news, ensuring traffic along the China Chang Railway and completely completing the reception work in the Northeast, so as to prevent the Soviet side in the Northeast from making any excuses, has become an urgent matter. It is reported that the Military Affairs Commission will continue to transfer the meritorious troops of Longling and Tengchong, who made contributions on the Yunnan-Burma front, to the Northeast by sea. The number of troops is two armies. This unit will be commanded by General Zhou Fucheng, who once belonged to Wan Fulin's troops. Zhou is from the Northeast.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] The scene of the informal withdrawal of Soviet troops from Shenyang seems to be about to replay in Changchun. Considering all possible accidents after the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the official authorities have taken necessary measures. All personnel who do not need to stay in Changchun are temporarily sent to Jinzhou and Beiping. Each unit designates at most three or four people to stay behind. Personnel from the provincial governments of Heilongjiang, Nenjiang, Songjiang, and Jilin have also been concentrated in Changchun and Harbin, respectively, forming a clear contrast with the reception personnel from Changchun and Harbin who are returning west in succession. The General Headquarters personnel are heading east to the Northeast in droves. Special Commissioner Sun Yueqi of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Special Commissioner Chen Gongliang of the Ministry of Finance are scheduled to take a military plane to Shenyang on the 23rd to handle the reception work.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd] The personnel for the Northeast reception have been sent to Beiping in batches, but senior personnel are still staying in Chongqing. It is reported that the responsible authorities for the Northeast reception have submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to use two more special planes to complete the transfer. Chongqing and Baoji are used as concentration points. Once approved, all Northeast reception personnel can fly to Beiping.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 21st] As the Soviet troops withdraw from here, the number of vacant large buildings in the city is increasing daily. This morning, the former College of Political Science and Law caught fire after the Soviet troops moved out and burned for several hours, turning it into ashes. It is widely rumored here that the Soviet troops may completely withdraw from Changchun on the 26th. Although our official authorities have not yet received notification, given the events of Shenyang and Siping, which are only ten days ago, with lessons not far away, the general public is anxious about when the Nationalist army will come to Changchun and whether Changchun will become a second Siping. Armed men in civilian clothes are rampant in the city, and some people have come by military vehicles from northern Manchuria, seeing several district military units boarding the bus in the middle of the road heading south. When getting off, they only removed the symbols on their arms, and their clothing and weapons remained the same. Rumors are flying in the city, presenting an uneasy scene. Currently, the Manchu Coal Building is housing a large number of reception personnel, but Zhang Datong, the person in charge of the General Headquarters Economic Committee, and others, flew away from Changchun without saying goodbye today. Some organizations that need the Economic Committee to handle expenses will be seriously affected, because credentials, documents, and codebooks all flew away with the people, causing complaints and blame.

### Shenyang Rhythm

— Sent by Han Qingtao, Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in the Northeast, from Shenyang

In the morning, a dense atmosphere enveloped the entire city of Shenyang. The sun, just rising, seemed to have a red veil covering its face, and the cold air that stung the skin made people shiver and tremble. The Soviet Red Army Monument stands in the square in front of the Shenyang Railway Station on the "China Chang Railway", a tall cement structure with a tank car sculpted on top. On other tall buildings, huge oil paintings of Lenin and Stalin are hung, as well as long red cloth slogans.

Red Army vehicles loaded with goods are running on the streets. On some of the main streets of the former Japanese station, wooden signs saying "Red Army Street" and "Liberation Street" have been erected. The lone Red Army soldiers mostly have a submachine gun lying across their chests.

Soviet Troop Withdrawal Situation

At the "China Chang Railway" station, trains loaded with various items continue to depart northward. Defective locomotives are also towed away one after another. Japanese drivers and station staff are quite appreciated by the Red Army. Regarding our people, they say: "They don't go up high!" At the Huanggu Tun station, the Soviet troops also concentrated many materials and items. The Red Army often pulls on waiting passengers to help them carry their belongings. The reporter was fortunate enough to slip away while a Red Army soldier was chasing other passengers.

Some of the Red Army began to withdraw. It is rumored in the urban area that many Communist army men in plain clothes are disguised as rickshaw pullers, vendors, farmers, and ordinary citizens, mixed together. The central army in the former South Manchuria Road area and Huanggu Tun are busy building fortifications, blocking building windows with bricks and leaving gun holes to deal with emergencies.

On Beining Road, elite units of the central army are advancing northward, section by section, towards Shenyang, preparing to take over step by step, so the atmosphere in Shenyang is tense again.

The central army began emergency transport to the north. Passenger trains on Beining Road have been suspended since the 9th. On the morning of that day, two empty trains departed from Huanggu Tun Station to pick up the Nationalist army. But in the afternoon, the Soviet troops said they were busy withdrawing and that trains from the west could not enter the station. Our staff repeatedly negotiated but were ineffective. Only coal trains were allowed to enter the station that night. The same was true on the 10th, so the operation of our Huanggu Tun Station was greatly restricted, and the railway staff expressed dissatisfaction.

When people saw these things, although they knew that there were still many problems ahead and that bloodshed was probably inevitable, they were very excited because things could be normalized from now on. At the same time, they were also praying, hoping that all takeover and reception work would be completed smoothly, and that the local area would not be able to withstand any more destruction.

These are the facts that the reporter saw in Shenyang from the 8th to the 10th. The Soviet troops began to withdraw, and our reception of Shenyang thus began.

The Business Market in the Past Half Month

The Shenyang market has stabilized slightly in the past half month in the midst of tension, so Zhongjie Street is crowded with vendors selling daily groceries. Large stores, such as Yutai and Department Store, Hongshunsheng Silk Store, etc., have resumed business. In other streets and alleys, pork, beef, rice, and flour are sold everywhere, which really makes the Northeast compatriots extremely happy. Because under the puppet Manchu distribution system, nothing could be seen. What there was, was private accommodation, and one had to be extra careful when eating.

The open space on the original city base of the east city wall is occupied by merchants and vendors, with electrical materials, light iron utensils, woven items, porcelain, ironware, dyes, and second-hand goods, stretching from the southeast corner of the city to the northeast corner, a majestic display. Merchants from Guanzhong also come here to purchase goods.

The prices of goods in Shenyang are also gradually increasing: red gold is 15,000 yuan per tael, rice is 11 to 16 yuan per catty, flour is 17 to 20 yuan per catty, sorghum rice is 3.8 yuan per catty, pork is 32 to 34 yuan per catty, cotton is 30 to 34 yuan per catty, cotton yarn is 1,750 yuan per ten yards, calico is 2,500 yuan per bolt, and salt is 10 yuan per catty. The paper money used here includes Northeast circulation coupons, puppet Manchu paper money, and Red Army notes, all three types of paper money equaling 13 yuan of legal currency for every yuan.

People Look at the Police

The general public hates the police very much, because most of the police used their authority during the puppet Manchu period to enrich their own private interests. At that time, the people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation could all be grounds for violating the law. For example, if some rice was found in someone's house, it would be confiscated and taken home, where he could eat white rice for a few days with his wife and children.

This time, the police of the police bureau were still the same people who took over the municipal government. Changing the soup but not the medicine is very dangerous. Before and after the municipal reception, robberies occurred frequently, and it was rumored that they were the ones who did it. If they were fired, it would be even more unthinkable. In this complicated situation, it is hoped that they can repent and make a fresh start, serve the country and the hometown, and atone for their sins.

This time in Shenyang, the reporter saw the solemn and beautiful police bureau, the tight security in front of each branch bureau, and the equipment that the Japanese gave them, the large saber at the waist, which was really frightening. At noon on the 9th, in front of the Zhongjie Theater, a policeman chased a young man in a blue short suit, and a shot rang out, followed by the drawing of a saber, chasing across the street in a completely Japanese style. What it was for is unknown.

Needs Re-cultivation

Shenyang's cultural work is urgently needed. The Japanese-style products of the past are prevalent. For example, at the bottom of an envelope, where the word "Mr." is written, most people still use the word "Dian". Other kinds of nonsensical sentences are too numerous to count and need to be corrected. However, of course, people with profound knowledge are an exception.

Currently, the published newspapers include "China-Soviet Daily," "Northeast Youth Daily," and "Liaoshen Daily," etc. "China-Soviet Daily" is a large newspaper, founded on March 5th, and the printing is also eye-catching; "Northeast Youth Daily" and "Liaoshen Daily" are both half-size, but the latter is a horizontal folded tabloid. Also, under the masthead of "Liaoshen Daily" is labeled: "Edited by the Liaoning Provincial Government Shenyang Municipal Government."

Many bookstores have opened, and Guandong Publishing House is reprinting many books about Chairman Chiang's remarks and the Three Principles of the People. There are also many publications being published and printed. However, fourteen years of poisoning and fourteen years of suppression are really too frightening. This requires more effort from mainland authors and the publishing industry! (March 12th)

### Relief Flour and Clothing Are Shipped to Rehe Province

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] The Hopei-Jehol Branch of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has shipped 50,000 tons of flour, 100,000 bags of clothing, and 1,000 bolts of cloth to Chaoyang, Rehe. This is the first time the warm hand of relief has extended to the people of Rehe. The provincial government has sent ten staff members to assist in the distribution.

### Five Measures Determined for Military Grain Procurement in Various Provinces

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd] The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee discussed the issue of military grain procurement in detail and gave separate instructions on both fundamental and short-term solutions. Recently, Chairman Chiang convened some Central Committee members, chairmen of party departments in various provinces and cities, and chairmen of provincial and municipal governments to discuss this issue in detail and decided on several measures as follows: It was decided that (1) Provinces such as Sichuan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Fujian, which have stored grain, should immediately hand it over; (2) The amount of burden on each province shall be drafted and approved by the Military Grain Assessment Committee; (3) Those who have paid for stored grain but have not handed it over should immediately remit it; (4) Transportation shall be the responsibility of the central competent departments, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Logistics Department of the Nationalist Army; (5) Party departments and the government shall cooperate closely to procure surplus grain from large households.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 22nd] The Ministry of Food had originally planned to allocate one million bags of Sichuan grain to aid Hankou, but now, due to the difficulty of the grain source in Hubei Province, it has been decided to increase the allocation to two million bags, to be transported to Hankou in stages. 50,000 bags will be transported this month and are already underway. In addition, eight US Navy ships carrying relief supplies from Shanghai arrived in Hankou a few days ago and are being distributed to Hunan, Hubei, and Henan provinces according to the predetermined amounts.

For those beyond the national border, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will be responsible, with a subsidy of 500 kyats per person returning to Burma, and 200 US dollars per person returning to Malaya, but these subsidies are limited to families of four and only apply to those who completed their registration procedures after returning to the country following the outbreak of the Pacific War. (B) During the repatriation of overseas Chinese, military units will be dispatched to ensure their safety. (C) Burmese repatriates in Chongqing and Zunyi will be concentrated in Kunming for transportation.

### Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing: To Rest Briefly and Return to His Hometown to Sweep Tombs

[This Newspaper] Former Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Kong Xiangxi, arrived in Shanghai for the first time since the victory yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. on the special "Meiling" aircraft, landing at Jiangwan Airport at 3:15 p.m. The "Meiling" was originally scheduled to land at Longhua Airport, so many people from various circles in the city went to Longhua Airport to welcome him, including Mayor Qian, Kong's eldest son Lingkan, Dong Xian Guang, Song Hanzhang, Huang Renlin, Chen Xing, Chen Xunyu, Zhan Wenhhu, and heads of various central and Chinese banks. However, due to unfavorable weather conditions, it was difficult to clearly identify the landing site even when flying at a low altitude of 200 meters, so the aircraft circled several times before landing at Jiangwan Airport. Upon hearing the news, the welcoming party rushed to Jiangwan Airport to greet him. After disembarking, Kong shook hands with each member of the welcoming party and then rode in his eldest son's car directly to his private residence on Rue Massenet. He received many financiers, including Chen Xing, Xu Weiming, Jin Guobao, Shao Zenghua, Chen Changtong, and Lin Chongtang, as well as reporters from various newspapers. Kong told reporters that he had planned to come to Shanghai after the victory last year, but he was in charge of more than twenty charitable, cultural, educational, and industrial and commercial enterprises, and he was unable to arrange everything properly at once, so he was delayed until today. Regarding the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Sixth Central Executive Committee, Kong told reporters that the results of the meeting were very good. Although China has gone through eight years of war, there are many complex domestic problems, but under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the outcome was satisfactory. Kong commented on Zhou Enlai's statement on the Second Plenary Session, saying that "the positions are different and the perspectives are different." Kong also said that the reorganization of the government should be implemented in accordance with the principles decided by the Political Consultative Conference. Regarding Chairman Chiang's visit to the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, Kong said that when he visited the United States two years ago, then-President Roosevelt expressed his hope that Chairman Chiang could visit the United States, but at that time, the country was in a wartime period, and Chairman Chiang had too many responsibilities to leave the country. Now that victory has arrived, if Chairman Chiang can visit these countries at this time, it will enhance the ties between the Allied nations, but when this will happen depends on the domestic situation. Kong also said that Madame Chiang will come to Shanghai within days to arrange the return to the capital. Regarding the Northeast problem, Kong said that the general situation has improved. Kong continued, saying that he had not returned to his native Shanxi for ten years, and he planned to rest briefly in Shanghai before going to Shanxi to sweep the tombs and take care of family matters. He also said that after two operations, his health has greatly improved, but doctors still advise him to rest for a long time. In the future, he will focus on cultural, charitable, and educational work, so that younger and stronger people can take on more national construction work.

[This Newspaper] London, 22nd Broadcast: According to Moscow Radio, Stalin made a statement to American reporters today, saying: I attach great importance to the United Nations and believe that this organization is an important tool for guaranteeing peace and international security. This organization is based on the principle of equality among nations and is not aimed at dominating other countries. This is also the source of the United Nations' strength. I firmly believe that what all nations need is not a new war, but peace. I believe that outside wars are caused by some politicians, whose aim is to sow the seeds of discord and unease. In order to maintain peace, we should expose the true faces of those who create wars, so that they cannot abuse freedom of speech to engage in disrupting peace.

Churchill's previous speeches in the United States calling for closer ties between Britain and the United States have aroused resentment in Moscow and some American political and media circles. Churchill said: "To sit idly by and watch the situation on the Iranian, Turkish, and Iraqi borders deteriorate will be extremely dangerous." It is very easy to stir up chaos in these countries. Using money, force, and Shandong-style propaganda, legitimate governments can be overthrown, creating chaos and establishing puppet governments. The Security Council must show that it is a practical, not a cosmetic, body, and that it deals with facts and truth. We should not allow this world organization to face a fait accompli.

Commentary

### United Nations Organizations and the "World Government"

— Chu Yu-kun

The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to convene in New York on the 25th of this month. Representatives from various countries are setting off to attend. Moreover, the Iranian government, citing the continued presence of Soviet troops on its territory as a threat to world peace and security, has brought the issue between Iran and the Soviet Union before the Security Council. Simultaneously, France, arguing that the existence of the Franco government in Spain poses a threat to world peace and security, has also submitted the Spanish issue to the Security Council for resolution. Therefore, even before its opening, the Security Council faces many serious tests. Whether it can, as the world hopes, find thorough solutions to the various international problems of the post-war era is indeed a serious practical question.

It is reported that the United Nations General Assembly held in London also discussed the following practical issues: (1) The dispute between Iran and the Soviet Union; (2) The Greek issue; (3) The Indonesian independence movement; (4) The issues of Syria and Lebanon; (5) The international trusteeship of colonies; (6) The issue of joint control of atomic energy. These topics sparked heated debates, with representatives from various countries speaking sharply against each other, unwilling to concede. Particularly between Britain and the Soviet Union, there was a clear incompatibility, like fire and ice. However, the discussions invariably ended inconclusively, with nothing achieved through these verbal battles. Although it can be said that the United Nations General Assembly overcame many difficulties and ultimately achieved considerable success, the practical issues remained unchanged, failing to be resolved or compromised. Now that the Security Council is about to open in New York, everyone harbors great hopes that the United Nations organization can resolve any international disputes peacefully and maintain world peace permanently. In particular, Britain and the United States hope to use the United Nations organization to curb Soviet expansion. But can these excessive expectations be realized? Clearly, it is not possible. Therefore, many pessimists in the international community believe that the future of the United Nations organization is not very optimistic. To rely on the United Nations organization to maintain peace is like climbing a tree to catch fish, bound to disappoint. As a result, there are proposals in Britain and the United States to amend the United Nations Charter.

According to a United Press dispatch from Winter Park, USA, prominent figures from American political, educational, cultural, industrial, and commercial circles have jointly launched a proposal to President Truman, advocating for the amendment of the United Nations Charter to transform the United Nations organization into a "World Government." According to their interpretation, the United Nations organization is insufficient to maintain world peace in today's atomic age. After the proposal was published in Washington, the initiators decided to convene a conference in Winter Park to discuss how to amend the United Nations Charter so that the United Nations organization becomes a true world government. This movement has attracted the attention of people around the world.

As for the content of the world government, according to American Supreme Court Justice Douglas, the so-called "World Government" is a "World Federal Government." It has four characteristics: (1) Organize the "World Government" according to the American federal system. Before the American constitutional system, the United States had thirteen independent states, each with its own sovereignty and laws. Therefore, before the U.S. Constitution was established, if disputes arose between the thirteen independent states, there were only two ways to resolve them: war or diplomacy. But in the United States, law is used instead. (2) Organize a world court according to the American Supreme Court. (3) All countries in the world should cede a portion of their sovereignty to the world government, but individual freedom cannot be sacrificed. Therefore, the world government will be able to create peace and enhance individual freedom and security. (4) Establish an international bill of rights. If there is a world organization representing the people of the world, it will be able to resolve international disputes. However, the world organization representing the people of the world and the world government representing all countries are different in nature and cannot be confused. (5) Organize a world police force to implement international law and maintain world order.

Justice Douglas's proposition is certainly a problem worth studying in theory. However, within months of the end of World War II, the international atmosphere was once again filled with tension. The United Nations organization is like a newborn baby. How can we expect it to bear the responsibility of maintaining world peace? Furthermore, observing its inherent conditions, we also find the defects of the old League of Nations in this new international organization. The United Nations General Assembly held in London in January was not the international organization that the United Nations wanted to organize during the war. As early as New Year's Day in 1942, China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union first issued a "United Nations Declaration." Later, at the end of 1943, the four countries of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union issued a "Four-Nation General Security Declaration," announcing the principles of the new post-war international organization to the people of all countries. However, by the time of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference and the San Francisco Conference, a "United Nations Charter" was passed, which did not fully adopt the principles that had been previously declared. As for where its congenital roots of disease lie?

First, the United Nations General Assembly has not adopted "international democracy" as its supreme principle, but still adheres to the methods of the old League of Nations, allowing international politics to be manipulated by a few powerful countries. Countries that truly love peace, because of their small size and weak influence, have no voice. The Council of the League of Nations had permanent, semi-permanent, and non-permanent members. The current Security Council also has permanent members and non-permanent members. Moreover, in the Security Council, powerful countries can exercise the "veto power." Something that all countries agree to do cannot be established if one country opposes it. This method clearly violates the principle of "international democracy." Today, world affairs should be jointly studied and discussed by all peace-loving countries in the world, regardless of their size or strength, all standing on an equal footing, using open diplomacy. This is the only way to resolve all international disputes through peaceful means. Conversely, if world affairs are handled by a few powerful countries, sacrificing the interests of small and weak countries to achieve a superficial resolution of problems, this approach will only make international relations more complex and subtle.

Second, the United Nations Charter still does not stipulate a swift and effective concrete method for preventing aggression, and it has not yet made it obligatory for all countries to take joint action to sanction countries that disrupt peace. At the same time, countries around the world are unwilling to accept this obligation and still prefer to rely on their own military force to protect their survival. Therefore, the British sociologist Elbourne advocated "abandoning national sovereignty," so that the United Nations organization would have hope of success.

When we study the reasons for the failure of the old League of Nations, the most important reason lies here. In terms of its status, the League of Nations was not a supranational state, but merely an international association that exercised some of its functions. Since countries were unwilling to grant the League of Nations greater power, they could not hope that it would maintain world peace. As the public law scholar Clyde Eagleton said in his book "International Government": "Looking at the League's methods of controlling war, one cannot but recognize some shortcomings. According to various plans for preventing war, they have been weakened in peace conferences, and have become increasingly weak due to various explanations. However, if all countries can adopt the methods stipulated in the Covenant, they can still cope freely. The principle of sanctions has taken shape; what is lacking is the failure to make it obligatory for all countries to take joint action to sanction countries that violate the Covenant. Since the end of the First World War, the idea of national sovereignty has prevailed for a time, and countries have been unwilling to accept this obligation and still prefer to rely on national self-defense weapons, unaware of the powerful strength of the united organization." This passage not only explains the reasons for the failure of the League of Nations, but also points out the defects of the United Nations organization. It can also explain that in today's world where national sovereignty has not been eliminated, advocating a world government is still an impractical ideal.

### The Bureau of Education Hopes That Middle School Principals Will Persuade Teachers to Resume Teaching

Deputy Director Li Delivers Earnest Remarks

[Report from our newspaper] Municipal middle schools: Yucai, Gezhi, Jingye, Xinlu Normal School, Wuben Girls' School, and Wusong and other schools' faculty and staff began a work slowdown yesterday morning, resulting in over ten thousand students temporarily losing access to education. The Municipal Bureau of Education, upon receiving this information, immediately convened a meeting with principals of the relevant schools at 2:00 PM yesterday, with over ten people in attendance. Deputy Director Li Ximou then delivered earnest remarks, stating that improving teacher compensation is undoubtedly urgent. However, adjustment methods are determined by the central government, and local governments cannot arbitrarily change them.

Repeated Improvements to Public Education Compensation

Furthermore, the central government has made several improvements to the compensation of public educators in the city within the most recent month. Living subsidies have increased from 28,000 yuan to 30,000 yuan, and recently increased again to 40,000 yuan. Salary multiples have changed from 80 times to 100 times, and recently increased again to 130 times. The municipal government is preparing to retroactively issue these compensation adjustments. Recently, the central government may further increase subsidies to 50,000 or 60,000, and increase salary multiples to 170 times or 200 times. While these measures may still not meet our high expectations, the central government is very concerned about the livelihood of public educators in the city, which can be stated with certainty.

The Respect-for-Teachers Movement – Hoping to Fulfill Wishes

Regarding the urgent loan requests proposed by teachers, the Bureau of Education is actively promoting a respect-for-teachers movement. Once sufficient funds have been collected, they will be respectfully presented to the teachers to fulfill their wishes. Responsible central and local agencies, despite difficult circumstances, are not shirking their responsibilities and are gradually resolving the livelihood difficulties of teachers. While it may not fully meet the wishes of all teachers, at a minimum, teachers should appreciate the sincerity of the Bureau of Education and patiently await the results. Moreover, teachers bear the important responsibility of nurturing youth, and all their actions must serve as models for young people. Therefore, it is regrettable that some middle school teachers have suddenly begun a work slowdown today.

Hoping Principals Will Persuade Teachers to Resume Teaching

Subsequently, Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian delivered remarks, stating that he had been ordered by the mayor to assist Deputy Director Li in resolving this issue. The mayor instructed that all principals be responsible for persuading teachers to resume teaching immediately, prioritizing the education of youth. As for adjustments to teacher compensation, it will be referred to the highest authorities for prompt improvement. Yesterday, teachers at various schools still regularly went to school to process assignments, and students also engaged in self-study at school, maintaining good order. If the principals of each school can effectively persuade the teachers, it is hoped that teaching can resume today. According to reliable sources, the municipal middle school work slowdown yesterday was not comprehensive. The First Girls' Middle School, Municipal North, Fuguang, Gaoqiao, Luhang, Yangjing, and other six schools maintained regular classes, taking care of youth education, which has garnered social sympathy.

### Municipal Elementary School Faculty and Staff – Not Adopting Work Slowdown Action

Agreeing to the Respect-for-Teachers Movement Method

[Report from our city] Some municipal middle schools in the city launched a work slowdown action yesterday to demand improved compensation, which has attracted the attention of social figures and student parents. The Municipal Elementary School Faculty and Staff Association convened an emergency board meeting last night to discuss support methods. Ma Jingwu was publicly elected as chairman. After unanimous deliberation, it was resolved that to support middle school teachers, representatives Mao Wenpei and Yu Zhengchao would be dispatched to urge the Bureau of Education to handle the previously owed salary differences and emergency loans according to the method agreed upon with the director during the previous board of directors and representatives joint meeting, in order to alleviate the livelihood difficulties of teachers. It was decided to temporarily not take work slowdown action to emphasize students' education. Regarding the respect-for-teachers movement, the association also put forward the following suggestions to the Bureau of Education for adoption: The respect-for-teachers movement should focus primarily on municipal elementary schools, middle schools, and social education workers. Funds raised should be distributed at any time. If funds are insufficient for distribution, please ask the Bureau of Education for loans to be distributed, to demonstrate the Bureau of Education's utmost concern for the lives of colleagues.

[Additional Report] In light of the poor living conditions and meager compensation of teachers, the Bureau of Education has launched a respect-for-teachers movement, hiring social figures and enthusiastic educators to organize a respect-for-teachers movement committee. They will solicit large sums of money from industrial and commercial magnates and parents of students at various schools to help with the livelihood of teachers. The first meeting will be held tomorrow (the 23rd) at 10:00 AM to discuss implementation steps. It is expected that funds will be raised within two to three weeks, and each teacher can receive a subsidy of 50,000 to 80,000 yuan. Elementary school teachers have already agreed to this plan.

It is said that the Green Team also has a general who will not attend, so the battle will definitely be more intense.

Green Team: Liu Zhenbin, Wang Weizhen, Wu Ailian, Yang Wenzhen, Yuan Rongjin, Huang Mingyuan, Li Aozhi, Zhan Xiu, Rong Shujian.

### Shanghai Garrison Headquarters Opens Trial Yesterday Afternoon for the Case of Vandalism at the Shanghai Guang Theater – Six Soldiers Publicly Interrogated

Regarding the case of soldiers Li Yanjun and others vandalizing the Shanghai Guang Cinema on the evening of December 28th of last year, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, acting on military orders from the highest authorities, held a public trial at the military court of the headquarters at 2:00 PM yesterday. The plaintiff, Shi Tingqing, manager of the Shanghai Guang Theater, and the defendants, Li Yanjun, Yuan Shuhao, Lu Wenpei, Yu Shibao, Luo Zhongming, and He Qiqi, six staff members of the U.S.-China Cooperative Organization's wireless radio branch, were present. Presiding Judge Zeng Zhaoyi first summoned the defendants Li Yanjun and others, asking their names, ages, hometowns, occupations, and addresses. Then, he thoroughly questioned them about the incident. According to Li Yanjun's testimony, on the evening of the 28th, he went to see a movie alone and was not in a group. The wireless radio repair tool (hammer) he carried was brought along after repairing a wireless radio at a friend's house. The movie ticket was requested by Lu Wenpei. Next, according to Lu Wenpei's testimony: The previous statement that "Li Yanjun was the one who shouted and attacked at the Shanghai Guang Cinema" was indeed what was stated at the time, but now his memory is unclear. Also, according to Lu Wenpei, Yuan Shuhao, and Yu Shibao's simultaneous testimony: Bringing a gun to the movie was indeed a fact, but it was a usual habit to carry a gun. As for hitting Shi Tingqing and vandalizing window glass, they all denied it. Finally, the plaintiff Shi Tingqing was summoned. According to his testimony, the back of his head was hit by a gun handle in the theater on the third floor, but he could not clearly identify who hit him. At this point in the interrogation, the presiding judge read the testimony in the case once. The court ordered that the verdict be postponed and adjourned at approximately 5:00 PM.

### "Large Group" Involved in Stealing and Selling U.S. Relief Goods Busted

Three Foreigners Apprehended

[Report from this newspaper] According to the U.S. Military Crime Investigation Department, the U.S. military authorities, together with the municipal police, recently busted a "large group" operating a large-scale illegal sale of U.S. relief goods in Shanghai and arrested the leaders, Englishman Pu Jin, Russian Xiao Yike, and Italian Gan Luo. Police detectives also seized a large number of U.S. military supplies, including over 4,000 boxes of medicines, food, vitamins, and soap. According to information from the U.S. Military Crime Investigation Department, Pu Jin was designated by the British Foreign Office to serve in the British Red Cross. Recently, because there were still British prisoners of war residing in concentration camps in the Dutch East Indies and other Far East regions that had not yet been repatriated, the British Red Cross purchased a large number of relief supplies from the U.S. Red Cross at a price of ten U.S. dollars per box for distribution to various places. During transportation, Pu Jin, Russian Xiao Yike, and Italian Gan Luo secretly sold most of the relief supplies on the black market at a price of 35 U.S. dollars per box. After U.S. military police discovered this, they reported it to the U.S. Crime Investigation Department, which informed the city police, who went and arrested Pu and the other two and searched and found the privately hidden relief supplies, worth approximately over 50,000 U.S. dollars.

### Revisions to Procedures for Exchanging Winning U.S. Dollar Bonds

It has been confirmed that, according to Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations for Foreign Exchange Control, winning bonds and matured interest coupons of the U.S. Dollar Allied Victory Bonds issued by the government in the 31st year (of the Republic), as well as the principal and interest of matured U.S. Dollar Savings Certificates, should be sold to designated banks. The Central Bank will no longer issue U.S. dollar drafts. The revised procedures for exchange are as follows: (1) A. Bondholders may sell the above-mentioned winning bonds and matured interest coupons to the Central Bank or designated banks for Legal Tender. B. Alternatively, they may use them to offset all or part of the foreign exchange used for legal purposes as stipulated by these regulations and their rules. (2) The Central Bank will credit the foreign currency account of the designated bank upon receiving the above-mentioned winning bonds and matured interest coupons. (3) The above-mentioned winning bonds and matured interest coupons can only be paid within the country and cannot be directly drawn in U.S. dollars in the United States. The Central Bank has already notified its U.S. agent bank to comply with this. Furthermore, the withdrawal of principal and interest of matured U.S. Dollar Savings Certificates is still subject to the U.S. Foreign Funds Control Regulations. To comply with Article 28 of the Provisional Regulations for Foreign Exchange Control, bondholders may sell the certificates to the original issuing bank or institution, or, after the original issuing bank or institution confirms that they are correct, sell them to the Central Bank, or apply directly to the Central Bank for processing according to the legal purposes stipulated in the current regulations. However, if there is a connection to enemy or puppet organizations, acceptance will be refused.

### Interview with Mr. Cheng of the Central Bank Who Left Chongqing Before the Ill-fated Plane: A Dangerous Hour - Extreme Cold in the Cabin, Pitch Black Outside - Relief Upon Reaching the Skies Over Yichang

The China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) had a total of seven planes depart from Chongqing on the 19th, heading to Nanjing and Shanghai. One of them, aircraft number 139, was reported to have crashed after taking off from Chongqing, and there has been no accurate news about it. According to Mr. Cheng, a supervisor from the Central Bank who was on another CNAC plane that took off on the same day with President Bei Songsun and arrived safely in Shanghai, the weather suddenly turned cold in the two days before and after the closing of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee in Chongqing. It rained all day on the 18th, and the secretariat of the Second Plenary Session notified the first batch of departing Central Committee members that they were originally scheduled to depart on the 18th. However, on the morning of the 17th, when the Central Committee members went to the CNAC to buy tickets, the CNAC issued an announcement stating that ticket sales were suspended due to bad weather. It was not until the morning of the 18th that they were able to purchase tickets. On the morning of the 19th, Mr. Cheng arrived at the Shanhu Dam Airport at 5:30 AM. At that time, the mountain rain was heavy, and the surroundings of the airport were extremely blurred, with no sign of dawn. At the airport, Mr. Cheng first met Mr. Pan Xiao'e, who said that he had been ill for two months and was now returning to Nanjing with his family. Mr. Pan also introduced Mr. Cheng to his wife and son, and told Mr. Cheng that Miss Fei Zhongsun was also present. After Mr. Cheng shook hands with Miss Fei, he bid farewell to Mr. Pan, saying he would see him in Shanghai. Mr. Cheng then sat in the tea room with Mr. Bei Songsun and saw three or four planes taking off one after another. Finally, it was the turn of the plane that Mr. Cheng and Mr. Bei were on. After Mr. Cheng and others boarded the plane, there were many familiar faces in the cabin. In addition to Mr. Bei Songsun, there were also Mr. Chen Jianru, Mr. Zhao Lanping, Mr. Ye Suzhong, and Mr. Wei Yongcheng. One hour after the plane took off, the weather deteriorated, and the sound of jet fuel was heard from time to time. The cabin was as cold as an ice cellar, and the sky outside the window was as dark as night. Mr. Bei Songsun frequently went into the cockpit. One hour later, the light around them brightened, and the cold air also subsided slightly. Someone came out of the cockpit and announced that they had reached the skies over Yichang. Mr. Bei Songsun also happily announced that they had escaped the danger. Mr. Cheng said to Mr. Bei with a smile: "You've only been in office for a few days!" It was only after the plane landed at Longhua Airport that someone told them that a passenger plane had crashed. The crashed plane was the widely reported aircraft number 139.

### Trial of Sheng Sheng Ranch Owner Continues Yesterday - Seven Pieces of Adverse Evidence Presented - Workers Zhang Daode and Others Testify - Shen Wanling Denies Everything, Claiming Actions Were Not Voluntary

[Our Report] Sheng Jiucheng, the owner of the Sheng Sheng Ranch in this city, and his son, manager Shen Wanling, were sued by employees Sheng Adi and others. The court held a trial on the 19th of last month. Sheng Jiucheng is on the run, and only Shen Wanling has been detained. Yesterday afternoon, the Criminal Division of the High Court in Tilanqiao reopened a joint trial. Defendant Shen Wanling appeared in court, wearing a sea-green silk cotton robe, shiny leather shoes, and snow-white inner sleeves, with a calm attitude. The presiding judge, Liu Yugui, first presented seven pieces of evidence, including accusations of treason by the accusers and photos, to Shen. These included: (1) A photograph of an invoice showing the Sheng Sheng Ranch supplying 500 pounds of milk to the Hokkaido Japanese Navy canteen during the Shanghai milk shortage; (2) A photograph of a letter from a reader to the city's Xinwen Bao complaining that an infant was malnourished but the Sheng Sheng Ranch refused to deliver milk; (3) Photographs of formal receipts for the sale of 6,950 pounds of milk from the "Shanghai Dairy Corporation," an enemy-owned company; (4) A roll of Japanese household order forms showing that the most Sheng Sheng Ranch customers were Japanese; (5) Fourteen milk delivery slips from Sheng Sheng Ranch to the Japanese military police; (6) A photograph showing that Sheng Sheng Ranch first hired a Japanese national named Toyoshima as manager. After Toyoshima returned to Japan, he recommended another Japanese national, Kazuichi Seki, to succeed him. Seki's residence was at No. 9 Columbia Road. The accusers requested that the house be confiscated; (7) Photographs of letters from Japanese thanking Sheng Sheng Ranch for frequently gifting them fresh milk and butter, and a letter from Japanese borrowing trucks from the Sheng Sheng Ranch, indicating that Sheng Sheng Ranch had close ties with the enemy. After reading the photographs and receipts, Shen Wanling denied everything. Later, milk delivery man Zhang Daode testified, claiming that several workers were laid off because they demanded better treatment. They asked for travel expenses, but the defendant colluded with Japanese military lieutenants Miyagawa and Tanaka. Shen Jiucheng's third son, Shen Shiyi (who had studied in Japan) acted as interpreter to detain workers Zhang Daode, Li Yougen, and Zhao Yiwen at Xujiahui Middle School (i.e., the Japanese 2322nd Unit) for three days, where they were tortured. Shen Wanling argued that it was because Zhang and others were demanding money with threats that the situation escalated, thus causing the Japanese military police to intervene of their own accord, and that they were not invited to suppress the workers. Regarding the matter of supplying milk to the enemy, Shen also argued that he was forced by the enemy. After Zhang retired, worker Huang Jiajin voluntarily appeared in court and listed evidence that Sheng Sheng Ranch was a Sino-Japanese joint venture, such as the fact that Sheng Sheng Ranch could receive supplies allocated by the Japanese Embassy and that Sheng Sheng Ranch had a team of Japanese soldiers protecting it. Finally, the court ordered another hearing on the afternoon of the 29th of this month, and the defendant was remanded in custody.

Zhu Zhengdong Sentenced to Five Years

[Further News] Yesterday afternoon, the Criminal Division of the High Court, in addition to the Shen Wanling case, also rendered verdicts on two other cases and heard four cases: (1) Zhu Zhengdong, formerly the collection director of the Shanghai Puppet Incense and Candle Tax Bureau, was sentenced to five years in prison and five years of deprivation of civil rights; (2) Chen Youtian, from Jiangbei, was accused of being an intelligence officer for the Puppet Police Brigade. He argued that he was a tea attendant, not an intelligence officer; (3) Hui Wenyuan, manager of Zhenfeng Copper and Iron Factory and Rongmao Iron Shop, was suspected of manufacturing military supplies for the enemy's New Asia Iron Factory due to business relations. The arguments in the above three cases were concluded, and the verdicts were scheduled for the 29th; (4) Ding Bochu, formerly the puppet town chief of Caoxing, was accused of preparing 60 cotton quilts at the request of the puppet Shanghai Security Team; (5) Shen Pengfei was accused of being a secret agent for the enemy military police and leading the Japanese military police to arrest Ye Zhengqing and fine him. Ye reported the crime. The court ordered further hearings in the above two cases.

### Abundant Bullish News - Newport Tickets Soar - Highest Price Half of Old Stock - Hopes Continue

Newport tickets have soared in recent days. The market was brisk from the opening yesterday morning, with the 36-year issue jumping to over 190 yuan. After reaching a high, it fell back by a dozen yuan. At noon, it was around 200 yuan, and buyers continued to pursue it. In the afternoon, it rose to around 220 yuan, reaching half the price of old stock. It then leveled off slightly, with the result being a further increase of 30 to 33 yuan compared to the previous close. Various pieces of bullish news were circulating. There was a general hope that it would surpass half the price of old stock. According to investigations, Western merchants were buying the most actively due to news from Hong Kong. It was rumored in Hong Kong that the scrapped new tickets could be exchanged for British pound bonds. Another rumor said that the British Parliament had proposed to redeem them at 75% of their face value, which greatly stimulated sentiment. The market for old stock was flat, with little change. U.S. dollars were initially around 1,950 yuan in the morning, then fell to 1,940 yuan, fluctuating with the price of gold. In the end, they remained around 1,950 yuan, slightly down 10 yuan from the previous day. Hong Kong telegrams were 450 yuan, and Robbie 550 yuan.

### Gold Bar Stable, Allocation Price Unchanged, Few Registered

Although gold bars rebounded midway yesterday, the large players continued to unload, causing a glut of chips. Jewelry stores had little actual sales, and digestion was sluggish. The Central Bank's allocation price remained at 1.6 million, but few dealers registered, only 75 bars, which was difficult to accept. The opening price in the morning was 1.56 million, and it briefly fell to around 1.54 million. Hong Kong buyers bought on the dip. The general sentiment was that the Central Bank's allocation price would not change. Sentiment was very good at this time. After 10:00 AM, it was around 1.59 million. However, more inventories were gradually unloaded, and at noon it was around 1.56 million. The market was calm, and the aftermarket was even more quiet. The market price remained the same. The result was a slight decrease of 5,000 compared to the previous close. Ornaments were still priced at 170,000, silver at 1,600, and silver dollars rose to over 1,000. Due to the completion of the settlement of the gold inventory in the black market, the outlets were reduced, and the funding became looser. Interest rates seemed to fall slightly to between 1.5 and 2 jiao.

### Yarn Prices Turn Firm from Weak - Guang Gang Sales Active - Cotton Trading Flourishes

Yesterday's yarn market started weak and ended firm. The opening in the morning was slow due to rain, and dealers were waiting and watching. As a result, the price of 16-count Guangming was once quoted as low as 810,000. Then, due to strong demand for Shuangma from Guang Gang, it was pulled back from 1.06 million to 1.12 million, an increase of 30,000 compared to the previous day. The other counts were also brought back somewhat. However, the 20-count miscellaneous brands and the 42-count thread still fell by 20,000 to 30,000 compared to the previous day. The Spinning and Construction Company opened sales of ten types of patterned cotton cloth and eleven types of American cotton cloth yesterday, and will open sales of linen products today. Yesterday, New York American cotton prices rose by 13 to 23 points. Near-term American gold was 26.90, and far-term 26.80. The spot price of Middling was 27.48. The current cotton market in this city was flat and weak, but trading was active again, because the yarn factories taken over by the Spinning and Construction Company from the Japanese need raw materials urgently. The price of ordinary Middling was 77,000 to 80,000, and the price of intermediate 1-inch Middling was 82,000 to 84,000. The above were all factory delivery prices. The total was 3,000 bales. Private yarn factories did not make purchases. Local traders were trading Zhoupu cottonseed at prices from 10,000 to 16,900 yuan. The above were all spot prices.

### Ten Million Yards of American Cotton Cloth

### Rice Prices Rise Again Yesterday Due to Rain and Ships Unable to Unload

Yesterday's rice market was firm due to rain and the inability to unload goods from the ships on the river. Both japonica and indica rice rose by 600 to 700 yuan. White yuan also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. After a sharp drop, yin yuan was skillfully bought by stores and rebounded, with prices rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The Ningbo and Fujian gangs slightly purchased flour, and local sales were sporadic, with a further increase of 100 to 200 yuan. Soybean cakes were sold firmly. Digestion of soybeans was sluggish, and mid-grade grades were slightly reduced by 200 to 300 yuan. The oil market saw dull sales due to the arrival of Qingdao raw soybean oil and the continued arrival from the Longhai Line. The market was weak, and raw soybean oil continued to decline by more than 2,000 yuan.

### Sichuan Gang Intentionally Buying, Stock Prices Rise Steadily

Public bonds remained unchanged yesterday. The opening was flat, but gradually improved after opening at 1,580 yuan. Due to the booming stock market, scattered floating capital was forced into the bond market, so it rebounded to 1,730 yuan. The noon closing struggled around 1,690 yuan, with A and B slightly down and C and E slightly up compared to the previous close. The Chinese stock market was slightly weak at the beginning yesterday. Yongsha was 4,250 yuan, Meiya 3,450 yuan, Jingfu 285 yuan, Xinguang 250 yuan, and Qinxing 220 yuan. The multi-party traders had almost all settled, and no one was raising prices, resulting in this situation. However, the Sichuan gang continued to buy intentionally, and the chips were extremely exhausted. Before noon, Yongsha rose to 4,500 yuan, Meiya 3,680 yuan, Jingfu 333 yuan, and Xinguang 300 yuan before leveling off slightly. The results were the same as the previous closing for Yongsha and Meiya, while the three small hot stocks such as Jingfu rose by another half to 10%. Cold stocks were also pulled up, with more buyers than sellers, and many ending with buying orders. The buying trend was even stronger in the afternoon, with Yongsha rising to 4,600 yuan, Meiya 3,700 yuan, Jingfu 355 yuan, Xinguang 330 yuan, and Qinxing above 270. Foreign stocks rose due to reports that the standing committee had amended the new company law, which was more favorable to foreign merchants, causing a buying trend. There was a small pullback after the rise before noon. Yisha once rose to 10,000 yuan, and English Union was above 11,700 yuan. Large stocks then leveled off slightly. The noon closing results were about 15% higher compared to the previous closing. In the afternoon, the daily settlement for Yisha was 10,300 yuan and English Union was 12,400 yuan, focusing on hot stocks, following in the footsteps of Chinese stocks.

### Large Amount of Electrical Materials Shipped from the United States

It is scheduled to be imported and unloaded next Monday.

### Tea Market Still Shows Little Improvement

Green tea without coloring is sold to the United States, especially the round-headed variety, which is favored by South America. Although demand from there has been very strong recently, most of the goods stored on the market have been old for many years, and the quality has inevitably changed, so they are not suitable for foreign firms, and there has been no substantial liquidation. As for the tea market in this city, the trend is still soft, because buyers are sporadic, and suppliers are still constantly offering for sale, so prices are lifeless, and Qimen tea continues to decline.

### Market Summary

Sugar arrived in larger quantities yesterday, with high-grade sugar falling by 3,000 yuan, medium-grade sugar falling by 2,000 yuan, and medium-grade sugar also weakening by 500 yuan. The rest was the same as the previous market.

### Various Industrial Associations Request Restoration of Allocated Coal Price

[Our Report] Since the end of last year, the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in view of the soaring black market coal prices and the strong demand for allocation from private production enterprises, had planned to allocate coal for private factories. Several days ago, it issued application forms for factory coal and sent circulars to various industrial associations to forward and report them. Associations such as silk weaving, knitting, glass, rubber, dyeing and weaving, and chemical industries have successively completed their reports. The committee has internally determined the allocated amount to be tens of thousands of tons, with an allocation price of 70,000 yuan per ton. In the past few days, it has been in the process of filling out and issuing notices. Yesterday, it suddenly received a telegram from President Song ordering that the allocation price be increased to 175,000 yuan per ton. It is said that the reason is to use the increased coal funds to rectify coal mine equipment and mining volume, so that the fuel supply can achieve long-term balance. However, according to news from various industrial associations, the allocated coal price has always been only 20,000 yuan per ton. The decision to set it at 70,000 is already a considerable increase. Moreover, the allocated goods are Second Coal Layer No. 2 briquettes. The current black market price is less than 170,000 yuan. They are jointly requesting the authorities to restore the original allocated price.

### Unethical Incidents in the Publishing World

— Yuan Da

During the past eight years of the War of Resistance, some regrettable unethical incidents occurred in the publishing world. Due to the special domestic situation, tense international situation, rising prices, and difficult living conditions at the time, no one had the leisure to settle accounts for these unfortunate events. Now that the war is over, we might as well bring them up for discussion, so that the publishing world in our country knows how to improve.

(1) Piracy—The "piracy" referred to here is the act of secretly reprinting a book in the local area or elsewhere for profit without the consent of the original publisher. This kind of incident occurred frequently in Guilin and Chengdu after Shanghai and the inland areas could no longer send printed materials to each other in 1941. Some profit-seeking booksellers in the inland saw that the original publishers were in Shanghai and reprinted some books and periodicals in the inland. Although the original publishers in Shanghai knew about it, they could only lament their helplessness due to the mountains and rivers separating them. Guilin at the time almost became a "paradise for pirate booksellers." Even if some original authors or original publishers went to the local area to negotiate, they achieved very little. Such piracy incidents not only existed in the free areas, but were also frequently discovered in Tianjin, Dalian, and Shanghai after their fall. Under the power of the enemy and puppets, negotiations were even more troublesome, and many publishers had no choice but to let it go.

(2) Defaulting on Royalties—During the War of Resistance, many new publishers emerged in various places, some good and some bad. A portion of them were really engaged in "speculative business." People in the cultural world found these kinds of publishers the most troublesome because they often didn't care about manuscript fees and royalties. Even if the author repeatedly urged them or asked someone to intercede, they would make all sorts of excuses and shamelessly refuse to pay. And the author was often "helpless" in this regard.

The occurrence of the above two types of unethical incidents in the publishing world, although due to the existence of social and economic backgrounds, was also largely due to the weakness and ineffectiveness of Chinese law in this area, and the lack of unity among legitimate publishers.

To put China's cultural and publishing undertakings on the right track, it is necessary to first improve the ethical standards of publishers. At the same time, unethical publishers should be sanctioned by law and eliminated.

### Methods of Reading Books

— Compiled by Shen Yin

The worst thing for a reader is to be agitated. — Huang Mianqi

When reading, one must know the method of entering and exiting: one should first seek the way to enter, and finally seek the way to exit. Gaining an intimate understanding is the method of entering a book; applying it thoroughly is the method of exiting a book. If one cannot enter the book, then one does not know where the ancients put their heart; if one cannot exit the book, then one is stuck in the words. Only by knowing how to exit and how to enter does one obtain the method of reading books. — Chen Shan

When reading, one should widen the deadlines and tighten the curriculum. — Zhu Xi

People say that reading books is leisurely and flavorful, but this is just an excuse for laziness. If one is reading a book and doesn't understand the principles, one shouldn't be hasty, but also shouldn't put it down. However, if one idles away the whole day, calling it leisure, but not making any effort, it's like with medicinal herbs, you must first boil them over a high flame, and then simmer them over a slow flame, that is okay. — Zhu Xi

### Continuation of "Talks on Spiritual Culture"

Publication Date: December 1945

Our country is known as a nation of "spiritual civilization." When we think that our material civilization is not as good as others, we always like to comfort ourselves by saying that "our spiritual civilization surpasses others." Civilization, whether it is spiritual civilization or material civilization (in fact, the two are related), is built on the foundation of culture, and culture is the expression of the combination of thought and practice. The cultural foundation of ancient China cannot be said to be profound, but the culture reflected in modern thought is far less progressive than that of others. Especially in the area of spiritual culture, there are too many places obscured by vulgar and erroneous ideas.

In order to correct the erroneous concepts of the common people and instill correct thinking in young people, Mr. Cao Bohan wrote this book "Talks on Spiritual Culture." This book includes sixteen talks, which can be said to be aimed at the distorted thoughts of the current society, and express new understandings and new insights on spiritual culture. The author intends to eradicate, one by one, the various ideological maladies prevalent in society today.

Indeed, for a country like China, which boasts of its "spiritual civilization," if it does not lay a solid foundation in spiritual culture, cultivate correct thinking in people, and eradicate distorted theories, then spiritual culture will only decline, regress, and even die out day by day. The responsibility of building spiritual culture lies entirely with the youth, because the youth are the fresh cells of the nation. Only with the youth's unparalleled vitality and enthusiasm can they raise and ride the toxic thoughts of all the vulgar fallacies prevalent in today's society, and only then can they create a new and free world. The author of "Talks on Spiritual Culture" explained that his motivation and purpose in writing the book was entirely for the youth: "When young people are dissatisfied with reality, please temporarily accept your full enthusiasm, first use scientific methods to analyze various social phenomena, and find out the laws of their development. Especially in the area of spiritual culture, do not be obscured by the erroneous concepts of the common people, and then you go to transform society, your power will not be sacrificed in vain, and your career will have satisfactory results."

The dissatisfaction of young people with real life and thought cannot be improved simply by temporary emotional agitation. After reading "On the Struggle Against Ghosts and Gods," I deeply felt that young people's wishful thinking of breaking all superstitions and achieving victory in the struggle against ghosts and gods cannot be achieved by empty slogans of breaking superstitions. We must first find out the social roots of superstition, and on the one hand, improve the culture of the masses, and on the other hand, transform the social system. Regarding moral issues, in the two articles "The Changes of Morality" and "National Morality is Developing," the author strongly argues that morality changes with society, and the reason for the change is largely due to the different degrees of economic development. When talking about the inherent morality of the nation, we cannot abstractly and generally accept it blindly. Even some moral items that are worth promoting must be supplemented and developed with new concepts that are in line with the times. One-sided efforts to eliminate morality, and to promote national morality that meets the needs of the times and society, for example, "dedicating utmost loyalty to the country and great filial piety to the nation" should be promoted, and loyalty, filial piety, and righteousness that do not conform to the times should not exist. The author also expressed his views on changing customs, believing that the work of changing customs can be initiated by a few progressive people, but it is only effective when social and historical conditions are met. Changes in customs and habits often occur after changes in the economic base. "The Evolution of Language and Writing" and "The Emergence and Development of Art" both provide progressive theories: "First, a unified national language must be promoted by economic and political progress, and phonetic writing can also help, but it must never artificially unify in violation of naturally formed principles. Second, to eliminate the gap between spoken language and written language, we must go a step further from the movement of vernacular writing and adopt phonetic writing. When talking about art, the author believes that "art is the product of human social life, and the main basis is productive labor, followed by war, and then by sexual desire. In the evaluation of art, we should not only pay attention to its content, but also pay attention to its form. The creation of new art is achieved in the process of accepting the legacy of old art and discarding the form and content of old art."

China in the future will step into the road of "industrialization," and naturally it will actively promote the development of science. In the two articles "Starting from the Reasons Why Chinese Science is Not Developed" and "The Relationship Between Philosophy and Religion, Science," the author contributed many valuable opinions. The divergence of worldviews is an important issue in the ideological world. The author wants us to pay attention to the times and social background of each theorist or thinker when we encounter the coexistence of various schools of thought, otherwise we will not be able to distinguish whether many sophistry that violates the truth is distorted and arbitrary. The article "Talking about the Spirit of the Rule of Law" also has profound arguments: "Modernization cannot be achieved solely from the economic aspect. Politics, law, culture, etc. must be coordinated with the economy. To make China modern, we must implement democratic politics, and to implement democratic politics, we must have the spirit of the rule of law." Young people often clamor to abolish the idea of family, but they have not recognized the background of familism and its central idea. There is also the debate about individualism and collectivism, which is of most interest to young people, but the understanding of this aspect is generally too superficial. I hope to get correct inspiration from this book.

In addition, there are two articles that are worth paying attention to, "A Review of Several Chinese and Western Cultural Views," in which the author sternly criticized the theories of Zhang Shizhao and Liang Shuming. He argued that the backwardness of the Eastern spirit should not be promoted, and it is very possible and necessary to be washed away with the development of the New Culture Movement. After China's modernization, achieving economic industrialization, ideological scientification, and political democratization, the backwardness of the Eastern spirit will disappear with the elimination of the fundamental difference between Eastern and Western cultures. "Matter is the Foundation of Spirit" elaborates on the relationship and mutual influence between spiritual culture and material culture, and determines that although spiritual culture has other positions and functions, it is ultimately based on material culture and cannot determine material culture. Finally, when discussing "Chinese Society and Chinese Culture," the author states that the development of society can only be found in the economic foundation to solve the moral, to distorted theories to expand except. Regarding the criticism of other people's thoughts, the author also mentioned in the "Postscript": "Especially the last few articles, wantonly criticizing the lofty and grand discussions of contemporary celebrities and scholars, I am also afraid that I will fall into the subjective prejudice on the other hand. I very much hope that people in the society will give me more well-intentioned criticisms and corrections. Naturally, before I get what I think is a better opinion, I doubt what I see. But I very much hope that there are better opinions to help my progress." This attitude of studying problems is very correct.

In short, the discussions in this "Talks on Spiritual Culture" can represent a most progressive philosophical thought of the present, and it is indeed a little crystallization of the author's hard work in thinking, and I would like to introduce it to the young people who are wandering on the forks in the road of spiritual and cultural thought.

### A Book Guiding Housekeeping: A Guide for Brides Going to America

— Yi

The U.S. Wartime Information Bureau has done a good job in guiding foreign brides or fiancées waiting to go to the United States in the past few years. In particular, the British branch has held lectures and housekeeping classes for brides, explaining the truth about the United States to these future American citizens. It has compiled a booklet called "A Guide for Brides Going to America," which is included with the British publication "Good Housekeeping." A part of this article explains American humor. Here is a paragraph that can be used as an example to see a glimpse.

"There are several kinds of spoken humor in the United States that you must learn carefully. You may not be very accustomed to joking, but you must learn. There is sometimes a bit of cancellation in joking, to see if you can handle it. There are many ways to please people, one of which is to make yourself the center of attention, even making fun of yourself, which is a very popular characteristic."

"Joking sometimes also carries a bit of insult out of affection, but Americans are not saints, and they also use insulting ways to express themselves when they are angry."

"Later you may retaliate with jokes. But be careful not to try when you are not very clear about how to joke."

Several chapters of this booklet talk about how to make friends in small cities, how to live in cities, how to manage a household, and what attitude to have.

### Publication of the Complete Ciano Diaries

— Shi Guo

When the sensational Ciano Diaries began to be serialized in newspapers, readers were somewhat disappointed. They felt that what Wells said, "the most valuable historical document of the contemporary era," was an exaggeration. But they actually didn't see the whole picture. Now that they have read this complete translated version of 600 pages, they will admit that the words of the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs are not exaggerated.

The circulation of this book is forever a wonderful story. Before Ciano was executed, he handed over six volumes of diaries to his wife, Edda, in prison. Edda then disguised herself as a pregnant woman and smuggled them to Switzerland. Then, a reporter from the Chicago Daily News immediately bought them at a high price, photographed them as a film, quickly transported them to the United States, and translated them hastily and published them in the newspaper. Everyone rushed to see them first. Now that Edda is imprisoned, some people are quite indignant, because she has the merit of preserving and circulating documents and should be awarded a medal of honor. How can she be given a taste of iron bars?

The "Ciano Diaries" faithfully exposes the crimes of fascism and the true nature of the monsters of Hitler and Mussolini, which cannot be forged by those who are not insiders. Wells proved the reliability of this diary, because Ciano had shown it to him before the war. Ciano was a man of vision and left valuable records for the turbulent era.

According to Wells' preface, Ciano was a man who disregarded faith and morality, a complete product of the degenerate era of Italy. He did not recognize international justice. But in all aspects, he was better than his father-in-law, his leader, and finally his executioner. He was humorous, witty, and good at humor. "He has some of the temperament of the Italians of the Renaissance."

Original title: The Ciano Diaries. 1939-1943. Compiled and translated by Hugh Gibson, published by Doubleday, 584 pages, priced at four U.S. dollars.
