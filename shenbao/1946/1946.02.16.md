The Chairman, accompanied by the music of the honor guard, alighted from the second black car. The Madam alighted and stood in front of the car, not moving forward. After the Chairman alighted, he took off his dark grey felt hat and, accompanied by Mayor Qian, reviewed the honor guard. The Chairman, looking solemn, approached the "Meiling" and boarded. The Madam did not accompany him. After the Chairman boarded, all the senior officers and soldiers seeing him off stood at attention and saluted. The Chairman looked out the window from the second window twice, to the left and right. As the plane started its engines and began to ascend, the Chairman waved goodbye frequently from the window for the third time to all circles before flying to Beijing. The time was 4:05 PM.

### Military Rehabilitation Conference Opens; Chairman Scheduled to Give Instructions Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The opening ceremony of the Military Rehabilitation Conference was held at the Army Headquarters at 9 AM this morning. Over two hundred generals attended. Commander-in-Chief He and Deputy Chief of Staff Bai delivered instructions successively until around 12 PM. Because the written reports submitted by the generals in attendance needed to be整理 (arranged), the afternoon session was cancelled. The conference is scheduled to continue at 9 AM on the 16th, when Chairman Chiang will personally deliver instructions.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] On the 16th, the second day of the Military Rehabilitation Conference, after the generals respectfully listened to Chairman's instructions, the 29 senior military organizations designated by the headquarters will report in turn, providing summaries of the current situation regarding troop reorganization, personnel equipment, the military, supply conditions, military education, training, health, local security, and pacification.

The instructions of Generals He and Bai have clearly indicated that the conference will pool collective wisdom to complete the important task of rehabilitation and troop reorganization in order to achieve the grand plan of national reconstruction and troop reduction.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The strict security and confidentiality of the Military Rehabilitation Conference is, in itself, unremarkable, but it has caused some reporters to wander and peer from Zhongshan East Gate and Zhujiang Road, more than a Chinese mile away from the venue, gazing at the towering Army Building. After that, what will you do?” Using the answers of approximately one hundred people, a small statistic was created, and the result was as follows: Approximately 30% wished to study, approximately 5% wished to become police officers, approximately 5% wished to engage in industry or mining, approximately 50% wished to return to farming, approximately 5% wished to become journalists, and approximately 5% wished to become representatives.

### Northeast Political Council Invites Mongolian Banner Committee Members to a Tea Party

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] The Political Committee of the Northeast Headquarters of the Generalissimo convened a tea party for Mongolian Banner members in Beiping at 3 PM on the 15th. Over five thousand Mongolian Banner members attended, unanimously expressing their absolute support for Chairman Chiang and the Central Government under the unified and complete sovereignty of the nation, hoping that the government would have a new understanding of Mongolia. The gathering dispersed happily at 5 PM.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 15th] The "Eastern Mongolian Autonomous" organization has seven departments, three of which are headed by Han Chinese, and is an organization that combines Mongolians and Han Chinese. This organization is different from the puppet local organization in Hailar because the anti-government elements in Hailar are more deeply rooted. It is heard that relevant Mongolian Banner parties here have dispatched personnel to Wangyemiao, hoping to reverse this adverse current. According to Bai Yunti, head of the Mongolian Banner Pacification Delegation, he and relevant parties have studied the Mongolian Banner issue multiple times, and it is generally agreed that a Mongolian Local Autonomous Committee should be established in the future, under the leadership of the Central Government, to handle local Mongolian Banner issues. This organization should be one that encompasses powerful figures from all sides of the Mongolian Banner and grants the Mongolian Banner people a relatively high degree of autonomy. If this can be achieved, the Mongolian Banner issue may not be difficult to resolve. He also stated that this idea has been drafted into a concrete plan and submitted to the government for review.

[United Press, Chongqing, 15th] The son of Prince De, the former chairman of the Japanese puppet regime in Inner Mongolia, has now become the leader of the "Eastern Mongolian Autonomous Republic." Both father and son advocate for Mongolian independence. Prince De chose the "Japanese path" and became a Japanese puppet, while his son chose the "Soviet path," having been trained in Moscow and becoming a staunch communist. After Japan's surrender, Prince De rejoined Chongqing and is now in Beiping, but his son, after residing in the Soviet Union for many years, entered the nomadic areas of the Northeast with the Red Army.

### Central Executive Committee Member and Southeast Pacification Commissioner Ye Chucang Passes Away from Illness Yesterday Morning; Funeral to be Held at China Funeral Home Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Ye Chucang, member of the Central Executive Committee and specially appointed Pacification Commissioner for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Nanjing, and Shanghai, was dispatched to Shanghai on December 11 of last year. He contracted a slight cold on the plane, and felt unwell after disembarking. Mayor Qian strongly urged him to be hospitalized for treatment, but Ye, feeling that his responsibility for pacification was too important to neglect, still forced himself to complete the task of pacifying the citizens of Shanghai. He met with representatives of the citizens and attended gatherings every day from dawn to late at night, never taking a break, which further weakened his health. He was admitted to the Fourth Municipal Hospital in Hongkou for treatment on the 20th, but his condition did not improve significantly. On January 6, he was transferred to the Municipal Sanatorium on Daxi Road for treatment. After undergoing diagnosis and treatment by various medical experts in Shanghai, and after Chairman entrusted President Qi Shounan of the Central Medical College to fly to Shanghai for diagnosis, it was determined that he had a lung disease caused by a cold and accumulated fatigue. Although famous doctors carefully studied and treated him, it was difficult to see results. His appetite decreased daily, and his spirit faded.

Sudden Change in Condition After Chairman Chiang arrived in Shanghai, he personally visited Ye on the 13th to express his condolences. Ye, feeling inspired,勉力起坐 (with effort started to get up), and the Chairman comforted him with gentle words, saying that he would telegraph President Qi to fly to Shanghai again to preside over the treatment. Unexpectedly, his condition suddenly changed at noon on the 14th, with rapid breathing and increased pulse. The attending physicians were helpless. He passed away at 4:40 AM on the 15th. His remains were immediately transferred to the China Funeral Home on Hague Road. The coffin sealing is scheduled for 3 PM on the 17th. Although he held important positions throughout his life, he never lost his scholar's character, striving for self-improvement, upholding public service, and abiding by the law. This was known throughout the country. His sudden demise has caused deep sorrow among those who heard of it.

Chairman Sends Condolences After hearing the news, Chairman Chiang sent Zhang Daofan, chairman of the Central Cultural Committee, to express condolences yesterday morning, and to express his condolences to Madam Ye. Various party and government figures in the city, including Mayor Qian Dajun, Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Zhonghang, Zhao Dihua, Wu Shaoshu, Hong Lanyou, and Wu Kaixian, have formed a funeral committee at the Min Guo Daily to handle funeral matters.

Short Commentary

### Mourning Mr. Ye Chucang

Amidst the cheers and celebrations of the citizens of Shanghai welcoming Chairman Chiang's arrival, the sad news of the passing of Mr. Ye Chucang, member of the Central Committee, was suddenly received. The scenery remains the same, but the joy has turned to sorrow. Expectations were high, but an elder statesman has abruptly departed. This is a major loss to the nation, and is more than just a personal emotional loss.

Mr. Ye began his career as an editor early in life, dedicating himself to the Party and the nation, enduring countless hardships. He possessed a deep understanding and cultivation of literature throughout his life. Therefore, he could not stop writing, and his writings were often insightful. His words could inspire the revolutionary tide and prevent the noble aspirations from falling. After leaving politics, he became even more diligent, vowing to be clean and honest, never seeking personal gain, and maintaining his spirit of hard work from beginning to end. In terms of talent, he was a treasure in the political world. In terms of qualifications, he was an advanced member of the press. We, as colleagues, have admired his brilliance and hoped to follow his example. How could we have imagined that just as the country was celebrating its recovery, he would suddenly close his eyes and no longer see? Many things are tangled together, making it difficult to bear.

However, the past is gone, and the dead cannot be brought back. Empty words of mourning are of no use. Those who are left behind must fulfill his wishes and carry them forward. We must offer suggestions and criticisms in accordance with public opinion, and we must conduct ourselves with integrity and uphold honesty. We, his colleagues, are not talented, but we are willing to encourage each other. May Mr. Ye's spirit watch over us.

Editorial

### Northeast China Issues of Concern to China and Foreign Countries

Half a year has passed since the Japanese invaders surrendered, but the issue of Northeast China, the initial trigger of World War II, has not been completely resolved. It has also been just half a year since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Alliance Treaty of Friendship, but the informal negotiations between China and the Soviet Union regarding the Northeast issue are still intermittent. The Soviet army has not yet withdrawn from Northeast China, and the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) is still stationed in Goubangzi and cannot enter Shenyang and Changchun. What exactly is going on here? Foreign and Chinese journalists in Shanghai are concerned about the Northeast issue. Compatriots across the country are concerned about the Northeast issue, and people all over the world are concerned about the Northeast issue. We cannot help but ask: What is the situation in Northeast China now?

Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from a reader in Goubangzi. After reading the following passage, we can get a general idea of ​​the current situation in Northeast China. He said:

"I arrived in Northeast China and originally planned to go home immediately to visit my relatives, but the transportation in Northeast China is also blocked, and there are frequent assassinations, which make it inconvenient for me to go home. It is heartbreaking to say. I have witnessed the factories and residences built by the Japanese in the area from Shanhaiguan to Jinzhou being completely destroyed by the Communist army. According to the common people, after a certain army transported the machines away, the Communist army gathered poor people to demolish the houses, so it is really a problem for the national government's personnel to find places to live in Northeast China. The destruction is too regrettable! Compatriots in Northeast China in areas without the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) are suffering from heavy taxes and levies, sinking deeper and deeper into the water and fire. Therefore, compatriots are eagerly hoping to restore order as soon as possible. If I hadn't witnessed the tragic destruction, I wouldn't have believed that the suffering of compatriots is even greater than during the Japanese occupation. The slogans of the Communist army in Northeast China gave me a repulsive impression of the Communist Party: 'Support Marshal Stalin and build a Soviet Federal Government of China.' They have completely forgotten why China had the War of Resistance Against Japan! The common people all said: 'Now it is not as good as the puppet Manchukuo era, because at least there was some guarantee of life at that time.' The Communist army has no discipline at all and does not listen to the orders from above. They are too big to be controlled. Standing from the perspective of the people, we are really worried about the future of the country."

According to a report from our newspaper in Nanjing, the report that Zhang Xinfu, the acting special envoy to the Northeast of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and others were killed has been confirmed. It is reported that on January 16, Mr. Zhang accompanied Soviet personnel from Pan Yang to Fushun to discuss the takeover of coal mines in the area when he was murdered on the way. Seven attendants and guards also died at the same time. At that time, the Fushun mining area had been transferred from the Soviet army to the control of the Communist army. By cross-referencing this fact, which has been officially acknowledged, with the report from the reader's letter cited earlier, it is not difficult to see what kind of world Northeast China is today.

Foreign journalists asked on the 13th about "the date when the Soviet army will completely withdraw from the nine provinces of Northeast China," and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave a very subtle answer, saying that "the Soviet army had originally agreed to withdraw from Northeast China before February 1." So half a month has passed since that date, and the NRA has been continuously heading there. Why is the Soviet army delaying its withdrawal? What economic issues do China and the Soviet Union still need to discuss? On the Chinese side, as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "there is nothing that cannot be disclosed to the public," and we reporters only hope that the government will announce and report the development of the Northeast issue of concern to China and foreign countries at any time. We believe that if the world truly wants to maintain peace in the future, there is hope only if everything is open and discussed clearly. Especially China, which has just entered the ranks of the great powers, has an even greater need for frankness and openness.

The "Open Door" policy, that is, all countries have equal trade opportunities. The report that an agreement has been reached between China and the Soviet Union to allow the Soviet Union to obtain certain economic rights in the nine provinces of Northeast China "has not been officially reported." It can be seen that American personnel are also very concerned about the Northeast issue. We trace the current troubles in Northeast China to the secret agreement between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in Yalta. On the 11th of this month, the anniversary of the Yalta Conference, Washington, London, and Moscow simultaneously announced the three secret conditions proposed by the Soviet Union for participating in the war against Japan: (1) The Soviet Union was to participate in the Far East war within three months after Germany's surrender; (2) The status of the Mongolian People's Republic should remain unchanged; (3) The Soviet Union's rights before "Japan's perfidious attack in 1904" (i.e., the Russo-Japanese War) should be restored, including (A) the return of the southern part of Sakhalin Island and its adjacent islands – referring to the Kuril Islands – to the Soviet Union, (B) Dalian was to be opened as an international port, and Lushun was to be returned to the Soviet Union for lease, (C) China and the Soviet Union were to jointly manage the Chinese Eastern Railway and the South Manchurian Railway. The original announcement also stated that the Soviet Union's main interests could be guaranteed by this plan; China should maintain "complete sovereignty" over Manchuria. The agreement acknowledged that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek must agree to the agreements on Outer Mongolia, Dalian, Lushun, and the railways, and "President (Roosevelt) was advised by Marshal Stalin to take various measures to obtain this agreement." We learned about these secret conditions one year later, and we should deeply appreciate the significance and origin of the Sino-Soviet Treaty. What we cannot be relieved about is that China, to this day, has not fully exercised the "complete vitality" that it should maintain in the nine provinces of Northeast China!

China today is known as one of the five major powers, but we are still silent about our own problems, about the Northeast issue that has been on our minds for fifteen years, and we still cannot express our wishes. The Chinese are really "generous" enough! The new friendly relationship between China and the Soviet Union is based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty signed on August 14 last year. What is stipulated in this treaty coincides with the terms listed in the memorandum of the Yalta Conference announced at this time. Since the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship is a treaty concluded between China and the Soviet Union, China and the Chinese people respect and value this treaty very much. In the Soviet Union, today it wants to inherit the privileges taken from China by the Tsarist Russian era, and in addition to inheriting the privileges of Tsarist Russia in China, it also demands that the status of the "Mongolian People's Republic" be maintained unchanged. This presents a very interesting, and at the same time, very regrettable contrast to the Soviet Union's statement after 1917 renouncing the privileges of Tsarist Russia in China. However, with the tragic mood of a hero breaking his arm, in order to ensure peace in the Far East and even world peace, we ultimately signed a new treaty with the Soviet Union and built a foundation of friendship. The dignity of this treaty should be respected. However, the situation in Northeast China has never been clear for several months. Under the current circumstances, tolerating silence may still be necessary for the government, but what do the general Chinese people think in their hearts? Which side does not respect this treaty? The various parties and factions that often claim to represent the people, as well as social figures, do they have any spare time after discussing politics and fighting for power?

Under this rather serious situation, where the Chinese are still "tight-lipped," we are encouraged by the statement by US Secretary of State Byrnes reaffirming the "Open Door" policy. The so-called "Open Door" policy originally included two points: the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty, and the equality of trade opportunities for all countries in China. This is one of the two pillars of American foreign policy, the Pan-Americanism that evolved from the Monroe Doctrine and the "Open Door" in the Far East. The beginning of this policy was due to Northeast China fifty years ago. For fifty years, the "Open Door" policy can be said to be deeply connected with Northeast China. Japan wanted to undermine the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty and the equality of trade opportunities for all countries in China. From the continuous artillery fire in Shenyang, it eventually evolved into the Pearl Harbor incident and the outbreak of the Pacific War. To maintain this national policy, many American men died on the barren islands of the Pacific, in the Philippines, and in the Ryukyus. Now that the Japanese invaders have collapsed and victory is in hand, the situation in Northeast China is still unclear, and there are many signs that the developing situation is incompatible with the principles of the "Open Door" policy. China's Northeast is not only an issue related to China, but an issue that affects world peace and security. Not only did Japanese Tanaka already believe that conquering Manchuria and Mongolia would lead to the conquest of China, and conquering China would lead to the conquest of the world, but the New York Times recently pointed out that controlling the nine provinces of Northeast China is the key to controlling China, and controlling China can control the entire Asia. It can be seen that if the nine provinces of Northeast China are not fully returned to China in accordance with the Open Door Declaration, peace in Asia and even world peace will be threatened. The reaffirmation of the "Open Door" policy by the US Secretary of State at this time makes its significance even more profound.

The key to maintaining peace in the Pacific after the war lies in the relationship between China and the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain. China has no territorial or political ambitions, which our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly declared to China and foreign countries. But it goes without saying that we must ensure our inherent and acquired rights and interests. Since we have already made various concessions to ensure peace after the war, we cannot continue to make concessions beyond these concessions. Concessions are ultimately limited. If the "Open Door" policy abandons ensuring the integrity of China's sovereignty and territory, there will be no so-called "equality of trade councils in China." It is really necessary to clarify the situation in Northeast China as soon as possible; and in the effort to clarify the situation in Northeast China, it seems that this is not entirely a matter between China and the Soviet Union, but requires the joint cooperation of our allies. Now that the secret agreement on Yalta has been announced, in addition to the direct efforts of China and the Soviet Union to clarify the situation in Northeast China, it is not difficult to see the international relations involved. We are willing for everyone to frankly report the truth about the Northeast issue, and we hope that everyone will openly and publicly discuss the Northeast issue and express their own wishes.

### Speculative Market Receives a Head-On Blow, Authorities Inspect Securities Firms, Decisive Action Taken Against Illegal Trading, Small Money Shops Engaging in Improper Business Will Be Shut Down

(Our Newspaper) In recent days, speculative market trading in the city has been in full swing, with securities and foreign currencies all rising frantically in a straight line, setting new records since the victory.

Implementation of Securities Firm Inspection

At around 8:00 AM yesterday, specially appointed personnel from the Financial and Monetary Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance stationed in Beijing and Shanghai, together with police officers, went directly to the Huashang Securities Exchange Building on Hankou Road in this city to resolutely implement inspections of all securities firms. This was the first time since the victory that the government had intervened in the speculative market. When the inspection team arrived at the building, they immediately posted the announcement prepared by the Special Commissioner's Office at the main entrance, and sealed off the main door of the building leading to Hankou Road, leaving only the door on Jiujiang Road open for passage. The inspectors then boarded the building and inspected each securities firm one by one, reviewing the account books of each firm and extracting the facts. At the same time, they also inspected people entering and leaving the building, but did not seal off any firms or arrest anyone. The speculative trading in securities and foreign currencies was thus temporarily curbed.

Speculation Strictly Punished According to Law

The announcement from the Special Commissioner's Office is recorded as follows: "In accordance with Article 7 of the Regulations for Handling Exchanges in the Beijing-Shanghai Area: 'During the liquidation period, exchanges shall not engage in any trading activities, and shall notify their commissioned brokers and firms that they shall not engage in any customer trading activities during the exchange's suspension period. If there is a violation, in addition to the fact that the law will not protect such trading activities, the broker's qualification shall be revoked.' It is reported that brokers and securities firms in the Huashang Securities Exchange Building in this city are sometimes engaged in customer trading, speculation, and manipulation of gold, foreign exchange, and securities, which is improper. In addition to sending personnel to conduct strict investigations and impose severe punishments according to law, this announcement is hereby issued to warn them not to violate it, lest it cause inconvenience. Financial and Monetary Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance stationed in Beijing and Shanghai, Cai Zi No. 5, Special Commissioner Chen Xing, February 15th, 35th year of the Republic of China."

The authorities resolutely implemented inspections of the brokers and their firms under the jurisdiction of the securities exchange yesterday to see if they had engaged in speculation, manipulation, and illegal trading. If the facts are verified, not only will the broker's qualification be revoked, but if the circumstances are serious, in addition to investigating the firm, the person in charge will also be handed over to the court for interrogation, so that the speculators know to be vigilant. It is also reported that the authorities are deeply indignant at the small money shops in the Sichuan Road area of this city, which do not engage in proper business and often engage in illegal speculative trading in securities and foreign currencies. The authorities have already sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau ordering them to be shut down, and will take decisive action if necessary.

Wealthy households have flocked to the speculative market to buy gold bars, while the middle and upper classes have flocked to silver shops to buy jewelry as asset protection, with the market price of jewelry reaching as high as 166,000 yuan per tael. Yesterday morning, the authorities thoroughly investigated the speculative market, and the frenzied situation immediately stopped.

The workers' union submitted a written proposal to the management of various newspapers on the afternoon of the 13th: "Starting from February, the salaries and allowances of workers will be calculated based on the rise and fall of the 'workers' cost of living index' published by the authorities. The base number will be the average of 55 yuan per worker in the 20th year (1931)." They were given a deadline of this afternoon to reply. According to sources from the union, the union has received replies from various newspapers, either in writing or verbally, but they are all vague and difficult to satisfy the workers. The workers' emotions are very tense, and they are preparing to apply to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for mediation in accordance with the law.

### Trial of Japanese War Criminals: Confessions Read in Court; Defendant Admits to Strangling American Pilot

[United Press Local Dispatch] The American Military Tribunal yesterday continued the trial of those who murdered American pilots in Hankou. Signed confessions from three Japanese corporals were read, admitting to strangling three American pilots with ropes under orders.

According to the confession of Warrant Officer Fujii Tsutomu of the Hankou Japanese Military Police, before midnight on December 16, 1944, he went to the crematorium. The three American pilots were fatigued from marching and severely beaten, unable to stand. They were placed on the ground, and the ropes binding their hands were untied and wrapped around their necks. Fujii held one end of the rope for one of the pilots, helping to strangle him until his breath ceased, then released the rope. The other two American pilots were also strangled at the same time. The bodies were then loaded onto a vehicle and put into the crematorium furnace. This execution was carried out under the orders of Lieutenant Colonel Hattori, Commander of the Hankou Military Police, who committed suicide by poison before being arrested. The confessions of Shirakawa and Hisamatsu Minoru were largely the same as Fujii's, stating they acted under orders from superiors. These confessions were obtained in Hankou, with the assistance of Lieutenant Colonel Matsuura of the 34th Army Headquarters of Japan. When presented today, the defendant's defense lawyer objected, claiming the confessions were coerced and arguing that the United States no longer had extraterritorial rights in China, requesting the case be dismissed. The court did not comment but denied the request.

Sentencing Next Week: Over half of the war criminals' confessions have been read, and the rest may be completed today, to be reviewed by the presiding judge and jurors. Next Monday, the defendant's defense lawyer, Harkins, will read his rebuttal evidence, followed by formal arguments and sentencing.

### Various Groups Forming Committee to Protect People's Freedom

Since the Political Consultative Conference advocated for the protection of people's freedom and stipulated in the second provision of the Peace and National Construction Report that "local councils, bar associations, and representatives of people's organizations shall jointly organize a people's freedom protection committee," it has been learned that representatives from the city's bar association, chamber of commerce, local association, education association, farmers' association, student federation, accountants' association, and other people's organizations, as well as Shanghai-based senators, have jointly initiated preparations and are actively planning to establish the Shanghai People's Freedom Protection Committee.

### High Court Hears Two Treason Cases

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the Criminal Division of the High Court, presided over by Judge Cao Jun, handled the case of traitors Bin Li'er and Han Jian. Details are as follows:

Zhang Zhishan: Zhang Zhishan, former Chief of the Xujiahui Branch of the Overseas Police Bureau, and Patrolman Ma Junqing, abused their power to seize the residence of traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Chen Fengming, evicting Chen and his co-tenants. Chen recently filed a complaint, but the defendants have not been apprehended. Only the complainant appeared in court yesterday to testify. The court ordered a postponement for further hearing.

Gu Guoxiong: Gu Guoxiong, a secret agent for the enemy's Shanghai Southern Military Police in Penglai Road, collaborated with the enemy military police to arrest Yang Jiaji, the director of the Pudong branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, during the war. Yang Jiaji and his brother Yang Weier reported Gu to the authorities, leading to his arrest. The High Procuratorate investigated and confirmed the facts, prosecuting him for treason. However, the defendant claimed in court yesterday that he was a menial worker in the enemy military police, not a secret agent. Regarding the arrest of Yang Jiaji, he claimed that the translator was absent that day, so he was ordered to accompany them, and he had also provided information to underground workers. Witness Dun Zhizhang testified that he was a primary school teacher who worked for the city party headquarters during the war, engaging in underground work. He had a teacher-student relationship with the defendant, from whom he obtained information. The defendant had notified him several times that the enemy military police would arrest principals of municipal schools, etc. He reported the information to the party headquarters, but he did not know if the information was accurate. As the complainant was absent, the court ordered the case to be detained for further examination.

### Authorities Strictly Cracking Down on Speculation: Gold Market Trading Halts

US Dollars, Government Bonds, and Stocks All Lack Formal Market Prices

Yesterday, due to the authorities taking decisive action against the Stock Exchange Building, a large number of personnel were dispatched to guard all entrances and exits before 9:00 AM, assisted by armed personnel. Initially, exits were prohibited, then entrances. Simultaneously, those exiting were searched. Finally, the eastern entrance of Jiujiang Road was opened, and the account books of each room in the Stock Exchange Building were randomly inspected. The situation was serious, and speculators and retail investors were deterred, causing the market to effectively halt. Unofficial black market transactions were initially around 1.5 million, dropping to below 1.4 million at the lowest point, and around 1.4 million at noon. Gold shops initially quoted 160,000, then lowered it to 158,000, before suspending quotations altogether. Silver ingots remained at 1,600, silver dollars at 750 to 800 yuan. Black market interest rates remained high, as speculators were unwilling to release funds, with interest rates ranging from 20% to 25%.

Foreign Exchange: Money changers dealing in US dollars were also intimidated by the authorities' serious measures and did not publicly trade. The previous day's transactions became a suspended issue, difficult to resolve, resulting in no formal public trading. In the black market, a small number of transactions occurred at 2,000 yuan, eventually settling at 1,960 to 2,000 yuan. Hong Kong dollars, due to the yarn and cloth merchants settling payments, saw a large number of old banknotes and telegrams exchanged at 350 to 370 yuan. New banknotes continued to quote previous purchase prices. Due to their highly speculative nature, trading became difficult after the crackdown.

Government Bonds and Chinese and foreign stocks were unable to convene, resulting in no formal market prices. Only Second-Class bonds declined from 1,800 yuan to 1,700 yuan, with a slight amount of matched trades.

### Major Commodity Prices Fall Amid Crackdown on Speculation

Rice

Yesterday, the rice market saw a softening of sentiment as gold prices were suspended. All grains declined in unison, with medium to low-quality Japonica and Indica rice falling by 500 to 600 yuan. Flour decreased by 300 to 400 yuan. Soybeans plummeted by over 1,000 yuan. Oil prices also decreased by varying amounts of 2,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were oversupplied, continuing to decrease by 500 to 600 yuan. Bran also fell by 100 yuan. Only raw peanuts remained stable.

Yarn

Yesterday, the yarn market fluctuated sharply. In the early morning, sentiment collapsed due to news of the authorities' ban on speculative trading in gold, US dollars, etc. 20-count Double Horse yarn once fell to a low of 880,000, and Blue Phoenix reached 835,000. However, this was fleeting, as buyers rushed in, and Blue Phoenix rebounded to 900,000, while Double Horse again approached the one million mark. The situation was slightly firmer as a result. The closing price for coarse yarn was approximately 40,000 to 50,000 lower than yesterday. However, 42-count yarn declined more significantly due to slower sales. Opening lower by 150,000 yuan, selling pressure intensified, and it once fell to 1.68 million yuan. The closing price was a massive 270,000 yuan lower than the previous day.

Cloth

The cloth market was affected by the sharp decline in yarn prices, and market prices also declined, by varying amounts of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The Textile Construction Company offered 42-yard Ruyi bleached cloth at 68,000 yuan, 40-yard Blue Peacock bleached cloth at 62,000 yuan, 42-yard Jumping Carp bleached cloth at 55,000 yuan, 30-yard Jumping Carp natural-color twill at 26,500 yuan, 1038 bleached cloth at 58,000 yuan, and 6038 bleached cloth at 64,000 yuan.

Cotton

Yesterday, trading in spot cotton was less active. Due to the strong downward trend in the yarn market, the Textile Construction Company suddenly adopted a wait-and-see attitude, with only other factories engaging in scattered trading. Prices were lower than the previous day, with Da Zhongji declining by 4,000 yuan.

Silk

Yesterday, speculators in the silk market were cautious, resulting in a quiet market. No transactions occurred in rayon. Off-market, 120 Tiao Qiao spot goods from Heji were sold for 2.1 million yuan. Warehouse receipts were quoted around 1.2 million to 1.25 million yuan, with no accurate market prices. Sentiment was weak, and most market participants remained on the sidelines. Factory owners with inventory were unwilling to sell cheaply, with prices similar to the previous day, and trading was virtually halted. In silk fabrics, Meiya satin was quoted at 1.2 million yuan per hundred strips in the morning, falling to 1.16 million yuan. The price cut [illegible characters] was approximately 10% lower than the previous day. Minsheng brocade and Linji wax-feathered gauze maintained their original asking prices.

### On "Fables"

— Xiaoshan

The universe originally had no fables, nor did it need them. Everyone could speak honestly to everyone else.

Fables exist to adapt to certain environments and characters. They are commonly used in two places: within superstitious circles and within autocratic circles.

In Greece and India, people were intensely devoted to "ghosts." A snake, a tree, a pile of stones, a toad—any of these could become their "Buddha." Their superstition was as stubborn as stone, and ordinary speech couldn't penetrate their ears. One had to go around in a big circle, telling fables and making comparisons, in the hope that they might understand a little. Thus, these two places became major producers of fables.

Ancient Roman fables were also famous. This was because their "tyrants" were particularly authentic. People faced unexpected consequences for saying anything too clear. They had no choice but to rely on fables, using cats and dogs to make satirical remarks!

Everyone has a mouth, not just for eating but also for speaking. What a torment it is if you want to say something but can't, or aren't allowed to! To clearly speak of a person, yet having to "embody the person in a dog," to "start from the dog"—how suffocating is that?

Even more unbearable is when the person being represented, being referred to, clearly knows that "the dog is me," yet is hindered by the distinction between human face and dog face, unable to directly acknowledge it, and can only quip, "He's talking about a dog; it has nothing to do with me!" Or, even more outrageously, to "reveal oneself": "A dog is just a dog; what do you think of my colors?"

For someone without ears, no matter how exquisite your metaphors or abundant your fables, the result is still "a couple of 'woof woof' bites!" Therefore, despite the abundance of fables, their harvest often equals grapes leftover after a great wind.

I hope fables will diminish soon, and direct people will no longer speak indirectly. I also hope those who are "embodied" will conduct themselves with self-respect. Otherwise, even if no one calls you a dog, your insides will still frankly admit to having a dog's heart and dog's guts.

### Rare News: Strange Rain

— Huang Jiali

What comes down from the sky most commonly are rain, snow, frost, mist, and hail. Sometimes, during strong winds, sand and stones will fly. In this World War, besides bombs from airplanes, the landing of paratroopers is the newest spectacle—truly, "flying generals descending from the sky." This kind of rain of bombs and people can also be called strange rain, but it is man-made and not inherently incomprehensible. The strange rain described here involves water columns and fish rain, as well as other animals.

Imagine suddenly having a large number of lively fish, frogs, and similar animals falling from the sky like rain—it is an extremely extraordinary event. No wonder many people refuse to believe such events occur. However, on June 17, 1939, The Times of London carried this news. According to the supervisor of the municipal swimming pool in Swansea, Wales, around 4:30 PM on that day, there was a heavy rain shower. He hurried to escape, and as he ran, he heard a sound behind him, presuming it was the sound of clumps of mud falling. He said:

"I turned around and was greatly astonished to see thousands of small frogs falling on the concrete path around the swimming pool. It stopped in a matter of seconds, each small frog being about the size of a fingertip. I swept them up and shoveled them into buckets."

A curious newspaper reporter followed up on this report with a special interview, interviewing people who had witnessed the small frogs falling from the sky firsthand. British Army Lieutenant Colonel Owen published a document in the newspaper stating that when he was in Batangri, India, after a strong wind and rain, he rode his horse across the parade ground. He found that three or four acres of the ground were completely covered with small fish, the size of whitebait or small sardines.

Newspapers around the world frequently carry many other similar strange events. Below is one such strange event reported in an American newspaper:

During a storm in Providence, Rhode Island, active bass and [illegible character] suddenly fell from the sky onto the streets, some as long as five inches. One-quarter of an acre was covered with these fish. One man who was in the rain at the time said that he was not only hit by the rain but also by the fish! Many children picked up many fish in buckets to sell, while another person picked up a full bucket and displayed it openly in a shop window.

But the strange rain that falls from the sky is not limited to fish rain and frog rain. Most of these strange events involve aquatic or amphibious animals. I have recorded the animals that have fallen from the sky as reported in newspapers, including the following: Toads falling in Charentay, on the Saône River in France; whitefish falling from the sky in Uganda, Africa (the nearest river being thirty miles away); jellyfish falling in Bath, England; small geckos falling in Montreal, Canada; a shower of tadpoles falling in New York City; a shower of mice falling in Norway; a snail rain in Lerums; a red worm rain in Halmstad; and a large shower of brown worms falling in Clifton, Indiana, USA, along with a two-foot-long live alligator.

Perhaps the strangest rain that has fallen in Britain was the one that occurred in Worcester in 1881. After a storm, the streets were covered with periwinkles and crabs that had fallen from the sky. It was said that as many as ten sacks of periwinkles were collected and sold in the market. One man collected two large sacks of periwinkles in his private garden. But Worcester is fifty miles from the sea!

The only explanation for this strange rain is that water columns picked up by tornadoes from lakes and seas can lift several tons of seawater four hundred and twenty feet high. At the same time, a large group of frogs, fish, periwinkles, or other animals in the water are naturally also easily picked up and carried by the strong winds to places tens of miles away. When the water column breaks down, they fall in places that no one can predict.

Anecdotes

### Parrots Can Talk

— Zhongyi

Previously, a rumor was circulating in Oslo, the capital of Norway, that a certain citizen was raising a parrot that could say "Down with Hitler!" Rumors always spread extremely quickly. As the rumor spread, it eventually reached the ears of the Nazi "Gestapo," who immediately warned the parrot's owner that they were preparing to pay him a visit! The possible consequences of a visit from the "Gestapo" were beyond doubt. In a state of worry and fear, he sought help from the local pastor. The kind pastor immediately taught him a way to avoid disaster, promising to lend him his own parrot while hiding the man's parrot in the pastor's home.

Sure enough, the "Gestapo" arrived. They questioned him about why he taught the parrot to say "Down with Hitler," insulting their leader. Calmly, the Norwegian replied, "My parrot's cries contain no political meaning. Please do not wrongly accuse me."

But the "Gestapo" were not so easily dismissed. One of them immediately walked over to the parrot and shouted, "Down with Hitler!" The parrot remained silent and unresponsive. He repeated it several times, but the parrot still did not make a sound. As a result, the other two "Gestapo" members joined his ranks. The three of them, united, loudly shouted, "Down with Hitler!" "Down with Hitler!"...

"Amen!" The pastor's parrot cleverly responded.
