[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Today marked the third meeting since the formal resumption of the military three-person group. The discussions have generally been satisfactory. However, the crucial element for peace talks remains in the next five days. Of the three major issues that must be resolved in this meeting, the first two have already been agreed upon, while the most important issue of troop reorganization has yet to be formally discussed.

### Authorities in Beijing Arrest Perpetrators of the "Xiaguan Incident"; Responsible Police Chief Dismissed

The CCP Prepares a Memorandum to Send to the Three-Person Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Regarding the situation at Xiaguan Railway Station last night, when this reporter left Xiaguan at 10:30 PM, I saw refugees gathered in front of the station. After 11:00 PM, the refugees insisted on Ma Xulun appearing, but Ma refused to leave his room, leading to the beating incident. According to statistics, those injured included Ma Xulun from Shanghai, Lei Jieqiong, Chen Zhenzhong, Pu Xixiu (reporter from Xinmin Daily), Gao Ji (reporter from Ta Kung Pao), Xu Bin (reporter from Yi Shi Bao), Xu Shinian (reporter from Da Zhong Bao), Qian Jiangchao (information officer of the municipal government), a passerby, Ji Zeng, a police officer from the Military Police Corps, Gao Chengxiang, a platoon leader of the military police, and Liao Qixian and Li Zhengcai, station military police. The injuries varied in severity. After the incident, they were escorted to the Central Hospital for treatment by the Garrison Headquarters. As for the perpetrators, the military police authorities arrested Tang Shouhua, Zhang Mingyuan, Cao Chuansen, Jing Changfa, Wang Minghua, Han Xuechun, Yan Yiping, and Lu Qi amidst the chaos. They are currently detained at the headquarters of the First Military Police Regiment and will be investigated according to the law.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Ministry of Interior has taken seriously the clash that occurred last night at Nanjing's Xiaguan Railway Station between refugees from northern Jiangsu and those so-called anti-civil war petitioners from Shanghai. Yu Zhan, the chief of the police station responsible for the area, was dismissed for failing to prevent the incident. Yu Yiqun, the chief of the Xiaguan Police Bureau, was given a major demerit, and Han Wenfu, the chief of the Capital Police Department, was given a reprimand. Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Interior stated that he would order his subordinates to provide thorough protection for social order and the safety of the people at all times.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The CCP delegation prepared a memorandum regarding the "Xiaguan Incident," which was divided into three points, mainly requesting guarantees that similar incidents would not occur in the future, and the punishment of the perpetrators, etc. It was rushed to the three-person meeting at 10:00 PM tonight.

### Sympathy for the Plight of Refugees is Natural, But Violence is Inexcusable: Spokesperson for the Central Propaganda Department Expresses Opinion

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] When asked about the public clash at Xiaguan Railway Station last night, the spokesperson for the Central Propaganda Department replied as follows: "The clash at Nanjing's Xiaguan Railway Station last night between refugees from northern Jiangsu and those so-called anti-civil war petitioners from Shanghai is regrettable. While we sympathize with the plight of the distressed refugees, their resort to violence is inexcusable. It is especially regrettable that reporters from Xinmin Daily, Ta Kung Pao, and Yi Shi Bao, as well as several military police officers, were injured. The local authorities will thoroughly investigate and punish those responsible for the violence to serve as a warning. At a time when the government and American friends are working hard to find a peaceful solution, all movements inciting the masses must be stopped. Such incitement will inevitably cause disturbances, even bloodshed, and hinder the progress of peace talks."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Today, Minister Peng Xuefeng of the Central Propaganda Department sent Secretary Deng Youde and Deputy Director Huang Xiangshan to the Beijing offices of Ta Kung Pao, Yi Shi Bao, and Xinmin Daily to express condolences to reporters Gao Ji, Xu Bin, and Pu Xixiu, who were mistakenly injured by refugees.

Number of Injured

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Yesterday's edition of this newspaper briefly reported on the attack on Ma Xulun and others by refugees from northern Jiangsu at Xiaguan last night. According to further investigation by our reporter today, Ma Xulun, Lei Jieqiong, Chen Zhenzhong, Yan Baohang, Ye Duyi (representative of the China Democratic League), and reporters from Ta Kung Pao, Xinmin Daily, and Yi Shi Bao, a total of ten people, were injured in the chaos. Last night, the local military police dispersed the crowd and transported them to the Central Hospital branch on Taiping Road. Except for Ma Xulun, Chen Zhenzhong, Lei Jieqiong, Yan Baohang, and Ye Duyi, who were hospitalized for rest, the others left the hospital after receiving treatment. From 2:00 AM to 10:00 AM this morning, Zhou Enlai, Deng Yingchao, Teng Daiyuan, Guo Moruo, and Shao Lizi visited to express their condolences. The hospitalized individuals were transferred to the main Central Hospital on Huangpu Road at 11:00 AM this morning. In the afternoon, Li Dequan, the wife of Feng Yuxiang, and others visited the hospital. According to the doctors, all five suffered external injuries and were not in serious condition. They can be discharged after two or three days of rest. When the reporter saw Ma Xulun, Ma had just woken up from a nap. He had no visible injuries on his face and was in good spirits. He was lying leisurely in bed, wearing a white silk short shirt and trousers. Ms. Lei Jieqiong, a professor at Soochow University, had the most serious injuries, with only a scratch on the corner of her right eye from glass and some bruises on both arms. Her body temperature was normal, and she had a long conversation with the reporter. Chen Zhenzhong was hit on the head but has recovered. Yan Baohang, the manager of Shanghai Daming Company, claimed he was temporarily pulled into the petitioning group and was upset about injuring his right eye.

Reports from Various Individuals

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Bao Dasan, Zhang Xiangbo, Sheng Pihua, Huang Yanfang, and Chen Lifu, who are considered representatives of the people, gave an oral report on the Xiaguan incident yesterday at a meeting between the third party and government representatives. Huang Yanfang reported on the petitioning process and the circumstances of their departure from Shanghai. Sheng Pihua reported on the circumstances of being beaten at Xiaguan last night. Zhang Xiangbo reported on the purpose of their petition in Beijing and their mission. Chen Lifu, a student representative, told the reporter that the purpose of the petition was to address the rising prices in Shanghai so that students could have a place to study in peace. This reporter interviewed the five representatives separately. They believe that apart from recovering the items lost during the beatings, they do not wish to pursue legal action.

Shao Lizi Speaks

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Regarding the incident last night in which the so-called representatives of the people of Shanghai were beaten at Xiaguan, it is now being referred to as the "Xiaguan Incident." Today, this reporter asked Mr. Shao Lizi for his views on the "Xiaguan Incident." Shao said, "I believe that the attitude of their representatives is very good. At the same time, they also want to downplay the matter and not pursue legal action. This attitude is very good."

Ulterior Motives

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Today, this reporter visited various parties to inquire about the details of the incident in which Ma Xulun and others were beaten by refugees. It is reported that the government was unaware of this matter beforehand, resulting in injuries to the municipal government information officer and four military police officers, which was witnessed by the public. The security authorities are currently investigating the truth of the incident and have already apprehended eight people at the scene, who will be dealt with impartially according to the law. It is also said by qualified individuals that the feelings of grief and anger among the refugees from northern Jiangsu have reached a boiling point, bordering on desperation. They not only hate the Communists but also often complain about the government's forbearance. The seriousness of the refugee problem is well-known. To say that the refugees caused the incident or were instigated by the government is either speculation or motivated by ulterior motives. The government is able to treat the CCP and other party members with courtesy and allow them to gather in the capital to discuss national affairs openly, so why would it fear a few people like Ma Xulun and others who claim to be people's representatives coming to Beijing to petition? Clearly, those who are deliberately exaggerating the incident and blaming the government are doing so because Ma Xulun and others were not killed and a bloody incident was not created.

### Spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense Rebukes CCP Suggestions (Continued from Yesterday)

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] As for (1) the first point raised by the CCP representatives, which states, "The three-person meeting should immediately announce a long-term truce in the Northeast and reaffirm the national truce order. Regarding the truce order, the government has already issued it twice, and both times it was agreed to by the Communist side. However, it has been completely violated by the Communist army. Therefore, whether the truce order can be effective depends entirely on the Communist army's sincerity in complying with it. If the Communist army immediately ceases all offensives, then complete peace can be achieved immediately. Why wait for the order to be reaffirmed?" (2) The second point raised by the CCP representatives states, "The three-person meeting should immediately negotiate concrete measures to restore national transportation and first repair important railways." Regarding the restoration of national transportation, it has been specifically mentioned in previous truce orders. After the Japanese surrender and before the truce order was issued, all railways in North China were unobstructed. After the truce order was issued, the Communist Party took advantage of the National Army's compliance with the truce order and lack of reinforcements for defense to launch a major attack on the railways from the mountains, seizing cities and destroying the nation's arteries in sections. Except for the Beining Railway, which can barely maintain full-line traffic but is still subject to attacks, the remaining lines have been severely damaged by the Communist army. After February of this year, the three members of the military three-person group, [General George C.] Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai, issued an agreement to restore transportation immediately. The Beijing Executive Headquarters issued Order No. 4 on February 11 to implement it. The Ministry of Transportation also prepared personnel and equipment to repair the railways and organized engineering teams to begin repairs, but all were obstructed by the Communist army and could not proceed. On March 10, the three members, Marshall, Zhang, and Zhou, inspected various places in North China and personally witnessed the cities and towns along the railways being besieged by the Communist army and the transportation being obstructed. Three agreements were also established: 1. Lift the siege of various cities; 2. Remove restrictions on the freedom of movement of the people; 3. Do not delay the restoration of railways on any pretext. However, the Communist army in various places not only continued to obstruct repairs but also intensified the destruction. Millions of people are still displaced and unable to return home. (3) The third point proposed by the CCP representatives: "The three-person meeting should periodically negotiate concrete supplementary measures for troop reorganization and demobilization in the country and the Northeast." Since the two sides signed the basic plan for troop reorganization and the integration of CCP troops into the National Army on February 25 of this year, the government has followed the regulations, submitted rosters on time, and implemented the reorganization. It has now entered the second phase and will be completed on time. However, the Communist side has not yet followed the provisions of Article 4 of the plan to submit the preliminary work plan for the reorganization of its troops, including the nature, strength, weapons, names of commanders above the brigade level, and the locations of various units to the military group. The Communist army's lack of sincerity in implementing the reorganization is evident. (4) The fourth point proposed by the CCP is even more hollow and unrealistic. Before the military conflict can be stopped, to mention the convening of a political consultative conference and equating political issues with the truce order is the height of their delaying tactics. Stopping the conflict, restoring transportation, and implementing the troop reorganization plan are the urgent priorities at present. If the Communist army acts with sincerity, these three issues can be resolved on time, and political issues can also be solved easily. If the Communist side continues to create unnecessary obstacles and attempts to delay time, then its responsibility for destroying peace and unity and hindering national construction will be even more obvious. (End)

The people of northern Jiangsu, unable to endure the Communist army's harassment, have fled to other places, especially Zhenjiang. The upper picture shows the tragic situation of refugees living in caves, and the lower picture shows the scene of a refugee camp. (Photos taken by the New York Times correspondent)

### The Beijing Provisional Council is Established Today; Chairman Chiang Issues Special Instructions

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 24th] The Peiping Provisional Council has been in preparation for several months and is now ready to formally convene on the 25th. Chairman Chiang issued special instructions, urging them in three points: (1) The urgent task at hand is to quickly restore social order, practice economy, and increase production. The food shortage is severe everywhere. How to practice economy, manage the situation well, investigate hoarding, and advocate disaster relief to overcome the difficulties; (2) At present, ensuring the strictness and clarity of the Baojia organization is a practical plan, and supporting the virtuous and upholding justice should be mutually reinforcing, so that the implementation of government orders can be promoted and the people's hearts can be directed; (3) The state's war of resistance against foreign aggression was unavoidable, and the people were levied taxes and levies to defend the nation and the people. It is hoped that you will understand the government's heart of treating the people as children and widely guide the people to the meaning of sacrifice for the country, encourage the people to abide by the laws, supervise the government, and eliminate greed. The mountains are high and the roads are long, and there is no way to meet. I hereby express what I have in mind and wish to encourage each other together.

### The Atmosphere in the Military Mediation Department is Stagnant; The Communist Army in Shanxi Launches a Widespread Offensive; Taiyuan and Datong are Surrounded on All Sides

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 24th] The Executive Headquarters has forwarded the order to extend the truce for eight days to all groups for compliance, but the atmosphere in Xiehe Hospital seems unoptimistic. An official spokesperson pointed out the severity of the current situation in Shanxi, which is even more serious than in Shandong. The intersection of the Tongpu and Zhengtai railways southeast of Taiyuan is currently under siege. The highway west of Taiyuan leading to Wenshui and Jiaocheng has also been destroyed, and Taiyuan is almost surrounded. After the fall of Shuoxian, Datong's only connection to the cities defended by the National Army has also been severed. Datong has almost become an isolated island outside Yanmen Pass. In southern Shanxi, the Communist army continues to besiege Quwo, and the situation in Jiangxian is also very critical. In Shandong, the Communist army is attempting to attack the water source of Qingdao, Huangbu, and Fanjiacun. The grain routes around Jinan have been blocked, and the situation is also worrying. The Communist army on the PingSui Railway has a tendency to encircle Nankou. Nie Rongzhen's troops of 15,000 men are attacking Yangfang in one direction and Baijiakou west of Nankou in another, attempting to cut off the PingSui Railway. An official spokesperson also pointed out that there are still small-scale conflicts in the Northeast. The spokesperson refused to comment on how the situation will develop after the eight-day extension expires, only repeatedly answering "hard to say."

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 24th] The CCP representative of the Datong Executive Group has withdrawn from Datong. Officials said this is a prelude to the completion of the encirclement and the start of the offensive by the Communist army.

Also, when the Communist army attacked Wenjiashi, County Magistrate Wu Deming and others died in the line of duty.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 23rd] The Communist army has gradually withdrawn from the outposts around Jinan, but the number of Communist troops continues to increase, and it seems that there is an intention to attack Jinan. Also, Zhao Guangyu's regiment in Dawenkou is still holding on to the core. On the night of the 22nd, the underground bunkers were destroyed by the Communist army, and the situation was critical. After a desperate defense, it was stabilized.

### The Communist Army Digs Up the Grand Canal Dike; Southern Hebei Suffers a Terrible Flood

The report stated that crops and houses in the area have been severely damaged.

### Mao Zedong Issues a Statement Opposing U.S. Military Aid to China

[Associated Press, Peiping, 24th] Mao Zedong stated in a public statement in Yan'an yesterday that the CCP firmly opposes the U.S. State Department's proposal submitted to Congress on June 15 to continue military aid to China. He also stated that U.S. military aid to China is armed intervention. What the Chinese people urgently need is not U.S. weapons and troops stationed in China. Under these circumstances, the CCP has no choice but to oppose the U.S. government's continued supply of weapons to the Kuomintang government and the dispatch of U.S. military delegations to China. It also demands that the United States immediately stop the so-called military aid to China and withdraw its troops stationed in China.

### Military Traitors Yang Kuiyi and Two Other Renegades Were Executed by Firing Squad in Nanjing Yesterday; The Trial of Traitor Qi Xieyuan Has Concluded and His Death is Not Far Off; Veteran Traitor Yin Rugeng is Scheduled for Public Trial the Day After Tomorrow

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Yang Kuiyi, a military traitor who was the director of the puppet Wuhan Pacification Office, Ling Xiao, the puppet Minister of the Navy, and Hu Yukun, the puppet Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Committee and puppet Minister of Military Orders, have been tried by the Military Law Department. It was determined that the three traitors, Yang, Ling, and Hu, colluded with the enemy, organized puppet troops, and resisted the government. The evidence was conclusive and their treasonous acts were obvious. The three traitors were sentenced to death at 11:30 AM today. Guo Yiguang was appointed by the Military Law Department as the execution supervisor, and the three traitors were taken by car to the Yuhuatai execution ground at 12:20 PM for execution by firing squad. They arrived at the execution ground at 12:42 PM. The three criminals were lined up in a row, and the execution soldiers used rifles to execute them. Yang was hit by one shot, Ling was hit by three shots, and both fell to the ground and died. Hu was hit by eight shots before he died. It is reported that Yang was 53 years old and from Hubei, Ling was 59 years old and from Chongde, Zhejiang, and Hu was 55 years old and from Liaoning, Northeast China.

### The Jiangsu High Court Issues a Ruling: Chu Niyi Granted Retrial, Justified by Preservation of National Father's Remains and Writings

[Special dispatch from our Suzhou office, 24th] Chu Niyi, the traitor, had his death sentence upheld by the Supreme Court, with the approval already a full month ago. All circles anticipated his imminent execution. However, his wife, Chu Chen Shunzhen, suddenly, on the day following the execution of the traitor Chen Gongbo, applied to the Jiangsu High Court for a retrial. At the time, public opinion was universally shocked, as there was no precedent for such a case, and it was believed that the application would certainly be rejected. After receiving the retrial application and various new exonerating pieces of evidence, the Jiangsu High Court, after several meetings and studies by the original trial staff, issued Criminal Ruling No. 4 on retrials at approximately 3:00 PM on the 24th. The main text: "This case is granted a retrial." The reasons are recorded separately. After hearing the news, our reporter specially visited Mr. Sun Hong, the presiding judge of the original trial, who stated: "The decision to grant Chu Niyi a retrial is based on his preservation of the National Father's remains and writings. It cannot be said that he did not perform a minor service. If this is correct, it should be cited as a reason for mitigating his sentence, to show that the law is neither unjust nor lenient. As for the rumor that an American named Wharton intervened, that is a complete fabrication. Even if such a thing were to happen, this court absolutely cannot change his criminal responsibility because of it."

Reasons for Retrial

The defendant's case involved being a traitor, and after the verdict by this court, it was upheld and approved by the Supreme Court. Now, the applicant argues that the defendant, in 1942, went to Beiping to negotiate with the Japanese army, retrieved the National Father's remains, and respectfully escorted them to Nanjing to be enshrined in the mausoleum. The National Father's writings and belongings stored in his Shanghai residence during his lifetime were sealed by the Japanese army. The applicant says the defendant forcefully argued, and was able to get back those historical items such as the original manuscript of the National Father's "Sun Wen's Doctrine" and the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" handwritten by the National Father on "How to save the Country and Revolution." Also, the knives and swords worn by the National Father during his lifetime were also carefully preserved by the defendant. The Nanjing Ninghai Detention Center has a detailed record of the above facts. The initial trial overlooked this important evidence favorable to the defendant, which is a reason for a retrial. This court believes that while the defendant's collusion with the enemy and treason are indeed deserving of punishment, if the applicant's statements are true, then the matter concerns loyalty to the National Father and preservation of documents, which is not without the circumstances described in Article 3 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases. The original definitive judgment did not consider this point, and therefore, there is reason for a retrial. Based on the above discussion, in accordance with Article 1, Article 28, Paragraph 2 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, and Article 428, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the ruling is as stated in the main text.

### Two Other Traitor Cases Were Heard Yesterday But Not Decided

[Special dispatch from our Suzhou office, 24th] At approximately 4:00 PM on the 24th, the Jiangsu High Court retried Liu Dui, who had falsely served as the secretary of the puppet provincial government, a professor at the Art College's School of Literature, a member of the provincial government's seal committee, and head of the education department. He admitted these false positions without hesitation. However, he excused himself by claiming coercion from the environment and the need to maintain his livelihood. He also argued that he rescued underground work comrades and preserved the artifacts of Soochow University, and claimed that he committed no misdeeds while in the false positions, requesting a lighter sentence. The court hearing lasted approximately 30 minutes before concluding, and the court ordered a postponement for further questioning, and the traitor Zhang was returned to custody.

[Special dispatch from our Suzhou office, 24th] At approximately 4:00 PM on the 24th, the Jiangsu High Court heard the case of Chen Boqi, suspected of being a traitor for falsely serving as a pilot in the puppet air force. Because Chen confessed that his father was an American citizen and his mother was Chinese, the court ordered that his nationality be investigated before further questioning. Chen was returned to custody.

### Wang Jingwei's Son-in-Law, He Wenjie, Scheduled for Sentencing on the 30th

He stated that he was still serving Chen Gongbo in his false position and denied any guilt. The presiding judge asked about his feelings regarding Wang Jingwei's death and Chen Gongbo's sentence of life imprisonment. He claimed that he always admired Wang Jingwei's character and views. The prosecutor then requested a judgment according to the law because He did not show remorse for his crimes. When He was answering the defense, he frequently looked to the right, peering at his wife, Wang Wenxing, and forcing a smile. At 11:20 AM, the debate ended, and it was announced that the sentencing would be delivered at 10:00 AM on the 30th.

(Note: The water conservancy projects currently under construction in Zhejiang Province include the Sanjiang Sluice in Shaoxing to prevent tidal floods, the hydropower generation in Longquan, and the farmland water conservancy irrigation project in Wei County. Projects that are about to be constructed include the Duomen hydropower generation of over 200 horsepower in Yongjia and Suian. All projects are being managed by the Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau and the National Water Conservancy Committee, with materials supplied by the Executive Yuan. In addition, the small-scale water conservancy loan negotiated by Chairman Shen in Beijing has been confirmed at 500 million yuan and will be lent out soon.)

### Suiyuan Sets Opium Suppression Period

[Special dispatch from our Beiping office, 23rd] In order to eliminate the long-standing opium addiction, the Suiyuan authorities have ordered that the nearly two months from "June 3rd" to the end of August be a period of suppression. "June 3rd" was the day for the execution of Nai Anxi to deter others. The Suiyuan authorities executed him for large-scale opium trafficking. The criminal was the chief of staff of the Dingqi Security Team and had used his position to transport 703 catties of Western merchant opium with armed escort. The Suiyuan authorities are currently investigating the planting of opium seedlings in mountain clearings or vacant farmland areas. Once discovered, the land will be immediately cleared and the roots removed. The general opium users are currently nervous because during the period of enemy rule, opium planting and addiction in Suiyuan became widespread. Not only was buying and selling legal, but there was even a "Soil Industry Cooperative." Opium dens were everywhere, and they were even used as bargaining chips.

### Local dispatches

Passengers Arriving in Hangzhou from Shanghai Given Epidemic Prevention Injections

[Express News from our Hangzhou office] Hangzhou is densely populated, and as summer arrives, the risk of epidemics is concerning. Shanghai and Hangzhou are just a short distance away, making transmission very easy. In order to prevent this, the Municipal Health Bureau, in addition to implementing epidemic prevention injections for the public in the city, has also dispatched epidemic prevention teams stationed at the passenger exits of the railway station. All travelers arriving from Shanghai are given epidemic prevention injections. For the clear and refreshing beverages sold on the market, such as shaved ice, sour plum soup, frozen dates, cold noodles, cold dishes, and agar made from wooden lotus seeds, in addition to sending personnel to strictly prohibit them at any time, a special letter has been sent to the provincial police department for assistance.

Traitor's Death Sentence Changed to Life Imprisonment: Li Baozu, a famous traitor in Hangzhou, who previously appealed the initial judgment of the Zhejiang High Court, has now been heard that the original death sentence has been reduced to life imprisonment in the appeal.

Wuhu

Passenger Vehicles on Wuhu Routes Repeatedly Robbed: Robberies of vehicles on the Wuhu routes are almost daily occurrences. Travelers hesitate to travel. At 8:00 AM on the 19th, two passenger vehicles that came from Hefei, carrying approximately 50 passengers and local goods, were robbed. The first vehicle drove to the edge of a mountain near the boundary of Chao County and Hanyou. Suddenly, seven plainclothes bandits, who had been ambushing on the left side of the road, opened fire. Three passengers were shot and killed, and the driver and another passenger were injured. Everyone was robbed, with losses of about 30 million yuan. Before the bandits could get far up the mountain, the second vehicle arrived. Unexpectedly, the vehicle's tire burst at the scene of the incident, and it could not move. The bandits turned back down, and the passengers were terrified. Fortunately, there were two armed guards on the vehicle who quickly yelled and fought back. Knowing that they were prepared, the bandits left. The vehicle did not arrive in Wuhu until the afternoon. In addition to the injured driver, one dead passenger had followed the Henyun cargo to Wuhu. The remaining one dead and one injured passenger remained at the scene of the incident.

As for the candidates, they have also been reviewed and announced by the Provincial Department.

Special Essay

### Basic Concepts for Resolving the China Problem—An Appeal to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and a Contribution to Third Parties Who Consider Themselves Mediators—

— Liu Muhua

I

After the 15-day truce expired and was extended for another eight days, everyone breathed a sigh of relief, and some people began to harbor extravagant hopes, thinking that the Communist Party might change its attitude in this last opportunity, and that all difficult problems might be resolved in a reluctant manner. This view cannot be said to be without some partial justification, but if we carefully consider the current reality of China, and the social and international political background hidden behind the disputes, it is not difficult to find the superficiality of this vague optimism. And precisely because people generally view it so superficially, they simply do not recognize the existence of the historical and objective conditions of the problem itself, which further increases the serious difficulties of the situation.

To solve the current problem, it is essential to first understand where the crux of the domestic problem lies. In other words, what we want to ask now is: What are the government and the Communist Party fighting for? Can that dispute be resolved peacefully? More realistically, is there another way to seek China's revolution besides one-party dictatorship? What is the distance between the Principle of People's Livelihood and Communism?... These are the most fundamental questions.

In short, the current internal conflict in China is the political struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. In essence, this political struggle should be a struggle of ideologies and policies to be reasonable. In reality, however, the two parties have engaged in relatively little dispute over ideologies and policies. The Political Consultative Conference held in Chongqing, apart from passing the principles for amending the draft constitution, which can be considered something tangible, the rest of the discussions revolved around the distribution of government personnel, the distribution of National Assembly representatives, the distribution of troops and territories, and so on. Some people believe that the Communist Party's goal is only to share some "official positions and emoluments," and that their military activities are merely to gain a favorable position in order to demand a high price. The implication is that the government is also prepared to pay a price, but it cannot be too high. If this were true, it would seem that the current problems in China would be too simple. Unfortunately, the reality is not as simple and easy as one might think. If the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can truly cooperate in good faith to jointly participate in the organization of the National Government, and both abandon the policies of one-party dictatorship and proletarian revolution, the first step must be to seek to bridge the gap between the two ideologies, which is the bridge of the souls of the two parties. The cooperation between two revolutionary political parties must, at the very least, be premised on having largely similar positions or policies, otherwise it will be a superficial alliance. Moreover, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have gone through cooperation and then separation, and no one can easily forget the past. Now, if the two sides do not truly seek a common ground for cooperation in ideology and policy, but instead invite "relatives and friends" to negotiate a piecemeal division of property, this fact undoubtedly illustrates that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have deep-seated prejudices, and cannot trust each other's sincerity, and are therefore more inclined to be realistic.

However, the current situation in China cannot but find a way to break through? The way to break through is to resume negotiations. I am afraid that holding another Political Consultative Conference will still not be up to the task. To put it bluntly, China is still quite far from democracy, and the so-called "public opinion" is still looming. I dare to say that even if universal suffrage is implemented, it will still not escape the influence of various power circles. Therefore, the National Assembly has not yet convened, and the Communist Party is already arguing about how many representatives they should have. I advocate removing all the camouflage and hypocrisy, and having the Kuomintang and the Communist Party step forward in a dignified manner and talk openly and honestly. All people outside the two parties should honestly act as intermediaries and peacemakers; absolutely no partiality is allowed, and being a follower is even more undesirable. Then, the two parties should raise the most fundamental issues, and establish a common path for national construction from the perspectives of their respective ideologies and policies, and from the objective situation of China, so as to be of practical benefit. I dare say that this is the only path that politicians can take now.

II

I advocate removing all camouflage and having the Kuomintang and the Communist Party confront each other head-on to resolve the disputes, entirely based on various historical and international political factors. I feel that this is what should be done in reality, and it must also be done this way.

Taking the word "democracy" as an example, everyone in the country is now calling for democracy, but it seems that the interpretations are different. Since the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, China's politics seems to have embarked on the path of the Soviet Union. Now, after more than ten years of "ruling the country by the party" by the Kuomintang, it seems to have become a stereotype, and the Kuomintang wants to change course after this war and take the democratic road of Britain and the United States. Can it be done? It is still in the process of evolution, and the future is uncertain. As for political parties, only the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are not only strong, but also have ideologies that form complete systems, and have considerable history. Other small parties or political groups are still difficult to compete with today. More than a decade ago, I seemed to have outlined three possible paths for China's future destiny in my heart: (1) The Kuomintang eliminates the Communist Party and completes its national construction strategy of the Three Principles of the People; (2) The Communist Party seizes power, implements proletarian dictatorship, and practices Soviet communism; (3) The Kuomintang and the Communist Party, guided by the international environment, treat each other as ordinary political parties, and work together to jointly realize a Principle of People's Livelihood similar to socialism. And today's situation further proves that my previous observations were generally correct. Today's China seems to be facing a crossroads of these three divergent paths and is at a loss. But I now want to take a further step and offer an explanation, that is, due to the evolution of international politics, the first and second paths are no longer possible. Not only will the Chinese people not allow it, but the international community will not allow it either. Therefore, China's future is only one major path, which is the third path, and the Kuomintang has already expressed its willingness to build the country jointly with other parties. In other words, it has abandoned the first path.

There is no need to talk about the past two decades. Let's look at the current international situation. After the end of the war, due to the demise of fascism, it has been confirmed that the attempt by the likes of Hitler to mix the economic form of the Soviet Union with the organization of capitalist society has failed. Thus, two camps have clearly emerged in the world, standing in opposition to each other. The United States and the Soviet Union, representing two different social systems, could cooperate during the war, but after the end of the war, there was no way to avoid each other, and they finally faced each other. After the United States and the Soviet Union faced each other, on the one hand, the Security Council and the Foreign Ministers' Conference held meetings one after another, and on the other hand, there were troublesome facts such as the Iran issue, the Turkey issue, the Balkan issue, the German and Italian issues, the Northeast issue, and the Korean issue. In fact, these many issues are just one issue, that is, the Soviet Union wants to create a "security zone" around its borders, and the United States also wants to obtain security guarantees in the East and West oceans. All issues are nothing more than the reaction of these two "contradictions of securityism." To be fair, the United States does not need to expand its territory, and the Soviet Union does not necessarily want to invade others. Neither of them wants war, but due to the incompatibility of social systems, suspicion seems to be unavoidable. Reflecting this international situation, the China issue is complex when it is said to be complex, and simple when it is said to be simple. Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union will allow either side to create a situation of absolute control over China. And the issue of peace in China also reflects the issue of world peace. I am not saying that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are using the international background for political struggle. I am only saying that their political struggle is affecting international relations everywhere.

The Chinese revolution that has developed from this international relationship, whether it is the revolution of the Three Principles of the People or the communist revolution, has undergone an internal transformation, that is, the revolutionary strategy of one-party dictatorship is no longer possible in China today. The Kuomintang has already seen this and expressed its intention to abandon its previous "rule the country by the party" approach. At the same time, even if the Communist Party wants to take the opportunity to seize power, it cannot be without scruples. If both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party sincerely abandon the intention of "one-party dictatorship" and no longer take the first or second path, then all problems can be solved easily.

Therefore, the international situation is not pessimistic. On the contrary, it is beneficial to China. At least, it reduces the subjective conditions of incompatibility between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and provides a common path, which is the path of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in accordance with the current international situation.

III

I believe that the real obstacle to the future of Kuomintang-Communist cooperation is not that there is anything absolutely irreconcilable in ideology or policy. Because ideology is not a formula, and policies are more flexible and have room for adjustment. Moreover, the Principle of People's Livelihood of the Three Principles of the People, if it can be thoroughly realized, as Mr. Sun Yat-sen said, is already socialism, and communism is only a type of socialism. According to Mao Zedong's idea, the Chinese revolution should first seek to realize New Democracy, and the Communist Party Manifesto also claims to be willing to fight for the Three Principles of the People. If this is true, then in terms of theory and ideology, we cannot find any reason for the Communist Party not to support the National Government at this time. It can be seen that if cooperation is achieved, the policies of the two parties can be mutually accommodating.

So what exactly is the obstacle to their cooperation? The only thing is suspicion! Since the Kuomintang and the Communist Party split midway during the Northern Expedition, and after several communist riots in Nanchang and Guangzhou, and the long-term encirclement and suppression by the government, the relationship between the two parties has been very bad, and they do not trust each other, and cooperation has been full of hidden reefs. More unfortunately, since the beginning of this political struggle, the ruling Kuomintang has always stood on the side of the government, and cannot help but criticize the Communist Party's actions. The Communist Party, which holds military power, has especially never forgotten to expand its territory as capital for political struggle. The public opinion circles also seem to have such "subjectivity," which sometimes exacerbates the suspicion between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Therefore, I deeply feel that the propaganda war between the two sides must not stop, and that the general public does not recognize the essence of the problem, and does not understand the key to the current situation in China. Joining in the middle and making trouble is really giving the future of the country the most terrible impact.

To make the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cooperate sincerely and complete a democratic constitutional country, at least two prerequisite concepts must be affirmed: First, we must recognize that the Communist Party in opposition and the ruling Kuomintang have equal political status; we must recognize that all actions of the Communist Party are also to realize its ideology and implement its policies, and are engaged in political struggle, but the methods it adopts are worthy of consideration. Second, we must recognize that the Chinese revolution has not yet succeeded, and feudal forces, bureaucratic capital, comprador class, and corrupt elements are still active everywhere. The Communist Party's actions are indeed too excessive, and the actions of the Communist troops in various places may even deviate from the original intentions of the Communist Party, but with a forgiving attitude, the Communist Party may not think that it represents the demands of the Chinese common people. It is undeniable that since the Kuomintang came to power, in the past eighteen or nineteen years, except for the fact that it truly led the whole nation to save the country during the Anti-Japanese War, most of its energy has been used to consolidate its regime and party infighting, and sometimes it has even compromised with its previous revolutionary targets. Even at present, politics is quite inefficient. It is forgivable that there is no way to deal with the economy, which can be said to be due to insufficient conditions; but what about the governance of officials? After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, it may not even be possible to truly achieve a clean government. Therefore, we must recognize that the expansion of the Communist Party is partly due to the external oppression of Japanese imperialism for twenty years, and partly due to the political incompetence of the Kuomintang. We must especially recognize that many outstanding young people who have devoted themselves to Yan'an and have been deceived by the Communist Party are not because they believe in Marxism, nor are they not believe in the Three Principles of the People. They just want revolution, they want to overthrow feudal forces, bureaucratic capital, and all dark phenomena. As long as the Kuomintang is serious about revolution and truly achieves "capable government," why would young people love the Communist Party!

I believe that the people of the Communist Party understand the point that the international situation does not allow the outbreak of revolution more clearly and deeply than we do. Otherwise, they would not need to ask the government for anything, and they could just start a revolution directly. Precisely because the communist revolution is not allowed by facts in China and is indeed unworkable, it fights and then wants to talk with the Kuomintang. The central issue today is nothing more than demanding that the government implement the revolutionary policies of the Three Principles of the People. We must remember: If the government practices revolution, it will not see the expansion of the Communist Party at all; and if it claims to be revolutionary but violates the interests of the people, it will not have a future at all.

The one who tied the bell must untie it. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party must now seek a bridge for cooperation on the revolutionary path. The Kuomintang must liquidate itself and revive the revolutionary spirit of the Guangdong government era; the Communist Party must also liquidate itself, and some excessive styles of killing and arson and the riot policies of Nanchang and Guangzhou must not be repeated. In order to realize the Principle of People's Livelihood, in order to build an equal and free China, in order to overthrow feudal forces and bureaucratic capital, and in order to liberate the Chinese people, there is no reason for them not to get closer and cooperate.

Any problem, just like we calculate complex fractions, must be gradually simplified before it can be solved.

What most people lack for the current problem is a kind of inductive work. The reason why the Political Consultative Conference did not achieve much is because of this. My personal idea is that it is best to let the third party take a step back first, and concentrate the problem on the revolutionary path of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as a major premise for resolving the political struggle. As long as the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are still willing to be the promoters of a unified revolutionary policy, and the people of the third party are all honest and fair witnesses, and at the same time maintain equal weights, in this way, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and all aspects of the country can jointly govern, and their ideologies and policies can be reconciled and implemented by the weights. Then China's politics will have a way out. It is true that there is no way out without revolution, and it is still the country that suffers if the Kuomintang and the Communist Party do not unify the revolutionary path. This is entirely a factual view, and has nothing to do with theory.

If the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can truly cooperate politically and place the struggle on various policies, it is what China urgently needs. Taking the land policy as an example, the Kuomintang can propose a plan to implement equal land rights, and the Communist Party may as well advocate that land be nationalized. Then, the final decision rests with the representatives of the people, which is the realization of democratic politics. Regardless of the people's decision, as long as the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are willing to do so peacefully, I think no one will disagree. Because the Chinese people are not afraid of revolution, they are only afraid of non-revolution, counter-revolution, and fake revolution; but the Chinese people do not want a revolution of riots and bloodshed, they cannot withstand another bloodshed!

We also advocate not to regulate the future form of China's politics and society with a certain stereotype. China will not become Britain and the United States, nor will it become the Soviet Union. China should always be China. The national tradition especially cannot be ignored. What China has demanded since modern times is nutrition, various qualities, not other people's stereotypes. The Chinese politics after the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cooperate should be that the government proposes policies, which are decided by the people, and then implemented by the government, rather than the Soviet government form, or the rigid government form of Britain and the United States. The Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and various other parties can try their best to strive for the realization of their ideas and ideologies in various policies, and the Chinese people will naturally choose what they need. Selling dog meat under the pretense of selling sheep meat cannot be trusted by the Chinese people.

In short, the key to the China problem lies here. Leaving the Chinese revolution problem—which is the only demand of the Chinese masses—leaving the historical and real relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the disputes cannot be resolved, but will only create more complications.

To make the army nationalized, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must cooperate sincerely; to make the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cooperate, a unified revolutionary path must be established first.

Special Envoy Marshall, as well as the so-called third parties who participated in the Political Consultative Conference, seem to need to have a full understanding of this last point. Even the responsible persons of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party seem to be very unwilling to touch this fundamental issue. Therefore, I dare to contribute this basic concept to them.

### Whether the Trieste Issue Can Be Compromised Determines the Success or Failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference—Waiting for New Instructions from Moscow—Two Meetings Held Yesterday Morning and Afternoon

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] The key to the success or failure of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference lies in today's two gatherings, especially depending on whether a compromise can be reached on the future of the Port of Trieste, which is disputed by Italy and Yugoslavia. The secret informal meeting on Friday afternoon, and the secret exchange of views between Byrnes and Molotov at dinner that night, still do not seem to show any signs of compromise. The issue of Trieste, which is related to the overall situation of the conference, will depend on what new instructions Moscow has at the end of the week, and whether Britain and the United States can make concessions and accept the proposal for international co-management. If Moscow resolutely rejects international co-management, it will be more difficult to reach agreement on the remaining issues on the conference agenda, and it will be even more difficult to obtain the Soviet Union's consent to convene a full-scale peace conference.

[Associated Press, Paris, 23rd] The plan to internationalize the Port of Trieste is said to have been proposed by French President and Foreign Minister Bidault at the secret meeting of the four foreign ministers on the 21st of this month. According to this plan, the Port of Trieste will be under the jurisdiction of the United Nations for a period of ten years, after which a referendum will be held to decide whether the port should belong to Italy or Yugoslavia. Judging from unofficial sources, it is not yet clear how the compromise plan will affect the border dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia. In order to speed up the drafting of the peace treaty with Italy, the four foreign ministers have scheduled two meetings this morning and afternoon, with the agenda including the border issues between France and Austria and Italy, and the disposal of Italy's remaining warships. However, observers believe that the Trieste issue will be discussed first.

[Associated Press, Rome, 24th] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi announced today in a document: "Italy will do its best to resist any peaceful solution that would subject the Port of Trieste to international co-management and cede the western part of the Istria region to Yugoslavia." "This solution is unfair. Although we are weak and unarmed, we will never tolerate the destruction of our rights."

### US and Soviet Union to Engage in Heated Debate at Atomic Energy Commission

[Reuters, London, 24th] Tomorrow's debate at the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission may damage the optimistic atmosphere that has emerged after a week of meetings at the Paris Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. At the beginning of the establishment of the Security Council, it was informed that the resolutions in the meeting could reflect the basic relationship between the powers. Now, the resolutions of the Atomic Energy Commission obviously also have a significant impact on the Foreign Ministers' Conference. This can be seen from the fundamental differences between the plans proposed by the US and Soviet representatives to the Atomic Energy Commission. It is expected that the United States will not be willing to immediately destroy atomic bombs or disclose their secrets before obtaining the firm guarantees mentioned in its plan, and Soviet representative Gromyko may not intend to accept this guarantee. Tomorrow's debate will inevitably bring the US and Soviet plans to a conflict situation.

[Associated Press, London, 23rd] The British United Nations Association held its general assembly today and voted by a large majority against the US proposal for an international management of atomic energy plan and in favor of the Soviet proposal.

### South Africa Discriminates Against Indian Overseas Chinese—India Files Complaint with the United Nations

[Reuters, New York, 23rd] Mudaliar, the chief representative of the Indian mission to the United Nations, recently submitted a complaint to United Nations Secretary-General Lie on India's protest against the discrimination by the South African federal authorities against the 250,000 Indian residents of that country, asking him to submit it to the plenary session on September 2. India has previously announced the severance of trade relations with South Africa and recalled its High Commissioner. Mudaliar also said that the current situation is becoming increasingly serious and is sufficient to damage the relations between the two countries.

### Argentine Ambassador to France Meets with Molotov

[Reuters, London, 24th] Moscow Radio recently announced that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with the Argentine Ambassador to France yesterday. Afterwards, the Argentine Ambassador told people that the meeting lasted for half an hour and the atmosphere was extremely sincere.

### Soviet Consul General Suddenly Leaves Seoul

Hodge Says Matter is Inexplicable [Agence France-Presse, New York, 23rd] A local radio station said that the Soviet Consul General in Seoul and his staff have returned to the Soviet-occupied area. According to Hodge, Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces in South Korea, the sudden departure of the Soviet Consul General was not only unexpected, but also difficult to explain.

### Clashes Break Out Again Between French and Vietnamese Military Police

Hanoi Falls into State of War

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 22nd] After Hoang Thuc Khang, Acting President of the Vietnamese government, issued a document advising the people to maintain stability in the face of the daily clashes between the French and Vietnamese and not to allow any provocative behavior, the situation in Hanoi was only stable for twelve hours. Clashes broke out again between the French and Vietnamese at six locations last night. Within three hours from 9 pm to 12 am, the entire city of Hanoi fell into a state of war, with machine guns as dense as a string of pearls, and mixed with steel artillery grenades. All traffic in the urban area was cut off. After mediation by the French-Vietnamese Liaison Office, the clashes stopped.

### Far East International Tribunal: Former Yomiuri Editor Testifies, Says There Was No Freedom of Speech in Japan Before the War

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] Suzuki Kyo, former chief editor of the Yomiuri Shimbun, testified before the International Tribunal today, stating: Japan not only implemented a strict censorship system before the war, but the press departments of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministry also convened chief editors of various newspapers on a regular basis to inform them of the content to be written. From 1935 until the end of the Pacific War, Japanese newspapers and periodicals were entirely under the government's control and domination. During this period, there was not a single newspaper in Japan that resembled a free one. The prosecution then presented Japanese photographs as evidence, with the photos showing American warships as part of Japan's evidence of preparedness for war. A newly opened film producer claimed that the Japanese government approved 306 Japanese films in 1940, of which 110 were on the theme of militarism, and the propaganda films were produced under the instruction of the government.

### Shia Islamic Leader to Visit Iran

[United Press, Meshed, Iran, 23rd] Ayatollah Sayyed Hossein Borujerdi, the spiritual leader of five million Shia Muslims, will arrive here within half a month to discuss future Iranian general elections. Observers believe that these Shia Muslims have prevented a revolutionary movement similar to Azerbaijan's here and oppose the land redistribution plan of the leftist "Tudeh" Party.

### UN Security Council Meets to Debate the Spanish Question

Polish Proposal Will Undoubtedly Be Vetoed

[United Press, New York, 24th] The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to meet today to put to a vote the Polish proposal calling for the entire world to sever relations with the Franco government. Representatives from various countries have prepared to attend the discussion. Judging from their expressions, Poland will get at most four votes out of eleven, and the proposal will be rejected. However, it is heard that Polish Representative Lange intends to take two actions: to keep the Spanish case on the agenda of the Security Council and to prevent it from being submitted to the United Nations General Assembly in September.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Former Undersecretary of State Welles said here today in a broadcast that the Security Council's debate on the Spanish issue is actually a struggle for a foothold between the Soviet Union and Britain, and even between the Soviet Union and Western countries. If the Franco government is overthrown, Spain is likely to have a civil war, and a Communist-dominated government will seize control. If that happens, Spain is likely to be split, and Britain's transportation to military installations at the Suez Canal and throughout the Mediterranean may be cut off. In addition, the Communist forces in France, Italy, and North Africa will receive direct assistance from the new Spanish government and will be greatly strengthened.

### Indian Congress Party Executive Committee Rejects British Proposal; British Representatives Still Trying to Salvage, to Avoid a Breakdown in Negotiations

[This Newspaper's Report] London, 24th, broadcast: The Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress has rejected the British proposal regarding the Indian interim government.

[United Press, New Delhi, 24th] News today: Because the British Cabinet Mission's plan to establish an Indian interim government is bound to be rejected by the Congress Party, it has put forward a new, last-minute proposal to avoid a breakdown in negotiations. It is reported that British representatives Lawrence and Cripps met with Congress Party representatives Gandhi and Patel for an hour to discuss this new proposal. After the meeting, Gandhi rushed to the Congress Party Executive Committee to attend the morning meeting. It was previously reported that the committee was ready to pass a resolution rejecting the British plan, but after the two-and-a-half-hour meeting ended, no expected resolution was announced, causing outside speculation that the committee may have reached an agreement on the form of the Indian interim government. After the meeting, Congress Party President Acharya Kripalani told reporters, "There are some new developments today, and perhaps the situation is hopeful?" Acharya laughed and replied, "One can draw one's own conclusions." It is noted that Acharya was clearly pessimistic about the future of the negotiations yesterday.

Gandhi and Acharya Issue Separate Declarations

[United Press, New Delhi, 23rd] Indian National Congress President Acharya Kripalani and Indian spiritual leader Gandhi issued separate declarations tonight, stating that they reject the British proposal to form an interim government. Acharya's declaration was issued three hours after the Congress Party Executive Committee meeting. It is said that "as far as the Congress Party is concerned, this matter is now over." Gandhi said in a speech at an evening meeting, "We should not expect the British Cabinet Mission, but should form our own cabinet mission to exert its leadership and power. We cannot build freedom in haste, nor can we obtain it in haste. We must persevere and move forward." Congress Party President Nehru had a 90-minute meeting with Indian Governor-General Wavell and the British Cabinet Mission. Gandhi also attended the committee meeting.

### Another Mass Grave Discovered in Germany

[United Press, Berlin, 23rd] According to a Red Army newspaper report: Another mass grave has been discovered at the site of a former prisoner-of-war camp in Zossen, Saxony, Germany, containing the bodies of 100,000 prisoners of war, mostly Russians. According to the investigation: The prisoners died from overwork, lack of food, and infectious diseases. The so-called prisoner-of-war hospital once housed 50,000 patients, who were unattended. The only way out was the mass grave.

### Radioactive Isotopes Can Be Used to Explore the Source of Diseases

Another Use of Atomic Energy

[United States Information Service, Washington, 23rd] Since the War Department recently announced that radio isotopes can be used for research in biology and medicine, the results of wartime atomic research may soon be used for the first time in peacetime. These isotopes will be used for research in basic and applied sciences, especially in biology and medicine. These beneficial radio isotopes will come from the "atomic pile" at the Oak Ridge Laboratory in Tennessee and will be distributed throughout the United States for scientific applications. The benefits that isotopes can produce in medicine, at least initially, are not direct treatment, but as a tool for exploring the source of diseases. Under the currently announced plan, about 100 types of isotopes with different capacities and radioactivity will be available.

### Eisenhower Releases Historic Report: Analyzes Allied War Achievements in Europe: Three Major Battles Determined the Fate of the German Army; British and American Strength More Than Double That of the Soviet Union

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower today submitted a 123-page long report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, describing his command of the troops from Normandy to the Elbe River during his tenure as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe. The report stated that the victory in the European War was determined by three major battles. This was due to the strength and cooperation of the United Nations and the mistakes of Germany. The war was won before crossing the Rhine. Hitler and Rundstedt miscalculated the date of the Allied landing and concentrated their main force to deal with Britain, waiting for a second attack that would never come. The enemy's strategy of stubbornly defending its self-selected positions to meet the enemy therefore fell into our trap. In the eleven months from D-Day to Victory Day, the three major battles were as follows:

Normandy Landing Battle: The enemy was trapped there due to inconvenience in supply and transportation, and the destruction of the transportation lines became its fatal blow. The enemy, due to weak air power and lack of reconnaissance, was completely misled by our feint strategy and failed to mobilize the troops in the Calais area until it was too late to regret it. If these troops had crossed the Seine River and attacked the beaches at the beginning of our landing, the overall situation might have been unfavorable to us.

Battle of the Falaise Pocket: At that time, from the perspective of military logic, the enemy should have made a strategic retreat, but the enemy did not do so and wanted to defend to the end, thus allowing the Seventh Army to be surrounded and smashed to pieces. The battle for France was decided in the bloody hedgerows of Normandy.

Rhine West Bank Battle: In February and March 1945, the enemy forces there originally wanted to defend Germany, but they were defeated to the point of collapse. In short, from the perspective of the entire war, Germany's failure to fully sustain the supply of its troops was its fatal injury. The enemy's morale was indeed very strong, but morale alone was not enough to save the situation. Regarding this point, we are most grateful for the mission of the United Nations Air Force. In terms of the strength of the United Nations, on the eve of crossing the Rhine, the troops under my command numbered nearly four million, plus nearly 11,000 fighters and bombers, and the British and American navies were united into one, with unparalleled strength. Behind the combat troops, there were 3 million uniformed male and female auxiliary members.

Full of Cooperative Spirit: The cooperation between Britain and the United States was not only based on the spirit of the United Nations, but was even like one country, jointly pouring in its resources, manpower, and materials. The Soviet Union was more difficult. Until the end of 1944, I did not receive a report on the Soviet strategy... But in January of the following year, I learned from Marshal Stalin the detailed plan of the Soviet Union's four-way offensive, using 150 to 160 divisions. The victory was greater than expected. At the end of the European War, the General Headquarters had 90 divisions under its jurisdiction, most of which were jointly operated by tanks, anti-aircraft guns, and other subordinate units. When Germany surrendered, I had a total of 90 divisions, each division with about 17,000 men, more than twice the strength of the Soviet divisions.

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Fraught with Obstacles: The Full Picture of the Dispute Between Italy and Yugoslavia

The Question of Sovereignty Over Trieste is the Focus of the Dispute

Since the first Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in 1945, the issue of the Italian Peace Treaty has remained a sticking point and has not been fully resolved. The current Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in Paris is studying how to reach an agreement. This article, translated from "Foreign Policy Bulletin," is a special account of the border issue between Italy and Yugoslavia, and summarizes the opinions of both sides, which is very important reference material.

At the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, the three powers agreed to establish a Council of Foreign Ministers, which would meet in London "to draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Finland, etc., and to provide solutions to major territorial issues at the end of the European war." The agreement specifically emphasized that "the preparation of the Italian Peace Treaty is an important task that the new council should immediately undertake." The Foreign Ministers' Conference began in September 1945. After several consultations, it finally broke down without fulfilling its mission. In December of the same year, the three foreign ministers decided at a meeting in Moscow to authorize their deputies to immediately resume work in London in order to draft a treaty for submission to the peace conference scheduled for May 1, 1946. Although the deadline has passed, no progress has been made in reconciling the differences on the Italian Peace Treaty. The differences between the three powers mostly occurred in the issues of reparations, the disposition of Italian colonies, and the re-drawing of Italy's new borders. Regarding the very complex Italian-Yugoslav border dispute, the London Conference had an agreement, which stated: "The demarcation line should mainly be determined based on consideration of ethnicity, and regardless of sovereignty, Trieste should be an internationally administered free port." Although this agreement provided a formula for coordination, the heart of the problem had not been touched. Italy and Yugoslavia have great differences regarding "consideration of ethnicity." Therefore, this statement needs to be defined fairly and accurately. At that time, both countries had demands on sovereignty, and the term "sovereignty" also needs to be clearly defined. When the Foreign Ministers' Deputy Conference discussed this issue again in January 1946, it decided to send a special committee to Trieste to study the territorial claims disputed by all parties and make concrete recommendations before the peace conference. However, it is doubtful whether the committee can break through the difficulties for the solution of the problem. Therefore, people cannot help but think that the three powers made this resolution simply to delay the day when the problem must be solved.

If the issue of the Italian Peace Treaty could truly set aside all disputes, and there were no factors of competing for hegemony in Eastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean, the solution would definitely be easier and faster. Although European problems can be dealt with one by one, they all have inseparable connections. The solution to the Italian problem is obviously related to the new balance of power formed during the war. The most basic point is: who can share the sphere of influence in the Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea, and how should the main interests be distributed? From this point of view, the trust requests of Tripolitania and Eritrea, the future of the Greek and Dodecanese Islands, Italian reparations, and the new Italian-Yugoslav border are all intertwined. The focus of the border dispute is Trieste. The port of Trieste is located at the top of the Adriatic Sea, on the west coast of the Istrian Peninsula. However, the disputed area includes the area related to the different borders before and after the war. This area is called "Venezia Giulia" by the Italians. This area is 3,500 square miles and has a population of about one million. According to Italian estimates: 600,000 are Yugoslavs and 400,000 are Italians. According to Southern estimates: 650,000 are Yugoslavs and 250,000 are Italians.

Conflicting Demands from Both Sides

In the past two years, the situation has changed drastically, and Yugoslavia and Italy have been constantly arguing over the Venezia Giulia issue. Both sides hold their own views and are deadlocked. However, their opinions can be roughly divided as follows:

Yugoslavian Demands: These were described in detail in a memorandum submitted by Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj at the Foreign Ministers' Conference in September 1945. The memorandum requested that the border between Yugoslavia and Italy be extended westward, starting from the city of Monfalcone on the Adriatic coast and extending northward to the confluence of the Vipava and Isonzo rivers, and then extending north along the Isonzo River for a short section, and then northwest along the Tsintau road to the end point of the Italian border as the new national border. If Yugoslavia's request is realized, Italy's situation will not be as good as when it bordered Austria in 1914, and Yugoslavia will absorb 350,000 to 400,000 Italians. The reasons cited in the Yugoslav memorandum and various formal and informal supplementary talks can be summarized as follows: (1) In terms of population, the area requested by Yugoslavia is mostly Slovenian in the south and mostly Croatian in the north. Therefore, the combined population of Slovenians and Croatians accounts for the majority of the population in the area, and Slavs are the national group of Yugoslavia, accounting for the largest number of people. Generally speaking, Yugoslavia's request is largely correct, but the Southern side also said that the statistics include the figures made by Austria in 1910, which do not accurately reflect the current situation. They pointed out that the survey method of determining ethnic relations based on the language spoken has made the Italian population larger than the actual figure. They estimate that the total population of the area is 970,000, and Yugoslavs account for no less than 650,000. (2) As for the port of Trieste, the Southern side believes that the city "is entirely dependent on its interior, but the interior is not Italian but Yugoslavian. Although it is generally recognized that most of the population of Trieste is called Italian, the population is obviously very mixed. Since the entire port is surrounded by Slavic suburbs, its Slavic component is increasing, and the Italians in Trieste mostly supported the Liberation Army's movement during the war, which is enough to show their desire to follow Yugoslavia. In any case, Yugoslavia is determined to make Trieste an autonomous state within the Yugoslav Federation, with the same rights as other autonomous units. Therefore, the Italians will still have their own government, and their national rights will be guaranteed. In addition, the economic prosperity of Trieste can only be realized when it becomes part of Yugoslavia. There are many precedents for international co-management of commercial ports. International co-management of Trieste is by no means a solution to the problem." (3) Yugoslavia is a loyal ally of the victorious countries and has its own rights as a victor to this land.

Italian Demands: These are far less clear than Yugoslavia's. According to the memorandum submitted by Italian Foreign Minister Gasperi to the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Italian government is clearly adopting a consultative approach. It stated that in order to unite and reconstruct Europe, and especially to establish friendly relations between Italy and Yugoslavia, it is willing to make sacrifices. It recognized that Italy was guilty of fighting Yugoslavia, but it also pointed out that the Italian people did not want this war. Gasperi said: Regarding the border dispute, Italy is willing to accept international mediation, but hopes that the solution can be accepted by the "democratic government." He explained the solution that the Italian people considered fair, that is, the "Wilson Line" is generally reasonable. According to the "Wilson Line," Trieste should be left to Italy. Italy hopes to reach an agreement with other countries that intend to use the port, requesting that the port and suburbs not be disconnected, that it not lose railway links with Pola, and that Fiume be restored to its "isolated part." The Italians in the southern border should be properly protected, and Southern Italy should simultaneously disarm on the nearby coast. He specifically called for the rights to the Arsa coal mine, which supplies 30% of Italy's total coal production, and the bauxite mine necessary for the Italian aluminum industry. He pointed out that Italy is already an exporter of these two materials. The reasons for Italy's demands are: First, although Italy made mistakes during the fascist regime, it was loyal to the United Nations during the final victory period and made its important contributions. Therefore, it should not be treated as a defeated country. On the contrary, it should be regarded as a cooperating ally. Naturally, this is a judicial argument, which the Allied forces would never have considered during Italy's participation in the Axis powers. Second, depriving the Italian nation of hundreds of thousands of people, especially depriving it of sovereignty over Trieste, will cause resentment among the Italian people, thus making the "democratic government" unrealizable and making future relations between Southern Italy very disharmonious. In short, although Yugoslavia says that its claim is the consensus of the people in the area, it does not propose holding a plebiscite. A plebiscite may provide a real answer to the problem, but whether it can be held is a big question. (US Information Office)

### Imminent Atomic Bomb Test: Final Bombing Practice Conducted Yesterday; Test Costs Not Expected to Exceed $500 Million

[United Press Bikini Atoll B-29 Type Aircraft 24th Dispatch] The atomic bomb test is about to take place. Test personnel, including Major Swinkerd, conducted the final test flight today, dropping a practice bomb on the target ship Nevada with considerable accuracy. In the previous four test flights, practice bombs were dropped within 500 feet of the target. However, today, Vice Admiral White, in charge of the atomic bomb test, ordered the bomb to be dropped from an altitude of 600 feet. When Major Swinkerd's aircraft, "Tuff's Dream," took off from Kwajalein Island, an army air force captain accidentally touched the rapidly spinning propeller and died instantly.

[United Press Bikini Coral Island 23rd Dispatch] The final test flight of the B-29 aircraft carrying the atomic bomb, originally scheduled for the 22nd, was postponed to the 24th due to adverse weather conditions.

[Further Dispatch] The U.S. Navy Department yesterday defended the cost of the atomic bomb test, denying that the expenditures would exceed $500 million. Even if the test costs included most ships, personnel, supplies, and other factors, similar to the scale of wartime forces, this figure would not be reached. Navy Lieutenant Commander Cholin stated: The cost estimate will not be released until Test Commander Blandy submits the final report, but the gross amount will be lower than the construction cost of an "Iowa" class battleship, approximately $110 million. The lessons learned from this test will save countless lives, ships, and money in the future. The claim that the target ships are worth $400 million is also difficult to accept. This is an estimate of the total construction cost, but most of these warships are now worthless. If sold for scrap, the seventy-seven target ships would only be worth $5.5 million.

### New Type V2 Rocket Can Reach 100 Miles High

Scheduled for Test Launch on the 27th of this Month

[United States Information Service Washington 23rd Dispatch] On June 27th, the U.S. Army Ordnance Department will set an altitude record when launching the sixth V2 rocket at the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico. Joint research personnel from the Army and Navy will observe this rocket, filled with experimental recording instruments, penetrate the ionosphere. It is expected that the rocket will reach an altitude of 100 miles, a high-altitude area known only through observations of sunlight, auroras, meteorites, and radio wave reflections.

### Earthquake on the West Coast of the United States

[United Press Seattle 24th Dispatch] An earthquake occurred in the Pacific Ocean today, affecting areas from northwestern Washington to southern Vancouver Island and Kelowna Island in British Columbia. Many house walls collapsed, and some residents died from heart attacks as a result. According to records on the seismograph at the University of Washington, the first earthquake occurred at 9:14 AM. The eastern coast of Vancouver Island suffered the most damage. Witnesses in Courtenay reported that giant waves of seawater invaded the land.

### The Bullet That Killed the Former King of Siam Entered From the Front

Results of Coffin Examination

[United Press Bangkok 21st Dispatch] (Delayed) Official announcement: The body of the late King Ananda Mahidol has been exhumed, examined, and X-rayed, proving that the fatal bullet entered from the front, contrary to rumors that it entered from the back. The examination was conducted due to rumors that the King was assassinated.

### To Cope With Modern Warfare, the United States Needs to Maintain Strong Strength and Establish an Intelligence Military Academy to Cultivate Talent Early On

[Reuters London 23rd Dispatch] New York radio reports: General Eisenhower, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army, recently gave a speech stating that to save the United States in future wars, it is necessary to have a very large defense force that can be deployed immediately. If the United States can maintain a strong military position, it can prevent the threat of retaliatory aggression from enemies. In future wars, the U.S. military will need to penetrate deep into the enemy's heartland, defeat its troops, and seize its military equipment before it can stop its rocket attacks and bombing. Therefore, the United States needs to maintain its strength at all times.

[United Press Washington 23rd Dispatch] Secretary of the Navy Forrestal announced today that a well-organized and well-trained intelligence agency can determine the outcome of a war. To implement the strategy of "know yourself and know your enemy," the Navy Department will establish an intelligence officers' school on July 1st to cultivate talent.

### Relief for Refugees in Northern Jiangsu: Fundraising of 5 Million Yuan; Fundraising Committee Established Yesterday

Minister Gu and Chairman Wang Report on Inspection of Disaster Situation in Northern Jiangsu

[Our Newspaper Report] More than 3 million refugees in Northern Jiangsu are suffering under the devastation and oppression of the Communists, fleeing to other places. More than 50,000 refugees have arrived in Shanghai in recent days. Wu Zhihui, Du Yuesheng, Rong Desheng, Chen Guangfu, Qian Xinzhi, Leng Tong, Niu Tiansheng, and others have initiated the organization of the Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association. Yesterday at 4 PM, the establishment meeting was held at the Broadway Mansions, attended by more than 200 people from all walks of life. Wu Zhihui served as chairman and delivered the opening speech. Leng Tong then delivered a speech, stating briefly: Relieving the refugees in Northern Jiangsu is a matter for all people in Jiangsu Province, requiring a large force to solve. An appeal was made to the government, and Minister Gu Zhenggang of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Chairman Wang Maogong of Jiangsu Province were invited by the Central Government to inspect various places, which was deeply inspiring. However, the government's financial resources are limited, and Shanghai's economic situation is better than other places. With the fundraising planned by Mr. Du Yuesheng and others, it is believed that the compatriots in Shanghai can take on the task of disaster relief.

Minister Gu then reported on the inspection, saying that his mind was filled with sadness and anger when inspecting various places. He was very pleased to receive enthusiastic assistance from all walks of life. Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned and sympathetic to the refugees in Northern Jiangsu, and sent him to pay attention to relief. With the assistance of local gentry, the work has made considerable progress in a short period of time. The relief principles are divided into three stages: (1) To cooperate fully and unify the government and social forces. (2) To treat both the symptoms and the root cause, providing relief and restoring production. (3) To be practical and rapid, ensuring that all relief materials are used on the refugees and processed as soon as possible, as disaster relief is like putting out a fire. Regarding the organization, the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association was established under the principle of full cooperation to determine relief policies and material distribution. Offices were established in Xuzhou, Yangzhou, Haizhou, Nantong, and Taizhou to cooperate with local organizations to carry out work. Regarding relief work, refugee reception centers, refugee canteens, hospitals, clinics, medical teams, small loans, and job introductions are being organized. In addition to the portion issued by the Central Government, materials and donations are being solicited from society. A finance committee will be established to manage the custody and audit of these items.

Any relief worker who engages in corruption should be publicly reported, and the whistleblower can receive a reward of 30,000 to 300,000 yuan. If a refugee impersonates someone and is reported, the whistleblower can receive a reward of 10,000 to 50,000 yuan. The Central Government has allocated 1 billion yuan for relief facilities and 5,000 tons of flour, approximately 230,000 bags, including 69,000 tons for Xuzhou, 36,000 tons each for Yangzhou, Haizhou, and Yinzhou, 500 tons each for Nantong and Taizhou, and the remainder distributed to other places. Hygiene and medical equipment have also been expanded, and epidemic prevention and infectious disease hospitals have been established. It is estimated that there are approximately 3 million refugees displaced by the disaster in the counties of Northern Jiangsu, and 1.02 million people have been registered. They were all driven out by the Communist Party's "three-capital struggle." It is hoped that the compatriots in this city will contribute money, grain, and housing. The fundraising target is set at 2 billion to 5 billion yuan. The disaster in Northern Jiangsu is neither a natural disaster nor a national crisis, but a man-made disaster caused by the Communist Party, so we must not sit idly by.

Chairman Wang then delivered a speech, first thanking the compatriots in Jiangsu on behalf of the refugees in Northern Jiangsu, and said that the refugees in Northern Jiangsu are starving everywhere. We must shout loudly to send the refugees home as soon as possible; to save the youth, not to let them fall into the hands of bandits; and to let the Communist Party know that the people of Jiangsu are not easy to bully, and not to let them achieve the goal of social instability and people having no food to eat. The Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission has taken in 10,000 refugee youths, and the Ministry of Education has taken in 3,500. It is hoped that the compatriots in Shanghai will donate generously, not only providing material relief but also spiritual assistance.

Then, Qi Boxi, a representative of the refugees in Northern Jiangsu, reported on the disaster, tearfully. Those present were moved to tears. In addition to requesting relief for clothing, food, and housing, he also requested Minister Gu and Chairman Wang to forward a request to Chairman Chiang to "return home." Shortly after the report, more than 100 displaced youths gathered outside the door to petition. After Minister Gu and Chairman Wang personally comforted them, they retreated, shouting slogans in support of the Central Government.

At the end of the meeting, Wu Kaixian reported on the association's affairs and announced the list of responsible persons. After passing, the meeting adjourned. The director of the preparatory committee of the association is Du Yuesheng, the deputy director is Wu Kaiguang, there are 25 standing committee members, and the fundraising group is divided into the financial sector: Captain Chen Guangfu, Deputy Captains Bei Yizhi and Zhao Dihua. Industrial sector: Rong Desheng, Yang Guanbei, Xi Yushu. Business sector: Du Yuesheng, Wang Zhixin, Wang Liangzhong. Women's sector: Qian Jianqiu, Su Xiang, Tian Shujun. Labor sector: Lu Jingshi, Lu Yinchu, Chen Peide. Performing arts sector: Tang Zhuanzhi, Zhao Peixin, Wang Qijun. Sports events: Gu Jiatang, E Sen, Tang Shichang. General fundraising: Wu Shaoshu, Wang Zhuyi, Li Wenjie. The general secretary is Wang Xianqing.

More than 30 people including Ge Kexin and Wang Zhuyi attended. First, Zhu Hua, director of the Jiangbei Service Agency, reported on the process of registering refugees and earnestly requested the prompt implementation of relief. Then, Minister Gu delivered a speech, stating briefly that he was ordered to inspect Northern Jiangsu, and the victims in various places were crying bitterly because national disasters should be endured, and natural disasters should be endured, but this man-made disaster should not be endured, so they cried. Under these serious circumstances, after consultation, a sound organization was established based on the principles of unified cooperation and treatment of both symptoms and root causes to complete the relief work. Finally, various attendees delivered speeches and the meeting adjourned.

### Difficult to Put Out Due to Strong Winds: Fire at the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury; Cheng Ami Dies in the Fire, Three Missing; Fire at Guangyi Engraving Company Causes Major Disaster

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday afternoon, while Shanghai was being hit by a fierce gale, the largest fire since the victory occurred in Shanghai.

At 1:40 PM, a fire suddenly broke out on the third floor of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury building at 17 and 19 Avenue Edward VII. At that time, there was a strong wind. In fifteen minutes, the flames on the third floor had spread from west to east, becoming a sea of fire!

Wang Ying, a reporter for the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, had just finished eating and was resting on the third floor. He did not know that he was surrounded by flames on three sides. He only heard a clamor of voices below. He quickly looked out the window and realized that a fire had broken out. The corridor on the third floor was full of thick smoke. Below, several workers from the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury were holding a truck tarp open, as if preparing for someone to jump, but this was only a precaution. Jumping from the third floor was quite dangerous. However, he first dropped a box and then jumped down!

The street was already full of onlookers, many of whom were employees of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury. Watching him jump, everyone couldn't help but close their eyes - but Mr. Wang Ying was lucky and landed safely without any injuries!

Cheng Rongming, a typesetter at the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, rushed to his room on the third floor as soon as he heard that there was a fire on the third floor. He desperately dragged out his wife, but he couldn't rescue his three-year-old son, Cheng Ami, and watched him die in the fire.

As of 10 PM last night, those still missing included Ms. Pu Cai, a 53-year-old woman who was bedridden with mental illness, and her seven-year-old granddaughter, Pu Pinfang. Cheng Xiangsheng, the five-year-old son of Mr. Cheng of the distribution department of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, is also still missing and his whereabouts are unknown.

The second floor of the newspaper building was full of water stains, but the machines and paper of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury were not damaged. Not only that, the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury was still published as usual yesterday, with the news of the newspaper building fire as the headline!

The editorial department of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury was on the ground floor, and all documents and typewriters were intact. However, many reference materials piled up on the third floor were completely destroyed.

The owner of this building is Mr. Morris, the owner of the North-China Daily News. The building is quite old and is one of the oldest buildings in Shanghai. At one time, a very luxurious casino was opened there. The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury moved in in 1929. There were many tenants on the third floor. Those burned down yesterday included the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury Radio Station, the New York Times office, Guangyi Engraving Company, and some dormitories for Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury employees. Zheng Zhaoji, general manager of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury Radio Station, and manager Wang Yanxun said that broadcasting could be restored within ten days.

The fire burned for two hours. By evening, Pan Zhichong and Wang Changyuan, detectives from the Huangpu Branch, had determined that the fire started at Guangyi Engraving Company.

The Henan Road Fire Brigade was the first to arrive yesterday, but was unable to put out the fire due to the strong winds. Later, almost all of the city's fire brigades were dispatched, and as many as twelve fire engines arrived one after another. U.S. military firefighters and military police also arrived, and finally put out the catastrophe in the strong winds. Renji Hospital received a soap box in the evening, with the small body of Cheng Ami lying in the box.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Holds Meeting to Discuss Overall Business Plan

[Our Newspaper Report] After the victory, the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company returned to Shanghai to resume its operations and received many enemy and puppet ships. The government also purchased a large number of ships from the United States and handed them over to the company. Therefore, the company has a large number of ships, but various routes are still not smooth, which has been criticized by all parties.

With the development of business, income could be increased and the company's economy could be improved. The above proposal has been approved by the general manager and it has been decided to convene a meeting tomorrow (Wednesday) of the heads of all departments and specialists to carefully study the various sections of the proposal.

### Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation: US Delegation to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow

Scheduled to stay in China for five to six months. Minister Zhou comes to Shanghai to prepare for welcome.

Since the victory of the War of Resistance, China's agricultural rehabilitation work has been actively carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. However, the establishment of China's agricultural policy, the thorough improvement of agricultural technology, and the increase and promotion of export agricultural products all require referring to the past experiences of friendly countries and utilizing the cooperation of their experts and technology. In September of last year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to conduct preliminary consultations with the US government on the issue of Sino-American agricultural technology cooperation. After several months of back-and-forth negotiations, the cooperation plan was recently approved by the governments of China and the United States. Agricultural experts were selected by both governments to jointly form the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Team. The main task of the team is to thoroughly investigate the state of Chinese agriculture, refer to American knowledge and experience, and jointly draft specific plans for Sino-American agricultural technology cooperation, with particular emphasis on the improvement of export agricultural products, to provide options for both governments to adopt and implement. The Chinese delegation has been appointed by the Executive Yuan. The American delegation flew from San Francisco on the 22nd of this month and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 26th.

[Our Dispatch] The trial of Hu Zewu, the fake Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and Tao Kangde, the editor of the fake Zhonghua Weekly, concluded yesterday afternoon, and the sentencing is scheduled for the 29th of this month. Hu Zewu argued that he had helped central personnel engage in underground activities in Anhui, Bengbu, and other places, and that the "Constitutional Implementation Committee" in which he participated was an empty document with little significance, and therefore did not cause great harm to the country or the people. Tao Kangde claimed that his editing of "Zhonghua Weekly" was to preserve his life while weakening enemy propaganda, which was beneficial to the people, and that he did not make any statements at the "Greater East Asia Writers' Conference," which did not harm the country. Xu Zuiren, a clerk in the Gongji Rice Shop, was prosecuted by the High Procuratorate as a suspected traitor for allegedly purchasing grain for the enemy. He was interrogated several times and the trial concluded yesterday, with sentencing scheduled for the morning of the 29th of this month.

### Stealing is Worse Than Smuggling in the Huangpu River

[Our Dispatch] According to Secretary Liu of the Jianghai Customs Secretariat, the problem of smuggling of foreign goods is not as serious as imagined, as the reasons for smuggling are nothing more than tax evasion and avoidance of prohibited items (such as luxury goods, which are prohibited from import). Currently, the prices of American goods are mostly cheap, so there is no need to evade taxes. The number of luxury goods smuggled in is also not large. He also said that there are currently three types of smuggled goods: those carried by sailors on ships, US military supplies, and those transported by aircraft. Regarding the latter, a company established by Filipinos was discovered two months ago using aircraft to transport smuggled goods. Therefore, customs officers are now stationed at Longhua, Dachang, and Hongqiao airports. Liu also said that the most serious problem at present is theft. Foreign ships often have to anchor in the harbor for weeks or months waiting for a dock or warehouse. During this long period, goods are inevitably stolen. Liu believes that in addition to the customs fulfilling its responsibilities, he also hopes that the military and police authorities will provide assistance.

### Kong Xiangxi's Bodyguard: Sentenced to Imprisonment for Murder

After being summoned back, they reconciled. However, Xu Li, who had a habit of spending money, was unemployed, so he often asked Lili for money. Despite repeated reprimands, he still went to see her from time to time. On March 27th of this year, Xu asked Wu Guorong to meet at Tushanwan and demanded money again. The two argued, and Wu drew his usual pistol to threaten him. Xu lunged forward to seize the gun and was shot and killed.

### Massive Robbery at Lao Fengxiang: Both People and Goods Recovered in One Day

[Our Dispatch] Su Henghua, an apprentice at Lao Fengxiang Yongji Silver Shop on Jinling Road, was robbed of a large amount of gold at 9:30 AM the day before yesterday while taking it to No. 112-114, Puan Road, for melting. After the incident, Song, the director of the Taishan Branch Bureau, and Section Chief Zhang, personally went to the site to investigate, believing that the old accountant Lu Dagen was highly suspicious, and took him back to the bureau for interrogation, where he confessed after questioning.

Section Chief Zhang led officers Yang Xinzhong, plainclothes police Gao Wenrong, and Xu Yushi to the location for a thorough investigation. At around 2 PM, they saw Zhu returning home hurriedly and arrested him. He confessed to the robbery without hesitation. Subsequently, the stolen goods, a pistol, and six bullets were recovered at No. 65, Yuanchengbang, Yuyuan Road. Lu Dagen, as an instigator, was also taken back to the bureau and detained, and will be sent to the District Procuratorate for investigation.

### Talking About Fire Brigades

Fires are less common in hot weather than in winter, so citizens temporarily overlook the importance of the Fire Department. However, they may see ambulances speeding by on the streets every day. Traffic accident events now number more than three or four hundred per month. The Fire Department is also responsible for transporting seriously injured patients to hospitals.

Shanghai's Fire Department has a fairly strong lineup in terms of equipment and personnel. It merged the two fire departments that were directly under the former concession's Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council into one, increasing its strength and expanding its service area to the four suburbs outside the city. The current Fire Department is under the jurisdiction of the Police Bureau, and the director, Zhou Zhaoxiang, previously served in Chongqing.

The organization of the Fire Department is as follows: the Department is divided into three sections. The first section is the Prevention Section, which is responsible for investigating licenses and inspecting fire-fighting equipment in public entertainment venues, factories, and schools. If anything is incomplete, it is corrected in time to prevent fires from occurring. The second section is the Rescue Section, which is responsible for all matters relating to fires, such as rescue, first aid, communications, and administration, as well as training police officers. The third section is the Mechanical Section, which has its own factory to repair damaged fire trucks. There are now two factories, one in Hongkou and one in Taishan District. The factory in Taishan District will soon be moved to Hongkou. In addition to the three sections, there is also a Fire Brigade directly under the Department, which has nine district teams: Central, Hongkou, Yangshupu, Xinzha, Jing'an, Yichang, Taishan, Wuxing, and Xinkaihe. In addition, there are also privately run volunteer fire brigades, distributed in areas such as Shanghai South, Zhabei, Shanghai West, Pudong, and Hongkou. They all liaise with the Fire Department to facilitate their work.

A Total of 152 Vehicles of All Sizes

According to Section Chief Li of the Second Section, the Fire Department has a total of 823 police officers from top to bottom, and a total of 152 vehicles, including bicycles. Among them, there are six light fire trucks, seventeen medium-sized pumper trucks, sixteen large pumper trucks, and six ladder trucks. In addition, there are also rescue vehicles, lighting vehicles, steam pumper trucks, and fire boats. Officers are divided into five types: drivers, firefighters, medical staff, communicators, and lookouts, each with their own specific duties. Section Chief Li believes that firefighting is a specialized profession and that they must learn special skills. After three months of training and passing an examination, they can be promoted to formal police officers. The most important requirements for recruitment are physical strength and the ability to lift heavy objects. Firefighters have one major rest every seven days. The rest of the time, they must be stationed at the fire station in case of emergencies. There are morning exercises every morning, and roll call must be taken at noon. Speaking of their treatment, Section Chief Li shook his head and said, "Considering their work, the reward is too meager." Section Chief Li believes that the outside world has too many misunderstandings about firefighters. "Good and bad cannot be lumped together."

Firefighting Steps

The steps for responding to fire alarms are as follows: The headquarters has a control room. When an alarm is reported from the outside, the control room immediately rings the bell to notify the district team where the fire has occurred. The communications room of the district team receives a direct call from the headquarters and immediately orders the dispatch. At the same time, it reports to the control room. If the fire is large, the control room directly orders other district teams to assist, so the speed is very high. Within a few minutes of receiving the report, the fire truck can arrive at the scene of the fire.

Finally, Section Chief Li said, "The traffic on the streets is too congested, which sometimes hinders the passage of fire trucks." (Shan)

Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue reported on the measures to address the symptoms and root causes of Shanghai's public utilities from January to June of this year, as well as the plans to improve and build a greater Shanghai in the future. Regarding: (1) Water supply issues, such as the plan to establish the West Shanghai Pumping Plant and actively organize a city-wide water supply network. (2) Electricity supply issues, as the city's power generation load has reached its peak, measures are being taken to increase the power supply. By the end of this year, the power plants are expected to increase to 170,000 kilowatts. (3) Gas supply, as the city has only three gas plants, which are insufficient to meet the demand, it is planned to add a plant in the South City. (4) Land transportation, as statistics show that public transportation vehicles have decreased compared to the pre-war period, while private vehicles have increased. Efforts are being made to develop public bus services. The French-owned 21st Road Bus Company has been ordered to find ways to resume operations.

### Chen Lifu Speaks on Kuomintang-Communist Negotiations at Joint Memorial Week: Hopes the Communist Party Will Meet with Sincerity to Achieve Peace Soon

[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Education Bureau, Social Affairs Bureau, and Land Administration Bureau held a joint memorial week at 11:00 AM yesterday at the Social Affairs Bureau auditorium. Bureau chiefs and staff members from each bureau, totaling about 300 people, attended. After the ceremony, Chen Lifu gave a speech on the issue of Kuomintang-Communist negotiations, stating: Since 1935, the National Government has begun to engage in sincere negotiations with the Communist Party. After eleven years of failure to achieve a satisfactory outcome, it is entirely due to the Communist Party's lack of sincerity. The most important issues at present are: (1) Restoration of transportation, and (2) Military reorganization plan. The Central Government has provided reasonable solutions, but the Communist Party has not complied, resulting in the current "stalemate." However, Chen expressed his hope that the Communist Party would consider the future of the country and the suffering of the people, and meet with "sincerity" to achieve peace as soon as possible. Chen was emotional yesterday, speaking eloquently until the meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.

Hurricane Whispers Past Shanghai

[Another Dispatch] Yesterday, Shanghai was disturbed by the tendrils of the hurricane, with strong winds of about five to six degrees. As the hurricane is moving inland from Jinhua towards Shanghai, it will sweep past Shanghai and enter the sea last night or at dawn today, when the wind force will increase to a huge level 8.

Navigation Obstructed

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday morning, the Jianghai Customs received a report from the Astronomical Observatory that a hurricane would hit Shanghai. It immediately hoisted a black ball on the roof of the clock tower flagpole to warn ships to take precautions and prohibit exports to avoid danger. In the evening, it changed to a red light, so the number of ships entering and leaving the port yesterday was greatly reduced. Only the Taigu Company's Niuzhuang ship, from Qingdao, entered the port, arriving at Wusongkou the night before yesterday and entering the port at 6:00 AM yesterday morning. The China Merchants Bureau's Jiangping ship, also from Qingdao, entered the port at around 4:00 PM, and the Jiangtai ship from the Yangtze River entered the port at around 5:00 PM. Only the Xiaoda Express ship, which travels to Chongming, exported. The ship exports every morning and returns to Shanghai in the afternoon, but it was not seen returning to Shanghai yesterday afternoon, probably due to the hurricane. The ships of the Dada Datong Joint Office, which travel to Nantong Haimen, were all suspended yesterday. The Jiangya ship of the Shanghai-Ningbo line of the China Merchants Bureau and the Huohua of the Ping An Bureau also stopped exporting. The Jiangya ship was rescheduled to sail to Ningbo this morning, and the Dahua ship was rescheduled to sail to Ningbo on the 26th. The Haweimen, which travels to India under the management of Tiensh Foreign Firm, also temporarily stopped exporting due to the wind. The Suimiweier, managed by Shunting Foreign Firm, came to Shanghai from the United States and has arrived at Wusongkou. Because the hurricane prevented the pilot from boarding the ship to guide it, it is temporarily anchored outside the port. The Yisheng ship of Yihua Foreign Firm, which came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, was scheduled to arrive yesterday. According to the company's news, the ship is currently sheltering from the wind in Xiamen and will sail here after the wind subsides, which is expected to be delayed by two days.

However, due to transportation and other related factors, the quantity of exchange is still limited, averaging about several thousand tons per month. If calculated according to the proportions needed by our country, the difference is enormous. At present, the types of goods exchanged mainly include transportation equipment, mining equipment, and silkworm eggs for exports, and wheat, salt, and bran for imports. Based on actual needs, our country hopes to import power equipment and rayon in the future. It is reported that relevant authorities plan to dispatch personnel to Japan early next month to conduct inspections and negotiate future trade goods exchanges. It is noted that this exchange of goods is of a general international trade nature and has nothing to do with the Japanese compensation issue.

### National Maritime School Stipulates Enrollment Standards for This Year's Summer Enrollment, Prioritizing Students from Coastal Provinces

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch] In the past, there were very few marine professionals in our country, which led to the decline of maritime power and the withering of the shipping industry. Not only was the maritime shipping industry entirely in the hands of foreigners, but even inland river shipping was mostly occupied by foreign vessels. Scholars believe that a large part of the weakness of the Qing Dynasty was due to the "maritime disease." Now that unequal treaties have been abolished, our country's shipping industry urgently needs to be restored. The Ministry of Education is urgently seeking to cultivate this talent and strive to remedy the situation. It previously planned to establish a naval vocational school, with the school site determined to be at Shangxinhe in Wuchang, and Liu Kaikun was appointed as the school's president. Liu graduated from the first class of the Naval Department of the Huangpu Military Academy, then graduated from the Shipbuilding Department of the Danzig University of Technology in Germany, and worked in shipping in England for many years. He also held important technical positions in Tongji University, the Ministry of Communications and Navy, and the China Merchants Bureau. Two years ago, he was appointed by the Military Commission as the deputy leader of the shipping and shipbuilding inspection delegation to England and wrote many specialized works. After Liu took office as president, he was determined to plan and implement the establishment of a complete National Maritime School. In addition to having spacious and perfect school buildings, there are eleven large and small ships and many motorized sailing ships, and a mechanical practice factory is being planned. In addition to recruiting a small number of students last year, the school stipulates enrollment standards for this year's summer enrollment, prioritizing the enrollment of students from coastal provinces. Personnel will be dispatched to major coastal ports to handle enrollment matters. Furthermore, because the general public still lacks understanding of this, it is ordered to explain the nature of the school and the needs of national construction in the future before enrollment. The number of students admitted will be determined by the candidate's level, physical condition, character, and aspirations, emphasizing quality and temporarily delaying the expansion of quantity.

### National Secondary Schools Return to Their Original Locations, Those with Special Circumstances Temporarily Remain the Same

[Our Newspaper's Chongqing Special Dispatch] During the War of Resistance, in order to assist the faculty and students of secondary schools that had withdrawn from various occupied areas, the Ministry of Education established three temporary national secondary schools in Henan, Sichuan, and Guizhou from December 1937, to accommodate students who had withdrawn from Ji, Cha, Sui, Ping, Jin, Jing, Su, Zhe, and Wan. Later, multiple national secondary schools were established for faculty and students from Shaanxi, Gansu, Hubei, Anhui, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, as well as the Northeast. Vocational, industrial, fishery, and normal schools were also established, as well as schools for children in orphanages to continue their education. The scope of the work increased year by year. After the victory, the education systems in various provinces and cities were restored, and these national secondary schools have been ordered by the Ministry to be managed by the respective provinces and cities. The Ministry of Education is now actively supervising the provinces and cities to handle this matter so that all areas can be completed after the summer. However, it is reported that the national secondary schools in remote provinces, vocational secondary schools, overseas Chinese secondary schools, and the provinces and cities' current capacity to take over this year are temporarily insufficient. Therefore, it is temporarily necessary for the central government to continue to maintain them, or those with special circumstances will temporarily remain the same, remaining national institutions. These include National Suiyuan Secondary School, Huangchuan Secondary School, Hexi Secondary School, Northeast Zhongshan Secondary School, Central Industrial College Joint Vocational School, Central Senior Nursing School, Central Senior Midwifery School, Southwest Zhongshan Senior Industrial School, Senior Commercial Vocational School, Maritime Vocational School, Hanmin Secondary School, Chengda Normal School, Longdong Normal School, and two overseas Chinese secondary and normal schools.

### Kunshan Library Preserves Valuable Documents and Rare Books, County Magistrate Shen Xiafei Submits a Request to the Provincial Government for Awards

[Our Newspaper's Kunshan Dispatch] The Kunshan Library has magnificent architecture and a rich collection of books, with a history of thirty years since its establishment. It is particularly rich in the writings of the county's sages, including a copy of "Tianxia Junguo Libing Shu" (Book on the Advantages and Disadvantages of the Provinces and States) by the great Ming scholar Gu Tinglin, with inscriptions by collectors Huang Yaopu, Qian Daxin, and others. It was previously owned by the Xu family's Chuanshi Building in Kunshan, and scholars from all over the country competed to see it. Before the War of Resistance, the Shanghai Commercial Press repeatedly borrowed it from the library to be reproduced in the "Sibu Congkan." Currently, the original manuscript and the masterpieces of literary and classical scholars such as Gui Zhenchuan, Zhu Bailu, and Gu Dehui have remained intact despite the war, which is a great blessing for Jiangzuo literature. In reality, this is due to the responsible preservation by Wang, the former director of the Kunshan Library, the instructors, and Lu Jian, Li Qian, and Wu Gang, who were responsible for depositing the books, as well as the local gentry during the War of Resistance. Now, Kunshan County Magistrate Shen Xiafei and Chairman of the Provisional Council Zhu Jingzhi believe that the preservation of this local heritage has a great impact on local literature. Therefore, they have specially requested that Chairman Wang of the Jiangsu Provincial Government praise the personnel who preserved and maintained the items to emphasize culture and education.

### Nanching Secondary School Renamed College, Decided by Jiangsu Provisional Council

[Our Newspaper's Jiangyin Dispatch] Nanching Secondary School was originally Nanching Academy during the late Qing Dynasty, with extensive school property. It was once renamed Nanching College. After the success of the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, it was renamed Jiangsu Nanching Secondary School, which is of a public nature. It was originally intended to be transferred to the province, but at that time, the school's property was abundant, and there were concerns that its future would be problematic if it was taken over by the province. After strenuous efforts by the board of directors, it remained a public institution, with the board of directors responsible for funding and not subject to provincial control. Graduates from each session have been talented. In 1937, with the outbreak of the War of Resistance, all of the school's buildings were almost completely destroyed. After the victory, Li Tianmin took over and began reorganization. The number of students increased sharply compared to before the war, and a committee was organized to be responsible for reorganizing the school property such as the sand fields. The Jiangsu Provisional Council decided at its tenth meeting on the 15th to change the school's name to Nanching College, while the secondary school portion was transferred to the province.

### Sichuan Province Guest Teachers and Staff Telegraph Government Requesting Grant of Subsidized Return Travel Expenses, According to the Precedent of Public and Private Primary and Secondary Schools in Chongqing

Other schools are also preparing lists, and they will be issued successively once the review is completed.

### Grand Charity Soccer Match Tomorrow, Qingbai and Hong Kong Star East to Meet Again, Du Yuesheng and Others Initiate Plea for Disaster Victims, Tickets Divided into Three Types: 20,000, 15,000, and 10,000

The disasters in central Hunan and northern Jiangsu are severe. Du Yuesheng, Wu Kaixian, Zhang Shizhao, Fan Shaozeng, Gu Jiatang, and others, in view of this, took advantage of the visit of the Hong Kong Star East soccer team to Shanghai to request a charity soccer match to raise funds for disaster relief. The Sports Association's Soccer Committee has resolved to accept the request and has scheduled a rematch against the local soccer champion Qingbai team at the Yiyuan Stadium at 5:30 PM tomorrow. Star East has played six matches in Shanghai, with four wins and two losses, which is a decent record. The team originally planned to go to Beijing to compete but decided to cancel due to time constraints. Tomorrow's charity match is an unavoidable obligation. Star East previously lost to Qingbai by a score of 1 to 3, so tomorrow is a good opportunity for revenge. The outcome is related to the entire team's reputation, and both sides will surely give their all to compete.

Ticket Prices

According to the committee's announcement, the prices for the charity match tickets are 5,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan for the grandstand, and there will be seats priced at 20,000 yuan inside the stadium. All proceeds, after deducting expenses, will be used to relieve disaster victims in both regions. Mr. Du said, "Buying one more ticket saves one more life." He hopes that soccer fans will show their enthusiasm and lend a hand to the disaster-stricken refugees. Tickets will be sold at the Municipal Gymnasium starting at 1:00 PM tomorrow. Complimentary tickets will not be issued, and long-term tickets will not be valid. Military and police personnel must purchase tickets to enter. The matter concerns relieving disaster victims, so please support this charitable act.

Strict Security

As for the stadium order, new plans have been made and carefully considered. Tomorrow, a large number of military police from the Garrison Command and the Municipal Police Department will be dispatched to maintain order. The police department's patrol cars will also be dispatched. Strict security will be implemented around the Yiyuan Stadium to prevent troublemakers from operating. Those without tickets should not attempt to sneak in, as stealing a ticket is equivalent to stealing from the refugees, and their conscience will surely be condemned.

Last Three Matches

In addition to tomorrow's match, Star East will also perform a small soccer demonstration at the invitation of the Small Soccer Association on Thursday and play against the Donghua team at the invitation of Guanghua University for the Guanghua Cup to raise funds for the university's restoration on Friday. Both matches will be held at the Yiyuan Stadium. The team may return to Hong Kong on the 29th. The schedule for the last three matches is as follows:

Charity Disaster Relief Match: Star East vs. Qingbai, 5:30 PM, June 26th, referee Zhang Le, linesmen Deng Xiaoliang and Huang Renyi.

### Principal Zhu Kezhen's Speech: Zhejiang University Today and Tomorrow

— Zhu Rentian

Every month, I receive many letters from high school students and friends, both graduates and soon-to-be graduates, who are filled with longing to attend Zhejiang University. They ask me to report on news about Zhejiang University. At the time, I always politely replied, "Principal Zhu will be coming to Hangzhou soon. Details will be provided later," deflecting their questions. This morning (the 14th), Principal Zhu gathered all faculty and students in the main hall of the main campus to give a detailed report on the situation at Zhejiang University, which can serve as a reference for them and for even more people who aspire to attend Zhejiang University. Therefore, without being ashamed of my own lack of ability, I have extracted a portion of Principal Zhu Kezhen's speech from my diary and presumptuously titled it "Zhejiang University Today and Tomorrow," disclosing it to the public.

Zhejiang University, including faculty and students from the main campus, totals over two thousand people. Except for those carrying heavy loads and graduating students, approximately fifteen hundred people moved back to Hangzhou with the school. Most of the students have passed through Hankou and safely arrived in Nanjing. Except for one student who unfortunately fell and died, the journey has been safe for the majority. They can be expected to arrive in Hangzhou soon. However, due to insufficient school buildings and the time required for construction, no students from either the main campus or branch campuses will be allowed to stay on campus during the summer. As for school staff, books, and equipment, they total approximately three hundred tons, and the luggage of all faculty and students exceeds one thousand tons. In terms of transportation procedures, Zhejiang University is listed as number thirty-seven. However, the school has a fixed opening date, and many instruments and books must arrive within the specified time. Therefore, it was necessary to establish a special office in Chongqing to plan and handle automobile transportation matters. However, today, after the victory, the difficulty of transportation is almost greater than during the war. Transporting each ton from Chongqing to Hangzhou costs over one million national currency. This difficult situation cannot help but make us lament, "Restoration is more difficult than fleeing!"

As for the school building issue, the Zunyi main campus occupies four thousand square units. Therefore, Zhejiang University will need at least six thousand square units after the restoration to solve the working space and accommodation for all faculty and students. Before the war, the school buildings of Zhejiang University were already not considered perfect. Important buildings were destroyed after the fall of the city. Although there are no accurate surveys of the remaining school buildings, a rough estimate is no more than two thousand five hundred square units, leaving a shortage of three thousand five hundred square units. Based on current prices, it would cost approximately 350 million yuan to complete these three thousand five hundred square units of school buildings. However, the Ministry of Education's restoration fund is only 150 million yuan, far from the ideal amount. Considering the practical difficulties, we have temporarily set the school buildings at four thousand square units as the plan to proceed with. The construction of the new one thousand five hundred square units is planned to begin immediately with bidding, aiming to be completed by the end of October. Therefore, the opening date of the school will have to be postponed to the beginning of November.

Due to the limitations of the school buildings, the enrollment and the addition of a medical school, as well as departments to the law school, must be considered. Currently, the number of students in the temporary universities operated by the Ministry of Education in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places totals five to six thousand. Furthermore, the number of discharged youth soldiers whose academic qualifications are high school graduates or have completed the fifth semester is no less than several thousand. They are planned to be distributed to universities in the Southeast, and naturally, Zhejiang University will not be an exception. However, we know that university education aims to cultivate practical and applicable cadres. Therefore, there must be a semi-official curriculum, a diligent atmosphere, and strict examinations at the school. I remember that a British visiting group's criticism of Zhejiang University was that it could be compared to the famous universities in England in all aspects, which is comforting and reassuring. I personally do not deny the level of the students from the temporary universities and those who served in the military, but they must follow Zhejiang University's consistent practice of entrance examinations or placement examinations. I have also discussed this point with the authorities of the Ministry of Education. However, this is an overall issue, and the wise education authorities should have an overall solution.

Everyone knows that the motto of Zhejiang University is "Seeking Truth." Today's commemoration should be at the former site of the "Seeking Truth Academy." In fact, the two words "Seeking Truth" are not only the guidelines for conduct and dealing with the world, but also the ultimate goal of scientific inquiry in this era.

Yes, the 20th century is the "Century of the People," an era of democracy. In this era, everyone has the freedom of belief and speech. However, we must pay attention to one point: so-called "democracy" naturally takes the welfare of the greatest number of people as the greatest premise and the opinions of the greatest number of people as the overall opinion. However, at the same time, we must respect the opinions of the minority, and at least give the minority as much opportunity to speak as possible. The Communist Party in the British Parliament occupies very few seats, but Communist Party members can still speak freely in Parliament, expressing their views fully. This is true democracy. The Soviet Union does not work that way. They only have the right to speak for the workers and peasants, and they obliterate other classes. This cannot be called true democracy. Therefore, I say: "The British system has equality in political status but inequality in economic status; the Soviet Union has equality in economic status but inequality in political status. In short, they are walking diverging paths. Whether in Hangzhou or in Nongyi, students like to post notices to express their will. Yes, this is the spirit of democracy. However, since it is "expressing one's will," the document should naturally be "borne by oneself." The notice must bear your signature or at least state your address. This is the essence of freedom of speech.

Schools are places for "cultivating people over a hundred years." Their mission is to cultivate practical and applicable talents. Therefore, I oppose any partisan political activities in schools. Several universities in the inland could not straighten their spines or stand up straight because of this. In today's democratic era, we do not oppose freedom of belief, but we deny that schools are places for political parties to compete. While you can have your own thoughts and beliefs while in school, you cannot force everyone in the world to have the same thoughts and beliefs as you, causing a "left? right?" struggle.

Some people object to students' ambitions to "become high officials" and "make a lot of money." I personally do not think so. I think everyone should aspire to "become high officials," but becoming high officials must mean doing great things; everyone must aspire to "make a lot of money," but it must start with undertakings related to "national economy and people's livelihood," such as revitalizing water conservancy, exploiting minerals, and developing transportation. Today, we only know that politics is not on the right track, officials protect each other, and officials are corrupt. In fact, these corrupt officials also shouted slogans of saving the country and wrote slogans of "Down with corrupt officials" like you ten or twenty years ago. Why? This is because they did not pay attention to small things while in school, and these small things are enough to affect the future. For example, taking public light bulbs for private use, breaking glass windows to垫 case files - These are all small things, but they are the roots of corruption. We can also report them for corruption, because light bulbs and glass are all public, national property.

Author's note: This article was sent hastily and has not been reviewed by Principal Zhu. If there are any discrepancies, I will be solely responsible.

### Record of the Hankou City Sports Meet: Athletics and Gymnastics Competition Divided into Open, Men's, Women's, High School, and Middle School Groups Achieved Good Results

[This newspaper's Hankou Dispatch] The Hankou City Sports Meet, which has been in preparation for a long time, was originally scheduled to open on June 1st. However, due to various difficulties, it was postponed to the 8th. Due to rain and wet grounds, it was rescheduled to officially open on the 10th at the newly built National Sports Field in Zhongshan Park. The opening ceremony began at 10:00 AM, with Chairman Xu Huizhi of the organizing committee delivering a speech, briefly stating the importance of groups and national physical fitness, and explaining the purpose of the competition, which is to promote sports.

### Joe Louis Announces He Will Fight Again This Autumn

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Spectators who paid high prices to watch the Joe Louis vs. Blevins fight, along with American sports reporters, were extremely indignant about Blevins's perfunctory performance.

Woolcott ranks fourth among the world's [heavyweights], while Morel ranks fifth. Most of the spectators at the Louis vs. Khan fight were foreigners. New Yorkers were unwilling to attend because the ticket prices were too high.

Spot transactions declined slightly in the afternoon, but next-day transactions were still easily restored. As a result, the price rose 12,000 compared to last Saturday. Ornaments and silver were flat. The black market interest rate was from 1.2 to 1.5 fen.

Foreign currency US dollars were weak but stabilized easily. Transactions were also very limited. After opening at 2,640 yuan in the morning, buying orders were maintained. Soon, the price rose slightly above 2,670 yuan. At noon, the price hovered around 2,660 yuan. The afternoon remained stable. As a result, the price was similar to last Saturday.

The British exchange rate was from 8,200 to 8,400, while the US exchange rate was apparently flat but quietly inactive.

### Unified C Only Has Balancing Accounts

Small Banks Absorb Miscellaneous Brands

There were no formal transactions for public bonds. There were some uncompleted transactions outside the market, with mutual offsetting. Miscellaneous brands were actively absorbed by small banks with surplus funds. Unified C was entirely balancing accounts. Physical transactions were unheard of. The asking price rose from 700 yuan to around 850 yuan at the close. As a result, the price was slightly more stable compared to last Saturday. Miscellaneous brands ranged from 350 yuan to 550 yuan.

Yesterday, the yarn market generally soared. Double Horse yarn led the way, with miscellaneous brands following closely. All counts, coarse and fine, rose. Double Horse was the most dramatic, jumping 120,000 yuan, mainly because customers from South China uniquely favored this brand. They flocked to a new high of 1,560,000. However,

### Double Horse Jumps 120,000; Miscellaneous Brands, Coarse and Fine, Follow Suit

Golden Rooster and Dafa both had a feeling of being out of reach. It is said that Double Horse is bought from Guangdong and resold to Nanyang and Hong Kong, targeting only Double Horse. Transactions for mid-size 20s and 16s yarn were not very enthusiastic, but prices followed, rising 30,000 to 40,000. Weaving factories' appetites for 42s double-strand thread gradually opened up, also rising 70,000. At noon, the Textile Construction Company opened yarn auctions as usual. Fine yarn prices, 32s and above, were marked up 50,000 to 200,000 compared to the previous period. However, 100s double-strand thread was no longer available for sale yesterday, and a new type of no-brand spool yarn was added, priced at 150,000, with each piece weighing only 268 pounds.

### Spot Cotton Transactions Still Good

Yesterday, New York American cotton telegraphs reported a rise of 9 to 12 pounds. The deferred price was 29.48, the forward price was 29.55, and the Middling spot price was 30.10. Spot cotton transactions in Shanghai were better. Shenxin First Factory purchased special Middling cotton at 117,500 yuan. The Sixth Factory purchased Brazilian cotton at 95,000 yuan. In addition, there were many inter-dealer transactions of cotton grades, with prices rising 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

### The Cloth Market Recovers Again

Since the collapse of the public bond black market, a portion of speculative funds has shifted to the yarn and cloth market. At the same time, actual demand from Sichuan, Hubei, Guangdong, and other places has gradually become active. Sales of serge and shirting were particularly strong. Due to the fact that the northern region has not shut down, the cloth market has recovered again.

### Supply and Demand Both Very Active; Rayon Continues to Rise

Yesterday, 120-count Dàqiáo rayon opened at 1,800,000 yuan. The highest was 1,845,000 yuan, and the lowest was over 1,780,000 yuan. It closed at 1,850,000 yuan. In the afternoon, someone tried to raise the price, but someone supplied as much as possible, so the price weakened slightly, closing at 1,820,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan higher than the previous weekend. 120-count miscellaneous brands all rose 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. 150-count white Fuji bright sold for 440,000 to 450,000 yuan. 75 Golden Rooster semi-lustrous sold for 660,000 to 670,000 yuan. Yesterday, Indian merchants traded factory silk. Evenly graded 75 silk sold for 2,300,000 yuan. Silk prices for users were slightly weaker. Traders bought and sold 30 to 40 bundles, with prices from 2,100,000 to 2,150,000 yuan. Another bundle sold for 2,050,000 to 2,100,000 yuan. There were no transactions for dry warp. The asking price was slightly smaller than the weekend by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. The price of American bed linen was 20,000 yuan lower than last weekend, and there were no transactions. Dàchéng checkered crépon was 4,900 yuan in the morning and 5,060 yuan in the afternoon, 150 yuan lower than last weekend.

### Rice Market: Customers and Goods Sharply Reduced

Rice Shops Still Allocate According to Market; Flour Still Not Available

The number of customer and goods registrations in the rice market yesterday decreased sharply, with only 764 bags. This included 295 bags of Yang Xian rice, 158 bags of Wu Xian rice, 10 bags of Bai Yuan rice, 270 bags of milled Xian rice, and 31 bags of brown rice. Rice shops still distribute rice to retail outlets according to the market, so the market situation remained unchanged, and the price of each type of goods remained the same. Flour was not available. Northern wheat shipments slowed down, and prices fell slightly. The oil market remained stable. Guangbang soybeans were inquired about, and high-quality goods saw a rise of 1,000 yuan, while mid-range goods rose by 300 to 500 yuan. Corn also rose by 1,000 yuan. Raw kernels and yellow sesame were similar. Broad beans digested slightly better, rising by 1,000 yuan. Bran sales were active in the countryside, and prices rose by 200 yuan.

### The First Batch of New Keehong Arrives; High Costs Make Sales Difficult

The first batch of this year's new Keehong black tea from Qimen, Anhui, has been shipped to Shanghai by Zhenhe Tea Shop. However, due to the high costs of picking, processing, and all other expenses, the cost is considerable, reaching several hundred thousand yuan per dan. Considering the current situation, it is feared that sales will not be able to continue smoothly. As for the foreign tea market, the high cost of Chinese tea has also greatly impacted exports. However, recently, tea merchants, in order to expand foreign sales, are willing to suffer losses despite the tight prices overseas. They are still rushing to produce, planning to declare for export as the shipping date approaches. Most holders of various domestic sales teas are unwilling to sell them off at a loss, and the trend of selling is decreasing. However, shops in this street and salt merchants from other regions are currently well-stocked and do not need to rush purchases, leading to a sluggish market.

### Bricks and Tiles Sell Well; Hollow Bricks Are in Short Supply

Recently, the arrival of bricks and tiles by ship has been infrequent, hindering sales, and prices have risen across the board. Blue roof tiles are selling the best, due to the construction of flat-roofed houses everywhere, and their selling price is higher than bricks. The hollow bricks produced by large and medium-sized brick and tile factories have limited sales in Shanghai, but many merchants from Nanjing and other regions are coming to Shanghai to purchase them, resulting in a shortage.

### Copper Shortage; American Factories Close; Electrical Industry Stagnates

[Reuters, New York, 24th] The current supply situation of copper in the United States is extremely serious. Many factories have been forced to close due to a lack of supply, with the electrical industry being particularly affected. Manufacturers are very confused by the recently implemented new price controls. Producers who are allowed to raise the price limit are limited to those who have reached a new wage agreement with labor unions after February 14, and the agreement must be approved by the government. To date, only Anaconda Copper and one small producer are eligible to raise the price limit. The remaining manufacturers can only sell at the old price limit of 12 cents per pound, while the new price limit is 14 and 3/8 cents per pound.

### Cost of Living in the U.S. Gradually Increases; Up One-Third Compared to Seven Years Ago

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] The Department of Labor recently released a report stating that the cost of living in the United States has increased by one-third since 1939 and is still rising. The prices of daily necessities have increased by 0.5% to 1% in the past 30 days. This is still much better compared to the doubling of prices in the United States after World War I.

### Company Permits Sales; Sugar Prices Tend to Stabilize

Yesterday, after industry representatives negotiated with the Taiwan Company regarding the sugar market, they received a satisfactory response, and it was agreed that all spot goods could be sold today. However, inventories are indeed limited, so spot prices will remain at the original level. At the same time, road goods can be traded, with prices around 95,000 yuan. As a result, the trend has stabilized. The association's opening price for medium white sugar in the morning was only 100,600 yuan, but later rose from 89,000 yuan to 110,000 yuan, before returning to 88,000 yuan in the afternoon. Numbered goods opened with 22 packages of Diaoqing at 95,000 yuan, Xiaokang at 91,000 yuan, and then 93,000 yuan. Several dozen baskets of Xinghua white were at 100,600 yuan, a decrease of nearly 10,000 yuan. It is heard that there are over 2,000 packages of Youqing road goods that will arrive within a few days. If so, then the future market should be slightly stable.

### White Coal Shows Some Activity

Previously, the white coal market was flooded with arrivals of white coal briquettes, and sales were brisk, causing market prices to fall frequently. Importers, on the other hand, adopted a wait-and-see attitude, fearing that market prices would fall again. Recently, due to excessive price declines, which were not enough to cover costs, arrivals have sharply decreased. Furthermore, most small merchants who urgently needed funds have been selling off their stock. Although current sales are still slow, some large merchants with strong financial resources are taking advantage of the low prices to buy in preparation for winter demand. Therefore, trading has been slightly more active than before. In addition, due to shortages, the price of white coal small pieces is quite firm. The market price of Yangquan small pieces has even exceeded that of Yangquan screened briquettes.

### Financial Reform; American Advisor Conducting Research

The newly appointed Supreme Financial Advisor to the Executive Yuan, Mr. Teyman, arrived in Shanghai from the United States a few days ago. He has set up an office at the Bank of China and has begun to study various financial problems. Mr. Teyman held an important position at the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States and has conducted extensive research on Far Eastern financial issues. In the future, the focus of his research will be on reforming various financial facilities for the authorities' reference.

### Panic Gradually Subsides; Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets Improve

With the situation of Chinese stocks stabilized and public panic somewhat subsided, buyers are active. Yongsha rose from 490 yuan to 530 yuan, Meiya rose from 2800 yuan to 3380 yuan, Jingfu had a low price of 190 yuan and a high price of 230 yuan. The situation of Xinguang was the most impressive, rising from 200 yuan to 253 yuan. Qinxing had a low price of 150 yuan and a high price of 193 yuan. After a high at noon, there was a slight pullback, gradually hovering. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsha rose slightly, Meiya recovered by a little less than 10%, Jingfu rose by 5%, and Xinguang and Qinxing each improved by 10%. Among the unpopular medium-sized stocks, Xinxing improved by a little less than 10%. Zhongfang and Huochai were flat. Small stocks each improved by around 10%. Foreign stocks gradually showed light. Large shareholders of industry stocks were absorbing some. All large stocks, except Jardine Matheson, and all small stocks, except Asia Paper, improved. The popular Ewo Silk rose from 9200 yuan to 9800 yuan, and British American Tobacco rose from 8000 yuan to 8400 yuan. The rest were also carried along. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Jardine Matheson and Asia Paper rose slightly, while British American Tobacco and Ewo Silk improved by about 5%. The rest rose by between 10% and 15%.

### Seafood Market Situation is Stable and Favorable

High-grade raw starch is in short supply, while low-grade and russet starch remain weak. Foreign vegetables and Xianglian are flat and dull. Hairtail, shrimp tails, and sea cicadas continue to sell well, showing an active trend. Dried mussels and pepper are affected by the Hong Kong exchange rate. After opening tight, the trend is quite stable and favorable. The supply of shiitake mushrooms and cellophane noodles is scarce, so they continue to rise. Dried scallops and zha cai are in a short supply as the former has extremely low inventories and the latter has a lack of goods from the production area, thus the price increases steadily. Most other items also increased more than decreased.

### After Guangdong Opens Foreign Exchange; Hong Kong Dollars Cannot Be Used for Settlement; Simplified Settlement Procedures Implemented

[Guangzhou, 22nd (Airmail)] The Joint Management Committee of Designated Foreign Exchange Settlement Banks has now stipulated that, from the 14th of this month, all designated banks must not pay in Hong Kong dollars for foreign exchange settlement. The acceptance of the difference in national currency should also be stopped immediately. In addition, the exchange rate for foreign exchange purchases has been changed from 390 yuan to 400 yuan, and the selling price remains unchanged at 410 yuan, effective from the 11th of this month. As for the prices after foreign exchange was listed in this city, the buying price is 2,020 yuan, and the selling price is 1,980 yuan. Simplified procedures have also been implemented. From now on, export merchants only need to fill out the certificate and have the owner sell the foreign exchange to the designated bank, which can then be submitted to customs for inspection and release. As for applying to purchase foreign exchange, the quantity of goods purchased must be filled out, and after verification, an exchange order will be issued.

### New Crop of Black Leaf Lychee Has Been Shipped

According to news from Guangdong, the first batch of new Black Leaf Lychee crop produced in Guangdong has been shipped and is on its way, expected to arrive in Shanghai within days. The total amount is said to be around one hundred and several tens of dan. As each item gradually sees new goods, prices are expected to gradually ease.

### Japanese Textile Trade; India to Take Its Place; Expansion Plan Actively Underway

[Reuters, Bombay, 24th] In accordance with the expansion policy recently proposed by the Post-War Planning Committee, the Indian government has specially announced the application for a license method, so that new textile mills can be built throughout India. The Indian government and the committee agree that the cotton cloth production of various textile mills can reach an increase of 50%. If this is achieved, the annual cotton cloth production in India can reach as much as 7.2 billion yards. However, textile machinery is in severe shortage, and the production target can only reach 35%, which is 1.7 billion yards, and 2,750,000 spindles must be added. The Manchester Guardian recently commented on India's plan, saying: If India no longer relies on imported cotton goods as a result, and can instead achieve an export balance of 10% of its total production, then India will be able to rise to the position of Japan in the international textile trade and compete with China for its future, which is very clear.

### Luodian Buttons Difficult to Export; Also Due to High Costs

Domestic Luodian buttons are favored by Europeans and Americans, so they occupied an important position in exports during the war. However, after the war, due to gradually rising wholesale prices, foreigners have switched to using substitutes. According to the person in charge of a British foreign firm, before the war, the wholesale price of Luodian buttons was only 80 cents per gross, but after the war, it has doubled. However, there are still few exporters, due to raw materials, wages, freight, and other factors affecting the high cost.

The raw material for making Luodian buttons is mussel shells, which is a natural specialty of our country. After this eight-year war of resistance, the amount of sea mussels that have bred over the years must be considerable. According to someone in the button industry, before the war, Japan monopolized more than half of the button market in Europe and America. After the war, Japan no longer exports buttons. If the authorities pay attention to this export and provide funds to assist the industry, so as to reduce costs and improve products, it is not difficult to win the entire European and American market.

### Sales of White Tung Oil Are Weak

Although there is a foreign sales outlet for white tung oil, the export is difficult to develop because the US market price does not match that of our country. It is heard that the current price of oil in the New York market is 39 US cents per pound, and the US government also uses this as the purchase price limit. If it exceeds this purchase price, it will be subject to a fine. Therefore, those who send telegrams to our country with prices higher than this receive no response. However, based on this calculation, the price of delivering goods to Shanghai is only 35 cents per pound, so those engaged in this industry feel that the export trade is like chicken ribs. Recently, although there have been sales, at only 71,200 yuan per dan, transactions are not very enthusiastic. In addition, the Hankou market is better by 23,000 yuan, making export profits even thinner. The largest number of local exports should come from vegetable oil plants, because national capital is used to operate international trade, which is something that ordinary businesses cannot hope to match. The domestic selling price of oil is between 68,900 yuan and 70,000 yuan. Sales are not strong, and the situation is stable.

### Shandong Salt Arrives Steadily

[Our Report] The Taikoo Company's Hubei steamer, traveling south from Tianjin via Qingdao, transported 5,000 bags of salt and over 1,300 pieces of flue-cured tobacco of varying sizes from Qingdao. It arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and is now docked at Taikoo Wharf No. 3 in Puxi to unload. In addition, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangping steamer, which was dispatched to Qingdao a few days ago, returned to Shanghai yesterday, bringing 300 tons of refined salt, which belongs to the Da Ye Salt Company.

### An Overview of the Economic Situation in Northern China

Living Expenses in Beijing and Tianjin Are Lower Than in Shanghai; Clothing Is Lacking Outside the Customs, but Food Is Sufficient

Li Junyao, Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, and Li Lixia, Director of the Financial Business Inspection Department, returned to Shanghai by plane from Tianjin. According to their reports, the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors of North China have been experiencing difficulties due to the incomplete restoration of transportation and the difficulties in the circulation of goods. However, through the efforts of the authorities, the circulation of transportation and finance is improving day by day. Although commodity prices in Beijing and Tianjin are not much different from Shanghai, general living expenses are still one-half cheaper than in Shanghai, especially in Beijing. Tianjin is a large commercial port in the north with a dense population and well-developed financial, industrial, and commercial sectors, but speculation is far less rampant than in Shanghai. An foreign exchange department has now been established in the Tianjin branch of the Central Bank. Importers and exporters in North China can settle nearby in Tianjin, and then the Central Bank will centralize the handling in Shanghai.

President Bei was recommended to provide assistance to the Tianjin export industry and Bei has directed the Central Bank and the specified banks in accordance with the previously promulgated rules to encourage exports, exporters could borrow with overseas letters of credit from each designated bank for a low-interest loan of five percent per week. The remaining aspects are being drafted, and after consultation with the Ministry of Finance and instructions from President Song, they can be formally released.

Mr. Li also went to Shenyang, Changchun, Shanhaiguan, and other places to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors of these areas, collecting a great deal of material. According to him, under the 50 years of Japanese management in the Northeast, finance, industry, mining, and agriculture have all made considerable progress. However, after the victory, the Soviet army occupied the Northeast, and most of the well-equipped industrial and mining machinery was dismantled and transported away by the Soviet army. After the subsequent destruction by the communist army, most of the factories and mines have only shells remaining. The houses along the railway lines have been burned to the ground, and the scene is very desolate.

What the Northeast currently lacks most is cotton woven clothing. Because the Japanese built very few textile facilities in the Northeast, cotton fabrics used to come from Japan. Now that the source of Japanese goods has been cut off, only a small number of domestic solo merchants are transporting goods for assistance. Fortunately, the Northeast is rich in agricultural products, and grain reserves are sufficient. Grain prices, rice, and flour have increased by seven times compared to before the war, while coarse grains have only increased by three times. As for industry and mining, although they have been dismantled by the Soviet army and destroyed by the communist army, judging from the Anshan Iron and Steel Factory, the remaining machinery, tools, and equipment, when concentrated and used, are still the most well-equipped iron and steel machinery factory in the country. The Central Government considers the legal currencies circulating in the Northeast to be the Northeast Circulating Certificates, Soviet military scrip, and Manchuria Bank notes. Anti-Japanese currency issued by the Chinese communists is also widely distributed among the people, so the currency system in the area is very complicated.

### Economic Briefs

[Tianjin News] The British firms Taikoo and Jardine Matheson previously had little business due to unsmooth sea transportation. The two firms established a joint office, but as overseas trade has gradually become active, they have dissolved the joint office and are operating independently.

Central Committee member Chen Guofu initiated the establishment of a large-scale broadcasting company, named the China Broadcasting Corporation, with capital of 40 billion. The Central Broadcasting Station will be merged into the company, which will be a joint government-business venture. Part of the company will raise commercial shares, and planning work is actively underway.

Foreign insurance companies have never been regulated by our government, which has greatly affected the people. After the victory, in order to stabilize the Shanghai financial market, the Ministry of Finance stipulated that foreign insurance companies must join the Insurance Association and complete membership procedures within three months. It is now learned that American companies have formally applied for membership, while British companies have not yet expressed their intentions.

### Keelung—Taiwan's First Port

Our Newspaper's 14th Airmail [Report] Special Correspondent Mu Yun

Unfold a map of China, and Taiwan is like a fish that floats on the blue sea, crouching in the southeast, swimming northwest, and the port of Keelung resembles a fish's mouth. The inner and outer breakwaters become the teeth of the earth, the train line and road network that run through the entire island are the fish's nervous system, and the islands of Pengjia Yu, Huaping Yu, and Mianhua Yu that float outside the port are the foam spat out by the fish's mouth. Looking at Keelung from a topographical point of view is enough to illustrate the importance of Chu, and its connection with Shanghai, Tokyo, Southeast Asia, Saigon, Hong Kong, Xiamen, and major commercial ports further illustrates that in addition to mutual dependence, Keelung has become a major breathing channel.

The Japanese saw the geographical superiority and spent forty long years to build her from a desolate land into an excellent harbor, and armed her into a modern naval port. These signs can be seen in the points and lines of Keelung City.

Port Capacity Reached Saturation Point Before the War

Keelung City, which occupies 4.4 square kilometers, is surrounded by low mountain peaks on the east, south, and west sides, and the vast sea on the north side. The land that can be used is only 1 square kilometer. On such a small piece of land, it constitutes the central area of ​​the commercial district, the political and legal district, the villa district, the fishery district, and the transportation district. On the sea in the north, two breakwaters built with cement below 40 meters clearly divide the harbor into inner and outer. The outer port has no wharf facilities, and eight out of ten parts of the inner port are completely artificial. Port C has three parts: the west port, where ships of 20,000 tons can dock freely, and ships of 5,000 tons can rely on 14 berths, and it is connected to the railway line. The cranes on the dock automatically unload goods from the hold into the warehouse, and passengers can walk down from the second floor. The east port has no artificial wharf, and ships of less than 1,000 tons can dock. The south port is a densely populated fishing port, and there is a canal for the safety and dispatch of fishing boats to facilitate water transportation.

Looking at the development figures before the war, 300,000 passengers and 4 million tons of cargo pass through each year. From the point of view of the port's digestion capacity, she has reached a saturation point.

Twenty-Five Major Bombings Show the Depth of Deprivation

The total population of Keelung City is 106,479. After 25 bombings by Allied aircraft, the population sharply decreased to 40,454, and 5,056 of the 8,000 houses were bombed. The area affected in the urban area was 1,712,500 square meters, accounting for 56% of the total area. General loss figures are: automobiles 66%, telephones 81%, telegrams 100%, electric wires 90%, hospitals 66%, water pipes 63%, fishing boats 53%, meat production 91%, seafood production 69%, and the total number of ships sunk and damaged was 484, about 80,000 tons. The trade volume, which is the city's lifeline, before the war (1941) was 65,397,881 yuan, and after the war (1945) it was 9,843,694 yuan, a sharp decrease of 55,854,187 yuan. Imports before the war were 27,409,074 yuan, and after the war were 8,731,214, a sharp decrease of 18,677,860 yuan. Before the war, there were 1,983 ships entering the port, with 8,357,601 tons, and after the war there were 2 ships with 12,769 tons. Before the war, there were 1,987 ships leaving the port, and after the war there were 2 ships.

These figures help the reporter understand Keelung and also make us understand the depth of deprivation that the war brought to Japan and the resource supply station of Taiwan, because the prosperity and decline of Keelung is a reflection of the whole of Taiwan.

Construction on the Ruins Completes Preliminary Work

The construction of Keelung City is like rebuilding on the ruins. At present, the municipal government is transplanting the plan carried out by the Reconstruction Company after the Tokyo earthquake to Keelung City. The Keelung Reconstruction Company uses NT$50 million as capital, of which 60% is funded by the provincial treasury and 40% by the municipal government. Calculated at the market price at the end of last year, the total reconstruction cost is NT$700 million. At present, the city government has completed the preliminary emergency work, such as street cleaning and sewer repairs. The entire restoration project can be completed by next summer.

The most important optimistic basis is that the fishery production accounts for 60% of the island's total production. As long as ice and fuel (sesame oil) can be supplied without worry, production can be doubled. The restoration of motorized sailing boats has been affected by exchange rates and prices every year, but this is only temporary. Once shipping is restored, Keelung will naturally develop.

Of the 5,056 houses, 1,200 have been repaired and 2,800 have been newly built, accounting for 75% of the total number of bombed houses. NT$1.7 million was raised from the Relief Association, and the project to repair 2,700 meters of sewers has already begun. The project requires NT$7 million and 90 sunny days. The contractor has repaired 16,000 square meters of roads, and two bridges have received assistance from the Port Authority. Repairs began in the middle of this month.

The Greater Keelung City Plan Makes the City's Position Increasingly Important

As the first mayor of Taiwan's first port, Shi Yanhan has recruited 13 Japanese experts to formulate a Greater Keelung City construction plan with the goal of 20 years and the foundation of 5 years. If this plan can be implemented, Keelung can be developed to more than double its size in 20 years, namely 600,000 passengers, 8 million tons of cargo, and 5,400 ships.

In this plan, the existing Keelung City will be completely transformed into a transportation and fishery district. The political culture and residential areas must be moved to Badu and Ruifang, suburbs nearby. The small train running every five minutes will serve as the regular transportation backbone.

Mayor Shi told reporters excitedly that this ideal construction plan will make the status of Keelung Port even more important. If ships from foreign seas want to reach Tainan, they must first pass Keelung and go around along the outer sea of ​​Taitung, which would take a whole day due to the distance.

Keelung hopes to be built up quickly and maintain the glory of the first port. It should also be like a fish. As long as the internal and external subjective and objective environments tend to improve, there should always be a day of rapid progress.

### Glimpses of Qiongya

Haikou, 5th Dispatch - Island Traveler

Shortly after the enemy's surrender, I, as a reporter, arrived in Qiongzhou and have resided there for several months. I have paid close attention to observing the various aspects of Qiongya's situation, and the actual information I have obtained is quite substantial. Now, I will depict the recent state of Qiongya from various perspectives, which I believe will be welcomed by those who care about Qiongya, especially those Qiongya people living abroad.

Qiongya has been ravaged by the enemy for seven long years, truly leaving it scarred and riddled with holes. It is just like a weak and ailing patient in urgent need of a miraculous cure. General Cai Jinjun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government's Qiongya Office, as the highest administrative officer of the region and as the physician of this patient, upon taking office in mid-February of this year, immediately outlined four major principles: People's Security, People's Convenience, People's Sustenance, and People's Renewal. He also identified two urgent tasks: Security is paramount, and relief is paramount. At the same time, he published a "Respectful Address to the Compatriots of Qiongya" of tens of thousands of words, eloquently discussing the matters that Qiongya should promote and reform in the future, and listing nine major goals, taking both fundamental and symptomatic approaches to governing Qiong.

In the restoration work, concerning political restoration, it is of course necessary to first create a new political atmosphere to win back the hearts of the people, and the completion of local autonomy and the strengthening of grassroots political organizations are particularly important plans. Since the establishment of the Provincial Chairman's Qiongya Office three months ago, it has intensified its efforts to promote this work of organizing and training the people. The most actively handled matters are the reorganization of the Baojia system and the implementation of the joint security and joint defense system. At the same time, it is making every effort to strengthen local self-defense forces, so that the people of the entire island, under organized and trained political facilities, can be mobilized from restoration to jointly undertake the great cause of self-rescue, village building, and national construction.

The county-level representative bodies of public opinion, the County Provisional Councils, have all been established long ago. The first round of vetting of candidates for public office has been completed and is still being processed. The village representative assemblies and Bao representative assemblies, these most grassroots organs of public opinion, are also being planned intensively and are scheduled to be held within a limited time. In particular, the election of provincial senators this time fully demonstrated the spirit of popular sovereignty, which cannot but be said to be a validation of the people's exercise of their civil rights.

### Severe Disaster, Overcome with Human Power

Currently, the most laborious work is still the relief effort. The disaster situation in Qiongya is indeed too severe. It is said that during the occupation period, Qiongya lost as many as 500,000 people. In addition, after the soldiers came the famine, with a poor harvest last autumn and a severe drought this summer, the food shortage has reached its peak. The government is now trying to use "human power" to overcome "natural disasters": on the one hand, it is appealing for large quantities of relief supplies to be transported here; the Executive Yuan has allocated 80 million yuan for relief and 35 million yuan for emergency agricultural loans, which have also been paid out. On the other hand, it is repatriating foreign refugees to their hometowns, and it is estimated that 15,000 refugees have been continuously evacuated and sent away. There are still more than 10,000 Taiwanese compatriots who need supplies, and efforts are being intensified to find ships to send them back to Taiwan. In addition, efforts such as promoting thrift, increasing the planting of miscellaneous grains, and prohibiting the export of grain and the prohibition of alcohol are all being carried out vigorously.

### Cultural Desert, No Less Than Food Shortage

In post-war Qiongya, the cultural desert is no less than the food shortage. Because during the enemy occupation, all cultural institutions were completely destroyed. As a result of our intensified educational restoration, to date, 90% of the public and private secondary schools on the island have been restored, 70% of the central elementary schools have been restored, and 50% of the Bao National Schools have been restored. The people's education centers, reading rooms, and so on in various counties have also been established one after another. Currently, there are two newspaper offices in Haikou, namely the Minguo Daily and the Heping Daily. There is one magazine, the "Heping Bi-Monthly", being published, and another, "Qiongya Construction," is in preparation. Recently, the "Qiongya Cultural Association" has been planned, and the Qiongya cultural movement is gradually showing signs of vigorous development.

Qiongya has been occupied for many years, education is backward, and there is a severe shortage of cadre talent. Now, in the restoration and construction, a large number of grassroots cadres are urgently needed. The prior condition for building a new Qiongya is still the problem of people. Director Cai, seeing this, specially planned to hold the "Qiongya Administrative Cadre Training Class." The first phase of the class is divided into five groups: Autonomy, Household Registration, Police Administration, Assistant Governance, and Cooperation. A total of 241 students started school on the 3rd of this month. According to Director Cai's plan, the training department of the class has twenty-six different sections and aims to create more than 6,400 cadre talents in a very short period of time to meet the current urgent needs.

### Transportation Lines Under Active Construction

According to investigations: In terms of transportation, since the establishment of the Qiongya District Office of the Highway Department of the Construction Department, it has intensified its efforts to rush to repair highways. The current length of the road lines that can be opened to traffic is about 700 kilometers and is still under rush repair. There are 12 management stations, including Haikou East, Haikou West, Wenchang, Jiaji South, Jiaji North, Wanning, Lingshui, Ding'an, Jinjiang, Lingao, and Nada. Currently, there are approximately 150 registered and licensed public and commercial vehicles operating. In terms of communications: The Chairman's Office is very active in the construction of telecommunications and telephones and plans to establish a radio station in each county. Now, in addition to the nine district stations, nine branch stations have been established in Qiongshan, Ding'an, Qiongbei County, Lingao, Wenchang, Yaxian, Qiongdong, Ganen, and Wanning. At the same time, for telephones, it is planned to erect an island-wide trunk line, with Haikou, Jiaji, Yulin, Beili, and Nada as the five central strongholds, and to connect with the branch lines of various counties in order to achieve smooth communication.

### Pioneers, For the Development of Qiongzhou

During the occupation period, the enemy operated many factories and had various industrial facilities. Since we took over, some have been destroyed by the enemy in advance, and some have been lost due to improper reception management. In addition, due to the problem of talent and the problem of economy, most of the factories and industrial facilities have not been able to continue operating, which is not only our shame, but also a great loss to the country. Regarding this issue of industrial restoration, I, as a reporter, once asked Director Cai, and he said: All factories and industrial facilities that can be operated by the people should be handed over to the people to operate, in order to supplement the government's insufficient strength. This opinion has been presented to the relevant parties, so that industry can be restored as soon as possible and further revitalized. Qiongya is rich in resources, and everything can be developed, especially those most related to the national economy and people's livelihood, such as farmland irrigation, fisheries, salt industry, and sugar industry, which have endless benefits. It is hoped that entrepreneurs will actively invest and operate. Regarding the development of Qiongya, the government has high expectations for the heroic pioneers of the overseas Chinese community. The people of Qiongya are rich in creativity, and many of them are engaged in industry and commerce abroad. They have both rich experience in operating industry and commerce and considerable capital, so it is hoped that these overseas Chinese will return to their hometowns to invest and work together to build a new Qiongya.

### Scene of Hefei City

Hefei Dispatch, this newspaper, June - Correspondent Fei Chaoran

With the sound of firecrackers, the Japanese devils ran away, the provincial government moved to Hefei, and the righteous people returned to their hometowns. The merchants and people in Feicheng, who were under the iron heel, dared to do business boldly, and the various businesses of the wealthy merchants of Lihuang City also followed suit. The commercial firms that had moved far to the rear have also returned with goods. Giant currents from all directions converge here. As a result, the ancient city, which was covered with weeds and wilderness, has been transformed into a bustling market with cars, horses, and people, and merchants gathering.

Merchants and Travelers Gather, Singing and Music Seethe

Because this place is the location of the heads of the provincial party, government, and military, various levels of institutions and downsized personnel from the sixty-two counties are constantly flowing here. Therefore, hotels, restaurants, and bathhouses are newly opened like bamboo shoots after rain, and they are constantly flowing and often full. Large-scale restaurants such as "Taibai Restaurant" and "China-America Restaurant" and bathhouses such as "China" and "New Life" have also emerged. Moreover, the Hefei Grand Theater, which moved here from Lihuang and was performed in by Li Wenzhong, is full of gongs and drums and singing and music, which can especially break the silence of the market in the past.

City Appearance to Be Reorganized, Bridges Floating

The provincial government, considering that the streets of Hefei are narrow and do not meet urban conditions, originally planned to open four wide roads in the city in a "well" shape. However, if it is implemented, the city houses must be greatly demolished, and the people who have been greatly injured after the disaster cannot bear the loss, so they are hesitant to start construction. They have only temporarily ordered the provincial government's long-term husband team to renovate the rugged stone road from the front street, Sipaifang to the Great Academy into a fish-ridge-back-style flat and spacious road, and rebuilt the original site of the steel-bone cement Sipaifang, which was bombed by the enemy, into an artistic wooden tower made of pine trees, standing upright like Dharma, solemn and majestic. Outside Nanxunmen, the Bao Xiaosugong Temple, which was compared to the Qinghe River in the Song Dynasty, was selfless, and had ten miles of lotus flowers and ten thousand willows, has been in disrepair for a long time and has been eroded by wind and rain. The provincial government and people from all walks of life have advocated reconstruction and have appointed Bao Zhengjie, a descendant of the temple, to take charge of it. They also plan to create Xiaosu Park, on the one hand to increase the city scenery, on the other hand to commemorate the former sages. The funds are tentatively set at 30 million yuan, and Chairman Li has independently donated 10 million yuan of his clean government funds to subsidize the grand event. The rest is being raised, and construction will begin soon. In the near future, Feicheng can restore its pre-war prosperity, or even surpass it. However, the shaking bridges are frightening. Except for the section from Hefei to Jiulonggang, which uses the foundation of the Huainan Road, which is still in good condition, the rest of the roads are bumpy like a baby's cradle, causing dizziness and often causing rollovers, which damages the safety of passengers, resulting in the rumor that "taking a car is like running an air raid alarm."

Lights Gradually Brighten, Market Quiet

The shortcoming is that in the evening, two months ago, the market mostly used vegetable oil lamps, and the light was like a bean. The night market was almost zero. In recent months, a large amount of kerosene has been transported to the city, and half of the commercial firms have switched to gasoline lamps, and the dark streets have become bright. Recently, Cai Shidun, an American electrical engineer sent by the United Relief Agency, has kindly come here and promised to be responsible for allocating engines and equipment from the United Relief Agency to help restore the city. People from all walks of life have expressed their appreciation after hearing about it. However, it must be said that although the Hefei market is gradually prospering, except for hotels, restaurants, and bathhouses, the other industries are not very good. Even the aristocratic Taibai Restaurant and China-America Restaurant have announced that they are going out of business. It can only be hoped that the five grains will be abundant in the second half of the year, and the business of the golden September and silver October will make up for the losses in the first half of the year.

Severe Housing Shortage, Rice Prices Rise

At the same time, the housing shortage is still serious. The huge city of Zhouban, forty miles around, has been destroyed by 10-20% in the urban area and 70-80% in the residential area, and the population has increased sharply, exceeding the supply. The landlords took the opportunity to hoard, reduced their own residences, and asked for high rents. Recently, the monthly rent for each room in the city has reached 20,000-30,000 yuan, and the monthly rent for each room has reached 3,000-4,000 yuan. Some even prepay the rent for one year. Public education personnel cannot afford it and are organizing a housing fund evaluation committee to demand a reduction. The police bureau has also drafted regulations on rent, which have been submitted to the provincial government and will be announced for implementation as soon as they are approved. The price of rice here was only 1,500 yuan per stone last autumn, but recently, due to the high price of rice along the river, merchants have come to purchase and transport it for profit, and it has risen sharply to 30,000-40,000 yuan, so that the people cannot live, and many cannot get a full meal all day long and eat unripe wheat in spring. The authorities should ban rice exports, and now is the time.

### How Can the Prevention of Plague Be Divided by Boundaries?

Dear Editor: Recently, the plague in Shanghai has been rampant, and everyone is in danger. After the new Director of the Health Bureau, Director Zhang, took office, he focused on epidemic prevention. At the same time, the Executive Headquarters expressed its intention to act in unison and convened an epidemic prevention meeting on the 16th of this month. Central and local officials in charge and hygiene leaders were invited to attend, concentrating their efforts and mobilizing the entire body to extinguish the plague in the city. The Executive Headquarters allocated more than 1,000 pounds of DDT and several trucks to the Health Bureau, and provided as much assistance as possible for epidemic prevention equipment, medicines, and funds. At the same time, the Health Bureau borrowed 30 trucks and jeeps from the Executive Headquarters to participate in epidemic prevention work. With such consistent efforts from above and below to prevent the epidemic, the five million citizens of Shanghai will certainly not need to be afraid of the plague, and everyone will be safe, right? However, according to people who know the inside story, before Director Zhang took office, the Executive Headquarters also convened an epidemic prevention meeting, but not only were the central officials in charge and the hygiene leaders not invited to participate, but even the local health officials were not notified to attend. At that time, the Health Bureau, in order to prevent the plague from spreading, repeatedly requested the Executive Headquarters to issue epidemic prevention equipment and medicines and to allocate trucks, but except for only 100 pounds of DDT, nothing was allocated, and trucks had to be purchased from the Executive Headquarters after paying a fee. Under the extreme lack of epidemic prevention funds and epidemic prevention equipment and medicines, the former staff members had to work hard and engage in epidemic prevention. Fortunately, thanks to God's blessing, there was no major chaos, and it passed due to personnel changes. In such a situation, we citizens are really confused. Is it true that the lives of our citizens can only be guaranteed if the local officials have a relationship with the authorities in charge? The plague is prevalent every year, and active prevention before the event is more important than passive eradication after the event. Why did the Executive Headquarters provide no assistance to the Health Bureau's requests before Director Zhang took office, and even the epidemic prevention meetings did not notify the local health administration personnel to attend? Is it because Director Zhang was transferred from the Executive Headquarters, and his performance is related to the Executive Headquarters, so they took such special action? It is important to know that a supervisory department should treat the things that local agencies should promote and reform based on the matter, not based on the person. The safety of people's lives is important, and this kind of administrative favoritism is evil. While the plague is rampant, in addition to hoping that you will work hard to make amends and engage in epidemic prevention, for the sake of the safety of citizens' lives in the future, please eliminate this evil habit of administrative protection of private individuals! Sincerely, reader Wu Yangzhen. Nineteenth day of the month.

### Translators Request to Take the Overseas Study Exam

Dear Editor: According to reports, the Youth Army Demobilization Administration, in order to encourage retired Youth Army members to further their studies, has selected a number of graduates from specialized schools or above to study abroad. It has obtained the consent of the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Education will draft the regulations and hold the exam together with the Ministry of Education's public-funded overseas study exam on July 21. This shows the government's utmost sincerity in rewarding the youth. We are reminded of a group of translators in the army. From the time the Flying Tigers came to China in the 31st year to the time when the Allied forces came in large numbers after the surrender of Japan, the Ministry of Education and the Foreign Affairs Bureau successively recruited more than 3,000 students from various universities in the rear to serve as translators in the army, risking their lives and enduring hardships. We dare not say that we have contributed to the war of resistance, but we have indeed fulfilled our national duty. The sacrifice of 17 translator friends such as Yang Daxiong of Jiaotong University, Miao Bin of Lianhe University, and Zheng Dengchi is a good example. At the beginning of the recruitment, the Ministry of Education and the Foreign Affairs Bureau stipulated that "10% of the translators who have performed well after demobilization will be sent to study abroad at public expense." When the translators were dismissed, the Foreign Affairs Bureau also emphasized that "the number of people studying abroad at public expense will be increased to 20% or 30%." At that time, there were also certificates for participating in the overseas study exam. After the victory, the translators returned from various battlefields and accepted dismissal from August 16 of last year to the beginning of this year. After that, it was once reported that the translator's overseas study exam would be held in mid-May. When the news of the Ministry of Education's overseas study exam was released, there was a saying that "the problem of overseas study for translators and youth army members will be handled together." Now that the problem of public-funded overseas study for the Youth Army has been solved, the problem of overseas study for translators has not been mentioned. Now we request the Foreign Affairs Bureau to work with the Ministry of Education to follow the promulgated laws and regulations, announce the selection of 20% or 30% of retired translators to participate in this public-funded overseas study exam, or announce the formulation of other measures. We will (1) appeal to society and ask all sectors to urge the Foreign Affairs Bureau and the Ministry of Education to pay attention; (2) ask the professors and principals of the universities that organized the recruitment of translators to inquire and urge the Foreign Affairs Bureau and the Ministry of Education; (3) contact retired translators and work hard to apply. Whether the matter can be realized is up to the government. We are only making a request and reporting to the government that there is still a small outstanding case in the process of restoration. Our assumed contact points are: (1) Dong Pengnian, Nanjing First People's Education Museum, (2) Zhang Yuying, Mechanical Engineering Department of Chongqing Shapingba Central University, Zhou Jie, Xiaowenquan Central Political School, (5) Shi Hongxi, Shanghai Public Utility Bureau, Yang Chuanling, Soochow University, Cao Fa, Zhengyan Newspaper, (4) Meng Fanying, Hubei Branch of the Hankou Executive Headquarters, (5) Luo Shigao, Beiping Social Bureau, (6) Chen Yongchang, Kunming National University. A group of retired translators: Yang Baoheng (Fudan), Shi Hongxi (Jiaotong University), Yang Chuanling (Soochow University), Zhang Yuying (Central University), Zhou Jie (Central Political School), Meng Fanying (Lianhe University), Lin Dunhua (Zhejiang University), Tang Tianxiong (Zhejiang University), Liu Shuhan (Chongqing University), Zhang Zhao (Fudan), Hu Qilin (Lianhe University), He Sizhang (Central University), Wan Benzhen (Fudan), Shi Jingzhi (Fudan), Zhu Fa (Fudan), Ge Linsheng (Fudan), Lin Jiwu (Fudan), Lu Weici (Central University), Dong Pengnian (Fudan), etc. June 18.

### A War Correspondent's View of the Bloodstains of Lincheng

— Zhong Yong

Lincheng Correspondence, June 5th

The 19th Headquarters and the 97th Army were besieged and attacked in Lincheng by over ten thousand of the Communist army's main force. From November 24th of the 34th year of the Republic [1945] until now, it has been almost half a year. During tense periods of the war, all parties were concerned about the safety and loss of Lincheng. The safety of Lincheng greatly affected the overall situation. Fortunately, the Lincheng garrison had been influenced by the Party's education and the wise leadership of Commander-in-Chief Chen. Therefore, no matter how difficult the environment was, they persevered. The people of Lincheng also cooperated wholeheartedly, and various parties offered comfort and encouragement, enabling the isolated city to stand firm for three months without any problems. Although the conflict has stopped and the dawn of peace is gradually appearing, the Lincheng garrison is still heavily surrounded by the Communist army, and the difficult situation remains. The Lincheng garrison is also working tirelessly and diligently to live their laborious and difficult lives. As a journalist working with the army, I witnessed the people's wails of despair, the soldiers' loyalty and bravery, and the Communist army's "extraordinary measures." I am filled with emotion and will briefly report what I saw to my readers.

The Situation in Lincheng

Lincheng is the gateway to southern Shandong, the barrier of northern Jiangsu, the fulcrum of the Linzao Railway Line, and an important town on the Jinpu Railway Line. A large amount of coal from Zaozhuang is transported through Lincheng, supplying the Jinpu and Longhai lines. At the same time, the Lincheng water tower is the only railway facility on the Jinpu Line. It took the enemy three long years to complete this great project during their occupation. Now that the water towers in Hanzhuang, Tengxian, and Yanzhou have been destroyed by the Communist army, only this water tower remains. If Lincheng is not defended and this remaining water tower is destroyed by the Communist army, even if there is peace in the future and the railway is allowed to be rebuilt, the destruction of this water tower will render transportation useless. Therefore, abandoning Lincheng not only cuts off north-south transportation, but also threatens Xuzhou in northern Jiangsu. At the same time, the Jinpu and Longhai lines will immediately experience a coal shortage, and the restoration of railway transportation will be hopeless. Today, Lincheng is important both militarily and in terms of people's livelihood.

Blood-Soaked Phoenix Mountain

Phoenix Mountain is located about two miles northeast of Lincheng. After our army entered Lincheng, it sent the Second Battalion of the 86th Regiment of the 29th Division to guard it. From a high position, it coordinated with our army's strongholds in Xinglongzhuang, Silishi, and Dongtuo. On the night of November 29th, Chen Yi led the Fourth Division of the Second Division of the New Fourth Army, with a force of about 20,000 people, to launch a sudden attack on Phoenix Mountain. Our army was forced to defend itself and retaliated. After a fierce battle all night, the Communist army suffered more than 400 casualties. The next day, the Communist army added about 10,000 more people from the Fifth and Ninth Brigades and attacked our hilltop positions with intensive artillery fire. However, the defenders of our positions were brave and composed, displaying a high degree of fighting spirit, wounding more than 12,200 of the Communist army, with corpses strewn across the mountains. The war continued until December 1st. Our army was exhausted after a long battle, the disparity in numbers was too great, and the fortifications on the hilltop were almost completely destroyed. Therefore, this loyal and brave group finally sacrificed heroically together with Phoenix Mountain.

Xinglongzhuang Set Ablaze

The war clouds of Phoenix Mountain had not yet dissipated when the flames of Xinglongzhuang began to burn. On December 2nd, after capturing Phoenix Mountain, the Communist army continued to pounce on Xinglongzhuang. The soldiers of the First and Second Battalions of the 68th Regiment, under the command of Regiment Commander Kang Qingru, were forced to resist. At that time, the sound of artillery fire was deafening. After two nights of continuous fighting, the Communist army suffered more than 2,000 casualties and had not crossed the defense line by one step. However, the third day was even more intense. The Communist army concentrated artillery fire on the fortifications of the village walls and used dense formations to cover their fierce assault, immediately engaging in close combat and bayonet fighting. At this time, the northern part of Xinglongzhuang had been occupied by the Communist army, and our army was only defending the southern part. The war had become chaotic, and houses were burning in the artillery fire, with flames soaring into the sky and smoke filling the air. The war continued until the fourth day, when our southern defenders began a counterattack, repeatedly charging and killing, with shouts of killing shaking the wilderness. They finally completely annihilated the Communist army occupying the northern part. As a result, Xinglongzhuang was safe after being in danger. In this battle, the Communist army sacrificed more than 7,000 people and more than 800 were captured, while we suffered more than 400 casualties.

Fierce Battle at Linshantou

Linshantou is located about two miles southeast of Lincheng. Xue Village is at the southwest foot of the hill. Both were garrisoned by the Third Battalion of the 85th Regiment of the 29th Division. Since occupying it, it had been attacked by the Communist army several times at night. Fortunately, our defenders were vigilant, and the enemy did not succeed. On December 9th, after the Communist army's attack on Xinglongzhuang failed and suffered a major setback, they mobilized the Second Division and the Ninth Brigade and launched a sudden attack on Linshantou. At the same time, they launched a feigned attack on Lincheng. The Communist army used the Second Division to attack Xue Village and the Ninth Brigade to attack Linshantou. Xue Village was first bombarded by the Communist army's artillery fire. Later, due to the disparity in numbers, they charged into the position at dawn and launched a street battle, fighting fiercely with bayonets all night. Part of our defending army heroically sacrificed, and part retreated to the Linshantou position. Linshantou insisted on not retreating under the fierce attack of the Ninth Brigade for a long time and wounded more than 1,400 of the Communist army. At this time, the Communist army reinforced with more than 3,000 people and tightly surrounded Linshantou. It lasted until the next night before being ordered to withdraw automatically. In this battle, the Communist army suffered more than 4,000 casualties.

Soldiers and War Horses

Because Lincheng has been besieged for too long, the troops have no food to eat and are often hungry. The refugees are the same. The people are refugees, and the troops are hungry troops with no food to eat. Everyone has compassion. Driven by compassion, they automatically saved five qian [approx. 1.85 grams] of food per person per day in extremely difficult circumstances to help the suffering compatriots. Although this amount is small, this rare compassion made the refugees grateful and tearful.

During the long period of fighting, food could not be transported, and the soldiers felt malnourished, and the mules and horses felt that there was not enough fodder. Therefore, our soldiers and war horses were often hungry. I saw officers and soldiers in the streets of Lincheng who had changed their appearance after being hungry for a long time. Their hair was deeper, their temples were longer, their eyeballs were sunken, and a state of hardship and malnutrition was fully expressed. But their spirit was still full of prosperity. I cannot analyze the form of mules and horses. To sum up in one sentence, all the horses have become skeletons, and many have died.

Rarely Fragrant Vegetable Roots

Confucius ran out of food in Chen and did not know the taste of meat for three months. Later generations sympathized with him. The garrison in Yicheng not only did not know the taste of meat for three months, but also did not know the taste of vegetables for three months. There are more people than vegetables, and the supply is not enough to meet the demand. Buying a little vegetable is many times more difficult than buying delicacies from mountains and seas. As long as you find a little vegetable, no matter how valuable it is, it is lucky to buy it. A few merchants have invisibly raised the price of vegetables. They said that it was because they took the greatest risk to smuggle them from the so-called "liberated areas." The people of Lincheng really have a feeling of rare vegetable root fragrance. Because there are no trees, the flying birds have lost their rightful branch to perch on.

The Chinese medicine pediatrician diagnoses her as weak. What is the disease and what medicine should she take? (2) I have been engaged in underground work, enduring hardship and hard work, which has led to physical weakness and lack of energy for treatment. This spring, dysentery relapsed, with blood in the stool. In the end, I had to inject (Emetine) to stop it. Every week, I have nocturnal emission without dreams. How should I seek treatment? What medicine is appropriate? (2) Is Vita-Spermin effective as recommended by a friend?

[Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers] (1) For your daughter's illness, you should first check her stool and urine to determine the treatment plan. (2) Nocturnal emission without dreams is caused by long-term illness and physical weakness. You should first treat malaria and dysentery, and then pay attention to recuperation. (3) Vita-Spermin is effective for neurasthenia. (2) Yang Qiuming asks: I am 25 years old, unmarried, and physically weak, so thin that I can't bear it. After walking for fifteen minutes, my face turns green and I am weak, and my spirit is lethargic. I went to the hospital for a physical examination and was not told what was wrong. The doctor examined my whole body and said that I was not sick. Recently, a doctor ordered me to take Vitamin B, but ten injections were ineffective. Now I have purchased Vita-Spermin and am injecting it. Please advise (1) Can I inject it? Are there any side effects? (2) If I do not have the diseases listed in the leaflet, is it okay to inject it?

### After the Worry

— Shao Fu

The world is surging. Gold bars and US dollars are prevalent. The current social atmosphere is heading towards a place with no religion, no faith, and a complete bankruptcy of spiritual life. It is really dangerous!

Even so, among the chaos and muddleheadedness, there are still good people. They are content with poverty, abide by their duties, and treat others with love and sincerity. They strictly abide by moral creeds, but they do not use this to flaunt themselves. Although the number of such people is small, they cannot help but command respect.

I know a doctor who hung the following couplet on the wall of his clinic: "Only seek everyone's health / Not counting one's own constant poverty" (meaning roughly the same)

He has indeed put what is said in this couplet into practice. He not only treats patients with care, but even a few dollars less is fine. Compared with the current quack doctors who extort money, it is like heaven and earth.

I also know a bureau chief who wrote on the first page of his pocket notebook:

1. Be responsible but do not take credit, 2. Respect other people's opinions, 3. Be willing to suffer losses.

He arrives early and leaves late, lives in a public dormitory, never does meaningless socializing, and never wastes a penny of public money. He is diligent and conscientious, and no one in his department does not respect and love him. He relies on a fixed salary every month to maintain his poor life for his family of four.

Writing here, I saw another piece of news in the evening paper:

[Shenyang, 24th] Since the enemy surrendered, the huge amount of materials left behind in various parts of the Northeast, in addition to being mostly transported away by the Soviet army or looted by the Communist army, there are also quite a few remaining among the people. However, they are all sold privately, claiming losses. Now, Shi Lingyun, the owner of the Yonghe Can Factory, has voluntarily donated the valuable air force equipment worth tens of millions of yuan stored there by the Japanese aircraft factory (Manfei) to the 13th Regional Command of the Air Force. This item can be sold as scrap iron and is worth millions of yuan.

These are probably the stars in the dark night: We are still full of hope despite our worries about the current social atmosphere.

### Butterfly and Moth Exhibition

— Wei

Recently in Chengdu, there was a "Butterfly and Moth Exhibition" with the aim of promoting natural science.

The exhibitor is Ling Xiao, a student of the Electrical Engineering Department of Wuhan University. The exhibition site is on the second floor of the YMCA on Chunxi Road. When you walk into the exhibition hall, you can see all kinds of butterfly and moth specimens, some of which you have never seen before. It is said that most of these exhibits were captured by Ling in Jiading, Emei, and Shaanxi in recent years. Among them are the petite and exquisite Tiger Butterfly, the brilliantly gorgeous Dung-Feeding Butterfly, the transparent and jade-like Floating Leaf Butterfly, and the Cabbage Butterfly, which produces seven generations a year. He divided the various butterflies and moths into more than 100 kinds of specimens. Each group is composed of four butterflies and moths, two male and two female, divided into front and back, and arranged in a very orderly manner in elegantly decorated mirror frames. The wings are complete and lifelike, making the viewers praise and compliment them. That kind of careful and patient spirit is really admirable.

Among the precious specimens, there are three: One often rests on willow leaves, the butterfly wings are originally brownish-yellow, but if you look at them from the side, they turn into a beautiful violet color. The second is the Dead Leaf Butterfly, whose wings are very similar to withered autumn leaves. They often rest on branches. Because of their shape like dead leaves, it is extremely difficult to find them. The third is a pair of butterflies in the act of mating: and were caught and even made, and have maintained their original state. Ling himself calls it his masterpiece, because the mating time of butterflies is short, and they open as soon as they touch. This is Ling's only harvest in the history of butterfly collecting.

In addition, the second exhibition room shows the method of collecting butterflies: including the specimens of Ling's butterfly collecting history, as well as the various processes of catching, breeding, collecting, and installation, and there is a "Distribution Table of Butterflies in China, Japan, and Korea" by Leech of England hanging on the wall. Among them, the most interesting exhibition is the living specimens of butterfly life history. From egg to adult, the various processes in between are placed in four places. It is clear at a glance. According to Ling, butterfly catching must be carried out in sunny weather, and you must wear gray-green clothes and hats, and the catching net must also be gray-green, so as not to startle them. The method of installation. You must first find a way to remove its internal organs, then dry them, flatten them, and then embed them in pre-made cardboard. A thin layer of preservative cotton is placed behind the cardboard, and finally it is placed in a mirror frame. All work must be carried out quickly, because if the time is too long, the butterfly wings will become brittle and difficult to handle.

The third room is the art department, which embeds butterfly wings into pictures with backgrounds. The pictures and meanings are very unique and novel, the carving is delicate, and the atmosphere is natural. One of them is titled "Towards the Phoenix," which was exhibited at Wuhan University in Jiading before. The meaning in the picture is the butterfly of "Phoenix," which was selected as the "Butterfly Queen" with 1,043 votes. Its wings are like peacock feathers, all emerald green and brilliant, which is very pleasing to the eye.

### Mouth

— Yi Gu

I remember a friend saying that the most beautiful thing about a woman is her two cherry lips. In other words, it is beautiful on the mouth; although that is not a profound truth, it is still very real. At least two words can describe it, or be included, that is, sweet (abstract) and hot (maybe real). Just these two words are enough to meet the conditions of beauty, let alone the bright red color, matched with a fair egg face, who would deny that it does not have great temptation.

But things in the world are often accompanied by advantages and disadvantages. On the other hand, a woman's mouth may be the most talkative, the most fond of talking, and mostly the most fond of criticizing others. And these comments contain jealousy, suspicion, and even contempt; so many unnecessary disputes and conflicts are invisibly planted, because women are the least able to keep secrets! These disputes may harm one's own life, one's family, and even the entire society and country, which is too terrible!

In fact; not only women's mouths are like this, but even men are no exception. Due to a strong sense of self-esteem, everyone always loves to praise themselves and defend their own shortcomings. If that person can step back to the other party and not argue, then that person either has something to ask of him, or is under the power of force. Otherwise, he is either mentally ill or an idiot. At least he is also a fool.

Saying Good About Yourself

Saying good about yourself is a common problem of ordinary people, so groups, societies, parties, and even countries formed by people will certainly be no exception. So the result of this self-reading, self-loving, and self-justifying is very dangerous.

As for those who make money by mouth and live by mouth, there are even more people. The most practical are radio broadcasters, microphone singers, and stage actors. Storytellers in the book market, and even clothing store clerks on Shilu Road, and in fact, teachers and businessmen are not living by mouth? If department stores or other counter clerks and teachers are not allowed to speak, then the situation is so bad that it is conceivable.

The great American humorist Dr. Lin Yutang once said, "In the United States, all presidents earn the White House seat by lying. Roosevelt is the best at lying: so he was re-elected for four terms." Then, if he had not suffered from cerebral congestion, he might have had hope for another election. This seems too ridiculous, but in the US elections, broadcast speeches are indeed very important to the election.

Although the mouth is not as broad in terms of eating as it is in terms of speaking, it is also worth studying. In today's severe famine, China is still a place where "the rich have a feast of wine, and the poor have half a mouthful of food." And in the places under the double robbery of drought and civil strife, it feels even more true that "the vermilion gate smells of wine and meat, and the road has frozen corpses." Look at Guangzhou, many people die of starvation, but the dance halls are full every day and business is booming.

"Calamity comes from the mouth, and disease enters from the mouth" is indeed a well-known saying, often those who ruin their lives and reputations do so because of their mouth, and among them, those who make mistakes by taking narcotics and drinking are the most. In fact, when God created man, he only created a mouth on his face, originally wanting people to say good words and eat food that is enough to feed their bodies, but mankind has caused various sins and accidents because of their mouth, which may be contrary to the creator's original intention?

### If America Were to Be Hit by an Atomic Bomb

— Translated by Li Chuan

There are many rumors about the power of the atomic bomb. We first heard various miraculous tales in the newspapers, and later we saw news that it was "not as powerful as rumored." A Major de Seversky went to Hiroshima and Nagasaki and wrote an article "Atomic Bomb Hysteria," published in the February issue of Reader's Digest in the United States. He may be the source of this "debunking" news, and he downplayed the power of the atomic bomb. However, his research and observations were superficial, and his conclusions were very definitive in his article. This caused a group of experts to vehemently object. They spent a considerable amount of time in Hiroshima and Nagasaki studying and calculating, and the results they obtained were absolutely different from Major Seversky's "debunking." Their response to the power of the atomic bomb is in the May issue of Reader's Digest in the United States. I have translated it for our readers' reference. Translator's Note

What would happen if we used an atomic bomb like the ones we dropped on Japan to bomb New York City? Especially on the Empire State Building (Note 1)?

I asked Major General Farrell, the deputy commander of Major General Groves, who was in charge of the atomic bomb design, and who was ordered to go to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to inspect the damage after the disaster.

"If the bomb were to land accurately," General Farrell said, "such an atomic bomb could raze the Empire State Building to the ground. Perhaps a few layers of remaining ruins and broken walls would remain on the ground, but that would be a terrible sight. Another possible scenario, which is what one would hope for, is that the atomic bomb lands just outside the building. This situation might completely collapse the upper part of the building." Even the largest ordinary bombs cannot compare with its explosive force.

Aerial Burst vs. Ground Burst

Many experts, scientists, medical professionals, and military experts measured the disaster in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Among them were one hundred and fourteen experts from the "United States Strategic Bombing Survey" (Note 2). They explored, measured, and took many photos over two months. The results of their painstaking research can accurately determine the potential impact of such an atomic bomb on other cities in the world. These experts unanimously and vehemently disputed Major Seversky's speculation, which claimed that if New York or Chicago were hit by such an atomic bomb, the disaster and loss of life would be the same as those caused by a ten-ton giant bomb.

They also believed that Seversky's article dangerously underestimated the terror of the atomic bomb and would lead people to a false sense of security at critical moments.

The bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were deliberately detonated at a very high altitude to maximize the area of the blast and the destructive shock wave. The center of the explosion could completely flatten brick buildings several stories high within a mile; one-story brick houses could be flattened within "one and a half miles." In Nagasaki, factory chimneys within four miles and under shifted, cracked, or collapsed. Some barracks four and a half miles away collapsed. Ten percent of the glass shattered at seven miles. Glass also shattered at twelve miles.

When we look at the towering buildings of American cities, it is easy to believe that they are much more difficult to destroy than the fragile Japanese cities. It is easy to forget that even the buildings in our cities contain more than nine-tenths of houses made of rough bricks, stones, or wood, which are not much stronger than the buildings destroyed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Three Square Miles of Scorched Earth

General Farrell has now returned to his former position as the chief engineer of the New York State Department of Public Works, and is a construction professional with a bright future. When I asked him to elaborate on the impact on New York, he replied, "If a single atomic bomb were to explode at the appropriate height above a typical American city, I believe the radius of that violent blast could reach one mile or more." This means that the houses in an area exceeding three square miles would be destroyed or ruined to the extent that no living creatures could remain there.

But can our great office buildings withstand that violent bombing? I sat with Dr. Morrison (a physicist who participated in the atomic bomb tests in New Mexico, Los Alamos) on a rattan chair by a street in downtown New York City and looked out. "American skyscrapers," he said, "look stronger than they actually are. They are walls built layer by layer with bricks or stones, with each layer of wall placed on a steel frame. If a Nagasaki-type atomic bomb were to fall nearby in the air, the walls of these buildings would fall like leaves from a tree, killing or injuring the people inside, and the broken bricks would clog the streets. If it falls near the ground, those bricks and stones will shoot open like cannonballs."

General Groves was questioned by the Special Committee on Atomic Energy convened by Senator McMahon about the impact of an atomic bomb on Washington. He replied, "If the bomb falls right in the center of the five-sided area, then this pentagon will be completely destroyed." General Groves must know this, because the construction of the pentagon area was under his supervision. "If an attack were to target potential enemy targets," he continued, "it would fall on the triangle area of the United States and those government agencies, and the area of destruction may be two miles in diameter." In other words, the resulting destruction and loss of life would be enough to cause the federal government to hang a sign saying, "Urgently needs repair, temporarily closed!"

Doomsday Exaggerations

Major Seversky, in his article, did not recognize that a revolution had taken place in military science and bluntly said that the impact of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was "exaggerated." He was shocked by the contradictory situation, namely what he saw and the "neurotic" informal propaganda, which made him think this way. There was no fact of matter "vaporizing" into "spots of light" in an "instant." The bombing was not anything "special" because concrete buildings still had "structural solidity; the disaster and death were entirely due to "fire, just fire"—because of the spread of fire, not the fire directly caused by the bomb's heat.

The experts' answer to that last complaint was, "Why? Fire doesn't have to be anything new, as long as it does its job. Before the bomb was dropped, accurate calculations were made based on the target and detailed studies of Japanese buildings. Major Seversky found such a disappointing conclusion, this has accurately achieved the ideal purpose. The bomb used in Hiroshima was detonated at a certain height to flatten the largest number of Japanese-style wooden houses, which were set on fire in this way. If the bomb had exploded closer to the ground, the strange phenomenon of evaporation might have occurred, more concrete buildings might have been flattened, and a small area might have been directly scorched by the bomb. But that would be a meaningless waste. We don't need to add 'spots of light' or other flattened effects to the Japanese landscape. We needed to end a war. We did it. With two bombs. If those couldn't move Seversky, then he is one of those people who will not complain until the end of the world."

The experts felt that Major Seversky was too negligent in his observation of the destructive power that made an empire surrender! They clearly pointed out that he must not have seen a long concrete building in a school, two hundred feet away from the zero point, with half of its upper two floors cracked in this bombing. There was also another building whose collapsing concrete walls indicated how much thrust the entire building had received with diagonal jagged cracks. He did not mention the twenty-one concrete buildings near the bombing site in Hiroshima, four of which were completely destroyed, and ten of which were structurally damaged. His observation points overlooked the fact that many Japanese buildings were more sturdy than similar buildings built in the United States, in order to resist earthquakes. He saw that flagpoles, weather vanes, and other fragile things had not been destroyed or burned in the bombing, but he had never seen twenty flagpoles bent, or the paint on an oil depot 6,500 feet from the zero point burned bright by the heat of the explosion, or the charred plants on a small hill 7,000 feet away.

The Power of 20,000 Tons of Explosives

Major Seversky's opinion that such a bomb falling on American cities "would only cause the same disaster as a ten-ton giant bomb" was the most strange to the experts. Such a bomb contains only five tons of TNT, while the power of an atomic bomb explosion is no less than 20,000 tons of TNT.

I had seen the photo of the clumsy-looking Hiroshima school building 2,400 feet away, the upper two floors of which had been destroyed, and asked General Farrell about the impact of a giant bomb on New York.

"A giant bomb," he said, "can be explained by its name, it can only bomb one Block (Note 3). That is four acres. Let's assume that a ten-ton bomb were to fall in the center of four Blocks, and all of them were low buildings, bombing or severely damaging sixteen acres, that is only one-fortieth of a square mile. If an atomic bomb explodes on the ground in the same situation—conservatively speaking—it is at least eighty times larger than the area bombed by a giant bomb; if it explodes at a considerable height, it must be at least one hundred and twenty times larger."

Dr. Morrison thought that the power of the atomic bomb was at least 100 times greater than that of a giant bomb, perhaps 300 times or 1,000 times. A civil engineer from the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USBSS) estimated that the power of the atomic bomb, even in fragile Hiroshima, was only 100 to 200 times greater. The Vice Chairman of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, Nitz, said that Major Seversky's remarks were "completely beyond the scope of reason."

In contrast, the 114 experts of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey spent thousands of man-hours in Hiroshima and Nagasaki researching and calculating. Major Seversky admitted that he had not done any calculations and only stayed in each city for two days, "naturally not enough time," as he told people in the Senate committee, to do "a detailed study."

Major Seversky's work forced us to resolve to "prove these facts without exaggeration." The experts' answer to Major Seversky was that his own errors had turned the facts upside down and that inaccurate reports about the atomic bomb were particularly dangerous. Because, according to his statement, if an atomic bomb of the Hiroshima type did not cause much more damage to American cities than a regular large bomb, we could avoid any unnecessary anxiety and seek that ostrich-like foolish happiness! At the same time, the worldwide control of this terrible weapon could be postponed!

"Living people already know how to make a bomb whose destructiveness is equivalent to one million ten-ton giant bombs. If such a bomb were to fall on Washington or other major cities, you can imagine the tragic destruction of those buildings and the annihilation of the city's population," said Dr. Edward U. Condon, consultant for bomb design and Chairman of the National Bureau of Standards.

(Note 1) The Empire State Building is more than 120 stories high and is the tallest skyscraper in New York City.

(Note 2) Original name U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, abbreviated U.S.S.B.S.

(Note 3) Giant bomb, original name Blockbuster. The area between four streets is called a Block. Buster means bomber, so Blockbuster explains its destructive power by the literal meaning of its name.

### Seal Engraving Talk

— Gao Tianxin

Epigraphers and Seal Engravers

The characters engraved on seals by epigraphers are based on metal and stone. Metal types include bells, , pans, and pots, hence the name "Metal Script." Stone types include stone drums, , , hence the name "Stone Script." Seal engravers only engrave the shape of the characters. Those who are inferior cannot even do the shape well, let alone the meaning of the ancient Chinese people's creation of characters. Moreover, later generations have another person for writing, unlike epigraphers, who handle writing and engraving all alone. In terms of having another person for specialized writing, it should be precise, and progress should be made over time. Why is it that starting from the age of , until the hair turns white, there is still no progress? Why? The reason for this is that seal engravers read less, do not know how to research; second, they do not specialize in writing seal script, writing all scripts, including regular, cursive, and clerical scripts. What can be engraved also includes all scripts, including regular, cursive, and clerical scripts. Since they do not read and have no academic ability, merely wielding the knife, how can there be excellent works?

### The Question of Remarriage

— Ba Ling

"Should a woman remarry after her husband dies?" In the current situation of Chinese society, it still seems to be a question worth discussing.

We know that in our country's society, a part, and even a large part, of feudal ideas are still deeply imprinted in the minds of the general public—especially in the minds of rural people. They still hold to the "male supremacy" ideology, believing that a man can of course remarry after his wife dies. Wealthy men even hold grand banquets with music to remarry a woman. Onlookers not only do not criticize it at all but also express envy. On the other hand, if a woman remarries after her husband dies, she not only does not receive the sympathy of relatives and neighbors, but also faces many cold remarks behind her back or to her face, ridiculing her. From the standpoint of gender equality, we believe that this is society's coldness and discrimination against women, and there is indeed a need to correct it.

I believe that "gender equality" is an immutable truth. Men can remarry, so why can't women? — Of course, those who voluntarily observe chastity for their husbands are not included in this example. Under certain circumstances, women's remarriage should not only not be criticized but even be encouraged. For example, after the end of World War I, women in the participating countries mostly remarried because their husbands had died on the battlefield. This was a common phenomenon. Therefore, women's remarriage is indeed something that should not be opposed, both in terms of humanity and national population.

In short, I do not advocate women's remarriage, but I absolutely sympathize with remarried women and will never despise or criticize them.

### American Mothers and Children

— Yang Yongzhang

Someone wrote to the editor of an American medical journal asking him to answer two rather interesting questions.

First, the person asked, if there are two women, A and B, with A being older and B being younger, and they are both mothers, then which of the two will have taller and heavier babies? Second, this neurotic American also asked, are newborn babies in America now taller than those in the past, because he is afraid that Americans will gradually shrink.

The answer to the first question is not easy because there is too little research and reporting in this area. According to Ban Jiu's findings, Waner believes that in addition to the various circumstances during and after childbirth, the mother's age is also somewhat related to the child's growth. In general, babies born to mothers who are too young or too old have some shortcomings in health, but young mothers are better. Because women of older age may already be mothers of several children, the family burden is certainly heavier. Having another child means more expenses, and babies born at an older age are certainly in far worse economic conditions than those born early (when young). Whether in terms of nutrition or health care, it is detrimental to the child's growth. In fact, a child's health is closely related to the family's economy, and the relationship with the mother's age is relatively limited.

As for whether American children are shorter now than before, this is easy to solve. According to medical surveys and statistics, the height of American babies is not decreasing but continuing to increase. At the same time, they are more confident that the weight of the next generation of children will continue to increase.

Thinking of the mothers and children in small countries, it is truly pitiful. No one will pay attention to this small (?) problem, and of course, there is no way to answer it. Chinese women who are mothers, I wonder what your thoughts are?

### Children's Mental Health

— Nian Ren

Ladies: Are you often troubled by your children's affairs? Or do you even lose your temper and scold or beat your children for some reason? Please stop doing that. Parents' every move is easily transmitted to their children. The saying "Tomorrow's children are today's selves" is not meant to be sensational. Of course, you definitely don't want to see your children behaving so unreasonably. Minor mistakes often lead to lifelong regrets. Now, I will write down some common abnormal behaviors of children on the left. Please observe whether your children have the same behaviors.

Timidity, stuttering, lying, truancy, shyness, stubbornness, mischief, aggressiveness, vanity, fantasy, eccentricity, fear of strangers, fear of darkness, temper tantrums, dependence on adults, or melancholy.

If they exhibit three or four of these, then your son (or daughter) is already a child with an unhealthy mind.

Although there is no need to worry excessively that these are incurable diseases, they should not be taken lightly, and you should not unintentionally allow them to grow and spread, leading to severe "hysteria" and personality disorders. These patients often become blind or paralyzed in certain parts of their body due to a little stimulation or tension. Are there any women in your neighborhood who like to cause trouble and argue? Does she often easily get angry with her husband? This is because she doesn't pay attention to mental health and gradually develops this annoying behavior from a young age. Small matters in the mind can have a significant impact on future career and social life. For example, if a child has a habit of shyness, they will be hesitant and conservative in the future, becoming a negative personality. Or, "stubbornness" can expand into cruelty and obstinacy, making them feared and hated by people.

And don't blame your children for being afraid of the dark. The result of severe scolding is the opposite of what you expect, it will only promote a cowardly nature in children and add another tricky problem. When children are two or three years old, when they are just learning to speak and entering kindergarten, their field of experience expands, so they often have situations that they can't cope with. At this time, it is easiest to cast some form of mental state. Especially children who are spoiled and overprotected by their parents, as soon as they enter a new environment, can develop abnormal behaviors of being at a loss, fearful and crying. But please don't just blame them for being useless, you must understand that the formation of behavior and personality is not a matter of one day or one night, and changing them is also not a matter of today or tomorrow. Intimidation and scolding have long been abandoned by educated people.

Therefore, we must never use emotional impulses to manage the psychological problems of children. Similarly, we must never cause them a kind of "emotional tension" abnormality when correcting their behavior. And we must analyze the child's behavior calmly and solve emotional difficulties. Here are three steps: (1) Observe and analyze abnormal behavior. (2) Make the child aware of his or her own shortcomings. (3) Suggest solutions and help them.

For example, to solve stuttering and fear of darkness, ridicule and anger are futile. Children who stutter are mostly under emotional disturbance and are very nervous, some even have convulsions. They cannot prevent persistent hesitation when speaking, or cannot control the repetition of words and syllables. If you laugh at him or imitate him, it will make him more uneasy emotionally. Therefore, he can often avoid stuttering in unfamiliar situations and try his best to control it. Therefore, first you must tell him the origin of stuttering, and then comfort him to speak slowly, and accurate speech can eliminate it, and at the same time, help him practice difficult words or phrases that are often mistaken, so that the emotional knot lurking in the depths can be slowly untied, and in this way, he can speak fluently.

The fear of darkness is relatively simple, it is mostly formed by alternating reactions. What does this mean! Children have had unpleasant and unsafe experiences in the dark, or in their parents' stories and conversations, they have learned that darkness is a symbol of fear and terror. It can also be eliminated by the method of alternating reactions. That is, in dark situations, give them pleasant and peaceful feelings, and gradually shift their existing prejudices.

Spring and Autumn

### Door

— Zhang Baihuai

In a dream, in the very center of the ideal map touched by my eyes, clear handwriting showed that there was such a magnificent golden house.

My conscious thoughts told me that this house contained a great deal of happiness, a great deal of warmth and joy, and, in addition, forever and ever, inexhaustibly, contained the pure and beautiful and loyal hearts of all good people.

So I felt extremely happy and laughed out loud. I thought this should be the most proud wealth of our world.

I wanted to walk over. I took a step and walked over.

However, the door was tightly locked.

I realized that this magnificent house might still have its own owner.

But I was determined to take out all the precious things inside, without any reservation, and then, I would fairly and impartially distribute them to those unfortunate, poor, unhappy, loveless, joyless, and pitiful children of our human race.

So I turned to thinking about a way to open the locked door.

I excitedly looked around. All around were people busy working, some for themselves—but more for everyone. They seemed not to know that there was such a golden house in the world, or, although they knew that there was such a golden house in the world, it was not something they could enjoy.

I thought: I might as well tell them!

"Friends!" I shouted, shouting with a fiery voice, "Do you know that there is a magnificent house in the world?"

They all looked up in astonishment, but none of them were willing to answer.

"That house contains the price and needs of all our efforts!" I shouted again, this time shouting with a voice of revelation.

But they just looked at each other silently, without the slightest sign of belief.

A slightly trembling voice floated over.

"That's right, that house, the house with the locked door..." It was a person saying to his companion, saying it very softly, so softly that only his companion and I could hear.

I immediately looked at him and smiled at him.

"But you, doesn't everyone have a good key?" I asked amiably.

"But it can't be done," the locked door, already... already rusted so that it can't be opened!" He said hesitantly, with a bit of self-abasement.

I was very disappointed and could not say anything more. I suddenly felt that these people were too cowardly and too kind, so they would always bear pain.

So I walked away. I thought I had to think of a way to open the locked door myself.

I certainly don't want to seize that shining, brilliant treasure. I want to take these shining treasures out and return them to these too kind and too timid and lovely people.

I jumped over a very wide ditch and walked into a very grand and bustling street. In every store on this street, the shop windows displayed keys of all kinds of strange styles.

I saw that the people here were competing for various colors of happiness, love, and joy as an appearance to show off their own wealth. They were bustling and jostling, and the air was filled with the strong fragrance of women's cosmetics.

I felt that this street was full of frivolity, insidiousness, greed, and extravagance. The people on this street, I noticed a little, and saw that they had long abandoned their pure and beautiful hearts.

I began to understand why those people who were busy working all day long retained their goodness, and I gradually realized why they had no happiness, no love, and could not see joy.

I thought: The people who are busy working have many, many pure and beautiful hearts, people's hearts, while the pedestrians on the street displaying all kinds of keys do not.

I thought: The pedestrians on the street displaying all kinds of keys have many, many happiness, people's happiness, but the people who are busy working have none at all.

Although I was thinking that among those various keys, there must be one that could open the door of that golden house, I did not go looking for it. I was afraid of being deceived by those who sold keys. They themselves are not necessarily able to open the locked door, otherwise they would definitely not lack that most important and indispensable thing. They flaunt their wealth, but they don't know how poor their souls are.

I still returned to the place where those lovely people were working. I was ashamed that I had not brought them a key. I just told them:

"Friends, in a house, a magnificent golden house, there are all the happy things we need.

"The lock on that door, although it cannot be opened, has already reached the point of being rusted and decayed. As long as, yes, as long as the thunder of truth sounds, it will be shattered on the threshold. At that time, be a little braver! Go in, those things belong to everyone, everyone in our new world should have them..."

I didn't finish speaking. Immediately, with a bang, followed by a muddy and dull sound that also spread out on the ground. Oh, a beam of colored light shot straight out from a magnificent house. Loud cheers vibrated my heart, which was so happy that tears streamed down. I turned over and saw that I was sitting on the bed, bathed in sunlight.

### A Dong

— Yun Xi

A Dong was a maid in the second landlord Yang's house in Qilitang. Her two rolling eyes and a pair of oily little braids were equally lovely, but the wife thought that she was too light-boned, which was the fatal flaw of the subordinates. She came from Shaoxing Prefecture. In a certain year of great famine, she was sold to this village, and twenty silver dollars severed her connection with her own parents. Because she came in winter, she was called A Dong.

According to the old custom in the countryside, once a maid who was sold outright grew up, if she was not taken as a concubine by the master or young master, the owner would find a husband for her, give her some clothes as a gift, and send her into the arms of a strange man, which was considered to fulfill a wish, while sighing, "She just learned some life skills and then ran away!" At this time, there were probably already young candidates in line.

After enduring more than ten years of whipping and scolding, A Dong finally grew up to be very plump and needed the warmth of the opposite sex. She understood that what was in front of her was a major event related to her lifelong happiness. She vaguely saw the future joy, vaguely shining. At first, she yearned for it enthusiastically, but finally hesitated.

Two strong young men expressed their diligence to her at the same time. One was called Shougen, and the other was called Fachang. The two men were called to the Yang's house to do a few hours of short-term work during the busy farming season, so they both had the opportunity to get close to A Dong. In this regard, Shougen seemed to have a more superior position. Her mother worked as a maid in the third house of the Yang family. He often borrowed the reason to visit his old mother and talked a few more words with A Dong. He spoke shyly and bravely, appearing very honest and innocent. Fachang, like Shougen, was also a tenant of the Yang family, but his character was more lively, curious, and bold. He had traveled to several foreign ports and had a broad knowledge. All his conversations and gestures were naturally superior to Shougen's, making it easier to attract a young woman who was fantasizing. A Dong's attitude gradually became clear between the two men who originally had equal hope, leaning towards the more humorous one.

The second master and second wife seemed to have an attitude of non-interference in this matter. The master thought that both Shougen and Fachang were not bad. Although Fachang was more pleasing, he did not necessarily want A Dong to marry Fachang. As for the wife, she simply didn't have time to think about such trivial matters. She was an optimist. When she was happy, she laughed and giggled, lay down on the bed and smoked a few pipes of opium, and slept comfortably. When she was unhappy, she scolded the servants and maids head-on, lay down on the bed and smoked a few pipes of opium, and still slept comfortably.

However, this was not a trivial matter for Shougen's mother, Aunt Chen. We have to understand that a widow who only left behind an only son after her husband's death often faced economic constraints, and at the same time, the desire to hold a grandson occupied the first position in her heart. Although in the countryside, it still required a considerable expense to marry a daughter-in-law through a formal marriage. Her wise eyes had long placed her expectations for the second half of her life on A Dong. However, according to the current development of the situation, wouldn't the good dream that she had worked so hard to weave be completely broken?

So she looked forward to the arrival of Aunt Hedong.

Aunt Hedong was an outstanding matchmaker, an indispensable figure in the village and town. She was diligent, good at talking, good at pretending to smile, and quick in her movements. Although she came from a humble background, she could enter and exit large households everywhere and win the welcome of both superiors and subordinates. She occasionally brought some gifts, such as two chicks or half a jar of pickles. When she returned home, the basket was usually heavier than when she went out. The setting sun painted her face red, and her heart was particularly light.

On this day, Aunt Hedong arrived. Aunt Chen received her with extra care, brewing tea three times in a row. Aunt Hedong was surprised, but she didn't want to ask first, so she pretended to be nonchalant and talked about the happy event of the Huang family in the town the day before: the bride was pretty, but there were more freckles on her face; the master and wife often quarreled, the wife wanted to have a big scene and liked to give more money to the subordinates, but the master always wanted to deduct some, saying that spending money was like shaving water slices, and saving a few would save a few, ... while exploring Aunt Chen's facial expressions, she marveled at the other party's patience. Fortunately, Aunt Chen finally opened her mouth timidly.

"Mom, I won't hide it from you, I have something on my mind that I want to ask you to do."

"You can say it, my old body can do its best, how can I not help you." Aunt Hedong immediately catered up.

"It's also about marriage, our Shougen has reached the age."

"Yes, it's time to get a wife. Fortunately, Shougen is an honest and stable person, otherwise, at this age, he would have been sniffing and drilling around like a dog. - Who are you interested in, I'll go and talk to them for you."

"Mom, you are a discerning person, you can see clearly, I don't need to say it."

"I really don't know."

A Dong in the second master's room, and also

"Oh-" Mom finally couldn't help but giggle; this... then you should... you should set up a voice with the second master and wife, wouldn't that be done"

"How can I say it myself, besides-" she paused, and then told her difficulties one by one. Aunt Hedong was an extremely good person, so of course she agreed readily.

"This matter depends entirely on you!"

"Don't be so polite, what is it to help each other as family members, I'll definitely mention it when I go to the second master's house later."

The two sat side by side on the low stool behind the stove, the firewood illuminating their wrinkled faces with smiles, and their hearts were as warm as fire.

Aunt Hedong came to the second house, and the wife was enjoying the opium. Mom sat down on the bed with her butt, repeated talking about the Huang family's happy event in the town, and roundaboutly led to the main topic, and then gave full play to it.

"To be honest, I don't care," the wife yawned lazily, "I'll ask the master back, as long as he agrees, I have no objection." Saying that, she loaded a pipe of opium.

"But I want the wife to look at my old woman's face and say a good word in front of the master."

"Okay, my wife is good at helping, she won't not help, ... but, to be honest with you, marrying a maid, small scattered items, there are a few anyway, and there are a few clothes, but it's not as good as the young lady, it can't be like a proper one." The wife's tone suddenly became serious.

"Hey, what are you talking about, wife, she is asking for a person, not goods, as long as the master and wife agree, even if she comes over with just a stick, Aunt Chen will be satisfied."

"Okay, you sit for a while, when the master comes back, you talk to him."

"Yes, but I still have to ask the wife to help!" Aunt Hedong giggled again.

The master was hesitant at first, and then raised small objections, but he couldn't stand Aunt Hedong's river-like argumentation, a series of requests that had to be agreed to, and his heart softened. The wife also lived up to her trust, and from time to time, one or two jiaoyu flew out from the smoke, for example:

"Shougen's house is just across the river, and it will be convenient to exchange things in the future."

"I said that Fachang is very active, maybe he'll abduct his wife, and run to a foreign country with a pipe of opium, and even forget the owner."

"Although Aunt Chen is a maid in the third brother's house, we often send her to do errands, and we should give her this benefit."

The master chuckled twice and said:

"Okay, it's up to you, I didn't say that A Dong must belong to Fachang."

At that moment, Aunt Hedong excitedly turned her little feet and summoned A Dong to come in, and the master and wife seriously announced her husband's name. Then she habitually asked, "How do you feel?"

A Dong was stunned and didn't say a word, as if struck by lightning. Finally, she rubbed her eyes and slowly walked out, but hid in her own bedroom and sobbed.

The master was worried: a woman, she has to marry a husband sooner or later, what is she crying about? He cleared his throat and scolded, "Rotten skin, dare to cry! If you cry again, I'll send you to the underworld!" The wife was calm, grabbed the master's agitated shoulder and quietly persuaded, "Why get so angry, girls are narrow-minded and can't see through, she'll be fine after a cry."

Aunt Hedong was soft-hearted after all and felt sorry. She personally visited A Dong's small room and used the spirit of government officials to enlighten a revolutionary traitor to persuade this weeping woman.

"Oh! Don't you think, the master and wife are also doing it for your own good! Fachang is lively, but it's hard to say if he's really reliable. He runs outside a lot, has seen a lot of the world, and is active, it's hard to guarantee that there won't be any trouble! ... As the old saying goes, smart people make mistakes, but Shougen is the kind of person who is honest and reliable for life... Marry a chicken, follow a chicken, marry a dog, follow a dog, you have to plan for the long term! ..."

A Dong wiped her tears with the back of her hand, gradually raised her chin, glanced at Aunt Hedong blankly, then shifted her gaze and stared blankly at the ten or so running chicks in the courtyard, without saying a word.

"Besides, Aunt Lian is the most amiable person, and she only has one son, there's nothing to fight for in the family, if there's anything, the three of them can talk it over... There are houses and fields, enough to eat and keep warm, what else do you want?"

Strangely, A Dong suddenly sobbed again.

"Oh dear, why are you crying again, what else can't you let go of? ... You have to be obedient, don't be so stubborn, you know the master's temper, if you obey him smoothly, he will treat you well, if you make trouble, he will insist on you doing what he says, and in the end you still have to obey him, why not listen to him early and make everyone happy. ..."

Although she didn't get to the point of being exhausted, Aunt Hedong certainly spent a lot of effort. Fortunately, where there is a will, there is a way, A Dong really changed her mind, and under Aunt Hedong's urging, she nodded slightly, expressing her submission.

Aunt Hedong was overjoyed and immediately took the good news to Aunt Chen. The two then asked the third master to check the calendar and choose a good day, and sent a gift to the second house as an engagement.

Aunt Chen was eager to have a grandson, and the auspicious wedding day was set for this winter. Although the second wife thought it was too tight, she sighed and agreed. Shougen and A Dong were shy and tried their best to avoid meeting each other. Aunt Chen's face also seemed to turn tender, and she felt embarrassed in front of A Dong.

As for Fachang, he suddenly became extremely silent, his mouth seemed to be locked. After that, it was difficult to come to Yang's house. I don't know how, he was suddenly taken away by dysentery.

Aunt Hedong praised her good eyesight to everyone she met. She said:

"I had already determined that Fachang's philtrum was born short, and he wouldn't live long. I advised A Dong not to marry him, he's so young, being a widow, what's the joy? ... Fortunately, A Dong was obedient after all and was willing to listen to me, wasn't she? Now it's verified."

Everyone thought it was right, and the pain in A Dong's heart also subsided. She had nothing to repay, so she worshiped Aunt Hedong as her adoptive mother.

A light feather flies in from beyond the window,

It comes from a distant homeland.

The southern wind blows through the silk trees before my eyes,

Floating up a dream, a song.

This place has no jasmine's fragrance,

Nor the sweetness of lychees,

The beautiful reed flute's sound is now cut off.

I dare not gaze at the cloudy clear sky,

Bearing a string of green homesickness's melancholy.

Sparrows fly towards the vast edge of the sky,

Letting the evening bell carry away the traveler's manifold worries.

The night's gloom gives me anxiety,

In the darkness, I await tomorrow's struggle!

### Double Flying, Double Dwelling (64)

— Zhao Qingge

Twelve

Mrs. Mo, like an ant on a hot pan, was anxious to make her dream a reality, so under the encouragement of many people, and through Shi Yulou's introduction, she finally decided to let Lihua take the stage for three days starting from New Year's Day! Zhang Xian and the theater manager agreed that these three days would be on a "bubble" (ticket meaning) basis, without any remuneration. If it was successful, she would officially go into the business after three days, and then discuss remuneration. At the same time, Liyun would also take the stage for a trial performance. Zhang Xian arranged the repertoire for the three days for them. Lihua's first day was "The Dragon Travels and Plays with the Phoenix"; the second day was "Female Escort"; and the third day was "Teaching the Son." Liyun's first day was "Catching and Releasing Cao"; the second day was "Yellow Crane Tower"; and the third day was a duet with Lihua in "Teaching the Son." Lihua's play was scheduled as the third act in the front, and Liyun's was the second.

Once the principles were decided, Zhang Xian hurried to teach them to review these plays they had learned, and also held a rehearsal. Needless to say, Lihua always performed better than Liyun in the rehearsal. Whether it was singing or acting, Lihua would understand it with just one listen and one look; Liyun, however, had to listen many times and look many times, and then learn many times before she could understand. Even then, she was not proficient. Therefore, Zhang Xian often scolded Liyun: it's bad enough that you don't have talent, but you don't even try. But Lihua also didn't try hard. Lihua's success depended entirely on her talent and intelligence. Apart from satisfying her thirst for knowledge by privately reading the scripts like books, she rarely practiced the technical aspects of acting on her own initiative. Strangely enough, even though she didn't practice, she didn't forget anything. This amazed Zhang Xian! He wanted to make things difficult for her, but he couldn't bring himself to; he was secretly pleased, but he didn't dare to provoke her easily.

Lihua had already learned more than ten complete plays, and had also learned some supporting roles' parts. She now treated learning opera as an obligation she had to fulfill to Mrs. Mo and Zhang Xian. She fulfilled her required courses with tears in her eyes every day. She no longer defied Mrs. Mo and Zhang Xian in everything they wanted her to do; she knew that defiance was useless. So during rehearsals, she mechanically allowed everyone to arrange her, without uttering a word. Usually, apart from when she had to speak when learning opera, she didn't talk much. She ignored Zhang Xian, didn't talk much to Mrs. Mo, and even rarely played with Liyun. She became more taciturn and introverted, sitting quietly in the room all day long like a grown-up girl, either reading books or doing needlework. The innocence of her childhood had left her far, far behind!

Liyun, however, was still so cheerful. If she didn't learn the opera well and was beaten and bullied, she would cry for a while, but then forget about it. Especially these days, she was very happy because Second Mrs. Weng was coaxing her, telling her to study opera diligently so that she could make her beautiful clothes and buy foreign dolls for the New Year. On the day of the rehearsal, she felt a very strong interest! She wore a gauze hat, a blue robe, and a pair of high-soled boots, and she even had a long beard hanging from her chest. She was simply overjoyed! She had transformed from someone not yet ten years old into an old man. This was the first time she had played like this, and she hoped to be able to play like this often in the future. Because she regarded singing opera as play, she neglected the artistic aspects of learning. But she had one advantage, which was that she was not stage-frightened or shy. When others watched her during rehearsals, she didn't care at all, as if she didn't know there was anyone else there. She was so bold and shameless, and when the gongs and drums sounded, she sang even more enthusiastically than usual. Even if you said she wasn't good.
