### Completion of Constitutional Draft Legislative Procedures, Submitted to the Government for Submission to the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan Passes Constitutional Draft Amendment

[Our Nanjing 22nd Dispatch] The Republic of China Constitution Draft Amendment, which has been the focus of national attention, was passed unanimously without objection in the Fourth Temporary Session of the Fourth Legislative Yuan at 2:30 p.m. on the 22nd, after being reviewed and passed by the joint review meeting of the five committees of the Legislative Yuan in the morning, following the resolutions of the Central Standing Committee. The constitutional drafting legislative process, which involved numerous meetings and debates over several days, was thus officially completed. The case can be sent to the National Government on the 23rd and then to the National Assembly as a reference for constitutional drafting. More than 50 legislators attended today's plenary session of the Legislative Yuan, chaired by Sun Ke. After Wu Shangying reported on the minutes of the previous meeting and other documents, the discussion of the constitutional draft began. First, Lin Bin reported in detail on the review process of the Republic of China Constitution Draft Amendment by the joint meeting of the five committees, including the circumstances of the three review meetings on the 13th, 16th, and today, and the supplementary procedures of the Central Standing Committee. The case has been decided by the joint review meeting this morning to follow the resolutions of the Central Standing Committee, and it is submitted to the General Assembly for public decision. After the report, Wu Yunpeng immediately stood up and spoke, hoping that the due status of all ethnic groups should be clearly stipulated in the constitution to ensure its protection and conform to the true meaning of equality among all ethnic groups. Wu believed that if the Legislative Yuan passed the constitutional draft without changing a single word, it would be best to attach this opinion to the National Assembly. Di Ying also Wang requested that the petition submitted by the Mongolian representatives to the Legislative Yuan last time be drafted by the Legislative Yuan into a written opinion and forwarded to the National Assembly. At this point, the legislators believed that since the case had been passed by the review committee without changing a single word, it was not necessary to discuss the content in detail in this meeting. Chen Zifeng suggested that the entire constitutional draft be submitted to the National Assembly for further content revisions. Chen Guyuan also believed that there was no need to talk more about the content. Then, Sun Ke, in his low tone, summarized the review process. Legislator Gu also listened attentively, and the atmosphere at the meeting became more solemn. Sun first pointed out that the constitutional draft promulgated by the National Government on May 5, 1936, was originally named the Republic of China Constitution Draft. Newspapers simplified it as the "May Fifth Constitution Draft" for convenience, but this was not the legal name. It seems appropriate to maintain the legal name and should not add words such as "May Fifth Constitution Draft Amendment" in parentheses. Regarding the Mongolian banner issue raised by Committee Member Wu Yunpeng, Sun said that under Article 5 of the constitutional draft, "All ethnic groups in the Republic of China are equal," the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference was originally followed to add "Minority ethnic groups living in a certain area shall have their autonomy protected." Later, the President believed that the treatment of large and small ethnic groups should be equal and should not be specifically pointed out, so this clause was deleted. Articles 26 and 27 of the constitutional draft's National Assembly chapter, "The National Assembly shall be organized by the following representatives," were originally: (1) Legislators directly elected by various provinces and ethnic autonomous regions, (2) Supervisory committee members elected by various provincial councils and ethnic autonomous region assemblies. After research, the term "ethnic autonomous region" was considered too broad. Strictly speaking, the mainland is also an "ethnic autonomous region." At the same time, there is an interpretation of the term that refers to Mongolia and Tibet. Why not directly change it to the Mongolian leagues and Tibet? Hence, the current regulations exist. Sun continued, when the Central Standing Committee discussed the case at its 46th meeting, new opinions were also raised, and some advocated amendments. In the end, it was decided that because the case would still be submitted to the National Assembly, no amendments would be made to the articles at that time, and it was passed in principle and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. The intention of the Central Standing Committee was also that it was not necessary to amend the articles in a day and a half. They hoped that the entire case would be passed without amendments to complete the legal procedures and then submitted to the National Government for submission to the National Assembly for discussion. If the committee members had any opinions on the content of the constitution, if they were also representatives of the National Assembly, they hoped to raise them at the National Assembly. If they were not representatives of the National Assembly, they could entrust representatives of the National Assembly to submit written opinions. There seemed to be ample time in the National Assembly for discussion. After speaking, he submitted the resolution made by the joint review meeting on the 22nd for voting. All the legislators shouted in unison: "No objection," "No objection." This most important bill in the history of the Legislative Yuan, which is also the most important "Republic of China Constitution Draft Amendment" in the history of Chinese constitutional drafting, was passed in a chorus of "no objection."

### Review of the Constitutional Draft Passes Through Joint Committee

[Our Nanjing 22nd Dispatch] The Republic of China Constitution Draft Amendment has been passed by the joint review committee of the five committees of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 22nd, following the resolutions of the Central Standing Committee, and submitted to the plenary session of the Legislative Yuan for public decision. After the plenary session of the Legislative Yuan passes it at 4:00 p.m. on the 22nd, the legislative process will be completed. The joint review committee began at 9:30 a.m. with more than 50 legislators present, chaired by Lin Bin. He first explained the proceedings of the constitutional draft review meetings on the 18th and 19th and pointed out that representatives of the government had expressed opinions on the organization and powers of the National Assembly, the relationship between the legislature and the executive, the issue of the power of consent, and the local system during the meetings. Next, he explained the differences between the final amendments made to the constitutional draft by the constitutional draft review committee and the revised draft compiled by Wang Chonghui and others based on the principles of the Political Consultative Conference. The most important of these was the addition of Article 45, "The President may convene a meeting of the heads of the relevant Yuan to resolve disputes between Yuan, except as otherwise provided in this Constitution." This article was originally stipulated in the May Fifth Constitution Draft, and it is now restored to increase the connection between the Yuan. Another Article 57 was added, "The heads of the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan and the political committee members not in charge of ministries and commissions shall be appointed by the Government upon the nomination of the President of the Executive Yuan." In addition, a more important change was made in Chapter 111 of the chapter on the powers of the central and local governments, which was changed to "The following matters shall be legislated and implemented by the central government or delegated to the provinces and counties for implementation." In the revised draft, the word "county" was added under the word "province," and the first clause, "General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy," was added to make up for the drawbacks of excessive provincial power. Finally, he reported on the proceedings of the 46th meeting of the Central Standing Committee to discuss the case and the President's hope for the Legislative Yuan's review of the case. After the report, he invited the committee members to express their opinions. Di Ying was the first to stand up, reporting on the proceedings of the last reception of the Mongolian petition representatives and explaining in detail the Mongolian representatives' hopes for the constitution. Then, the committee members expressed their opinions on the amendment. Liu Butong and others were the most激烈, advocating not to discuss it. Chen Guyuan and others advocated "passing it in principle" without changing a single word in the content. Li Yuanbai believed that the amendment needed to be studied and should be amended, and advocated that all legislators participate in the National Assembly to discuss it. Chen Changheng advocated adding words such as "time is too short to review the content" to the resolution. Some legislators believed that there was a problem with the four words "passed in principle" because if so, the Legislative Yuan would bear the responsibility. The centrists put forward a new theory, that is, "passed in principle," but the wording should be carefully considered. Some legislators also offered opinions on the name of the constitution, advocating adding words such as "May Fifth Constitution Draft Amendment Draft" under the new name to indicate that the constitution was based on the May Fifth Constitution Draft. Li Qinglin, Situ De, and Tan Tiwu then put forward amendments on the content of the constitution. Li explained that all ethnic groups should achieve true equality, and suggested that in addition to ensuring that farmers have their land in the chapter on basic national policies, the right of herders to use land should also be guaranteed in the constitution. Situ De believed that the constitution ignored the land issue, and the chapter on basic national policies involving the economic system should be revised. Female legislator Tan Tiwu believed that the constitution should have concrete provisions on the equality of all ethnic groups and men and women. More than 30 people spoke, and the meeting was very lively. Sun Jiulu, Chen Guyuan, and others also submitted joint proposals. Finally, Lin Bin summarized the opinions of all parties and submitted them for voting, and the following resolution was passed by a majority of 34 votes: "The Republic of China Constitution Draft Amendment is proposed to be passed in accordance with the resolutions of the Central Standing Committee and submitted to the General Assembly (i.e., the plenary session of the Legislative Yuan) for public decision." The meeting adjourned at about 11:30 a.m. (According to the Legislative Yuan, the first review meeting was held on the 11th, and President Sun briefly reported on the revision process of the constitution. A joint meeting of the five committees was held on the 14th to listen to Wang Chonghui and Wu Jingxiong's report on the collation process. Due to the legislative procedure issue, no discussion was held at that time. A temporary forum was held on the 15th, and another review meeting was held on the 16th, which decided to discuss it again after the Central Standing Committee completed the supplementary procedures. The review meeting was passed today, and it has lasted for more than a decade, and the meeting has been held as many as five times).

### Li Huang Suffers from Brain Disease and is Recovering in Shanghai

[Central News Agency, This City] Since Mr. Li Huang, a member of the Central Standing Committee of the Youth Party, declined to see guests on the doctor's advice, there have been various rumors, and some have even mistakenly reported that he is missing. The reporter visited Dr. Wu Tianmin, who diagnosed Li's illness, at Taishan Apartment on Linsen Road yesterday to inquire about Li's condition. Wu did not want to admit it at first, and then smiled and said to the reporter: "Youchun (Li Huang's courtesy name) is my old friend of more than 20 years. He is currently suffering from brain disease and needs absolute rest. He really doesn't want outsiders to disturb his mood at this time." The reporter insisted on asking him to allow him to see Li once. Wu said: "I am sorry that I cannot do it from the standpoint of a doctor, but I can guarantee that Youchun has not disappeared and can recover his health in a short period of time. When he can see guests, I will notify your agency first."

[Our Nanjing 22nd Dispatch] The Fourth Preparatory Meeting of the National Assembly was held at 3:20 p.m. on the 22nd. Chairman Jiang arrived in military uniform two minutes before the meeting. Sun Ke was still the chairman. First, Hong Lanyou reported that 1,557 representatives had reported to date, and 1,502 attended today's meeting, exceeding the legal number. He announced the opening of the meeting. After the ceremony, he reported on the results of the election of the presidium. Hong read out the names and votes of the elected persons one by one. When all the representatives heard the name of Chairman Jiang, the applause was thunderous. Then, every time a name was read, everyone applauded. Then, he reported that Wu Yifang, Chen Lifu, and Chen Cheng had resigned from the position of chairman of the presidium. Hong then called the names again, and the elected persons went to the stage in turn. The chairman was in the center, and Bai Chongxi and Sun Ke stood to the left and right. Then, all the chairmen went to the stage. It was already 3:50 p.m. and a temporary break was taken. The presidium immediately held its first meeting in the auditorium to determine the candidate for secretary general of the assembly. At 4:10 p.m., the preparatory meeting was reconvened, and the results of the presidium meeting were reported. Hong Lanyou was publicly elected as the secretary general of the assembly, and Chen Qitian and Lei Zhen were the deputy secretaries general. The assembly will be adjourned for one day on the 23rd. The second meeting of the presidium is scheduled to be held at 10:00 a.m. on the 23rd to discuss the rules of procedure of the assembly.

### Xu Yongchang Returns to Nanjing

[Our Beiping 22nd Dispatch] Xu Yongchang returned to Nanjing from Taiyuan on the 17th. People from Taiyuan said: After many twists and turns, Xu's trip was to discuss with Yan Xishan about serving as vice president or the head of one of the five Yuan after the implementation of constitutional government, because the reduction of provinces and regions is inevitable, and it is not appropriate to continue to serve as the chairman of a small province or region.

It is reported that the China Democratic League once intended to participate in the constitutional draft review committee, but was not invited, so it could not attend.

### Amendment to the Executive Yuan Organization Law Passed by the Legislative Yuan for Review, the Ministry of Transportation Still Maintains the Original Name of the Ministry of Communications

[Our Nanjing 22nd Dispatch] The amendment to the Executive Yuan Organization Law has been passed by the Fourth Temporary Session of the West Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 22nd according to the review opinions. The biggest difference between the case and the draft amendment released the day before yesterday is that the Ministry of Transportation in the original draft has been changed back to the Ministry of Communications. Lin Bin, Chairman of the Legislative Yuan Legal System Committee, explained when reporting on the review process of the draft that the original text of the bill submitted by the Chairman was the Ministry of Transportation, but the draft amendment to the Executive Yuan Organization Law issued by the National Government was changed to the "Ministry of Communications" and stamped with a seal. The review believed that "Communications" was better than "Transportation", so the old name of the Ministry of Communications was maintained. There were also some other changes. After the report, Wei Tingsheng drafted a speech, advocating the abolition of the Chief Accountant of the Executive Yuan. Lin Bin explained that the Executive Yuan has been setting up a Chief Accountant for many years, and its affairs are also extremely busy. It seems that the opinions of the Executive Yuan should be consulted first, and this case seems to be passed temporarily according to the original proposal. Regarding whether a Chief Accountant should be set up, it seems that another case should be handled. Hong Ruizhao expressed opposition to the addition of ministries and commissions to the amended Executive Yuan Organization Law. He believed that the current amendment to the Organization Law has its environmental needs, but the current sudden increase of three or four ministries and commissions is a malignant expansion. The Ministry of Internal Affairs has nothing to do, and now it has changed the original business of the ministry to set up the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Land Administration, and the Ministry of Water Resources. The business of the Postal and Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications was originally very clear, but now it has also changed the department to a ministry. This increase has not seen its balanced finance. Zhao Pei, Jian Guansan, and others did not think so. Jian's opposition was particularly fierce. Finally, Zhong Tianxin, with his usual calm mind, spoke, pointing out that only one Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has been added this time, which cannot be said to be too much. Further, even if it is not due to the situation, there are sufficient reasons for changing water conservancy, land administration, and health to ministries, because after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, construction began. The above three businesses are of great importance to the welfare of the people, even if they cost more national treasury, it is not without good influence if they can be done well. Finally, it was submitted for voting and passed according to the review opinions.

### Anecdotes of the National Assembly

— Our Reporter Zhang Ming

As soon as the reporters entered the venue today, they received invitations. When they opened them, they found that it was a reporter inviting reporters. The Capital News Reporters Association was inviting reporters from all over the country to Nanjing.

When the presidium gathered to go to the stage, Chairman Jiang was the first one, wearing a military uniform, standing in the center of the stage, always with a smile on his face. At this time, the mercury lamps shone in all directions, dazzlingly.

The second person to go to the stage with the chairman was Bai Chongxi, in military uniform with dazzling medals, shining brightly in the mercury lamps.

There were two women in the presidium, but Wu Yifang declined, so only Liu Hengjing was left, standing in the ranks of the presidium, looking particularly small and delicate.

Because of Wu Yifang's resignation from the presidium, and because the chairman announced Shao Lizitou's replacement, the female representatives were a little agitated. During the break, everyone gathered in groups, with some saying that if a woman resigns, a woman should replace her, and some saying how can her private resignation affect us women? While they were arguing, Hu Jianzhong walked over and said, "What's wrong, female representatives are going to riot?"

The only female chairman of the presidium, Liu Hengjing, came down from the stage and was surrounded twice, first for photos and then for autographs. The reporter asked her to say a few words, but she said, "I only have one sentence, there is only one woman among the 46 members of the presidium, which is too few?"

Shao Lizitou was announced to be replacing the presidium, but he firmly declined. When the gentlemen of the presidium went to the stage, he reported below, expressing his firm intention to decline. And he pointed to his head with his finger, probably meaning, "I always feel a headache." He declined the presidium because he had said before that he would not be the secretary-general or a member of the presidium.

There were many coughs in the venue, one after another, probably due to the change in temperature.

Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department entered the venue and sat in the last seat in the audience.

The three representatives who resigned from the chairmanship of the presidium were all from Zhejiang. Zhejiang representative Wu Wangji said: "I am embarrassed to say."

The reason for Wu Yifang's resignation from the presidium was that school affairs were busy. Chen Lifu said himself that he was "short of talent and busy with affairs." Shao Lizitou, however, "often feels a headache." Chen Cheng's intention to resign was very firm, and Gu Zhenggang wanted to stand up and say a few words of retention, but Chen Cheng repeatedly bowed to him, asking him not to say anything.

After the chairman announced that someone had resigned, these three or even four figures immediately became the target of everyone, and at the same time, they also seemed quite active in this moment.

The order in the venue on the 22nd was very good because there was no discussion of events and there was nothing to argue about.

### Sun Baogang and Others Arrive in Nanjing from Beiping, the Social Democratic Party Immediately Nominates a List and Expresses Satisfaction with Chairman Chiang's Reply

[Our Nanjing 22nd Dispatch] Sun Baogang, Wan Renqian, and Ye Duyi, members of the Central Standing Committee of the Social Democratic Party, arrived in Nanjing from Beiping at 2:00 p.m. on the 22nd. They immediately reported to Zhang Junmai on the internal consultations of the party in the north. Jiang Yuntian visited Lei Zhen for a long talk in the evening. It is learned that the copies of the letters exchanged between the Long Social Democratic Party and the government were delivered yesterday. The Social Democratic Party expressed great satisfaction with the President's reply, because the various opinions put forward by the party to the government have been fulfilled as desired and have been guaranteed. However, the list of National Assembly representatives of the party had already been drafted and may be submitted on the 23rd. It is also heard that in the Social Democratic Party's letter to the President, in addition to reorganizing the government, fulfilling the four promises, implementing the military reorganization plan, and withdrawing party groups from schools, it also advocated a thorough ceasefire and resumption of talks with the Communist Party, following the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and convening a comprehensive group to seek the unification of the country. A certain person in the Social Democratic Party optimistically believes that if the government can do the above points, the Communist Party may also participate in the National Assembly. Regarding the fact that Qiang Junli did not participate in the National Assembly, it was because he believed that he must maintain a third-party position to mediate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. According to the documents exchanged on the 23rd, the Central Propaganda Department may hold a press conference to announce them, and the list of representatives may also be submitted immediately after the documents are announced.

[Our Beiping 22nd Dispatch] Social Democratic Party representatives Sun Baogang and Ye Duyi left Beiping for Nanjing at 8:30 a.m. on the 22nd. Wan Renqian, a well-known figure in the Northeast Social Democratic Party, accompanied them. Sun and Ye told people before leaving that they would report the opinions from Beiping to the headquarters. The Social Democratic Party's participation in the National Assembly will have to wait for a final decision after concentrating opinions from all parties. They believe that the Social Democratic Party will not split due to the issue of participating in the National Assembly. Whether the Social Democratic Party participates in the National Assembly or not, they personally will not participate in the National Assembly. After the National Assembly, they will return to the north again and go to the Northeast. Wan Renqian told people before leaving that he would ask Mr. Zhang Junli and the headquarters of the Social Democratic Party to carefully consider the issue of participating in the National Assembly. On the 22nd, more than 500 members of the Beiping Social Democratic Party held a general meeting at Tang Xiangming's residence at 6:00 p.m. to discuss the election of National Assembly representatives. It is heard that the Beiping district of the Social Democratic Party has been allocated five National Assembly representatives, and Tianjin three. On the 22nd, both Beiping and Tianjin held meetings to elect double the number of candidates, and the headquarters was asked to circle them.

### Military Mediation Department Loses Function, Group Representatives All Withdraw

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] Although there are no instructions to abolish the Military Mediation Department itself and the Changchun branch, all groups stationed in other locations have completely lost their function as of the evening of the 22nd. The Communist representatives in the government areas and the government representatives in the Communist areas have now completely withdrawn from their stationed locations. This is the result of an agreement by the three parties' committee members. Currently, in addition to the representatives of the two parties in the eight groups outside the Guan already having withdrawn, the only five complete groups within the Guan also withdrew on the 21st and 22nd respectively. In the Botou group in the Communist area, the government and American representatives withdrew to Cangxian on the 21st.

### Ten Legislators Discuss the Revised Draft Constitution (I)

— Our Newspaper Reporter Yu Zhenji

Since Wang Chonghui, Wu Jingxiong, and Lei Zhen used the May 5th Draft Constitution as a basis, and organized and established the "Revised Draft of the May 5th Draft Constitution" based on the principles of the Political Consultative Conference and the principles of modification by the Comprehensive Conference and the Constitution Drafting Committee, all parties have attached great importance to it. The comments made have also been inconsistent. Some even believe that modifying the May 5th Draft Constitution is to stray far from the Three People's Principles and the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution. During the review talks held by the Legislative Yuan earlier, the legislators also had fierce debates. The revised draft has recently been subject to the final review by the Constitution Drafting Committee, in which the connection between the five Yuans and the appointment of the heads of the Executive Yuan and various ministries have been further improved. It has been passed by the 46th meeting of the Central Standing Committee and sent to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures, and then sent to the National Assembly as a draft for constitution-making. When the Legislative Yuan held a joint review meeting of the five committees on the morning of the 22nd, the case was passed in accordance with the resolution of the Central Standing Committee. In the afternoon, the full session of the Yuan also passed it, and the legislative procedures have been completed, so it can be transferred to the National Assembly for discussion.

Constitution-making is the sole task of this National Assembly, and the revised draft will be the basis for constitution-making. Its importance in the history of constitution-making in our country is self-evident. The criticisms from various parties are so divergent. To this end, the reporter specially visited legislators Lin Bin, Chen Changheng, Zhang Zhaoyuan, Chen Guyuan, Li Chenxue, Zhong Tianxin, Chen Xiaocen, Chuan Tongxian, Zhao Jiuchuan, Chen Hong, etc., to make an objective comparison of the revised draft and the original May 5th Draft Constitution from the perspectives of academic theory and national conditions. The opinions of each legislator are summarized below in order of the revised draft. (Note: Most of the interviews were conducted before the meetings of the Constitution Drafting Committee on the 18th and 19th. For the main points of modification by the Review Committee, please refer to this newspaper on the 20th):

What Kind of Republic is China?

The revised draft changed Article 1 of the general outline of the May 5th Draft Constitution, "The Republic of China is a Republic based on the Three People's Principles," to "The Republic of China is based on the Three People's Principles, and is a democratic republic of the people, by the people, and for the people." This motion caused an uproar in the Legislative Yuan. Di Ying believed that Lincoln's three principles of of the people, by the people, and for the people did not include the entire Three People's Principles, and that listing foreign creeds in our country's constitution seemed inappropriate. Zhang Zhaoyuan also believed that it had the fault of misattributing something. Chen Guyuan believed that "of the people, by the people, and for the people" was not exactly equal to "nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood," but believed that the point was not overly important. Zhong Tianxin believed that such a provision did not immediately mean that it was contrary to the Three People's Principles, and that the two were not much different in essence. He himself once said that the purpose of the Three People's Principles was in the people, by the people, and for the people. However, from a legislative point of view, the revised draft seemed slightly tautological. Other members of the committee did not attach much importance to this.

Territorial Issues Worth Paying Attention To

According to the provisions of the May 5th Draft Constitution, the territory of our country is of an enumerated nature, and its changes must be decided by the National Assembly. Due to the current situation, the revised draft only makes a general provision for the territory, and its changes do not need to be decided by the National Assembly, and can be changed according to law. Most members of the committee felt that this provision was inappropriate.

Li Qingao believed that: The phrase "according to its inherent territory" is too vague, and suggested adopting the methods of other countries, using astronomical points to stipulate the longitude and latitude lines. If this point cannot be done, it should also use the enumeration method. Zhong Tianxin's view is: The drafters of the revised draft must have believed that since the legislators will be elected by the people, the Legislative Yuan composed of representatives of the people can deal with this issue. The drafters must also believe that since the Legislative Yuan has the power to discuss and decide on treaty cases, treaties will inevitably involve territory, so the provision in the territory article is "cannot be changed except in accordance with the law," instead of stipulating that it must be decided by the National Assembly.

Both people believe that territory is extremely important to national relations, and it seems reckless to change it only according to law. They all advocate following the original provisions of the May 5th Draft, that the territory of the Republic of China shall not be changed without the decision of the National Assembly. However, Mr. Chen Guyuan believes that enumeration is too rigid, and the current provisions have their own hard work, and generalization is better than enumeration.

Article 5 of the revised draft stipulates: "All nationalities of the Republic of China are equal." Li Qingao believes that although this article stipulates this, it is actually not done. He used the basic national policy as an example, stating that Article 136 stipulates: "The state shall enable tillers to have their land, laborers to have their jobs, and entrepreneurs to have opportunities for development, in order to seek the equality of national economy and people's livelihood." As far as the Han people are concerned, after "tillers have their land," their people's livelihood can be guaranteed. But what about pastoralists? What if "tillers have their land" and encroach on the pastures of pastoralists? The various problems in our country's past on the periphery were often caused by tillers encroaching on the pastures of pastoralists. Since it is called all nationalities are equal, why are the guarantees that pastoralists and even fishermen should receive not included in the Constitution? As far as the country is concerned, not all land is pastoral land. Li advocated changing the article to "those who have the ability to use land should retain their land." In this way, tillers, pastoralists, and fishermen will all receive the guarantees they deserve, and it can be said that the phrase "all nationalities are equal" has been truly achieved.

### Japanese Fishing Boats Unauthorizedly Cross Restricted Area, Found More Than 100 Li North of Taiwan, Hope Government Urges MacArthur Headquarters to Pay Attention

[City News] According to the Fishing Management Office of the Executive Yuan: On the 25th of last month, four Japanese hand-operated net fishing boats were suddenly found about 120 li north of the province (122 degrees 47 east longitude, 22 degrees 47 north latitude). They were seen by our fishing boat "Jie Chong Te Bo Ai". The westernmost of the Japanese fishing boats on that day had the words "Fukuda Maru No. 86" on the stern, which is a Shimonoseki boat with a green hull and red deck, carrying crew members in old Japanese army uniforms. It was found that the boat, etc., sailed from Nagasaki, and caught one box each of sea bream and red ladyfish at the time. It was found that the MacArthur Headquarters of the US occupation forces originally restricted Japanese fishing boats to fishing within 30 nautical miles of the country, and later relaxed it to 90 nautical miles, but now the Japanese fishing boats have invaded 400 nautical miles away from Taiwan. It is hoped that our government can pay attention to it and urge the MacArthur Headquarters to pay attention, it is said.

### The Political Conference of the Pacification Zone Decided to Implement the Land Reform Plan and Promote Cooperative Movement in the Recovered Areas

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 22nd] A senior official told the Associated Press today that the Political Affairs Committee meeting of the Pacification Zone, held by the government to deal with the recovered areas, closed yesterday. The meeting passed a "more revolutionary" land reform, as well as various measures related to relief, education and economic cooperation. The official also said: The meeting decided to set up four experimental zones in Huaiyin, Huai'an, Taixing and Taixian to implement the government's new land reform plan in accordance with the points indicated by Chairman Chiang in his opening remarks. The Political Affairs Committee meeting of the Pacification Zone was presided over by President Song and Minister Bai. It is said that the drafting of the plan has begun. General Fu Zuoyi said at the meeting yesterday that the Communist Party has failed not only militarily, but also politically and economically, and that all that remains is the party's doctrine, but it has now begun to waver. He said: Land reform will be implemented in three stages: (1) Farmers will continue to cultivate the land distributed by the Communist Party, but ownership will be returned to the original owners. This point also applies to landlords who are not in the local area. The previous rule of returning land to the original landlords was limited to 50 mu, but this rule has been abandoned, but some government officials still insist on retaining this limit. The official also said: This issue will be left to the Political Affairs Committee of the Pacification Zone. (2) The government will handle land registration. (3) The government will implement the Father of the Nation's land policy, that is, to increase taxes so that landlords who do not cultivate will not be profitable, and to assist farmers in purchasing land. The person also said: President Song has approved the allocation of 900 million yuan for relief in the recovered areas, but the Political Affairs Committee meeting of the Pacification Zone did not stipulate a detailed plan. It is said that this issue will be left to the relevant government departments and provincial authorities to decide. The meeting decided to promote the cooperative movement in the recovered areas. In addition, it was decided that the Executive Yuan should pay 100 million yuan to the newly established Central Cooperative Bank as soon as possible. It is said that Chairman Chiang had previously agreed to pay this amount to the bank as working capital, but so far, President Song has only paid 200 million yuan. The meeting also passed a resolution to start repairing all destroyed schools. There are no special provisions for the new curriculum.

### Truth About Soviet Employees of the China Changchun Railway Requesting Repatriation: All Are Sick or in Dire Straits

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd] Regarding the matter of Soviet employees of the China Changchun Railway in Shenyang, who are sick and living in difficult circumstances, requesting repatriation, the reporter specially investigated the truth from the China Changchun Railway as follows: The China Changchun Railway is more than 2,000 kilometers long. Since the Soviet army withdrew from the Northeast, we have taken over only more than 600 kilometers. This has caused the road's income and expenditure to be out of balance, with huge monthly losses, all borne by our national treasury. Although the road has tried its best to rectify the situation, the situation has improved slightly, but due to the unstable situation, the treatment of Chinese and Soviet employees cannot be improved temporarily, and the work of employees cannot return to normal. The situation of Chinese employees is indeed difficult. Under this pitiful situation, the Soviet side requested that some of its Soviet employees in Shenyang who are sick, have difficulty living, and have less work be transferred back to the Soviet Union. We expressed our intention to keep them and have tried our best to improve the treatment of negative workers. We also gave preferential medical expenses to Soviet employees who are sick. After several consultations with the Soviet side, our government finally agreed to the Soviet side's request. For Soviet employees who are sick, have simpler jobs, and have difficulty living, we temporarily allowed them to return to the Soviet Union, and our government provided them with transportation convenience, ordering the railway bureau to prepare a car to send them to Tianjin, take a Soviet ship to return to the country, and give them return travel expenses at its discretion. As for the remaining 100 or so Soviet employees, they are still staying on the road and working as usual.

### Editorial: Wishing the National Assembly's Constitution-Making to See the Big Picture!

Since the National Assembly opened on the 15th, it has been in the preparatory meeting process for a week. Now that the presidium has been selected, and the amendment to the draft constitution has been solemnly passed by the Central Standing Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the procedures, the Legislative Yuan is currently reviewing and discussing it yesterday, and it should be able to complete its legislative procedures soon. It can be seen that the National Assembly will enter the stage of formal sessions starting next week.

Although this National Assembly was produced amidst great hardship and tribulation, judging from the signs of the past week, one cannot but acknowledge that it is a cradle for fostering a new political atmosphere in China. What we call a new political atmosphere is one of mutual respect and tolerance. We resolutely oppose resolving problems on the battlefield and advocate deciding everything in the parliament. Only in this way can we see a parliament that encompasses various opinions, and allow it to be delighted to hear a parliament that can truly integrate, compromise, and appropriately determine what to adopt and what to discard. This National Assembly, thanks to the central authorities' foresight, tolerance, and forbearance, has indeed set an example of a new political atmosphere. In addition to the Kuomintang, the Youth Party and social elites participated first, and now the Democratic Socialist Party will also participate. Moreover, the majority of representatives elected by the people of the whole country and overseas Chinese, regardless of their party affiliation or lack thereof, have all come together from afar, which is already commendable. Although the Chinese Communist Party and the Democratic League have not yet expressed their participation, the National Assembly not only still reserves seats for their representatives, but also reserved seats for their participation in the presidium yesterday. It can be seen that all the representatives of the National Assembly sincerely hope that this great meeting will be a meeting that reflects various opinions from all over the country, which is especially the ultimate expression of a good political atmosphere. In addition, outside of the National Assembly, the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang and the Supreme National Defense Council recently passed amendments to the Organic Law of the National Government and the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan, fully demonstrating the spirit of abiding by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The Kuomintang, as the ruling party, has such magnanimity of "everything for the public," which is truly the most powerful guarantee for the Republic of China to embark on the road to democracy. As long as all participating parties can promote the new political atmosphere of "everything for the public," we believe that the constitution-making endeavor will surely have a satisfactory outcome.

Speaking of constitution-making, we can only appeal to the representatives of the National Assembly to broaden their minds and see the big picture. The constitution is the fundamental law of the country, and constitution-making is the greatest task of the people. Great undertakings naturally require bold strokes. With a congress of two thousand people, representing all ethnic groups, regions, occupations, parties, and social classes of the country, if the representatives do not have a broad vision of the entire country, do not have a broad mind to encompass the entire nation, consider the interests of the whole, and consider the descendants of future generations, but only focus on the local, think about the small self, argue endlessly over trivial details, then judging from the preparatory meeting situation in the past week, I am afraid that the approximately 140 or 50 articles may not be completely and flawlessly discussed in a year and a half. This is not what the people of today expect. We are not saying that the representatives of the National Assembly can act carelessly, but we must firmly request the representatives of the National Assembly to start with a broad brush.

Although democratic politics seems to be a waste of time, we must always hope that in the process of learning democratic politics, time will not be wasted excessively! Democratic politics is certainly a politics that welcomes debate, but we must ensure that everyone, in the process of learning democratic politics, truly debates on the topic within the scope permitted by the rules of procedure, and reduces irrelevant disputes over minor issues. Most of the representatives of the National Assembly come from the people and have their own professions. Those who belong to the party and government authorities bear the heavy responsibility of politics and military affairs for the central and local governments. If they prolong the meetings in the National Assembly and argue endlessly, what will be the impact on politics? What will be the public's perception? We sincerely hope that the representatives of this National Assembly can see the big picture, and in the major key points of the constitution, that is, the essence of the political and economic system, everyone will earnestly discuss without letting go, in order to reach a compromise and consistent conclusion, and establish a foundation for the long-term stability of the country. As for the wording of the articles, let the experts who are skilled in legislative technology take more responsibility for reviewing and organizing them. As for the details and minor matters, we fundamentally do not advocate making cumbersome regulations in the constitution. Gentlemen, you must know: As long as the people can truly "be the masters" in a democracy, and as long as the government can truly "implement the constitution" in constitutionalism, the constitution is originally nothing more than a grand law that the people and the government throughout the country jointly abide by and implement. Rather than being cumbersome, difficult to handle, and obstructive, why not first choose its major points at this time and solemnly stipulate them? So that every word and sentence in the constitution is something that everyone is willing to sincerely abide by and follow.

So, what are the big issues in the constitution? The representatives of the National Assembly must be able to see them, so there is no need to say more. At this time, we would like to offer one point first, which is the issue of the size of government power. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, had already said that we want to enable "the people to have power and the government to have ability." He also said that Western democratic countries, on the one hand, hope that the government is omnipotent, and on the other hand, fear that the government is omnipotent. In view of this, he created the five-power constitution. Its true essence lies not in the separation of the five powers, but in the checks and balances between "political power" and "governing power." In other words, he advocated that the people only need to have the four major political powers of election, recall, initiative, and referendum to control the "people" and "laws" of the government. After the government is elected and takes office, it should be allowed to fully exert the "ability" of its five "governing powers" to benefit the people. Those who are not capable should be "recalled," and those who have bad "laws" should be "referendumed." It is enough for the people to have this great power, and there is no need for elected representatives to pull the government's sleeves every day, making it unable to move, and taking it as a pleasure. This is Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great invention after a lifetime of studying the laws and institutions of various countries, and it is the true essence of the five-power constitution! If this point is forgotten, and only following in the footsteps of others, focusing only on restraining the administrative organs, whether it is a cabinet system or a presidential system, or what the current trend calls a disguised cabinet system or a disguised presidential system, no matter what tricks are changed or what coats are worn, they will all deviate from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. The United Kingdom and the United States are advanced democratic countries, their people are accustomed to democracy, their national power is already abundant, and their political systems have been established for a long time. Regardless of whether the constitution is written or unwritten, they can use it freely and have achieved great results. It does not matter much if the government's actions are slow. However, emerging countries with vast territories and populations, accumulated habits, and awaiting transformation, such as today's China, are in a world of constantly changing situations. How can we quickly catch up and actively build the country? Of course, it is okay to borrow from others, but we cannot completely copy the established rules of the United Kingdom and the United States. We hope that everyone will be calm, look around the world, focus on reality, and formulate a constitution that is more suitable and feasible for the Republic of China.

Finally, we would like to ask the representatives of the National Assembly to especially think about how this constitution can be implemented and how it can make everyone willing to follow it when making the constitution. They must never have the idea of making the constitution first and then thinking about revising it if it does not work at the beginning of making the constitution. To succeed in anything in the world, we must rely on a "sincere" character! "Sincerity is the end and the beginning of things; without sincerity, there is nothing." The National Assembly must seek to make the constitution truly feasible; this is sincerity, and this is the only key to the success of constitution-making!

### The Circumstances of the Murder Case in Shouxian Are Shocking: The County Magistrate Murders a Retired Military Officer; Zhang Zuoliu Has Been Detained After Accusations from All Sides

[Our Newspaper Bengbu News] Recently, a county magistrate in northern Anhui was involved in a case of planting evidence out of personal grudge, designing to kill an innocent retired military officer. The deceased was Zhao Zipan, who had followed Commander Bai Wenwei of the 33rd Army as a battalion and regimental commander during the years of the Republic of China sixteen and seventeen. He also led troops to fight against the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War. After this shocking tragedy occurred, not only did it arouse public outrage among the people of Huaishang, but public opinion here was also greatly shocked. Everyone believed that officials were treating human lives so carelessly, and that the law was being disregarded and human rights were not guaranteed. The details obtained from the investigation are recorded as follows: Zhang Zuoliu, the county magistrate of Shouxian, is from Fengtai, northern Anhui, and graduated from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou. He once founded the Huaimin Daobao in Huai. During the Anti-Japanese War, Zhao Zipan served as the captain of the First Battalion of the Twelfth Guerrilla Column of the Northern Anhui Garrison Headquarters, and as the deputy chief of the detachment of the Eighth Forward Column. Zhang Zuoliu, in the rear, once planned to transport a large amount of materials to the Bengbu area, which was occupied by the enemy, for sale. When passing through Zhao Zipan's defense zone, Zhao, fearing that he was aiding the enemy, stopped him. Zhang held a grudge because the materials could not pass.

Framed with Personal Grudge

After the victory, Zhang was appointed to a higher position. Last month, he fabricated a story that Zhao Zipan was colluding with bandits and falsely reported to the headquarters of the Eighth Pacification Zone, requesting his arrest and interrogation in Bengbu, which he succeeded in doing. At 2:00 p.m. on October 30th, Zhao Zipan was bathing in a bathhouse on Gongyuan Road in Shouxian City. Zhang Zuoliu learned of this and suddenly sent many armed soldiers to arrest Zhao and imprison him in the county government, forbidding him from communicating with anyone. When people from various agencies and organizations in Shouxian heard the news, they were very shocked. They jointly certified that Zhao had not committed any illegal acts and sent representatives to plead for his release. Zhang said that he was arresting and escorting Zhao to Bengbu on the orders of the headquarters of the Eighth Pacification Zone and refused bail.

Murdered En Route

At 5:00 p.m. on November 1st, the whole city was under martial law. Zhang Zuoliu sent eight armed soldiers with two long guns and six short guns to take Zhao Zipan out of the back door of the county government. Zhao was escorted to a boat at the North Gate amidst the sound of gongs. He also sent another team of armed soldiers to meet them by boat from the East Gate to escort Zhao to Bengbu. Unexpectedly, when they arrived west of Yabeipu in Pingshan Head (in Fengtai County, 20 miles from Shouxian), in the evening, soldiers shot Zhao to death. He was shot seven times, and there was a knife wound on his chest, which was very tragic. The next morning (2nd), the escorts hired a civilian boat from Tianjia'an and transported Zhao's body to Bengbu, reporting to the Pacification Headquarters that they had encountered bandits on the way and exchanged fire, causing Zhao to be injured and killed. They also requested an autopsy, which was completed and photographed. The deceased's son, Zhao Mingliang, and daughter, Zhao Mingying, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and purchased a coffin to hastily prepare the body for burial.

Appeals from All Sides

Zhao Mingliang and his sister were extremely saddened by the inexplicable murder of their father and appealed to people from Shouxian living in Bengbu for help in seeking justice. Liu Huaxuan, a scholar from Shouxian living in Bengbu, convened an emergency meeting of his fellow villagers at the Shouxian, Dingyuan, and Fengtai Fellow Villagers Association on the evening of the 7th. Everyone who attended was indignant. They elected Liu Huaxuan, Peng Zhuoru, Hu Xichou, Yue Xiangru, and Zhu Zhuoren to visit Commander Xia Wei at the Pacification Headquarters on the morning of the 8th to report the truth and details of the Zhao case. Commander Xia Wei was very surprised and promised to send someone to investigate. Subsequently, Sun Qingang, the speaker of the Shouxian County Council, went directly to Hefei from Shouxian to report to the provincial government and request a thorough investigation. Zhang Qingchuan, the director of the Shouxian branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, also went to Beijing to appeal. Zhao Mingying, the deceased's daughter, went to Hefei from Bengbu on the 10th to appeal to Chairman Li of the provincial government about her grievances. The Shouxian, Dingyuan, and Fengtai Fellow Villagers Association in Bengbu also sent representatives to go.

Detention Warrant

After receiving the report, Anhui Chairman Li Pinsian was extremely angry at Zhang's disregard for human life and issued a hand-written order to the First District Commissioner's Office to detain Zhang and escort him to the province for strict handling. The Commissioner's Office obeyed the order and immediately detained Zhang Zuoliu. He was escorted to Hefei on the 18th to be sent to the provincial government for investigation.

The Tragic Condition of Zhao Zipan After His Murder, the Knife Wound on His Right Chest

### New Recruits in Pinghu Enlist; Lottery Completed in Dangtu

[Our Newspaper Pinghu News] The first enlistment of new recruits in this county was held solemnly on the 18th. The county sent 25 new recruits this time. After the regimental management office checked their physical condition, 5 were unqualified, and 20 were actually recruited.

[Our Newspaper Qingpu News] The draftees selected by lottery in various districts of this county were gathered in the urban area on the 20th, totaling more than 500 people. The military medical officer sent by the Songjiang Regiment Management District has arrived in the county and will examine the physical condition of the draftees on the 21st. The quota for military service in this county is 250 people.

[Our Newspaper Dangtu News] This county has been ordered to recruit 730 new recruits, and the lottery has now been completed in various townships. They are being sent to the county government for concentration and then handed over to the Xuancheng Regiment Management District Command for acceptance.

### Six Thieves Escape from Prison in Chuansha

[Our Newspaper Chuansha News] Due to the negligence of the guards, at about 2:00 a.m. on the 20th, six thieves suddenly escaped from a prison cell in the detention center of the judicial office of this county. They were Zhang Genfu, Pan Xiaofang, and Cai Zhanqing, who had been sentenced to death, Zhang Jinsheng, who had been sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, Qian Zhongda, who had been sentenced to five years of imprisonment, and Cao Fuchang, a thief who was on trial. When the guards discovered this, they immediately reported it to the police and pursued them, but there was no trace of them. After inspection, it was found that the prisoners had dug a hole in the ground of the cell, passed through the walls of a small alley, and escaped outwards through a bamboo fence circle owned by a Mr. Song. The hole was more than ten feet long, and it was very difficult to dig. It could not have been completed in a day or two, and it was even more difficult without the use of iron tools. The entrance of the hole in the cell was conveniently covered by a bed, so the guards did not notice it beforehand. It was also heard that the prisoners all had shackles on their feet, but they had all been removed before escaping and left in the cell.

### Nantong Security Team Stationed in Chuangang Town

[Nantong News] Commander Zhang of the Zhangzhishan Security Brigade believed that the communist troops in Chuangang Town were trying to stir up trouble from time to time, which affected the security of the area. Moreover, the people of Chuangang were living in poverty. Therefore, he ordered Fan Kaifu, the captain of the First Company, to search and station troops there. The communist troops fled without a trace after hearing the news, only firing cold shots along the way. Chuangang Town was officially stationed on the 18th at 7:20 a.m. Because the advance was rapid and safe, the residents gathered along the road to welcome our troops.

### Wuxi, Chengjiang, Wujin, and Yuhang Cloth Factories Request Uniform Yarn Allocation

[Our Newspaper Wuxi News] After the Shanghai Economic Department's Textile Industry Management Committee implemented the cotton yarn allocation system, the dyeing and weaving cloth factories in other areas outside Shanghai were not treated the same, which was threatened by the black market yarn. Under the imbalance between supply and demand, the cost of the cloth produced exceeded one-third of that in Shanghai, and the price difference was even greater. The factories in various places that have not been allocated will fall into stagnation. At 2:00 p.m. on the 21st, the Wuxi County Cloth Factory Industry Association, together with representatives from the cloth factory industries in Wujin, Changshu, and Jiangyin counties, totaling more than 20 people, held an emergency meeting in Wuxi. They decided to elect representatives to go to Shanghai to petition the Textile Management Committee and the relevant government authorities, requesting uniform yarn allocation to provide relief.

### Female Bandit Lu Asi Mei to Be Tried by Military Law Soon

### Taihu剿匪Review: Elimination of Bandits and Security is Expected

[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 12th] The second phase of the Jiangnan area剿匪plan, which began on November 1st, will soon reach its completion deadline at the end of November. The Taihu剿匪Headquarters specially met with our newspaper reporter on the 22nd to publish a conversation on the work situation of the past two months, which is briefly recorded as follows: Taihu Lake covers 36,000 hectares and spans Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Since the late Qing Dynasty, for more than 50 years, it has been a haven for bandits. After the victory, General Tang Enbo, in view of the rampant bandits in Taihu Lake, which was a hidden danger to the security of Jiangnan, specially ordered Chuan Jinfang and Liu Hongde to organize the Taihu area剿匪Headquarters in Mudu. Since the middle of September, the work has been carried out. Based on the government's policy of leniency and not blaming the past, it first ordered Commissioners Jin Jiarang and Yang Yanbin to carry out the work of appeasement. According to statistics, from October to the present, the bandits who have returned to the government include Liao Bingnan and Pu Fulin's troops, who were based in Taihu Lake, Mao Yunxiang and Zeng Junfeng's troops, who disturbed the Sunan and Lubei areas, Gu Fuxing's troops, who stole into the Xinan area, and Xu Jintang's troops, who were active in the rural areas of Binhu, totaling about a thousand people, bringing back more than ten machine guns, more than three hundred rifles, and more than a hundred short guns. These personnel who have reformed themselves are waiting to be compiled and trained. As for the stubborn bandits such as Li Defu, Hui Yusheng, and Liu Senlin, they have all been wiped out. Currently, the remaining bandits in the Taihu Lake area include Xue Yonghui, Zhou Zhimin, and Qin Dagang's three troops, who are still disturbing the Baima Lanshi Jinqiao area in the Yangshan area. However, according to reliable information, the actual strength of the three bandits is only one light machine gun and more than ten rifles. Therefore, the bandits are isolated and it is not difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. In the future, the security of Taihu Lake can be guaranteed, the farmers in Binhu can rest easy, and merchants and travelers can also be fearless.

### The Grand Canal Work Relief Bureau to Close at the End of the Month

All unfinished projects will be handed over to the Jiangbei Grand Canal Engineering Bureau to be responsible for handling.

### Suppression of Rickshaws, Prohibition of Wheelbarrows

Rural Areas of Northern Jiangsu Affected

[Our Newspaper Rugao News] This year, rickshaws are banned in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hankou, and wheelbarrows will also be banned in the mainland. The reason is that wheelbarrows damage the road surface of highways. The county government has received an order from the province to transfer the order to investigate and ban them. However, rickshaw and wheelbarrow pullers are a side industry for the people of northern Jiangsu during the slack farming season. In the future, during the slack farming season, the villagers will not be able to pull rickshaws to Shanghai or push wheelbarrows in the countryside. This will have a significant impact on the rural economy.

### Qiantang River Water Conservancy Project Decided to Be Completed in Four Phases

[Our Newspaper Haining News] After the Qiantang River Water Conservancy Project Bureau invited Chinese and foreign water conservancy experts to discuss the results, it has now been decided to complete it in four phases, each phase lasting one year. The first phase of the project is the one currently underway in various sections, with an estimated cost of 6 billion. The second phase includes (1) the Haining Chengming Stone Embankment (150 meters of project), (2) the Haining Du·Shi·Gao·Li·Zhong Stone Embankment (250 meters of project), (3) the Haining Dan to Dai Stone Embankment project (360 meters of project), and (4) the Xiaoshan Wenjia Weir Stone Embankment project (50 meters of project), with an estimated cost of 10,715,000,000 yuan.

### Our Newspaper's Hangzhou Office Opens a Station for Spiritual Food

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou News] Our newspaper's Hangzhou office originally erected a newspaper display board on the edge of the Sixth Park by the lake, and readers were crowded and unable to move. In view of this, the Hangzhou Municipal Engineering Bureau cooperated with our newspaper's office to establish a spiritual food station at the Sixth Wharf.

### Hangzhou District Chief Election: Municipal Government Actively Preparing

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 22nd] The Hangzhou Municipal Government is actively preparing for the election of district chiefs. It is learned that candidates participating in the election are going to the Civil Affairs Section to register.

The Executive Yuan has allocated 500 tons of flour, which will be distributed to designated routes. Director Yang said: The construction of Zhejiang roads relies entirely on the power of the people. The decision to lease Zhejiang roads is being put out to tender, but the price offered by commercial vehicles is too low. The Department of Transportation has indicated that it is not enough to maintain the roads, so it is difficult to succeed. However, the tendering method is still being drafted.

### Improving the Beijing-Shanghai Railway

Following the publication in this column of Mr. Chen Liuli's article "Five Points to Contribute to the Railway Bureau," the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration has responded, stating: "(1) The train frequency on our railway is now greater than before the war, and the number of passengers has more than doubled. Therefore, apart from reserved seating, all other trains are extremely crowded, especially the fourth-class carriages. We will find ways to improve seating. Regarding passengers carrying commercial goods, our railway has strict restrictions. Large items must be handled as parcels and transported in the parcel car according to regulations. Small packages also require purchasing parcel tickets for carriage on board. Regarding passengers carrying chickens, ducks, fish, and crabs, we are currently formulating appropriate measures for prohibition. (2) The delays of our express trains averaged three hours and twenty-three minutes when we first took over. Recently, the average delay has been only nine minutes. After more than a year of effort, there has been significant improvement. As for delays of other ordinary passenger trains, there are many factors involved, and we are thoroughly researching improvements. (3) Each time we add passenger train services, we do so based on statistical figures of passenger numbers in each section of each month. Therefore, there is no impracticality. Regarding restoring the pre-war Beijing-Wuxi service, we have long considered this. However, the current level of passenger congestion between Beijing and Wuxi is far less than in other sections, so we can only proceed when there are sufficient vehicles. (4) All stations on our railway originally had waiting room facilities before the war, but many were destroyed during the war. Now, to reduce passenger suffering, we are planning to add waiting rooms to major passenger stations such as Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Shanghai, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou, and improve other facilities. (5) Due to a shortage of vehicles, our freight train services are already very limited. At this time of commercial recovery, various businesses urgently need goods to be transported. Our railway should strive to facilitate transportation to benefit people's livelihoods. The original letter suggested reducing freight train services and changing them to passenger services, which would be detrimental to one aspect while neglecting another. This would likely invite criticism from other quarters." We are publishing this to acknowledge the Railway Bureau's willingness to adopt good advice.

### Only Son Still Required to Serve in the Military

Regarding the reader Li Yimin's previous letter inquiring about the ambiguity of conscription for only sons, we have received a reply from the Conscription Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense explaining: "Article 26, Paragraph 4 of the Military Service Law promulgated by the National Government on October 10, 1946 (which does not include provisions for deferment for only sons) states that 'those solely responsible for family livelihood without siblings, or with siblings who have all been conscripted or are all under the age of eighteen' may be granted deferred conscription during wartime, but not deferred enlistment during peacetime, and are still required to enter military service." Editor's Note: Regarding the issue of whether only sons should be required to serve in the military, many people have repeatedly sent letters appealing for consideration. This serves as a reply.

### Postal Reply

Reply to Mr. Nie Zhicheng: Regarding your letter stating that Tinglin urgently needs relief, we have received a reply from the Su-Ning Branch of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration stating: "The distribution of relief goods by our office is based on the results of preliminary investigations conducted by the Relief and Rehabilitation Associations composed of gentry, charitable organizations, groups, and individuals enthusiastic about local public welfare in various counties. The allocation of materials and joint management are then carried out in conjunction with local individuals in each county. If that area has not received relief, and the situation is indeed as Mr. Nie describes in his appeal, we have instructed the county association to investigate and handle it. We are replying specifically to inform you of this." Special reply.

### Extra Notes on the Zhejiang Provincial Magistrate Examination

— Our Reporter Huang XingTian

The Zhejiang Provincial Magistrate Examination has not been held for fifteen years since 1931. After Chairman Shen took office, he decided to hold one. It was initially scheduled for July, then changed to October, and later to November. However, enrollment remained unenthusiastic. Only seventy-three candidates actually took the examination. Their qualifications can be divided into: (1) those who passed the Higher Civil Service Examination, (2) those who passed the Zhejiang Provincial Special Examinations in previous years, (3) graduates of the Zhejiang Provincial Autonomous School and Financial Training Institute, and (4) graduates of the Central Political School. In terms of experience, there were secretaries and section chiefs from Commissioner's Offices and county governments, district chiefs, lawyers, judges, bank staff, and some who had worked in military supply stations and as political staff in the military.

The examination was divided into oral and written tests. The written test lasted for three days. The Chinese language section was set by Yu Shaosong, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Gazetteer Office. In the question regarding the six "lians" (廉) from the Book of Rites (周禮), namely "incorruptibility in selecting the virtuous, the capable, the upright, the law-abiding, the respectful, and the diligent," almost none of the candidates knew the answers. The other subjects were not very difficult. As long as the Chinese was fluent and the general knowledge was rich, it was unlikely to submit a blank paper. The oral test was even more important. Director Ruan Yicheng of the Civil Affairs Department flew from Shanghai to Hangzhou from the National Assembly in Nanjing to handle this matter. During the oral test, all the examiners were divided into three groups: political, economic, and legal. Each group took turns to have one person speak, but all the examiners scored individually. Because each examiner's questions were different, the candidates inevitably had to rely on some luck. Old Mr. Yu complained a lot about the atmosphere among grain administration and tax personnel, so he would first give a lecture to candidates who had served or were currently serving in financial or grain positions. Director Chen Yingbao Lin did not forget about finance and asked questions about what to do when a magistrate took office and the county treasury was empty, the county council did not allow increasing the people's burden, and public school teachers petitioned for salary increases. These questions were precisely the difficulties that Director Chen himself was currently encountering, so he was not ashamed to ask. Director Ruan had a deep understanding of political and legal studies and had rich experience from ten years of service, so the questions he asked were penetrating and made it impossible for the candidates to use empty words. Moreover, he paid close attention to the wording and logic of the questions, and the respondents would be caught in contradictions if they were not careful.

In principle, the examiners were not allowed to express their attitude on the spot regarding whether they were satisfied with the candidates' answers. However, when the answers were too bizarre, they could not help but smile at each other. For example, when Director Chen asked a candidate what "guifei" (規費) and "tefu" (特賦) were, that future "parent official" frankly replied: "I have never eaten the financial rice (i.e., worked in finance), so I don't know." Some candidates were too nervous and stammered, unable to fully express themselves. Others spoke eloquently, as if they were presenting evidence in court or explaining the reasons for a proposal in parliament. Most candidates knew that Chairman Shen was hard of hearing in one ear, so they all spoke loudly. They also knew that Chairman Shen opposed apportionment and excessive taxes and valued farmland irrigation, so they all had a set of theories to support these two issues.

The oral test ended at noon on the 20th, and in the afternoon, the examiners reviewed the written papers. Because they were eager to announce the results, they all read until midnight before finishing. It is said that one paper had the following written on it: In the future, even if magistrates are elected, they must pass an examination to be eligible for election. This is truly far-sighted. However, there are still two magistrates from the first batch assigned to Zhejiang by the Examination Yuan who have not been assigned county positions, and the second batch of fifteen people have already reported to Hangzhou. In addition, there will be a magistrate qualification examination on the 22nd and 23rd of this month. Moreover, the Provincial Party Headquarters has been ordered to reduce staff, and Director Zhang also hopes that the Provincial Government can accommodate some of the laid-off personnel in county government positions. Therefore, the candidates are worried that the Provincial Government will not recruit too many, with most people thinking that it will take a maximum of only ten. Fortunately, most of the candidates currently have jobs, so even if they are not selected, they will still have something to do. If they are selected, they will have to enter the county administration research class of the Provincial Training Corps and study for a while before taking office.

### Britain and America Reduce Troops Stationed in Special Ports; Four Foreign Ministers May Reach Agreement; France Requests Postponement of Discussion on German Issue

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 22nd Broadcast: Regarding the issue of special ports, an agreement is now possible. The Soviet side demands that British and American troops withdraw from special ports within a limited time. Byrnes has proposed a compromise, indicating that Britain and America are willing to reduce their troops stationed in special ports to a certain limit. Molotov is likely to accept this.

[Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in the United States, Washington, 22nd Special Dispatch] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference, which has reached a stalemate due to the issue of special ports, has been unable to complete the Five Satellite Countries Peace Treaty. US Secretary of State Byrnes today shifted his focus, suggesting to avoid the important and dwell on the trivial, and begin discussing the German Peace Treaty first, and then revisit the issue of the Japanese Peace Treaty. The convocation of this Foreign Ministers Conference conflicts with the date of the UN General Assembly, which is very unfortunate. The four powers originally planned to meet with Chinese representatives today to discuss the veto issue, but Molotov declined to attend the Five Foreign Ministers Conference on the pretext that he had to participate in the UN General Assembly meeting discussing the issue of troop stationing.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd Dispatch] According to responsible sources, the French government has instructed its Deputy Foreign Minister Mouvieille, who is currently in New York, to request that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference not discuss the German issue before mid-January next year. France notified the three foreign ministers last month that as long as a provisional government is in power in France, it cannot thoroughly discuss this issue. Therefore, the French representative proposed postponing the discussion until January next year, at which time France's political structure would likely be clearer. At the same time, the French representative will request that any discussion on Germany at the New York Four Foreign Ministers Conference be limited to procedural issues.

### South African Federation Discriminates Against Indians; Gu Weijun Condemns; Voices Support for India's Complaint; Smuts Threatens to Withdraw from the United Nations

[Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in New York, 21st Dispatch] The United Nations Political and Legal Committee met today, and our delegation leader Dr. Gu Weijun delivered a speech supporting India's opposition to the South African Federation's implementation of racial discrimination policies. Belarus, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, and Guatemala also advocated that this issue be fully discussed and handled jointly by the Political Security Committee and the Legal Affairs Committee. This morning, South African Prime Minister General Smuts issued a warning, claiming that if international institutions take any action against racial discrimination, the South African Federation may withdraw from the United Nations. Subsequently, Indian representative Mrs. Pandit made a moving appeal, advocating taking action against the South African Federation. Mr. Gu said: The parts of South African law concerning Indians are based on the principle of racial discrimination, which is indeed a fact, and General Smuts does not deny this point. However, this issue is not simply a domestic legal issue of one country, but involves world political dynamics. Due to the dispute between South Africa and India over this issue, the relationship between the two countries is already quite "tense," so the principles of the United Nations Charter should be used to handle it. Mr. Gu also said that in the past three years, China has repeatedly resolved to maintain contact with the South African government to seek the abolition of discrimination against Chinese people in that country. Smuts's claim that it is a domestic issue is inappropriate. Smuts's liberal and progressive ideas are admired by the world, and he should help resolve this matter. Soviet representative Gromyko said that his government had not yet decided on its position, and neither had the British representative.

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 21st Dispatch] South African Prime Minister Smuts, in the Political and Legal Committee, expressed his agreement to discuss India's complaint against South Africa's discrimination against Indians, but at the same time felt that the discussion should not involve the United Nations' right to interfere in internal affairs. He said that the status of Indians in South Africa does not require action by United Nations institutions. Article 2 of the United Nations Charter clearly stipulates that United Nations institutions shall not interfere in matters within the scope of the internal affairs of member states. Each country, under the principle of not harming the rights of other countries, may formulate its own living conditions and has jurisdiction over people and things within its borders. To avoid serious consequences, it seems appropriate for the International Court of Justice to interpret Article 2 of the Charter, rather than having United Nations institutions investigate prematurely, so as to avoid setting a bad precedent for interfering in internal affairs.

### British Prime Minister Announces Size of Army, Navy, and Air Force; Currently 1.385 Million

[Reuters, London, 21st Dispatch] Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons today that the British armed forces will total 1,385,000 at the end of this December, 185,000 more than the target of 1.2 million announced this February. Due to the delayed conclusion of peace treaties, British troops stationed abroad have not been able to return as scheduled, so the repatriation target cannot be completed as scheduled.

### British Labor Government Regains Confidence; Conservative Party's Motion Against Nationalization of Industry Rejected by House of Commons

The Conservative Party proposed an amendment opposing the continued nationalization of major industries, which was rejected by a vote of 332 to 188.

### Argentine Diplomatic Mission to Visit Moscow Next Month

### Ukrainian Representative Robbed in Restaurant; Shot and Wounded in Leg

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 22nd Dispatch] UN General Assembly Ukrainian representative Steinick was dining with companions in a small restaurant in New York today when a thug suddenly broke into the store to rob it.

He is conducting an investigation and will submit a report through appropriate channels. US delegation leader Austin has expressed his apologies to Manuilsky.

### Investigation of Troop Stationing Issue Sparks Fierce Debate; Differences of Opinion Among Countries; Compromise Requires Behind-the-Scenes Negotiations; Our Representative Supports US Amendment

[Central News Agency, New York, 21st Dispatch] Due to the different positions of the major powers, reaching a compromise agreement on the thorny issue of the United Nations member states stationing troops in non-enemy territories will likely require behind-the-scenes negotiations. Although the five powers unanimously agreed in principle to the Soviet proposal, they differed on how to implement it. The Soviet chair only needs to investigate the situation of troops stationed in foreign territories, while the United States believes that the investigation must include the situation of domestic troops. Our country has indicated that it is willing to support the US amendment if the United States formally proposes it. France proposed three points: (1) a general investigation of armed forces, (2) a proportional reduction of troops stationed abroad, and (3) the final transfer of certain strategic locations to the Security Council for handling. Britain believes that the "real problem" is disarmament, not obtaining information on troop situations, so it advocates considering the Soviet proposals for investigating troop stationing and disarmament together.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 21st Dispatch] The UN General Assembly Political and Security Committee continued its meeting today to discuss the issue of troops stationed abroad by various countries. Chinese representative Gu Weijun first delivered a speech stating that the Soviet proposal for an investigation plan had been amended by the United States, and China was prepared to accept it. The Chinese troops stationed in Burma and Vietnam have long since been withdrawn to their country. As for the US troops stationed in China, the number is very limited and has been agreed to by the Chinese government. The purpose is to cooperate with China to complete certain obligations regarding the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war and the disarmament of the Japanese army. These US troops have not interfered in China's internal affairs. Their presence in China has not caused misunderstandings or friction between China and the United States, nor has it caused misunderstandings or friction between the US military and the Chinese people. Moreover, the number of US troops has been gradually reduced. We know that once the tasks agreed upon by China and the United States are completed, the US troops currently stationed in China can be completely withdrawn to the United States within an appropriate period. As for the Soviet proposal to investigate the troops of various countries stationed abroad, the Chinese government is prepared to accept it for two reasons: namely, (1) in accordance with Article 43 of the United Nations Charter, United Nations member states should provide the necessary troops to organize an international army to maintain international peace and security, so we want to implement this article, it is necessary for countries to provide information. (2) If the Soviet proposal can be supplemented by the US amendment, it will greatly facilitate the study of the issue of disarmament. For this reason, the Chinese delegation is willing to support the US amendment, that is, the information provided by each United Nations country on its troops should simultaneously include its domestic troops and troops stationed abroad.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 21st Dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin, during the debate on the Soviet Union's request for an investigation into foreign troops in the Political Committee today, stated that the British government's acceptance of this Soviet proposal is limited to the condition that the proposal is related to the issue of disarmament. Bevin indicated that if these two matters are mentioned together, he would be willing to support it. Before it can be determined whether the new agency is effective, Britain cannot take actions that might put its citizens in danger. Bevin further stated that Britain fully agrees with Molotov's disarmament proposal. He requested that the Political Committee provide the Military Staff Committee to the Security Council to establish a disarmament agency so that governments can know whether they can cede a large portion of their sovereignty to United Nations agencies. Before Bevin spoke, Molotov answered the questions raised yesterday by the British representative Cadogan, saying that the purpose of investigating the group's foreign troops was to facilitate the preparation of an agreement on troops available to United Nations agencies.

### Yoshida Cabinet Remains Firm; Believes It Should Not Hastily Dissolve the Diet

[Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in Tokyo, 21st Dispatch] Although the opposition parties have launched a fierce political offensive, the Yoshida Cabinet remains in its original position and unmoved. However, when the extraordinary session of the Diet convenes on the 25th of this month, the Japanese political situation will be swept into a turbulent vortex. The Japanese policies after the Diet adjourns have long attracted the attention of the people. The government's announcement of its six basic policies, coupled with the opposition parties', especially the Socialist Party's, arbitrary criticism, seems to have startled the world. Political observers believe that the government's six basic policies and their specific measures are nothing new and are merely stale clichés. Whether Prime Minister Yoshida and his cabinet members can maintain their current position depends entirely on the support and unity of the government parties. The Socialist Party has been ambiguous in the past due to complex internal circumstances, but its recent actions prove that the party has made significant progress. The government believes that although the new constitution was promulgated on November 3, it will not take effect until six months later, and a large number of proposals related to the implementation of the constitution will be submitted to the extraordinary and ordinary sessions of the Diet for discussion. Therefore, the government believes that hastily dissolving the Diet would inevitably lead to a political disconnection of one or two months and prevent the constitution from being implemented. For this reason, although the opposition parties have fiercely criticized it, the government's attitude has always been firm and has not shown any signs of wavering.

### Siamese Air Force Conspires to Stage Coup; Plot Exposed, 20 Officers Arrested

[Associated Press, Bangkok, 21st Dispatch] The police department announced today that the Siamese Air Force's conspiracy to stage a coup has been exposed and twenty air force officers have been arrested. It is claimed that the officers planned to launch the coup at midnight on Sunday, detaining Prime Minister Khuang Aphaiwong and other cabinet members, but senior officers did not participate in the conspiracy. Troops have been stationed at key points in the capital for several days.

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 22nd Broadcast: President Truman ended his vacation today and is scheduled to fly back to Washington tomorrow to personally handle the labor dispute.

[Associated Press, New York, 21st Dispatch] The US coal miners' general strike has begun today, affecting only a small number of non-union coal mines. Government lawyers have drafted a contempt of court lawsuit accusing Miners Union President Lewis of failing to prevent the strike of 400,000 miners. Coal mines in various states have reported that they have completely stopped striking. Bituminous coal mines in various states normally produce 2.2 million tons of coal per day, but today they have obviously all stopped production, and there is no hope for tomorrow either.

#### 400,000 Miners Now Staying at Home

The American flag is hanging in various state mines, waving in the wind, symbolizing that the federal government has taken over, but no accidents have occurred. The strike has even affected the anthracite coal mines in Pennsylvania, where 7,500 workers in eight major coal mines have also gone on strike. This major strike poses a significant threat to the US economy. Bituminous coal supplies 95% of the locomotive power, 55% of the industrial power, and 62% of the power generation nationwide. If the strike lasts for a long time, it will leave about 25 million workers unemployed, as the lack of coal is enough to force factories across the country to close. The industrial magazine "Iron Age" stated that the strike will force the steel industry to reduce production to 80%, compared to 91.5% last week. The lack of steel will cause thousands of manufacturing plants to close. Republic Steel announced today that it will reduce production to 65%, which is equivalent to a monthly reduction of 150,000 tons of steel production.

[Reuters, New York, 22nd Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon, almost all of the bituminous coal miners in the coal-producing areas of five US states went on strike. 102,000 bituminous coal miners in West Virginia, the largest coal-producing state in the United States, 100,000 bituminous coal miners in Pennsylvania, and the coal miners in Ohio, Illinois, and Maryland have all gone on strike. Judging from the reports from mines across the country, almost all of the 400,000 workers have gone on strike. US authorities believe that the coal mine strike will have an impact on US inland transportation and will be a major blow to the world's food situation.

#### US Dockworkers Still Unable to Return to Work

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 21st Dispatch] Although the strike issue of the dockworkers belonging to the Congress of Industrial Organizations has been resolved, they were still unable to return to work at the docks today because the captains, mates, and pilots unions belonging to the American Federation of Labor advocated extending the strike and deployed pickets at the docks to prevent the dockworkers from returning to work. The union will vote on the terms of the contract negotiated with the Pacific American Shipowners Association in the next two days. Before the terms of the contract between the captains, mates, and pilots unions and the shipowners are resolved, the Pacific coast will remain closed. Even if the terms of the contract are passed by the union, shipping is unlikely to return to normal before next Monday.

### Truman Takes Vacation; Underwater Exploration

[Associated Press, Key West, Florida, 21st Dispatch] President Truman is currently on vacation here. Today, he took a captured German submarine and descended to 440 feet below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico. He enjoyed the four-hour submarine trip very much. He once made an underwater excursion, which lasted 44 minutes. The President also watched a destroyer fire at a target 2,000 yards away on the surface and observed the explosion of depth charges and felt the vibrations. The submarine is a snorkel type, equipped with a respirator, which can be extended out of the water like a periscope while the hull remains underwater. There are convection boilers in the submarine, and the device simultaneously intakes water and exhausts steam for the engine, allowing the submarine to remain underwater for a long time in preparation for an attack. One of these submarines is being improved by the US Navy Department.

### Rampant Corruption in Romanian Elections; U.S. and Britain Refuse to Recognize as Legitimate

[Our Dispatch] London, 22nd: Broadcast reports that a British Foreign Office spokesperson stated that the British government is currently considering its policy towards Romania. The spokesperson declared that the British government would never recognize the recent Romanian elections as legitimate.

### Our Nation's Young Musicians to Perform Piano in the United States

Fundraising to Support Chinese Music Students Studying in the U.S.

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 22nd] Three Chinese children diligently practiced piano during the Japanese occupation and gave a stunning public performance on Victory Day, December 12th of last year, receiving high praise. They arrived in the U.S. on the General Buckner, expected to arrive here today, and will perform for President Truman during Christmas, before touring and performing in various locations. The three children are George Wei (8 years old), and his two older sisters, Madeline (10 years old) and Sophie (12 years old), accompanied by Captain Littell, station director of the American Forces XMHA radio station in Shanghai. The event is being managed by the Chinese Children's Welfare Association to raise funds to support Chinese students with musical talent to study in the United States.

### 800-Year-Old Giant Python; Fears No Tanks; Amazing Story from the Yunnan-Burma Road

[Reuters, Singapore, 22nd] Local Chinese newspapers are the first to report the astonishing story of a truck convoy encountering a giant python on the Yunnan-Burma Road. It is said that a military truck loaded with supplies was traveling from Burma to Yunnan when the driver suddenly felt the vehicle was blocked by something. Upon investigation, he saw a giant python lying across the road, with its body half-buried in the mud. It was so long that its head and tail were not visible. By this time, the entire truck convoy had arrived, and everyone got out of their vehicles. A 17-ton tank was used to drive over the python, but the python was seemingly unaffected, only slightly moving. Several young American officers, driven by curiosity, proceeded along the python's body to search for its head. After walking several hundred steps into the forest, they finally saw an enormous head resting on a rock, seemingly napping. One officer climbed a tree, intending to shoot it with his modern automatic rifle, but at that moment, the python woke up and raised its head directly to within a few yards of the tree. The officer, terrified, fell into the python's mouth and disappeared. After receiving the news, the U.S. military command sent bombers to drop over a dozen bombs on the python, finally killing it. After skinning it, over a dozen helmets, pistols, and rifles were found inside its stomach. Zoologists estimated that the python was over 800 years old.

(Editor's Note: This story was already circulating in Yunnan before the victory of the war of resistance.)

Perhaps your family lacks a "set of mahjong tiles," you may want to wait, it may float over from the Pacific. There are mahjong tiles, ping-pong, chess pieces, and other sports equipment worth a total of US$185,100.

Regarding military supplies, there are 100,000 detonators, fuses, and shrapnel, etc. Yang is very worried about these things, saying, "If they are not carefully guarded, it will easily cause trouble."

Other items include laundry soap, alkali, mosquito nets, fire hoses, life buoys, fishing weights, medical supplies, surgical gowns for surgeons, and food such as coffee, beans, etc., which are too numerous to list.

### UNRRA Staff Suspected of Smuggling; Not Detained; Leaves Shanghai for Philippines

[Our Dispatch] UNRRA Western staff member O'Keefe, was suspected of smuggling earlier this month and was escorted to the District Procuratorate by the police. The District Court, due to the Basic Agreement signed between our country and UNRRA, which stipulates separate regulations for crimes committed by UNRRA staff, requested an interpretation from the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The Ministry of Judicial Administration instructed that UNRRA staff crimes, except for those arising from official duties, are not exempt from extraterritoriality, as was published in this newspaper yesterday. O'Keefe's whereabouts have increasingly attracted attention. According to UNRRA sources, O'Keefe is now in Manila, and he was never detained by our country's authorities before leaving Shanghai.

O'Keefe submitted his resignation to UNRRA a few days before the news of smuggling broke. UNRRA had been investigating the case for some time, and after obtaining substantial evidence related to the case, they notified the Jianghai Customs and our country's police agencies. UNRRA, because our side did not detain O'Keefe, convened a meeting of O'Keefe's crew members and customs representatives, ordering O'Keefe to attend, and requiring O'Keefe to report to the UNRRA office twice a day, reporting on the progress of the case. At that time, UNRRA believed that our country's law only imposed fines for smuggling, so they did not detain him. Unexpectedly, although O'Keefe initially reported as ordered for a few days, he eventually secretly left his residence and arrived in Manila via Hong Kong. UNRRA stated that the organization attaches great importance to this matter, and whenever staff members engage in illegal activities, the organization immediately notifies the customs and police. The organization currently has over thirty inspectors, whose specific responsibility is to investigate such violations of Chinese laws and regulations, and immediately notify the relevant authorities in this city of all cases.

In addition, the facilities and conditions of the provincial, city, and county governments and their affiliated agencies, the main products and output, general wages and prices, the religious beliefs of the people, the economic situation, the birth and death rates, and the deeds of loyalty and martyrdom of the people are also included in the committee's investigation, and records should be made and classified by month for future reference.

From today, the operations of the existing Municipal Gazetteer Office will be merged into the committee. The director of the Gazetteer Office will submit a list of experts and heads of relevant agencies and schools for approval, so that they can be appointed as members of the Municipal Literature Committee.

### Inside Story of the Barber Industry Labor Strike; Labor Side Uses "Sacrifice Play"; Four Defendants Detained

[Our Dispatch] During the labor-management dispute in the barber industry in this city on June 1st of this year, labor representative Dai Xingqing was stabbed, and another worker, Zhao Guiliang, disappeared. At that time, barbers throughout the city were enraged, suspecting that the management had kidnapped Zhao Guiliang and assassinated Dai Xingqing, which made the labor strike even more serious. Later, the management discovered the inside story: Dai Xingqing's injury was actually a "sacrifice play" perpetrated by Gong Wenke, and Zhao Guiliang was instigated to leave by Gao Deyu. The four were suspected of using a scheme to incite the labor strike. Fan Jinggao, Sun Yuming, and Chen Yuanfu filed a lawsuit with the District Court. Yesterday, the District Court held a trial.

### North Station Master Catches Thief Empty-Handed; All Stolen Goods Recovered

[Our Dispatch] Tong Shida, the station master of the North Station, lives at No. 108, Renji Road. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, four thieves, all armed, suddenly broke into his home, forcing the servants and other people to hand over the house hold and valuables. Items stolen included gold lockets, gold chicken hearts, women's watches, and embedded rings. While the robbery was taking place, a Russian, Yapu , who lived on the third floor, had just returned from the horse race. Seeing people standing at the front door, he walked into the second floor and saw two robbers standing next to the staircase, blocking his way and threatening him with guns. The Russian did not yield and argued with the robbers. At that time, one of the robbers who was searching for treasure and heard the commotion hurriedly took the stolen money and fled downstairs. The victim, Tong Shida, also followed and shouted loudly. Together with the Russian, they arrested one of the thieves carrying the stolen goods and found a Mauser pistol. At the same time, the branch in charge had also received a report and sent a large number of police officers to the scene. As a result, the other three robbers were eventually captured. The arrested robber was taken to the bureau for interrogation, and all the original stolen goods were recovered and returned to the original owner.

### Hollywood Filmmakers Intend to Set Up a Factory in Shanghai; Locally Dubbing National Sound and Improving Chinese Subtitles

[Our Dispatch] According to Mr. Liang Qitian, chairman of the Shanghai Cinema Business Association, Hollywood filmmakers intend to set up a factory in Shanghai to engage in dubbing Hollywood films with Chinese dialogue and working on Chinese subtitles. American filmmakers attach great importance to the foreign market and have two methods to promote the foreign market. One is to promote 16mm films, because this type of film is light in cost and weight, can be mailed, and is not afraid of fire, making it easy to screen in small cities. The second is to add dialogue in Chinese language to obtain a large audience that does not understand English dialogue.

Many Hollywood films have added Chinese subtitles, but Chinese people working in Hollywood are not familiar with the domestic situation, so they cannot fully meet domestic needs. For example, "Taylor Bowell" is a big star well known to Shanghai people, but if she is translated into the four characters "Tailun Baoer", no one will know. In the past, companies have spent a lot of publicity expenses in the mountains. To prevent this batch of publicity expenses from being wasted, it is necessary to set up a factory in China. As for Chinese dialogue and Chinese explanations, they should also be adapted to the habits of the Chinese people so as not to cause jokes.

"Tarzan Goes to New York" is the first film to add Chinese explanations. This film is mostly action and less plot. MGM will select a film that focuses on the plot and add Chinese explanations to see its effect. The effect of "Tarzan Goes to New York" is worse because many Shanghai audiences understand English. In inland cities, American films with Chinese dialogue will be welcomed. The future trend may be to show two copies of the film in Shanghai at the same time, one with all Chinese dialogue and one with all English dialogue. In inland cities, the former will be shown.

Mr. Liang also told reporters that the number of moviegoers in this city has increased compared to before the war. At the same time, analyzing the identity of the audience, we can see that the income of the lower-class people in this city has increased compared to before the war, so they have the surplus funds to go to the movies. As for domestic films, they have a great future, but each film company needs to have a plan and produce more. Otherwise, it will be very difficult for cinema owners to schedule films if they make only one film every six months or a year.

### Shipping Industry Relief Transport Consortium Signs Charter Contract Last Night

The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), in order to complete its relief program, has chartered various ships to the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) on a bareboat basis. Its main task is to undertake the emergency transportation of relief materials, displaced people, and relief personnel. For this reason, the shipping industry has specially organized the Small National Shipping Industry Relief Transport Consortium to gather all equipment and strength to jointly bear the operation of CRRRA's ships.

### Industrial Power Supply Improves, Yarn Mill Production Gradually Increases

[Our newspaper] Thanks to the city's residents' voluntary electricity conservation and the slight increase in the power generation of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, the city's industrial power supply has greatly improved. The power supply for yarn mills is quite sufficient. At present, each yarn mill operates at least five day shifts and seven night shifts per week, and the most operate six day shifts and seven night shifts. The power consumption time is exactly the same as before the war.

In the past, yarn mills were divided into groups for power outages every day. The first group was from 5:00 to 8:00 p.m.; the second group was from 5:00 to 9:00 p.m.; and the third group was from 6:00 to 10:00 p.m. Since the 25th of this month, there has been a slight change. The first group is from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m., the second group is from 5:00 to 8:00 p.m., and the third group is from 6:00 to 9:00 p.m. After this adjustment, two-thirds of the city's yarn mills can increase their working hours by one hour per day, which can slightly help production.

### A Group of Water Rats on a Grand Parade on Land

[Our newspaper] At 10 a.m. this morning, the police局警察局will have another "豪举豪举" to cause a sensation among the citizens of Shanghai.

The style of theft has always been prevalent in Shanghai, and as a result, the police局警察局launched a grand parade of thieves; some time ago, everyone said that the public order on the water was really too bad, and the "water rats" stealing goods had long been well known, so today there are one hundred and several tens of "water rats", under the strict supervision of detectives, parading again, and being sent to the District Prosecutor's Office in a mighty manner.

It is said that among these one hundred and more prisoners, four headmen are particularly skilled and can steal two bags of white sugar, lurking in the water, and then seize the opportunity to escape. Often, the formalities for customs clearance of goods have not yet been completed, and the market is already selling them, which is the trick played by these "water rats". As for stealing warehouses and receiving stolen goods, there are even more tricks and wonders.

It is not easy for detectives to arrest "water rats" because they are really proficient in swimming. So, if the detectives are not careful, they will often be dragged to the bottom of the water with their guns. This time, more than one hundred were captured, which is really the result of painstaking efforts for more than a dozen days.

Today's parade will pass through Fuzhou Road, Racecourse Road, Luzon Road, Central Lin Sen Road, and Sinan Road, all the way to the District Prosecutor's Office. At 4:00 p.m., the police局警察局will also entertain reporters to report on the activities of the "water rats". At the same time, the Water Police局警察局has now obtained two patrol boats, one of which began patrolling the Huangpu River early yesterday morning; the other is still being repaired. The Water Police局警察局will also organize the Water Voluntary Police Corps, with the participation of President, Weili Han and other shipping companies. The number of team members has exceeded 300, and it can be officially established in the middle of next month. Obviously, the "water rats" are facing their doomsday.

[Another news] The Huangpu Police Branch Bureau was ordered to eliminate wharf thieves. Director Du ordered staff members Yang Jixing, Zhu Debiao, and police chief Sun Shuzhang to arrest them day and night. At the wharves of Xinkaihe, Taikoo, Xinguang, Beijing Road, etc., a total of 17 thieves, including Chen Amao and Chen Caibao, were arrested. They are all wanted criminals. After interrogation and verification, the General Bureau ordered them to be sent to the Criminal Police Department of the General Bureau before 9:00 a.m. this morning, assembled in a team to parade through the streets to show the public, and sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution according to law.

### Social Services; Reader Consultation

Medical and Health

(1) Stubborn Stomach and Intestinal Ailments

Xu Jingsheng asks: I suffered from gastrointestinal disease at the age of 21. After an X-ray examination, it was diagnosed as duodenitis and chronic appendicitis. After taking medicine for two years, I gradually recovered. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), when the War of Resistance broke out, I moved around constantly and lived an unstable life, which caused the old illness to recur. Although I recovered after taking medicine, it still recurred from time to time. In the autumn of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), it relapsed and has lasted for almost two years, without being completely cured. In the past month, the number of times it has occurred has increased. I feel tired, and my chest feels stuffy, making it difficult to stand up straight. Bending over slightly provides some relief. When it hurts, pressing it with my hand alleviates the pain slightly, but my stomach is constantly gurgling, which is even worse when pressed. I have no appetite and often feel nauseous. I only feel slightly relieved after vomiting all the sour water and accumulated material in my stomach. As a result, my body is becoming thinner day by day. Please advise me on a treatment method so that I can get rid of the pain as soon as possible. I will be eternally grateful. (1) Is it better to eat rice porridge or cooked noodles? (2) Are there any special medicines on the market? What medicine can I take to eradicate the disease completely? (3) Is there any way to remedy my weight loss? (4) Will it cause other diseases?

[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Medical Doctor] (1) Noodles are more suitable. (2) There is no special medicine, but it is still advisable to inject Larostidin. If used in conjunction with large doses of vitamins, it will be more effective. (3) Focus on increasing nutrition and supplement with medication. (4) It may cause systemic weakness.

(2) Deficient and Weak Body

Liu Suying asks: I am a married woman. I have several medical questions. I hope your column can answer them. (1) My period has not come for three or four months. Am I pregnant, or is it due to illness? (2) My mother is 45 years old and has a weak body (she raised six younger siblings). She is mentally listless and has a poor appetite. What is her ailment? (3) My mother is easily annoyed, irritable, and fatigued. She often has chest tightness and lower abdominal pain. What is the reason? (4) Are Vitamins B and C suitable for general deficiency? Do they affect pregnant women? (5) Are the ingredients of the multivitamins sold on the market reliable? Are they effective? (6) Which is better, Squibb cod liver oil capsules or Scott's cod liver oil?

[Answer from Dr. Tang Renjin, Medical Doctor] (1) Please consult an obstetrician to examine the uterus to determine this. (2) She may have parasites. A stool examination should be performed first. (3) This is a menopausal phenomenon. (4) Not necessarily. They are beneficial to pregnant women (especially Vitamin B1). (5) The ingredients are generally reliable. If used properly, they are all effective. (6) Each has its own advantages, but the latter contains more calcium.

### Reasons for Soaring Gold Prices; Central Bank Releases 200 Bars; US Dollars Peak at 4,800 Yuan; Many Unsettled Import Goods

[Our Report] Gold prices continue to rise, reaching a peak of over 2,630,000 yuan yesterday. When inquiring with relevant parties, they stated that the reasons can be summarized as follows: (1) There is an abundance of floating capital, which is not daring to invest in the production industry due to inflation, and high-interest loans are full of risk. Therefore, buying gold is the only way to preserve value; (2) Currently, some high-interest loans use collateral, but the interest rates are low compared to buying gold. The profits are not that high, and safety and convenience are not as good. Therefore, they abandon lending and buy gold; (3) Among the major cities in the country, Shanghai's gold prices are lower. Therefore, some floating capital is concentrated in this city to buy gold. Some people also use this as a business, buying gold in Shanghai and transporting it to other ports to sell. The risk is small, and it is very convenient; (4) A portion of the wealthy class is buying large amounts of gold. They believe that among various commodities, gold prices have increased less, and will inevitably rise sharply in the future. As for the rise in US dollars, it is not as fierce as gold because speculators are deeply afraid that the government may prohibit US dollars from circulating in our country in the future. Therefore, they do not dare to buy them in large quantities.

In other news, the black market for US dollars remains firm. The reason is that although the government has promulgated measures to strengthen the control of import trade and strictly prohibits the import of foreign goods that have not been approved, there are still many foreign goods in this city that have been imported but not settled. In fact, it is still difficult to completely eliminate smuggled goods. Therefore, merchants still have a strong need for black market US dollars, so the market price remains extremely firm in secret.

Yesterday, buyers frequently stirred, and the central bank fully responded. It opened at 2,588,000 yuan and was forced to retreat to 2,570,000 yuan. But the market was bullish, and there was a turnaround. People rushed to buy again, and it soon rose back to 2,615,000 yuan.

### Remaining Yarn Freed for Distribution; Limited to Members of the Yarn Traders Association; Textile Construction Announces Restrictions

[Our Report] Mayor Wu summoned Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, Tang Zhiliang, Chairman of the Yarn Traders Association, Zhou Jiasheng, Standing Director, and Shen Boqin yesterday afternoon. Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Department of the Textile Control Committee, also participated. Mayor Wu proposed to amend the Textile Control Committee's decision to allocate the remaining cotton yarn to the Yarn Traders Association, as requested by the Cotton Spinning Association, and requested that it be freely sold by each yarn factory. After research, it was finally decided that the remaining cotton yarn could be freely distributed by each yarn factory to its existing customers, but the customers should be limited to members of the Yarn Traders Association. The discussion adjourned at approximately 5 PM.

China Textile Construction Public Company sold a total of 1,251 pieces of various yarns yesterday. 185 pieces of 10-count Limatong yarn, 1,530,000 yuan per piece. 249 pieces of 16-count Fengnian grass package, 1,620,000 yuan per piece. 8 pieces of 16-count Jifeng grass package, the same price as 16-count Fengnian. 533 pieces of 20-count Lima large package, 5,330,000 yuan per piece. 276 pieces of 32-count Xiantao tube, 2,320,000 yuan per piece.

It is heard that a total of 639 yarn merchants requested to purchase yarn yesterday. The Textile Construction Company specifically revealed two points: (1) Merchants who have withdrawn from the association will have their allocations stopped. (2) Merchants who have ceased operations must not request purchases under false pretenses. If any fraud is discovered, it will be immediately reported for investigation. However, according to news from the Yarn Traders Association, a considerable number of non-members also requested to purchase yarn from the Textile Construction Company yesterday.

Yesterday, the yarn market was dull in both the open and underground markets. Although yarn merchants entered the market as usual, they only sat and chatted and did not discuss transactions at all. The fact that yarn merchants, who had been looking forward to the Textile Control Committee's allocation for four months, were able to resume applying for purchases yesterday, even though the amount allocated to each family was extremely limited, was a stimulant for people in the industry. In addition, the Yong'an Yarn Factory released 150 pieces, half of which were sold to long-term customers, and half of which were intended to be sold to the industry in general through the Yarn Merchants Association. However, when this method was decided, the market had already dispersed, so it was temporarily reserved. As for the outside black market, because the Textile Control Committee's allocation was imminent, the asking price was slightly weak, 4 million yuan for 42-count Blue Phoenix and 2.3 million yuan for 20-count Single Horse. The cotton cloth market saw lively trading as merchants from Tianjin and Hankou continued to favor it at lower prices. Asking prices were firm and flat. Dyeing factories in this city were adding more orders for greige fabric, and various types of goods were hovering in a firm and quiet state. The opening price for Longtou fine cloth was shouted at 92,250 yuan, and serge and tribute silk were also popular.

### Rayon Continues to Arrive; Cost of Import is 500,000

### Government Bond Market Hovering

The trading volume of government bonds suddenly became scarce, and the market was hovering. The price difference between the various bonds narrowed. Tong Bing opened at 1,380 yuan in the morning, with the high price being no more than 1,390 yuan. It fell to 1,280 yuan midway, and finally hovered between 1,320 yuan and 1,350 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 3 million yuan. As a result, Jia and Yi were flat compared to the previous close, while Bing, Ding, and Wu each fell by 50 yuan.

### Rice Prices Hovering; Coarse Grains Generally Flat and Weak

Yesterday, over 12,000 shi of rice and grain arrived at the North and South markets. Because the weather turned overcast, the market became more bullish, and trading volume increased. Northern and Southern japonica rice rose uniformly by 300 to 1,000 yuan. It fluctuated and temporarily entered a hovering state. Indica rice also rose smartly, and white yuan was firm. Yin yuan was actively transacted, and the price rose by over 1,000 yuan. Soybeans were still lackluster, showing a dull and weak state. Mung beans were mediocre. The arrival and sales of wheat were both slow, without gain or loss. Flour sales remained sluggish, and factories continued to supply it as usual. Miscellaneous brands of flour were unpopular. As for bean cakes, Taiwan and Fujian had shipments coming in, but Shanghai factories and oil factories in Changzhou, Wuxi, and the mainland were all selling. The market price was still fair, but fresh ones were slightly higher by 100 yuan. Sesame sales turned weak, falling by 1,000 yuan. Peanut kernels had no major transactions in both the local market and other ports, and remained in a weak state. Medium and lower grades fell slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, while high-quality goods were still stable. Red sorghum had no demand from distilleries, falling by 100 to 200 yuan. The oil market had few buyers and sellers. Various factories allocated a total of 500 dan of oil. The market price remained the same, with raw oil being nominally stable but actually firm.

### Meeting to Improve the Silk Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang; Requesting Investigation of Autumn Cocoon Costs and Purchase at Market Price

Regarding the improvement of the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, a meeting was previously convened by Zhang Daohong, representative of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Attendees included representatives from the construction departments of the two provinces, responsible persons from the China Silk Corporation, and Chu Furen and Leng Jun from the Third District Silk Reeling Association. The meeting lasted for three days. The resolutions passed are recorded as follows: (1) Please request the Raw Silk Purchase Committee to investigate the actual cost of autumn cocoons and request that national banks and bureaus purchase them at cost to protect silk merchants. The cost per dan is as follows: (A) Cocoon cost: 4,375,000 yuan; (B) Silk reeling: 1,440,000 yuan; (C) Interest: 581,500 yuan; Total: 6,396,500 yuan. That is, each dan of autumn silk must be sold for 6.4 million yuan to avoid losses; (2) It is proposed to organize a national silk industry loss investigation committee during the War of Resistance to compile a statistical report to provide to the Central Wartime Compensation Committee as a basis for negotiating compensation for losses; (3) The original silkworm seed is insufficient by about 4,000 sheets. Please request the China Silk Corporation to find ways to supplement it. The use of local varieties should be reduced through political and economic means. Local silk should have the same obligations as improved cocoons to bear the ancestral seed price subsidy fee and improvement fee.

### Silk Weaving Industry Loans; Conditions Readjusted; Raw Materials and Finished Products All Changed to 50%

The Shanghai Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Association applied for a loan, which was previously approved by the Four Banks Joint Treasury. The principle was to use 70% of raw materials or 30% of finished products as collateral. Members of the association had few raw materials on hand, and if they were used as collateral, they would not have enough working capital. They once requested the Central Bank to use machinery as collateral, but this was not approved. The association recently convened a general meeting of members to discuss countermeasures and prepared a written request, detailing their difficulties. With the efforts of Zhu Tongjiu, Deputy Director of the Audit Department of the Bank of Communications, and with President Bei Zuyi's consideration of the merchants' difficulties, the original decision was readjusted. Yesterday morning, a compromise solution was decided: raw materials and finished products would all be changed to 50%. First, the finished products would be delivered to the warehouses of various banks. The lending bank would issue a check with the payee's name to purchase raw materials, and then half of the raw materials would be delivered to the lending bank as collateral. The other half would be exchanged for the collateralized portion after the finished products were manufactured. All other principles would remain the same. The association was satisfied with this news, and yesterday afternoon, various associations rushed to complete the loan application procedures. It is expected that this morning, they can be submitted to the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications for processing. For factories with less than 10 machines, the Central Bank has sent a letter to the silver and money industry and the industrial and commercial banking group to start this Monday. The association currently has a total of 375 member units, with no more than half of the members owning more than 10 machines. Based on the calculation of the number of machines in operation, the total amount is approximately 15 billion yuan.

### Yarn Industry Association; Member Survey; Total of 500 Companies

[Our Report] According to a recent member survey report by the Yarn Traders Association: the association had a total of 636 members in the past. The current survey shows that there are only 613 companies. Of these, 83 have already ceased operations. There are currently 530 members who are officially operating.

### Rayon; Directly Distributed to Manufacturers; Notification to Apply Yesterday

The China Trust Bureau decided to allocate rayon to the knitting, dyeing, and weaving industries separately due to the rising black market price of rayon and the silk merchants' excuse of demand from the knitting, dyeing, and weaving industries. It notified the respective industry associations yesterday to handle the application matters and issued investigation forms to be filled out. Once the procedures are completed, it can be implemented. The China Trust Bureau's original plan to allocate rayon to rayon merchants has now decided to directly allocate it to manufacturing companies. However, if necessary in the future, it will be reconsidered. The bureau's eleventh allocation of rayon to applicants from the electrical silk weaving industry resulted in a total allocation of 347 boxes and 15 packages of grade 120 high and small.

### Unauthorized Transport of Cotton Yarn Detained; Authorities Dispatch Personnel to Conduct Strict Investigations Separately

In order to prevent unregistered cotton yarn from being transported and sold to other ports without authorization, the authorities dispatched a large number of people to guard the North Railway Station, wharves, and major thoroughfares yesterday to intercept cotton yarn transported to other ports. If manufacturers forcibly attempt to transport unregistered cotton yarn to other ports, it will be detained. As a result, many yarn transports were blocked at the railway station and wharves yesterday. It is heard that this matter will be handled by the municipal government and the Textile Control Committee.

### There are No Restrictions on Transporting Silver Coins Domestically; Large Amounts of Copper Coins Should Be Purchased

The Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Central Bank, stating that Article 4 of the Measures to Prevent Smuggling and Carrying Gold and Silver Out of the Country stipulates that the domestic transport of silver coins, which are not for export, is exempt from restrictions on area and quantity and the need to apply for passports. In addition, Article 7 of the Measures for Converting Silver Coins and Silver into Legal Tender stipulates that there should be no price difference between silver coins and silver and legal tender. Violators will have their property confiscated. Those who intend to evade the law and exchange silver coins and silver at high prices, thus violating other laws, will be punished according to the regulations. Therefore, silver coins and silver can be transported freely domestically, but they must not be sold at a price difference. As for copper coins carried in large quantities, they should be confiscated and sent to your bank for purchase in accordance with the regulations. The bank has notified all branches to comply.

### Wood's Strong Competitors: 1. Kerosene…2. Coal Balls

[Our Report] The sources of firewood in this city are both water and land routes. The water route comes from Wenzhou, and the land route comes from Hangzhou. Among the two, the water route is the main source. The sales market is limited to Shanghai, and there are more than 60 businesses engaged in this industry. The firewood industry is currently quite depressed because wealthy families mostly use kerosene, and modern families mostly use coal balls. Only poor families use firewood.

### Import Industry to Discuss Quota Allocation Methods Today

The import and export industry associations will discuss this issue again today and invite Chen Changtong, Director of the Secretariat of the Executive Committee, to attend the meeting to explain and clarify the actual situation.

### American Wheat Reaches New High Price

[United Press Chicago, 21st] Wheat futures rose another two cents today, reaching a new price in 26 years. The January contract closed at $2.155, the highest price since 1920.

### Erratum

In the "Revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade Attachment Table" published in this newspaper on the 18th, the tariff code number "644 (A), (B), and (C)" under the item of quota-allocated goods in Attachment Table (2) should be "644 (A), (C), and (D)." We hereby correct this.

### Merchants Bring Oil to Shanghai; Authorities are Willing to Provide Convenience; The Joint Allocation Office Allocated 900 Dan Yesterday

[Our Report] Yesterday, the trend of edible oil remained firm, and the market did not improve, with asking prices above the negotiated prices. The Social Affairs Bureau ordered the Miscellaneous Grain, Oil, and Cake Industry Association to temporarily suspend trading yesterday. However, yesterday, merchants went to great lengths to transport 400 dan of bean oil from North China and entrusted the Shanghai Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office to allocate and sell it to 200 edible oil retail stores in the Central District at the negotiated price. It is heard that Mayor Wu was very pleased that the merchants cooperated with the government to supply edible oil to the people and stabilize oil prices. He instructed Ji Mingzhai, Chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, to tell the merchants that the municipal government will provide special economic or administrative convenience to the merchants who supply edible oil to the people of this city, so that the merchants can continue to transport it.

In addition to accepting 400 dan of oil allocated by merchants, the Shanghai Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office continued to allocate 500 dan of oil from private factories yesterday and delivered it to the allocation office for distribution to 142 retail stores in the Central District. Therefore, the total number of edible oil retail stores in the Central District that have received allocated oil, including those who received it the day before, has reached 484. The quantity of oil allocated by various private factories yesterday was 80 dan of Dadexin rapeseed oil, 60 dan of Dayouyu soybean oil, 100 dan of rapeseed oil, 20 dan of Dasheng rapeseed oil, 100 dan of Dachangxin soybean oil, 65 dan of Changde soybean oil, 15 dan of Weimin soybean oil, and 60 dan of Shunyu soybean oil.

### Current Available Chips Scarce, Chinese Stock Market Quiet

The Chinese stock market yesterday experienced a severe shortage of available chips. Spot trading prices were more likely to rise than fall. Some short sellers were becoming long buyers, resulting in a more struggling market. Stocks opened high in the morning, but some trades did not occur. After the opening, prices dropped sharply as sellers competed. No. 176 strongly bought Shanghai Yong Knitting, while No. 152 bought Sino-French, creating a tight market. Prices rose again after the drop. At 11:25 AM, No. 126 and No. 10 sold a significant amount of remaining Shanghai Yong Knitting shares, causing all stocks to fall back to their lowest prices. However, from 11:45 AM onwards, Nos. 152, 180, 97, and 151, among others, jointly started buying, and gold notes also rose, causing prices to return to slightly above their morning highs. Near the close, there was turnover, but the closing prices had buyers. As a result, compared to the previous close, Shanghai Yong Knitting and American Asia fell by 3%, while Sino-French, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by 0.5% to 1%. Yonggong alone fell by more than 1%. Huafeng's fall was limited, while the cold stock Rongfeng remained stable. The rest fell slightly to a bit more than 1%. Deferred delivery stocks fell slightly to a bit more than 1%. In the afternoon, short sellers continued to exert pressure at high prices, causing prices to fall sharply. However, since available chips for spot trading were very scarce, there were many who covered their short positions at low prices, providing support for turnover. Trading was extremely quiet, even for Huafeng, which had gained popularity with deferred delivery trading the day before, and it became much more deserted. Cement prices fluctuated greatly due to a misunderstanding between No. 176 and a floor manager, resulting in a competitive spike: buying high and selling low, fluctuating by as much as ten dollars. As a result, compared to the previous close, Shanghai Yong Knitting and Huafeng experienced a slight decline, while American Asia, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by 3% to 0.5%. Sino-French fell slightly, while Yonggong alone fell by 1%. The cold stocks Rongfeng and Innerwear rose slightly, while An fell by a bit more than 1%. The rest experienced slight declines. Deferred delivery stocks Shanghai Yong Knitting, American Asia, Huafeng, and Sino-French fell slightly, while Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing fell by around 0.5%. Over-the-counter stocks experienced slight declines.

Foreign stocks again felt unsustainable. Except for Ewo Brewery and Paper Industry, which remained flat, the rest were all undersupplied. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yeguang fell by a bit more than 0.5%. Paper Industry and Ewo Brewery remained flat, while the rest experienced slight declines.

### Soviet Union Does Not Send Representatives to UNESCO Conference; American Newspapers Publish Editorials; General Assembly Discusses 1947 Budget

[United Press, Paris, 21st] The Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) today discussed the 1947 budget, totaling $7,565,000. Representatives from several countries delivered speeches, requesting priority for various projects. The largest item in the budget is private research grants, totaling $2,970,130. Professor research grants and subsidies totaled $1,252,870. In addition, the expenses of the Preparatory Committee are estimated at $950,000. The total expenses for this General Assembly are $8,515,000.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 21st Dispatch] The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization decided this morning to invite Sweden and Iceland to send representatives, and to invite Switzerland to send observers, to the organization's first General Assembly. However, the request of the Spanish Republican government in exile to send observers was rejected due to "legal difficulties."

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st] The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Conference continued its meeting. After a speech by Chinese representative Dr. Zhao Yuanren, Yugoslav observer Opu Sen Sky followed with a speech stating:

How to Guarantee Individual Cultures

Yugoslavia has not yet ratified the UNESCO Charter because the Charter does not provide any protection for those who oppose fascism and war promoters. Furthermore, although UNESCO now has a work plan, it does not provide sufficient guarantees for the preservation of the individual cultures of participating countries. If the above two matters can be guaranteed, then Yugoslavia can fully participate in UNESCO's activities without further expressing refusal. Since Yugoslavia issued this statement, political figures here have generally believed that the Soviet Union has also adopted a similar view and therefore refuses to participate in UNESCO.

An Empty Seat Awaits, but No One Arrives

[United Press, Paris, 21st] The Preparatory Conference of the United Nations Educational and Cultural Organization decided today to invite the Spanish Republican government in exile to send representatives to the meeting, which is tantamount to an indirect blow to Franco's rule in Spain. Polish representative proposed inviting the Spanish Republic as an observer, but the chairman of the conference, French representative Lu Bo, proposed a formal invitation, which was approved by a vote. Earlier, the Secretary-General of the General Assembly, British representative Huxley, reported that many of the decisions of the United Nations Educational and Cultural Organization cannot escape the opposing ideals centered on the Soviet Union and the United States. Therefore, the participation of the Soviet Union is extremely important. The clash of ideas is an inevitable fact in the current stage of history. Although the Executive Committee of the UNESCO Preparatory Committee has kept a seat vacant for the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has not arrived, nor has it sent observers. We are all saddened by this. If a powerful and culturally advanced country does not join as a member, then this organization cannot become truly global.

No Police, No Power, No Guarding

[United States Information Service, Washington, 21st] American newspapers and magazines have recently focused on the first General Assembly of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in Paris, and have published editorials and news reports on its activities. The New York Times stated today: "The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization faces a practical problem: how to win the Soviet Union's participation and cooperation. The American delegation is going to Paris to attend the meeting and has made some suggestions. These suggestions are not just empty talk. The suggestions actually start with repairing libraries, museums, laboratories, and schools; rewarding research in meteorology, navigation, international health, and infectious diseases; cooperating to remove elements that incite hatred from textbooks; assisting in the exchange of students, teachers, scholars, artists, scientists, government officials, and other personnel; and studying how to promote and improve the collection of intelligence, information, and culturally significant materials so that they can be exchanged internationally. It is not difficult for us to understand why the Soviets are hesitant. They do not want their people to be exposed to ideas that they consider unorthodox. However, if they participate in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as we hope, they will not be forced to accept these ideas. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has no police power and no intention of guarding. Its struggle against 'suspicion and distrust' relies on voluntary cooperation. Yesterday was a good start for this work. Lyon Blum has been elected as chairman. This shows that courage and vision have been recognized. The proposed budget figure of $9 million is far from the previous estimate of $1 billion to $2 billion. This shows that the organization has a sense of being realistic."

### Military Medical School's 44th Anniversary

[Our Report] Among the Chinese medical schools, three have the longest history: (1) Tianjin Medical School, founded in the seventh year of Guangxu. (2) Beiyang Military Medical School, founded in the twenty-eighth year of Guangxu. (3) Xiehe Medical School, founded in the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu. Among them, Xiehe and Military Medical School still enjoy a high reputation. Beiyang Military Medical School is the predecessor of the Army Military Medical School now restored in Shanghai.

To meet the needs of wartime troops, it has been shortened to six years. High school graduates are recommended by public and private secondary schools across the country, and take examinations in the recruitment areas of each province. After being admitted, they are first concentrated for six months of military training, with the treatment of first-class soldiers. After passing the examination, they are formally enrolled and assigned to the department they voluntarily study, enjoying the legal treatment of corporals. The medical and dental courses are five years, the pharmacy course is four years, and the internship is one year. During the internship, they receive the treatment of warrant officer medical officers. After passing the final graduation examination, they obtain the qualifications of first lieutenant medical officers, and then they are promoted according to their merits. President Chiang has now designated the new urban area of Shanghai, using the large hospital of the enemy army that can accommodate six to seven thousand beds as the school site. The original three military medical branch schools in the Northwest, Southwest, and Guangzhou have been merged into one place to form the center of China's military medical education and the general hub of national defense medical and pharmaceutical culture. It is reported that the school has now officially started classes. The 44th anniversary of the school will be on the 24th of this month, and a celebration meeting will be held.

[Our Report, Nanjing, 22nd] The national middle schools that have returned from the interior to the provinces and cities and handed over to the education departments of the provinces and cities have long been completed. Currently, only the Northeast Middle School is moving back to Shenyang and is still on its way. It will soon arrive in the Northeast to resume classes.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Regarding the restoration of national secondary schools, all students were previously required by the Ministry of Education to report to the education departments of their original hometowns and wait for assignment to schools. The Ministry is currently concerned that the current transportation is still smooth, and it is difficult for students to return to their hometowns on time. It recently ordered the education departments of all provinces and cities to accept returning students from national middle schools at any time and not to refuse to arrange them on the grounds of overdue registration. Even if the registration is too late, they must be given the opportunity to audit classes. They will be formally assigned to classes in the second semester. In addition, if these students were originally publicly funded, they will continue to enjoy publicly funded treatment.

### The Heavy Burden of the People of Henan and the Tragic Situation of Constant Attacks in Anyang

— By Our Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

20th [Day of the Month] Dispatch

Touring the Yellow Flood Area – Unable to Hold Back Tears

The main focus of how to save Henan from disaster lies in engineering technology, while neglecting politics. For example, blocking the breach of the Yellow River is a world-known issue, but the dark side of China’s engineering circles is not familiar to the general public. The new embankment at Huayuankou, originally scheduled to close before the flood season, was watched live as it was washed away.

An elegant intellectual accustomed to the life of Jiangnan, a liberal educated by the church, could not help but cry when he visited the Yellow Flood Area. He said to me, "The fact that the people in the disaster area still talk to you with smiling faces is the direct cause of my tears." This person is not fragile, but he saw that the life of the Chinese people today is "so that's how it is," and he saw a trace of a smile flashing on the faces of the disaster victims, as if he had explored the depths of their souls, and he was deeply moved. His tears may be said to be the hope of China.

After the relief sub-station's work team distributed flour to each household, the Baojia heads in some places would take it back and redistribute it to line their own pockets. This is an open secret. "We can't control this," the person in charge of the relief sub-station said helplessly.

The Huayuankou project is nominally a work-relief program, but in reality, it is conscripted labor. The headquarters stipulates that each worker receives one and a half pounds of flour per day. "They think the workers eat silver thread rolls. A worker on a construction site needs to eat two pounds of flour a day, and some even eat two and a half pounds," the field worker of the sub-station ridiculed this regulation. "However, it must be admitted that the United Relief Organization has indeed spent a lot of money here." The latest news is that the famous hydraulic engineer Savage may come to take a look.

The tractor training class of the Fan family in Weishi County is often troubled by the Communist army, and the detention of personnel or vehicles is a common occurrence.

Taking Fugou County as an example, the population before the war was more than 300,000, and now there are only 60,000 left. The past is gone, they have all sunk into the yellow sand, and among those who are left, more than 200 are blind. Because they lack business, what about those with good eyesight? Most of them still talk to you with smiling faces.

Classical Grandeur - An Unbearable Spiritual Burden

Running on the streets of Kaifeng, where the provincial government is located, a county-level official congratulated me that he had finally seen the provincial authorities today and could go back. Because running from a faraway county to the ancient Bianliang, making a trip, submitting a report, and waiting for half a month or twenty days without seeing anyone is a common occurrence. This is truly classical grandeur.

At No. 68 Madou Street, there are two plaques: one is the "Henan Yellow Flood Area Rehabilitation and Construction Association," and the other is the "Henan Yellow Flood Area Rehabilitation and Construction Guidance Committee," but there is no public office to handle affairs. The only person who is often there is a worker!

The classical grandeur has given the people of Henan a spiritual burden!

If the Internal Strife Does Not Stop, the People Will Have No Choice But to Hang Themselves

Henan has frightening apportionments. What I saw in Xinxiang and Anyang in northern Henan was simply a man-eating apportionment. Zhang Ji, the chief of staff of the 40th Army, who is from Henan, said to me earnestly, "The people of northern Henan are really suffering! You reporters should write about it!" If the internal strife does not stop and peace cannot be achieved, the people will have no choice but to hang themselves.

Any store or household can produce a large stack of notices for apportionments since the victory, for money, grain, grass, fodder, and firewood. All kinds of items are listed on it, a magnificent sight that dazzles the eyes. There are several apportionments a month, so there are several notices. Generally, they can be summarized into the following items:

The first is military supplies, including military grain, grass, and fodder. Each county has a supply branch, which is responsible for providing supplies locally, and these are all unpaid apportionments. Anyang apportioned 3,056,000 catties of wheat for the months of July, August, and September this year. It must be delivered within three days. According to the "old practice," merchants pay 30% and civilians pay 70%. The merchants pay 30% through the chamber of commerce, and the 70% is apportioned through the rural Baojia. In the meantime, there is suddenly an apportionment for military grain for a certain unit. As long as the temporary commander's office sends a telegram to the county, it is immediately apportioned. The apportionment of firewood, grain stalks, bran, and fodder has been apportioned to the seventh time by September, with each apportionment being 6,000,000 catties of firewood, 1,000,000 catties of grain stalks, 500,000 catties of bran, and 500,000 catties of fodder. This is also according to the "old practice." The Xinxiang County Chamber of Commerce recognized 20,000,000 yuan in shares in the county bank, and used this to offset the apportionment of firewood and grass. The office expenses of the supply branch are, of course, apportioned, and it is not surprising that tens of millions are apportioned in advance in order to save a sum of circulating funds. Even the food expenses of the personnel of the Military Mediation Department must be apportioned by Anyang. Because the transfer orders are not clear, and a small amount is missed, it is not surprising to replenish the various funds at any time. The military also looks at the construction of fortifications, and the requisition of people, money, and materials is also apportioned locally, and the apportionment items are even more difficult to estimate.

Apportionment Has Become a Trend - The Various Levels of Agencies Are Busy

The second is the various expenses of administrative agencies at all levels. When a Bao cannot pay the apportionment, the Bao head is detained by the county government or the town office, and the money spent is apportioned. The Baojia heads and staff are particularly busy attending meetings, listening to instructions, and supervising construction everywhere. The large expenses for transportation, meals, and lodging are also apportioned. There are more than a hundred county-level agencies in Anyang that have been displaced, and the townships and Baojia are ordered to provide furniture and run errands for them. The money spent is also apportioned. Improving the treatment of county-level civil servants is also an apportionment of several million yuan a month. The expenses of various county-level agencies are also an apportionment of tens of millions of yuan a month. The Baojia in the townships and towns entertain the people sent by various departments to urge payment, materials, and labor with meals and cigarettes. A Bao has to spend hundreds of thousands of yuan a month. In order to cope with the busy and tense apportionment official business, the Bao office needs seven or eight people, and the town office is like a county government, working overnight, with huge expenses. These people have only one word in their minds all day long: apportionment. As for the expenses of the Bao national school, it is naturally also apportioned, but the monthly amount is small, less than a few meals and cigarettes for those who urge payment and materials.

The third is the newspapers that must be read and the operas that must be watched. The newspaper fees and opera tickets are the regular expenses of the Xinxiang Chamber of Commerce. There are also consolatory funds for the soldiers, and the uniform expenses of the Qinyang Security Regiment are apportioned by the Xinxiang area, because that is an armed force that can fight. Building a beautiful auditorium in Xinxiang is an apportionment of tens of millions. The "donation" for a certain weekly publication or mutual aid society is also apportioned. Things like this have become a trend and cannot be stopped.

A household in Anyang has 40 mu of land, which, given the current situation, is a poor wretch, but should still be a small landlord. In September, the total apportionment was 29,073 yuan in cash; 104 catties of wheat; 44.6 catties of rice; 173 catties of firewood; 58 catties of bran; and 29 catties of grass. He told reporters that he wanted to escape, but there was nowhere to escape, and he would have to hang himself if it continued.

A small herbal medicine shop apportioned 969.5 catties of firewood, 493 catties of wheat; 161 catties of grain stalks; 80 catties of bran and 80 catties of fodder in the first half of September. This herbal medicine shop wanted to close down, but was afraid of losing his old signboard, so he would not be able to open for business in the future. This means: no closing.

The people say that this is the case everywhere in Henan. I have only seen Anyang and Xinxiang, and I don't hope that other places are like this. In any case, this is an iron fact that the people cannot bear. How can a county administrative agency become an apportionment agency in the midst of war?

### Guangdong Provincial and Municipal Governments Fight Over Business Tax Agencies

— By Our Special Correspondent Liang Feng

Guangzhou Air Dispatch, 15th [Day of the Month]

In Jiangnan, this should be the season when osmanthus blossoms are fragrant, but in Panyu, it is still as hot as late summer, so hot that it makes people feel bored and irritable. There has not been a drop of rain for more than a month, and the dust on the road flies up when cars pass by, making everything smoky.

Just like this situation, a rather comical thing has happened here recently, which is really laughable and ridiculous. I don’t know if the provincial government is short of funds and wants to rely on tax revenue to supplement it? Or if the municipal government sees that the provincial government can collect 3.6 billion yuan in business tax in the second half of the year, and the municipal government only gets half of it, and is a little envious? As a result, a funny scene of the provincial and municipal governments fighting over the business tax collection agency occurred.

The performance went like this: at 9:00 a.m. on the 6th of this month, the Guangzhou Municipal Temporary Council held its fifth resident committee meeting. After the director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, Chen Bingduo, gave a policy report, Councilor Zhang Xizhe asked whether the Municipal Business Tax Collection Office was subordinate to the provincial government or the municipal government. Director Chen replied solemnly that because the business tax is one of the local taxes, it should be merged into the tax bureau. The establishment of the Municipal Business Tax Office is actually an illegal organization. The municipal government has never recognized the existence of this agency, and the central government has not recognized it as legal either, but the provincial government established it regardless of the law!

As soon as this statement came out, people from all walks of life were surprised, because the Business Tax Office was officially established on September 1st, and it has been engaged in tax collection business for more than two months. Could it be an illegal organization? Then this joke is too big! Why didn't the municipal government make a public announcement or use administrative and judicial power to abolish or sue it? But why is the establishment of this agency by the provincial government criticized by the municipal government as an illegal organization? This makes people unable to doubt the subtlety of the relationship!

The reporter visited various places for this matter. According to the person in charge of the Provincial Department of Finance: "The business tax is a provincial tax and a tax for cities under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. This is clearly stipulated in Article 8 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law promulgated by the National Government on July 2, 1946. After searching all the laws promulgated, there is no regulation that prohibits the establishment of a special agency, so it cannot be said to be an illegal organization. According to Article 3 of the 'Measures for the Collection and Payment of National and Local Shared Taxes,' it also states that the business tax is collected by the central collection agency on behalf of or entrusted to the county (city bureau) for collection after being approved by the Executive Yuan. The so-called entrustment must be determined based on the necessity of the entrustment and whether the entrusted agency can bear the responsibility of handling it. The provincial government is the competent administrative agency of the local government and has the power to weigh the pros and cons. The business tax in this city has been approved by the provincial government and is collected by the Guangzhou Municipal Business Tax Collection Office, and it has been announced to the public. Before receiving a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, it was also in line with the general situation that in order to avoid the increasing burden of local taxation, the collection should be entrusted to county and city agencies. However, the provincial government believes that the amount of business tax in this city accounts for the majority of the entire province. In order to meet special needs and achieve results, it has again telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to approve that the Municipal Business Tax Office should still be responsible for the collection, and is now awaiting approval from the Ministry." In this way, since the business tax is stipulated as a provincial tax, the provincial government can establish an agency to handle it, and it can also be said that there is no regulation in the law that it is an illegal organization.

However, what did the municipal government tell us? According to the person in charge of the municipal government, "The municipal government wants to handle this matter with a peaceful attitude and does not want to say much, but only to implement administrative orders. However, Article 2 of the Business Tax Law stipulates that all business tax affairs originally handled by the central and provincial (including provincial-level cities) direct tax collection agencies should be transferred to the finance departments of each province and the tax collection agencies of each county and city (the rest omitted)... Therefore, it is also stipulated in this regulation that it should be handled by the tax bureaus of each county and city. In fact, the municipal government has repeatedly received telegrams from the Ministry of Finance, Jingdi Sanyang No. 4427, which roughly stated: 'In order to unify and enrich the county and city collection agencies, it is not necessary to set up another agency.' It also received telegrams from the Ministry of Finance, Caijing Zhi'er Shenxian No. 358, which roughly stated: 'The telegram orders the direct tax bureau to transfer the order to the Guangzhou branch to transfer it to your government for management according to regulations.' It also received two telegrams from the Guangdong Direct Tax Bureau, both stating that the transfer should be transferred to the Municipal Tax Collection Office for management. From the above telegrams, it is sufficient to prove that the Business Tax Office is not allowed to be established separately, and it is stipulated that it should be transferred to the Municipal Tax Collection Office for management." It seems that the reasons are very sufficient, otherwise how dare they offend their top superiors.

In order to seek details, the reporter went to the Guangzhou Direct Tax Bureau to inquire about the transfer process of the bureau. It was stated that: Regarding the transfer of business tax, the bureau had previously received an order from the Ministry to prepare to transfer the business tax to the Municipal Tax Collection Office in accordance with the "Measures for the Transfer of Land Tax, Deed Tax, and Business Tax to Local Management." Later, it received a letter from the provincial government stating that the Business Tax Collection Office had been established and requested to take over. At the same time, it also received a letter from the municipal government requesting the transfer of business tax. The bureau immediately submitted a request for instructions, and on September 26th, it received a reply from the Ministry of Finance No. 3395, stating that it should be transferred to the Municipal Tax Collection Office for management. The bureau was about to transfer it, but on September 28th, it received a telegram from the Provincial Government Shenjian Cai No. 6 Zi No. 22557 stating that the Business Tax Office had already been established, and detailed reasons were also submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Before receiving a reply, please postpone the transfer temporarily. The bureau again telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for instructions, and still received approval to transfer it to the Municipal Tax Collection Office according to the original plan. Later, it also received a letter from the Municipal Tax Collection Office stating that it had received an order from the provincial government to order the Business Tax Collection Office to be under the jurisdiction of the municipal government, please transfer it and send Secretary Chen Qinglong to the bureau to discuss the handover. At this point, the bureau officially transferred the business tax on October 5th.

Looking at the opinions expressed by the above parties, the provincial government holds the "laws," while the municipal government is righteously following the "orders of the Ministry." Each has its own reasons, which seems to have turned into a contradiction between "laws" and "orders of the Ministry."

Fortunately, this material dispute did not expand. This complex problem was finally reported yesterday (10th) that the Ministry of Finance telegraphed: "In order to unify the collection agencies of counties and cities and enable them to respond and go to work, the Ministry has separately planned and handled it as a whole. The business land deed tax in Guangzhou should be handled by the city's collection agency without setting up another agency. The proposed establishment of a special business office should be stopped." In this, we finally got a clear answer - the municipal government has won, but in the eyes of society and in the hearts of the citizens, it has left an impression of "it's too much of a joke!"

### Paris Prophet Old Tie Predicts Future Wars: The Third World War Will Break Out in Sixteen Years, Hoping to Obtain International Understanding and Provide Essential Capital to Eliminate [War]

Air Dispatch, 14th [Day of the Month] Our Special Paris Correspondent Wang Ren

Louis Marin, a member of the French lower house for a long time and now seventy-five years old, recently wrote a book entitled "The Security of France (La Securite de la France)," which states that the northeast of France is the only undefendable border (Frontiereouverte) that is not bordered by natural barriers. In the future, the border of France should be expanded eastward to reach the banks of the Rhine. This dispute, which has lasted for 1,100 years since 843 AD, has now been brought up again by Louis Marin and will definitely become one of the focal points of the debate at the General Assembly. Looking back on the past, the prosperity and decline of France and Germany have generally been cyclical. The Parisian youth prophet Old Tie (Ranyaud de la Ferriere) accurately predicts future events. During the European war, such as the Allied forces' attack on Europe in 1944 and President Roosevelt's ceasefire in 1945, he predicted them all. Recently, in September, the United States abolished price controls and had some internal difficulties, and in October, the frequent occurrence of aviation accidents. Old Tie had also spoken out in advance, and unfortunately, everything was as expected. Now, what makes his predictions attract the attention of the whole world is that 1955 will be one of the most prosperous years in Europe, and the next Third World War must begin in 1962. Knowing that disaster is inevitable, we always hope that human efforts can reverse the situation. The fundamental problem of preventing future disasters lies in being able to broaden the rule of benevolence, pacify the hearts of those who are against us, prevent the motives of discrimination among ethnic groups, and achieve international understanding. Perhaps the events of sixteen years later can be transformed from large to small and from small to nothing.

Commentary

### Qi Baishi's Position in the History of Painting and Calligraphy

— Yu Jianhua

Qi Baishi has undoubtedly occupied a place in the history of modern Chinese painting, but the height of this position cannot be determined now.

Su Dongpo wrote about Wu Daozi's paintings: "Those who know create things, those who are able describe them." Those who know are the sages with foresight, that is, the masters who can create their own school. They are also those who are not intimidated by power, not tempted by profit, do not care about gains and losses, do not care about praise and slander, go their own way, clarify their goals, hold on to their principles, do not cater to the times, do not follow the crowd, and fight for the truth throughout their lives, not stopping until they reach their goals, that is, revolutionary reformers. At the beginning of their creation, ridicule and attacks came one after another, society condemned them, the government oppressed them, and they were even thrown into prison, sentenced to death, and nailed to the cross. But when they succeed, they will influence the trend, create schools, and even be worshiped by the masses and admired by future generations. They become immortal figures of the ages.

Those who are able are those who are less capable than the creators, and can only learn from the creators, imitate the creators, inherit the creators, or get one of their aspects, or have a specific microcosm. Following Xiao Gui and Cao Sui, step by step, they are already very satisfied if they learn a few points. Being high-minded, they never dare to have the extravagant hope of surpassing their predecessors. They can only use "narrating but not creating" as a way to relieve themselves, and the spirit of "creating independently" is minimal.

In the late Qing Dynasty, the early Republic of China, and up to the present, in the school of freehand flower-and-bird painting, Wu Changshuo is naturally the "creator," and Wang Yiting and Qi Baishi cannot avoid being in the ranks of the "narrators," although Qi also has his unique style.

Su Dongpo said in Xun Qing's theory: "If his father kills someone for revenge, his son will surely rob." This also means that the creator, although a talented writer, inevitably has some biases. A kind of literary and artistic work that is too regular and orthodox is inevitably boring, so literary and artistic writers like to be unique and create their own banners, wanting to win by surprise. Moreover, there are few all-round talents in the world, and more biased talents. A person's bias is his strength. Developing his bias as much as possible is also developing his personality as much as possible, so he can rise as a dark horse and become his own master. This kind of biased place of literary and artistic artists is most obvious, forming a unique face, and one can know at a glance that it is the work of a certain person or school. However, at the beginning, the creator does not necessarily have the intention of creating a certain school, but only follows the proximity of his nature and the extent of his strength, and after years of research, he unknowingly evolves into a certain kind of face. For example, Shi Tao and Bada's early paintings were also very meticulous, Wu Changshuo's early paintings were also very elegant, and Qing Daoren's characters were not so tortuous "one wave three times" in his early years.

A person's bias, when viewed from the front, is his strength, but when viewed from the opposite side, it is precisely his weakness, so it is easy to have drawbacks. Bold brushwork is originally a strength, but it is easy to become domineering. Elegant brushwork is originally a strength, but it is easy to become weak. Therefore, the strong are straightforward first, the delicate are too trivial, the thick are turbid, the free and easy are frivolous, the gorgeous are vulgar, and the light are sparse. There is a benefit and a drawback. In the creator, there are originally more benefits than drawbacks, and the advantages can still cover up the shortcomings, which are not very obvious. However, when his descendants learn from him, they develop his bias as much as possible, extend it as much as possible, and intensify it, turning the bias into a habit and the strength into a fault. They follow each other and use it as a drawback, which is beyond the expectation of the creator.

The existence of Wu Changshuo in freehand flower-and-bird painting is beyond what the Yangzhou Eight Eccentrics could imagine. After Wu, Wang Yiting is not very different from Wu. As for Qi Baishi's pure use of carmine to write flowers and pure use of thick ink to paint leaves, such as maple trees, red camellias, begonias, lotus flowers, and chrysanthemums, I am afraid that Wu did not expect it at the beginning.

A painter who can become a master naturally has his true skills and unique appearance. A unique appearance is easy to learn, but true skills are not easy to learn. Changshuo's thick branches and large leaves are easy to learn, but Changshuo's spirit of epigraphy is not easy to learn. Yiting's flying brush and ink dance are easy to learn, but Yiting's mellow and ancient spirit is not easy to learn. Baishi's red flowers and ink leaves are easy to learn, but Baishi's arrogant and unyielding spirit is not easy to learn. From this point of view, the three families can be said to have their own merits.

A painter does not have to be proficient in every field. As long as he has one or two masterpieces that others cannot reach, it is enough for him to become a master. Wen Yuke only painted bamboo, Zhao Zigu only painted narcissus, Ni Yunlin only wrote withered trees and thatched pavilions, Zheng Suonan only painted orchids, and one skill is exquisite. As long as he can reach the peak, he can also be immortal for thousands of years. "Qiu's skill is in chess, Liao's skill is in pills, Yang Youji's skill is in archery, and Zhang Xu's skill is in cursive script." They all specialize in one skill throughout their lives. As long as Qi Baishi paints two crabs and shrimps, he can be said to be unparalleled in the world, not only now, but also occupy a considerable position in the history of painting. It seems that he does not need to use red, red, green, and green colors to compete with others for beauty.

From a general point of view, the Wu, Wang, and Qi families can be said to belong to the same school. If we distinguish them carefully, the three families are different. Wu only writes flowers (he also painted landscapes in his early years), Wang also writes flowers, birds, and figures, especially good at Buddha statues. Qi writes figures, flowers, birds, and landscapes, and crabs and insects are his best. Therefore, it can be seen that to learn from a person, although you learn it vividly, it is only a replica, and at most you can only become a second-rate "narrator." You must have your own expertise outside of the teacher's school, which was not available to your predecessors. Although most of them are "narrators," some of them are also "creators," and his position in art will be greatly improved. If Wang and Qi only painted two strokes of thick branches and large leaves of flowers and had no unique points of their own, it would be difficult to keep pace with Wu.

A school of painting has creators and also has enders. For example, the Loudong School of Painting, Huang Zijiu is the founder, and Wang Yuanqi is the ender, because he has reached the highest peak and cannot move forward. The Zhejiang School was founded by Dai Wenjin and Wu Xiaoxian, and it would not work if it were not ended by Zhang Pingshan, Jiang Sansong, and Lan Tianshu. Of course, after the ender, there are inevitably many people who are eager for fame and power, or admire the past, which has become a declining trend. The end of the crossbow is like "below Qin Hui," which is not worth mentioning. In modern times, Wu Changshuo is naturally the pioneer of freehand flower-and-bird painting, but the responsibility of ending this school seems to be Qi Baishi.

That is why I said that in the history of modern Chinese painting, Qi should occupy a position anyway. As for the height of this position, I can only wait for those who write the history of Chinese painting in the future to determine it for him.

### A Brief Biography of Mr. Qi Baishi

— Rong Zhuo

Old Man Baishi is eighty-six years old this year. He was born in Baishi Village, Xiangtan, Hunan, so he styled himself Baishi Shanren (Mountain Man of Baishi). His given name is Huang, his courtesy name is Binsheng. He had many other pseudonyms throughout his life, such as Xingziwu Laomin (Old Man of Xingziwu), Jieshan Weng (Old Man Borrowing Mountains), Jipingtang Zhuren (Master of Jipingtang), Sanbaishi Yin Fuweng (Wealthy Man of Three Hundred Stone Seals), Mujushi (Wood Dweller), and Lao Mu Yi (Old Wood One), all of which were commonly used. Before middle age, he once used the pseudonym Jihuan Nu (Slave of Fleeting Illusion), but he no longer uses it now.

He was born into a farming and impoverished family. His childhood was quite bleak. At the age of twelve, he began to learn to make crude wooden daily furniture. A year later, he switched to learning to carve patterns on wooden printing blocks. His artistic foundation was sown here.

When he was engaged in learning to carve patterns on wooden printing blocks, he carved flower boards for others during the day, and at night he bought oil and lit a lamp to study painting. He was so eager to learn that he naturally made some progress. Mr. Hu Qinyuan, a fellow villager from Hunan, saw his paintings and heard of his efforts, so he invited him to his home, encouraged him, and introduced him to Mr. Xiao Xiangjie, a painter of some renown in the village, to study painting. At the same time, he also introduced him to Mr. Chen Shaofan, a poet of considerable fame in the village, to study poetry. He studied painting and poetry with redoubled efforts.

After a few years, almost everyone in Xiangtan knew that he could write poetry and paint. First, he was introduced to Mr. Guo Baosheng by his fellow villager Yang Songcui. Mr. Guo was a famous military man at the time, with a refined love of books and painting, so they became friends. Soon after, he met Mr. Li Yumin, a former supervisory committee member. Later, he made even more friends. Those outside the government included Mr. Wang Zhongyan, Mr. Chen Huogen, Mr. Luo Xingwu, Mr. Luo Zhenwu, Mr. Hu Lishan, and Mr. Tan Ziquan. These six gentlemen and Mr. Baishi formed a poetry society in Longshan, known at the time as the Seven Gentlemen of Longshan. At the same time, he also became friends and teachers with Mr. Wang Xiangqi, Mr. Fan Fanshan, Mr. Xia Wuyi, and Mr. Yang Xizi, all of whom were famous in the literary world.

As his friends increased day by day, many people invited him to travel far away. He traveled west to Qin (Shaanxi), south to Guangdong and Guangxi, and north to Youyan (Beijing and its surrounding areas), enjoying famous scenic spots. In Shaanxi, he carved many seals for Mr. Fanshan. Lord Fan encouraged him to enter officialdom and gave him the line, "Rather be a solitary dragon, hiding gold and jade, than to prove my innocence in the Dingming Hall." He politely declined. During his first time in Beijing, someone wanted him to be introduced to Empress Dowager Cixi by Liao Dagugu Yunxian. However, he suddenly felt a desire to return home and immediately went back south. When Yang Xizi and others were organizing the Preparatory Society for Peace, they repeatedly telegraphed to invite him to Beiping, but he always stayed in his hometown at the Jieshan Hall, studying philology, seal carving, and painting diligently, never resting. This kind of life lasted for a full four years.

It was not until the sixth or seventh year of the Republic of China (1917 or 1918), when there were many bandits in Xiangtan and warfare in Hunan, that he left his sweet hometown and took refuge in Beiping, starting his life of selling paintings. During those twenty years, although he occasionally went back to Hunan and Sichuan, he lived in Beiping most of the time. After the July 7th Incident (1937), he did not have time to pack up his affairs in the north and was trapped under the iron heel of the brutal Japanese. He was not tempted by profit, not afraid of threats, and did not weary of poverty. He always lived behind closed doors in Kuache Hutong, Xidan, Beiping. During the recent nine years or so of suffering, his heart was extremely pained.

It has been more than a year since the victory, and he is still healthy and able to take a plane from Beiping to visit Nanjing and Shanghai, the capital after the calamity and the prosperous Shanghai. This time, he was able to meet his sons and grandsons as a guest and reunite with many artist friends in Nanjing and Shanghai. This is the most pleasant page in the old Mr. Baishi's life history.

### Interesting Anecdotes from the Literary World

— Zhan Weng

Xu Yi

Xu Yi passed away in Anhui three months ago. Another poet within our seas has weakened, causing great sorrow. Yi was ashamed of self-promotion, spending his entire life in a poor and remote area. Few knew of him, but his poetry was deeply skilled, even the wise Chen San'yuan could add nothing more. Yi always advocated the theory of no ghosts, promoting the abolition of superstition. In the countryside of She County, a security association was usually held, performing plays to reward the gods, wasting people's labor and money, and the accumulated habits were difficult to change. Although Yi strongly advocated reform, the villagers did not listen. One year, Yi deliberately threw a god into the toilet, saying to the villagers: "If a god has spiritual power, he should come and punish me! Otherwise, it is just a dull and unresponsive wooden puppet, why should we worship it?" The next day, Yi was unharmed, and the villagers gathered together and said: "Mr. Yi’an is from the Hanlin Academy, he must be a star in the sky, the gods dare not offend him. If we, the common people, lose our respect, we will surely suffer misfortune!" In the end, they rewarded the gods as usual. Yi could not stop them, which shows that the superstition of the foolish people is not easy to enlighten.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 101

— Ye Jingfeng

After the waiter carefully selected the drink and snacks that Tsurumi wanted and bowed and retreated, Tsurumi lit a cigarette, preparing to concentrate his thoughts and figure out how to deal with the group of people outside the door. His seat was a very comfortable dark corner, from which he could see the entire dance floor and also pay attention to the comings and goings at the entrance. He first carefully examined the dancers on the dance floor to see if there were any relevant figures, and if there were any of his own men. Then he scanned the men and women who had not yet started dancing, one by one, and felt that he was all alone in this place. No one was paying attention to him, and there were no familiar faces. The only thing that caught his attention was a dozen or so foreign men and women. The men were wearing neat formal attire, and from their gestures and actions, it was obvious that they were members of the German Fifth Column. The women, however, could not be identified at a glance.

By this time, "Spring of the Maiden" had been played back and forth three times, and the singers had been replaced twice. Most of the couples on the dance floor were enjoying themselves and did not want to leave the floor, so the band had to switch to a Western tango. Just as the music was changing, Tsurumi finished scanning the people in the room and suddenly caught sight of the large French-style glass door at the entrance opening, and the host bowing solemnly and ushering in a young woman. Although this woman was wearing a standard Western suit and was about five feet two or three inches tall, it was clear that she was of Japanese descent.

In the brief moment that she entered the room and showed her figure, Tsurumi had already given her a score of ninety-five points for her appearance and demeanor. This was because her physique was well-proportioned, her various body parts were in proportion, and her eyes, eyebrows, mouth, and nose were all above average when viewed in relation to her entire face. What was especially important was that the agility of her mind was integrated into a charming and graceful demeanor, exuding from the color of her skin and the posture of her various body parts, forming a kind of natural radiance that could captivate people's hearts.

A young man with a will of steel like Tsurumi was not easily moved. Moreover, in terms of beauty, there was only one Yaoqun in his mind. Yaoqun's beauty, in addition to meeting all the standard external conditions, was beautiful to the bone, beautiful in her soul. And in addition to beauty, there was also a kind of unsullied demeanor that ordinary beauties could not reach. This was not the so-called "beauty is in the eye of the beholder." Even if many third parties were to compare Yaoqun with this Japanese woman, if this Japanese woman was given a score of ninety-five points, Yaoqun would at least be one or two points higher.

Why was there this one or two point difference? Because Yaoqun was purely innocent, while this Japanese woman had a bit of affectation. From Tsurumi's sharp eyes, this woman was bound to have some secrets. She was either a double agent, a secret agent, or a member of the Black Dragon Society or the "Tenno Shuei" group. However, she was definitely not a left-leaning member of the "National Progress Society." In short, she must be a secret figure.

This statement was not entirely arbitrary, because all kinds of arts and crafts have a distinction between insiders and outsiders. If you are an unrelated outsider, an insider will always feel that your every move is out of place. Even if you are an amateur opera performer, even if you have practiced hard, if you are not from a professional opera troupe, you will inevitably be a "sheep," let alone if you are not an amateur performer at all? Conversely, if you are an insider, even if your skills are not high, every move you make is in accordance with the rules and every move is in proportion. Therefore, an insider can tell at a glance. Those who are engaged in secret work, no matter how good you are at disguising, cannot hide it from the eyes of those with experience, because they have been trained in this way and they perform in this way. Even if they try their best to disguise themselves, it is like Sun Wukong's seventy-two transformations. No matter how he changes, in the eyes of the Buddha, he is still a monkey.

### Farewell to Old Man Baishi

— Sun Fuxi

After Old Man Baishi received our welcome, he is about to return to Beiping. I have many thoughts and will express them in a few lines to show my farewell.

First, Chinese artists are not valued by society. This time, Old Man Baishi was invited south by the government and received a warm welcome from the cultural community. If there are no unexpected misunderstandings, it will definitely increase society's respect for art and artists. I also hope that the old man will lead the Chinese art world to move towards a great and bright future from now on.

Second, China is now in a state of extreme decline. Although we have the aid of the Allied countries, the establishment of a country and a person depends entirely on self-reliance. I do not understand politics, nor do I understand diplomacy, but I only know that relying on the support of this country or that country is not a way to self-reliance. Art takes the spirit of creation, independence, and freedom as its main purpose. I hope that the old man will use the spirit of art to lead the trend and save the dying Chinese customs.

Third, China's exports and imports have reached a ratio of one to twenty. The Chinese people are very tolerant, and they swallow as much foreign goods as possible. What is being imported now is just cigarettes, canned food, and glass leather bags. One day, when construction begins, the machinery and raw materials used in heavy industry will pour in. What ability do we have to balance foreign exchange? The only thing we can compete with foreigners in is art. I am not saying that we should move old antiques such as Zhou Ding Tang Yu and sell them to foreigners. I am saying that we should use Chinese artistic talents to improve industrial and commercial products, and further improve existing handicrafts and sell them abroad. Such products are available everywhere, such as bamboo lacquer, porcelain silk, etc. There is no need to set up factories, just guide the production of local folk crafts and purchase them by the piece. The shapes and colors must be beautiful and meet psychological needs, and as much as possible decorate them with towers, temples, and other patterns, clothing, and the special meaning of history that can attract people's love. If the old man can make a call to action, it will not be a way to save the country through art.

Fourth, I am usually saddened by the fact that I have not achieved anything in learning and conduct, and that I am nearly fifty years old. Old Man Baishi is eighty-six years old, and my personal achievements are not even a fraction of those of Mr. Qi. And my forty-nine years are only half of the old man's age. There are colleagues in the arts who are only one-third or one-quarter of the old man's age. We can work hard and diligently study, and we will surely succeed in the future. If we can do this, then we are all disciples of the old man!

I wish Old Man Baishi a safe journey and happiness, longevity, and health!

### Goldfish

— Shao Fu

Four months ago, I bought two goldfish and kept them in a fruit plate (I don't know where to buy a large fish tank). Other than having the servant change the water once every morning, there is no other care. But this couple has grown fat and strong in this fruit plate, living leisurely for four months.

The plate is placed on the writing desk in the study. In the silence, I often hear their fine, fragmented chattering sounds. Although it is subtle, it is very real. I often put down my books because of this and ponder over issues such as life.

They keep floating and sinking, chasing each other, chattering, and they look very happy and free. They have never worried about the world of this fruit plate.

If life is like a rolling snowball, if it is like a usurious loan with compound interest, time will create greatness, greatness that is unbelievable. If it is like a burning candle, the result will be nothing.

Perhaps most of us are like these two goldfish. Our world is an invisible fruit plate, with edges and a kind of mystery. And everyone lives on in a muddleheaded and self-satisfied way, waiting for the final natural extinction.

Like goldfish, we are not self-aware, so there is no sadness.

### Difficult to Count Banknotes - A Major Problem in Currency Transactions

— Chen Tianduo

Sometimes when we go to the bank to get a large amount of banknotes, on the one hand, to avoid procedural troubles, and on the other hand, because we believe in the bank's credit, we often do not check them and just take them and run. But when you use them for other expenses, you may find that there is a considerable amount missing. This situation directly damages the interests of the customers themselves and indirectly affects the bank's reputation. I dare to offer some suggestions:

A preliminary examination of the reasons is actually simple: because of the depreciation of the legal tender and the increase in the face value of the banknotes, there is a situation where a large number of banknotes cannot be counted. Originally, the financial industry has always been accustomed to trusting each other. Seeing that the teller has stamped the banknotes, they will no longer recount them and transfer them for external use, usually only counting the large amounts, not the small amounts. In fact, the number of tellers is limited. If each person counts 5 million yuan per day, then ten people can only count 50 million yuan, while the amount of cash that the bank handles every day is often around tens of billions of yuan. The remedies are as follows:

Promote and improve the bill of exchange credit system. As in European and American countries, all normal citizens have dealings with banks and use this system. This will not only reduce the difficulty of counting cash, but also consolidate finance and cultivate a good bill of exchange credit system. This is the first.

Banks should increase the number of staff and improve their abilities, knowledge, and character. In this way, it is possible to seek speed in procedures and also strengthen the bank's reputation. At the same time, attention must also be paid to improving the lives of the bank employees. This is the second.

Finally, I hope that this serious problem of missing cash can be improved and eliminated through the improvement of the bill of exchange system and the principle of moral integrity. At the same time, I also hope that customers will take this responsibility to protect the interests of each individual.

Furthermore, if the currency system can be adjusted with proper and confidential methods, then the above problem will be fundamentally solved!

Scientific Knowledge

### Stereoscopic Movies

— Yu Zhang

The Soviet Union can be said to be the first country in the world to show stereoscopic movies on a three-dimensional screen.

A foreign reporter who had seen several experimental screenings of stereoscopic movies in Moscow wrote a dispatch saying: "A tank is driving straight towards you - in a minute, it will crush you - ah! It's driving over your head! You hurriedly lower your head and tilt it to one side - but nothing happens. You're just watching a movie - watching a stereoscopic movie."

Scientists from various countries have long been studying how to make stereoscopic movies. The first group used the principle of stereoscopes to shoot, but they could only shoot static things, like slides, which could not be called movies. And it was also inconvenient to watch, as the audience's eyes had to wear a pair of lenses.

The second phase of researchers used a "protrusion method." When showing the movie, there were also two screens, one showing a red film and the other showing a green film. The audience also wore a pair of red-green glasses - the red lens looked at the green film, and the green lens looked at the red film - the images of the two colors overlapped at one focal point, and it looked like a three-dimensional image. This stereoscopic movie, the simple red and green colors themselves were a defect, and the colored lenses blocked a large amount of light, making the movie dim and unclear.

The third phase, which is also the most successful method, is what the Soviet Union is currently studying. The audience does not need to wear any special glasses, and it looks very clear. All the images are complete.

Several years ago, Semyon Ivanov - a Soviet engineer, the son of a shoemaker - was dissatisfied with flat movies and began to study stereoscopic movies. He experimented with many screens, creating different planes, possibly using dense fine metal wires to pass through them and tie them together. In this way, the screen had depth. He found that as long as it was matched with appropriate projection equipment (projector), this screen could produce a stereoscopic effect without glasses. But this screen required very long metal wires, which was too expensive. Although after many improvements, his final screen with a projection area of ​​25 square yards still required 112 miles of metal wire.

During the war, Ivanov's main job was serving in the military, engaged in aerial surveying. Thanks to his stereoscopic tools, he became one of the most successful Soviet aerial photography experts.

Even so, he never gave up his research on stereoscopic movies. In the third year of the war, he had a great achievement, which was to replace the metal wires on the screen with a large number of conical lenses. This projection plane has now been completed and installed in ordinary theaters, and audiences in any corner can receive a clear stereoscopic effect.

The "Vanotev Screen" weighs over a ton. The projection method has also been completely successful. Last year, Ivanov shot the first feature-length stereoscopic film - Robinson Crusoe - in Tbilisi, the capital of the Georgian Republic and the Transcaucasian Federation.

Just as sound films eliminated silent films, stereoscopic films will also replace flat films. The Soviet Union is now planning to build 20 cinemas dedicated to stereoscopic movies. The first one was recently completed in Moscow. As for converting ordinary cinemas into cinemas that show stereoscopic movies, it is also a relatively simple matter. The "Ivanov Screen" can be suitably installed in front of the ordinary screen, and the projection room and auditorium do not need to be改造.

### Why Not Try to Create Polysyllabic Characters

— Yu Funan

The newspaper on the 14th carried an advertisement for a "　" "髡" one million yuan micro-tone prize. In fact, it is very difficult to call these two characters with a precise and vivid sound. We know that most countries in the world except our Republic of China use phonetic writing, some characters have one sound, and some have two or three sounds. Therefore, most foreign words represent a meaning, and they are not like some of our words that cannot stand alone. For example, the two words "枇杷" (loquat), if you take out one word alone, you don't know what it means. These two words can only be considered letters, and they only have meaning when they are spelled together.

Therefore, many people think that our Chinese characters are outdated and not enough for modern application and are inconvenient to use. I remember that in March of this year, the Political Participation Council also put forward the idea of reforming Chinese characters. The promotion of phonetic symbols is indeed a good improvement, but it has not yet been popularized in society. A Russian person's name is often translated into a long string of clumsy characters, why not translate it into phonetic symbols for more straightforwardness.

At the same time, we must promote a kind of polysyllabic character to remedy this and eliminate those characters that cannot stand alone. A long time ago, someone proposed writing words together (a word should be written together if it includes two or three characters), which is very appropriate to adopt before the creation of polysyllabic characters is successful. Then, simplify and evolve from writing together into polysyllabic characters. For example, the three characters of library, in modern times, are simplified to "　". It is now commonly used by the public. This "　" character, of course, is still read as the three sounds of the library. This "　" character is an example of the successful creation of a polysyllabic character.

In my personal humble opinion, such as the two characters 枇杷, can be written as "　", similarly, 琵琶 can be written as "琶", 梧桐 can be written as "　", 蚂蚁 can be written as "　" (it is best to simplify here to avoid too many strokes), most of these alliterative and rhyming words can be created into a polysyllabic character, and the "究" and "　" in the advertisement do not necessarily need to call a single sound? Ask the advanced, I wonder what they think? It must be explained here that I do not want to write all the words as polysyllabic characters, but only hope to eliminate those characters that cannot stand alone)

I think: Why not give it a try!

### Why No Follow-Up?

— Zhuo Qiu

Former French Municipal Council Employees' Voice

In April and May of this year, the "application for retirement pay" issue for retired personnel of the former Public Works Bureau received a satisfactory answer. Following that, the French Consulate General also did not want to be left behind and indicated that former employees of the Municipal Council and the Police Department could apply for registration. Their "willingness to follow good examples" was entirely based on the "friendly Sino-French relations." In fact, the Municipal Council's finances in the past always had a surplus. Even today, the buildings and other movable and immovable properties under its remaining items still possess a massive value.

However, in the past, the employees of the French Municipal Council and the Police Department mostly "governed themselves," and the divisions between departments were too deep. They had never organized a group similar to an association or club. This traditional weakness of disorganization affected the outcome of this application for retirement pay.

Therefore, the registration procedure has ended for several months, and the meeting between Mr. Wang, the representative of the retired personnel, and the French Consul in Shanghai began more than a month ago, but to this day, there is still no follow-up.

Among our retired personnel, many are still unemployed at home. Most of them, during the period when the puppet organization took over the French Concession, were determined to preserve what remained and ended their employment fate at the same time as the French. They are still bitterly waiting for the follow-up on the retirement pay.

Recently, it was heard that "the debts of the former French Concession will be cleared by the end of the lunar year." We believe that this check from the French Consulate General can be cashed soon and will not end up unresolved.

### Weekend Chats: Creation

Using Poison to Fight Poison

Newspapers report that Wu Shengcai, a notorious thief in Taipei, had a gang of twelve "good fellows" who specialized in robbery and committed all sorts of evil deeds. He was known as one of the "Twelve Stars" in Taiwan Province. Although the authorities tried many times to arrest him, this "Dog Star" was always elusive and out of reach. Coincidentally, the Taipei Theater was showing the American film "The Invisible Thief." Wu, for some unknown reason, suddenly had the idea to take this opportunity to watch and study it, hoping to gain some insights. So, he stealthily went, and that's when he was caught in the police's net. Reading this news, one can't help but applaud. In the past, we often criticized Hollywood manufacturers for using a set of monster movies to swindle people's money, encouraging frivolity and theft, and blaming them in the manner of the Spring and Autumn Annals, expressing boundless indignation. Now, thinking about it, I truly regret that criticism. After all, the "Doctrine of the Mean" of our country has its truth. We overlooked the deep meaning of the filmmakers, "concealing capture in the strange," and instead greatly negated it, which is truly detrimental to our brains.

Furthermore, Let's Talk About Banning Prostitution

Following the lottery to eliminate rickshaws, the authorities now have a five-year plan to eliminate 100,000 prostitutes in the city through a lottery. These past two nights, many ladies in the red-light districts who are "about to have new paths" seem particularly active in the cold wind. I think this is probably because: on the one hand, winter is approaching, and the work of cracking down on street prostitutes must be temporarily put into "hibernation"; on the other hand, perhaps they know that the industry is already at the end of its rope, so to welcome a new life, they are specially putting on a farewell performance to commemorate it. Regardless of whether their activity is meant to imply a protest against or support for the "plan," I believe that the "anti-prostitution theory" has its significance in the current era. Because the existence of prostitutes in Shanghai poses the greatest threat to the good wives sitting at home. In order to maintain the warmth of their families, besides implementing all kinds of precautions against their "husbands," the most important thing is to dress themselves up to compete with the prostitutes for "love." Therefore, luxury goods that originally only catered to the general prostitute class are now gradually being snatched up by the wives. As the wives dress up, the prostitutes seek even more fulfillment, neither yielding to the other, and everyone is advancing at full speed. The import figures for face powder, lipstick, and glass handbags at customs have therefore ballooned. Tracing the root cause to prostitution, who can say that it is not appropriate to ban prostitution with a plan at this time?

Humans and Animals Grieve Together

It is said that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has recently shipped another batch of supplies to China, including all sorts of things like soy sauce, chili peppers, and vinegar. The most precious items are 792 mules, which can be called a grand sight. These mules "received short-term training" at the Tianjin UNRRA Transportation Bureau and are "fat and strong." "Not only are they economical to feed, but they can also endure hardship better than domestic mules." Therefore, in Shanxi, they have "already been snapped up by farmers." Some people have expressed regret about this, complaining about the inability of our Central Plains' special product, the mule, to "endure hardship." This kind of patriotism and concern for animals is, I think, "a common sentiment." But judging from the facts, although domestic mules are of excellent quality, in recent years, due to the widespread bankruptcy of farming families, people's livelihoods are already difficult, and raising livestock is even more makeshift, skimping on labor and materials, and feeding them rough fodder is to be expected. "The mule and the owner are both thin." After wandering in ditches, compared to the pampered, well-nourished American mules, they naturally feel ashamed. In fact, comparing animals to people, isn't it the same? These days in Shanghai, various agencies are launching large-scale campaigns in the streets to encourage electricity conservation, but the hair dryers in barber shops are still running. The bureau chief personally inspects straw-roofed toilets, but the price of Er'er's [a type of bun] is still rising. Life is pressing, and people do not obey the regulations like this, so how can we blame our mules!

The Writer is Wrong

I remember that after the tea party held last month in Shanghai to welcome Henry Luce's visit to China, a man named Li Yongkang was arrested for printing and selling "A Western Golden Lotus." Although these two things were a coincidence, they still gave our cultural circles a not-so-small joke. Not long after, it was heard that famous works such as "Red Pants" and "You Love Me, I Love You" had been approved for publication after review. The authorities later once denied this matter, but the denial was superfluous. Originally, with people constantly declining, erotic texts were bound to emerge. In a society where "seduction" and "rape" incidents are endless, "cultural commercialization" is truly in accordance with Heaven and in line with the people, a "product of the times," just as relief goods can turn into commercial goods. They are all birds of a feather, and we shouldn't be so biased or make a fuss about it. However, people like Li Yongkang are also very stupid. Why didn't they take advantage of Luce's visit to China to interview him after the tea party? If so, then his magnum opus "A Western Golden Lotus" could have captured the "Time" magazine's artistic conception and essence, discussing romance while leaving a little bra, [censored], etc., not going too deep, just enough. Wouldn't it be a Chinese streamlined publication? Unfortunately, he missed this move, leading to public resentment, while "Red Pants" and other works that follow suit are sometimes approved and sometimes denied, making it seem like a guessing game.

"Bathhouse" means bathroom. Whether it's taking a shower or bathing, people take off their clothes and get into the water.

In the bathhouse, the towels are not segregated. Just after Guest A used it to wipe his [censored], Guest B uses it to wipe his risk in a little while.

The water in the pool is as black as ink and as thick as soup. But the bathers soaking in this muddy soup still don't think it's too dirty.

Many bathers suffering from athlete's foot and scabies like to wash with boiling water in the "hot pool." They think this is enough to kill the itch. It is said that skin diseases are not contagious in the bathhouse, but I don't know on what basis.

If health experts were to run into the bathhouse to investigate, they would think that every bather is an adventurer, and they are probably all untainted by the filth.

The bathhouse is indeed unsanitary on the surface, but the service is very attentive. Steaming hot towels are constantly delivered, and the attendant is always there to wipe your back.

When bathing in the pool, you don't have to do it yourself. The back-scrubber will wash all the dirt from your body using a combination of soft and hard techniques until it is completely clean. Although the back-scrubber has an unpleasant term called "fishing for floating corpses."

Lying on the wax bed, the "foot massager" sits opposite you. While he is massaging your feet, he is also paying attention to your facial expressions, and the lightness and heaviness of his hands can understand your intentions, so-called scratching where it itches.

Several old bathers meet every day and talk freely about everything. Therefore, many people still like to go to the bathhouse to bathe, even though they have sanitary bathrooms at home. Therefore, the business of the bathhouse is still thriving, and the home bathroom is far behind. Health experts shake their heads and sigh!

### Five Circles for One Hundred Yuan

— Xiu Yi Sheng

At the side of the road are piles of oranges, clay figures, candies, and cigarettes, arranged in rows, as if in formation. In front of the formation, a foothold is drawn with white powder, and in front of the foothold is written: "Five circles for one hundred yuan!"

The circles are all thrown, and no oranges, clay figures, candies, or cigarettes are won. The children (or perhaps adults) then walk away. The practitioner then waits for the second person, the third person.

The "three feet of land rent, three bolts of cloth on credit" stalls have become this "five circles for one hundred yuan" game. There are more ways to make a living, and this is moving towards a productive social education!

### Gold Turns to Manure

— Zan Ying

Shi Dakai said, "Gold is like manure," but now it is "gold turns to manure." The gold of Fuxing Island has turned into two vats of manure. Although there are many tricks in Shanghai, turning gold into manure is still a first.
