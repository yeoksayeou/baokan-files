### Various Proposals from Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Circles to Rescue the Crisis; The Executive Yuan Responds Item by Item; Labor Issues Responded to by the Ministry of Social Affairs

[Our Newspaper] Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other organizations, in view of the various influences on our country's industry and commerce, such as prices, transportation, and the smooth sale of foreign goods, which has led to a crisis, sent representatives to Beijing on August 13th of this year to petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Finance. Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a reply from the Executive Yuan, which read: "Regarding the various proposals submitted by the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles to rescue the industrial and commercial crisis, it was approved on October 7th with the Jing San character No. 14916, and distributed to the relevant departments for the record. Now, according to the review of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, this case has been invited to gather relevant agencies to order consultation on the main points of the original request, compiled a meeting record, except for labor issues, which have been directly answered by the Ministry of Social Affairs, the remaining items, and on the supplementary opinions of various agencies, the original meeting record has been revised, along with the revised record, please review, etc.; It is noted that the opinions proposed in the revised record are still appropriate, of which the second item on the issue of the existence of the Four Joint Offices, seems to be unnecessary to discuss at present, the fifth item (3), regarding the type of import, and restrictions, has been sent to the Import Design Committee for careful research, and the same first item (6), regarding the barter policy, should be actively prepared, has been ordered by the Central Trust Bureau to consider, the seventh item, regarding the inland river shipping relief issue, has been ordered by the Ministry of Communications to reply with a special case."

Decision of the Ministry of Economic Affairs

The following is the resolution of the meeting convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs on August 29th to gather relevant agencies for joint discussion: (1) Production Loans and Industrial Loans (including amount, interest rate, and simplified procedures, etc.): (1) Amount - The government is in the process of handling various production loans one after another. The amount is also gradually increasing, without any restrictions. (2) Purpose - Limited to being used as necessary working capital for production enterprises. The fixed capital required for expansion of various factories must be raised through stock issuance and cannot rely on loans. (3) Nature of the enterprise - Loans will be granted to those who have hope of production, which can not only increase production but also help the development of the enterprise. Even if loans are granted to those who have no hope, it is difficult to expect success. Therefore, the approval of production loans must be decided separately for each production enterprise. (4) Interest rate - National banks have always adopted a low-interest policy and are continuing to do so in order to reduce the burden on merchants and the people. (5) Collateral - The collateral for loans from national banks has always been mainly raw materials and finished products, and there are restrictions on the period of acceptance. Now, the Four Joint Offices have approved a flexible approach, and the machinery owned by manufacturers can also be provided as part of the collateral in order to strengthen assistance to the development of production enterprises. For industrial and mining enterprises that are well-organized and have excellent operating results, national banks can also participate in investment or provide other guidance and assistance. (6) Simplified procedures - The Four Joint Offices have paid close attention to this issue, and recently passed various business regulations, which have been improved compared to the past. (2) Issue of the Existence and Abolition of the Four Joint Offices and the Specialization of Banks: Resolution: The issue of the existence and abolition of the Four Joint Offices is not convenient for the Ministry and other departments to discuss. As for the specialization of banks, it has actually been implemented long ago, and there is no need to discuss it further. (3) Issue of Organizing the Revival Industrial Investment Company: Resolution: In principle, it is feasible, but the issue involves many aspects and still needs to be carefully considered by the competent department. (4) Exchange Rate: Resolution: It has recently been adjusted and does not need to be discussed further. (5) Import and Export Taxes, Import and Export Chain System, Subsidy Policy, Barter Policy, etc.: Resolution: (1) Import tariffs are being researched and prepared for revision. (2) The government has recently decided to temporarily exempt export taxes uniformly. (3) The types and restrictions of imported goods are to be requested from the Executive Yuan to transfer to the Import Design Committee for careful research and appropriate revisions. (4) The import speed lock system is quite problematic in terms of implementation technology, and the exchange rate has just been adjusted, so it will not be discussed. (5) Export subsidy policy, export tax has been exempted, and the exchange rate has also been raised, so it will be discussed later. (6) The loan policy should be actively planned and implemented for several countries. (7) Smuggling of import loans should be strictly prohibited. (6) Issue of Compensation and Preferential Treatment for Losses of Re-employed Factories: Resolution: Regarding the compensation for losses of factories during the War of Resistance, the Executive Yuan has established a Compensation Committee, and the losses of various factories can be reported in accordance with the regulations and submitted to the enemy for compensation; as for preferential treatment measures, the second round of bidding for the sale of enemy and puppet factories that Zhu Neng sold has recently been formulated, and the re-employed factories in the rear area have priority in purchasing or leasing. The various factories can apply in accordance with the regulations. (7) Issue of Relief for Inland River Shipping: Resolution: This case is purely an issue of relief for the transportation industry and will be reviewed directly by the Ministry of Communications.

Editorial

### Opening of the National Federation of Commerce

The National Federation of Commerce, which has been in preparation for many years, opened today in the capital. At a time when economic construction needs to be stepped up and the industrial and commercial crisis in various places is gradually deepening, the establishment of the National Federation of Commerce in the capital at this time allows the central authorities and all sectors of the country to hear the urgent voices of industrial and commercial people, and its significance is not comparable to ordinary times.

As of the time of writing, all the proposals and reports of the inaugural meeting of the National Federation of Commerce have not yet been seen, and it is not possible to speculate on where the focus is. But in addition to wishing the National Federation of Commerce success, we believe that the conference really needs to pay attention to the following points.

First, how should the industrial and commercial crisis be rescued? This issue is expected to be one of the main topics in this meeting. Perhaps some people think that the formation of the "crisis" has psychological factors in it. The more you think about the crisis, the more the crisis seems to be pressing, and the result is a false alarm, just disturbing yourself. Therefore, it is advocated that there is no need to exaggerate the crisis. There may be some reason for this, but it cannot be used to adopt an ostrich policy, ignore the crisis too much, and wait for death. In any case, today no one would believe that there is no crisis in industry and commerce. Speaking of Shanghai, we feel that the points of petition submitted by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Council have pointed out the crux of the crisis, and are also quite succinct. However, some parts are still biased towards the local area, and the general national problems need to be supplemented or corrected by this National Federation of Commerce. Due to the vast territory of our country and the wide range of products, the economic situation in various places is certainly not necessarily the same. To give an example: the industrial circles in this port are eagerly awaiting the aid of foreign raw materials, while domestic raw materials such as tobacco, cotton, wheat, and soybeans are suffering from the inability to transport and sell them for various reasons, and are looking for other ways out, or the price is too different, and the merchants and manufacturers have not been able to obtain harmonious cooperation. The National Federation of Commerce is the general meeting of economic units in various places, and should be able to coordinate the overall situation and formulate a more advanced general plan to resolve the crisis for the selection of all parties.

In rescuing the industrial and commercial crisis, we have always believed that the biggest premise is the degree of understanding, and the choice of which plan is secondary. Because with a clear understanding, effective plans can be generated. Plans are plans, and promotion relies on strength. If the strength is insufficient, the plan is still empty words. Therefore, the National Federation of Commerce has a dual responsibility for this issue: one is to formulate a more complete plan, and the other is to effectively urge all parties to work hard to implement it.

Second, what kind of policy should be adopted for economic construction? The issue of the boundary between state-owned and private, the issue of industrial focus and the equal emphasis on agriculture, industry, and commerce, and the issue of free trade and the use of protection policies, seem to have been decided by the central government, but the opinions of the people are not entirely consistent. In this meeting, there should be many suggestions for discussion. We believe that any construction must be carried out in a relatively stable state in order to progress in an orderly manner and achieve results day by day. The biggest obstacle in the economic world now is the instability, which makes all parties busy with the current response and unable to start with fundamental construction. The reasons for this are complex, some are due to social, economic, and some are due to political and military reasons. The National Federation of Commerce is the general group of the national economic world, and its representatives are freely elected by the chambers of commerce in various places. It can also be said to be the most democratic general group of the national economic world. If there is a so-called "third party", then this representative of national industry and commerce, who is truly elected, is more worthy of it than politicians. At this turning point in the current situation, we hope that they will exert the power of democracy, provide true public opinion, strive to uphold justice, clearly distinguish between right and wrong, and judge the truth, end the turbulent situation, and promote economic construction. Because if military and political affairs are well managed, social and economic affairs will naturally be well managed. Aren't the current problems of transportation, prices, currency, unemployment, and lack of supplies obviously affected by military and political affairs?

Third, it seems worthwhile to examine the problems of the industrial and commercial circles themselves. Before the War of Resistance, the government lacked certainty and constructiveness in its economic policies, which is undeniable. In addition, the shackles of unequal treaties, agreed tariffs, consular jurisdiction, and concession areas everywhere were obstacles, which made the industrial and commercial circles struggling and deeply trapped in a scattered, chaotic, and complacent state. This is indeed a major obstacle to economic recovery. Now, on the one hand, we hope that the government will establish economic policies, and at the same time, we also hope that the general industrial and commercial circles will recognize the times and be able to cooperate with this national policy. There must be mutual support and practical cooperation between the upper and lower levels, so that all kinds of economic policies can be promoted to their full advantage. Taking Shanghai as an example: recently, various allocation methods have not achieved the desired results. There are naturally many reasons for this, and the fact that merchants are adhering to past habits and overemphasizing their own interests is certainly one of the main reasons. How to change the atmosphere and change the style in the future, so that officials and the people can stand on the same line, promote the country's established policies, and work together for economic recovery, we believe that this is not a one-sided responsibility of the authorities, nor is it a one-sided matter for merchants. Harmonizing the upper and lower levels, uniting as one, and moving towards the great road of economic recovery together, this is a common awareness that everyone must have. The representatives of the National Federation of Commerce come from all over the country, and they can see and hear more clearly. They will surely identify the goals and complete the important mission they are entrusted with.

Here, we wish the National Federation of Commerce success!

### Jiangsu's Land Tax Collection in Kind: Approved to Collect at 40% Plus a Grain Reserve, and Can Be Changed to Wheat or Cotton Depending on Local Conditions

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 31st Dispatch] Chen Chun, Deputy Director of the Suzhou Land Grain Office, received our reporter on the afternoon of the 31st and gave a comprehensive talk on the issue of land tax collection in kind: This year's land tax collection in kind and borrowing was originally stipulated by the central government that those who paid one yuan of tax during the war should be changed to three shi dou of rice grain, plus one dou of borrowing, plus nine sheng of public grain, totaling four dou and nine sheng. Now, the provincial government and the provincial council, believing that the tenant farmers in Jiangsu Province suffered too much during the war and the tax amount was too heavy, repeatedly submitted requests for reduction, which was approved by the central government to collect 40% in kind. The equivalent of one yuan of tax is 1.96 dou of rice grain, plus a 10% grain reserve. Therefore, today the fixed amount of land tax in Jiangsu Province is the lightest in the country, and the actual production situation in various places can be referred to again to determine the collection of barley, wheat, cotton, etc. The conversion standard is: collecting wheat, each yuan of tax is equal to 1.362 dou of wheat; collecting cotton, 1.08 sheng is equal to one zu of grain, and 1.05 sheng is equal to one shi of wheat. As for the tax rate per mu, it depends on the amount of output, and is divided into four grades and twelve levels. The most fertile land has a tax rate of 1.23 yuan per mu, and the least fertile land has a tax rate of only 0.12 yuan per mu, all converted into real objects for collection according to the grade. The reporter then asked about the repayment method of the borrowed part, and Chen replied: the central government has stipulated that no additional food coupons will be issued, and from the 40th year of the Republic of China, the land tax will be offset evenly over five years, or the real objects will be repaid evenly, but no interest will be calculated. Chen also stated that the work of collecting real objects in Wuxian County will officially begin on November 1st and is scheduled to be completed by December 15th. If all of them can be collected, it will be possible to obtain a total of more than 350,000 dan of grain. In order to reduce the transportation and consumption burden of tenant farmers due to tax payment, this office, according to the provincial measures, can mobilize the village chiefs to organize collective grain payment. The unit is the village, and the grain will be collected regularly. The village chief will lead and supervise the delivery of grain to the warehouse to show condolence.

### Traitor Li Yiqing Escapes During Transfer from Shanghai to Hangzhou

[Our newspaper's Haining dispatch] Li Yiqing, a traitor from Zhuji, served as a deputy commander of the puppet army during the occupation of the county. He participated in the murder of Zhang Ziqing, a tax collector for the county, committed many evils, disrupted the local area, and hindered our underground work. The people hated him with gnashing teeth. A month ago, the county discovered that the traitor was in Shanghai. It immediately consulted with the Shanghai Police Bureau to arrest him. The Hangzhou High Procuratorate sent two bailiffs with a letter to Shanghai to take him into custody. Unexpectedly, on the 29th, while taking the express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou, the traitor claimed to need to use the restroom while passing through the town of Xiashi in this county. The bailiffs escorted him to the restroom. When the train left Xiashi station, about three or four li away from the station, he smashed the window and jumped out of the train. At that time, the train was moving fast. The bailiffs only saw the traitor crawling on the ground, seemingly injured. They urgently asked to stop the train, but were unsuccessful. They were unable to pursue him. They got off the train at Chang'an station and then rushed back to Xiashi, where they joined eight policemen from the police局 and went to the scene of the incident to search, but found nothing.

### Gunfire in Baiyang Bay Indicates… Self-Defense Corps Ambush Lake Bandits, Destroy Bandit Boat, Intercept Large Batch of Stolen Goods

[Our newspaper's Suzhou dispatch] Muli Township in the Fifth District of this county borders Taihu Lake and has always been a place where lake bandits run rampant. In recent months, with the gradual advancement of the suppression work, the bandits' power has been slightly curbed. At around 10 am on the 28th, members of the defense sentry of the township's Self-Defense Corps suddenly discovered four bandit boats in Baiyang Bay in Taihu Lake. It was estimated that there were about 40 bandits, carrying new weapons such as light machine guns. They focused their fire on a motorboat, and one of the bandit boats seemed to be trying to dock, clearly intending to loot local villages. The defense sentry members immediately fired their guns to warn the police, gathered all the members, and rushed to the lakeside to intercept them. At the same time, they covered the motorboat to escape. Later, the self-defense corps from Hengjing, Qianzhuang, Xishang, and other places received the news and set out to encircle and suppress the bandits. They destroyed one bandit boat on the spot. Seeing that the situation was not good, the bandits quickly abandoned the broken boat and fled into the center of the lake. Later, the Xishang Self-Defense Corps managed to intercept the broken boat. They found a large number of stolen goods in the bandit boat, including gold rings, watches, clothes, and cloth, as well as 40 sets of military uniforms.

[Our newspaper's Suzhou 30th dispatch] Guangfu Tianchi Township in the Third District of this county, only 30 li away from the city, was suddenly invaded by more than 20 "New Fourth Army" soldiers carrying weapons on the evening of the 27th.

The next day, the military police stationed in Guangfu learned of this and rushed to pursue them, but they had disappeared without a trace. The remaining confiscated guns have been collected, awaiting further arrangements. It is now known that Township Head Zhou has escaped safely and returned.

### Large-Scale Purchases by Outside Merchants Drive Up Wuhu Rice Prices

[Our newspaper's Wuhu dispatch] Wuhu rice prices have been stable since the autumn harvest. However, recently, a certain Shanghai enterprise company, which originally dealt in flour and cloth and sold goods to both the north and south, has been prohibited from exporting and has used its surplus funds to explore the purchase of large quantities of rice in Wuhu. In addition, trade companies from Tianjin, Quanzhou, and Zhongjiang have also sent personnel to Wuhu to collect rice.

### Decline of Silk Industry Affects Mulberry Tree Growers; 3,000 Mu of Seedlings Have No Way Out; China Silk Corporation Discusses Relief in Chang'an

[Our newspaper's Haining dispatch] The mulberry seedlings produced in more than 20 villages and towns in Zhouwangmiao, Chang'an in this county, and the borders of Chongde, Tongxiang, and Hangxian are the main production areas in our country and have a great impact on the lives of farmers. The China Silk Corporation, in view of this, established a seedling cultivation guidance center in Chang'an this spring, and the China Farmers Bank provided mulberry seedling loans. During the sowing season, the company also issued a bonus of 6,000 yuan per mu to encourage farmers to plant and restore mulberry seedlings. It is estimated that 3,000 mu have been planted, which can produce about 8,000 dan of seedlings and 120 million branches. However, due to the current slump in the silk industry, they cannot be sold and have no ability to transplant them in large quantities, so there is panic. The China Silk Corporation specially invited more than 10 representatives from relevant parties in Chang'an to discuss countermeasures. It was decided to promote publicity as much as possible, encourage planting, and plan to set the price of seedlings at 60,000 yuan per dan, and transfer it to the Farmers Bank to continue to handle loans, requiring a total loan of about 1 billion yuan. It was decided to purchase about 2 million branches of grafted seedlings that can be planted. However, if the more than 100 million seedlings that require 20,000 mu of land cannot be completely resolved, then the more than 3,000 mu of mulberry seedlings will have no way out, which will affect the future of sericulture.

### Soviet Union's Disarmament Proposal Decided to Be Included in the General Assembly Agenda; Austin Responds to Soviet Challenge Speech

[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 31st Broadcasting: The United Nations General Assembly made amazing progress today. The Steering Committee of 14 countries unanimously approved that the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal be placed on the General Assembly agenda. The General Assembly Bulletin stated: This proposal has been submitted to the Political Committee.

[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, 31st Broadcasting New York News: The United Nations General Assembly held its last plenary meeting today. The only speakers scheduled to give speeches were representatives from Uruguay, Luxembourg, and Ukraine.

[Central News Agency, New York, 30th Telegram] The United States today expressed its support for the Soviet Union's proposal for universal world disarmament, which was put forward at the United Nations General Assembly. However, the United States went further, advocating the establishment of an international inspection system to ensure genuine disarmament. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov only proposed four plans at the General Assembly last night and did not mention supervision. US Chief Representative Austin gave a speech at the General Assembly today and launched a counterattack against Molotov's challenge.

[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 30th Telegram] US Chief Representative Austin gave a speech at the United Nations General Assembly today, stating that the United States is prepared to fully cooperate with other United Nations member states to implement disarmament and announce the number of its troops stationed in foreign territories. The main points he stated are as follows: (1) The United States is prepared to fully cooperate with other United Nations member states to reduce armaments, and the United States also advocates proposing safeguards to protect the parties who comply with the treaty and to resist possible violations or evasions of the disarmament agreement; (2) The United States is prepared to fully announce the number of its troops stationed in foreign territories. As for the proposed inspection of armaments, it should include all troops in a state of mobilization at home and abroad; (3) Regarding the veto issue, the United States believes that the principle of adopting consistent opinions on major events can reflect the facts of today's world; (4) There is room for improvement in the activities of the Security Council, and when using voting methods, actions that violate the original intent of the Charter should be avoided as much as possible. Austin said that Molotov's speech yesterday seemed to contain distrust and misunderstanding of the motives of the United States. I do not believe that mutual accusations between allies can promote the realization of unity. During the war, we did our best to provide allies with assistance and cooperation, and in peacetime, the United States should also support United Nations institutions. Our motives in war and peace can be left to historical judgment. We fought side by side in wartime and did not insult each other. Why not do the same in peacetime? Therefore, I will not participate in any accusatory behavior. We deeply welcome Molotov's expression of trust in countries to establish a unanimous agreement. Regarding the issue of disarmament, Austin said that the United States believes that this matter should be included on the agenda for discussion. The Soviet Union has strong military power, and it is appropriate to propose this proposal, just as the United States' proposal to prevent the manufacture and use of atomic bombs is equally appropriate. After the First World War, our unilateral disarmament was a mistake. We must not allow this mistake to be repeated today. To complete disarmament, we must take positive action to establish a postwar state of peace.

### The Thorny Issue of Spain; The Security Council Revisits the Past; Poland Demands Cancellation for Transfer to the General Assembly for Discussion; Soviet Foreign Minister Attends Meeting for the First Time

[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, 31st Broadcasting: The Spanish issue has been unanimously resolved to be temporarily recorded on the General Assembly agenda. Before this matter is submitted to the General Assembly for discussion, it will be handed over to the Political Committee for processing.

[Central News Agency, New York, 30th Special Dispatch] The United Nations Security Council met this afternoon, and Molotov attended for the first time representing the Soviet Union. After the Security Council meeting began, it first considered Switzerland's application to become a member of the International Court of Justice in The Hague. This issue was decided to be submitted to the Special Committee for review without debate. When the meeting was about to adjourn, the Polish representative suddenly suggested in a calm manner that the Security Council cancel the Spanish issue, which is still on its agenda. Lanchi requested that the Security Council, in view of the strong interest that the General Assembly had already expressed in debating the Spanish issue, take the necessary actions to enable the General Assembly to obtain this right because Article 12 of the United Nations Charter stipulates that when the Security Council is executing the functions conferred upon it by this Charter with respect to any dispute or situation, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with respect to that dispute or situation unless requested by the Security Council. After Lanchi made the suggestion, there was a commotion at the meeting for a while. Molotov agreed to discuss the proposal immediately, but the Egyptian representative suggested that this issue should be submitted to the Security Council through normal channels, that is, the issue must be submitted to the agenda three days in advance. The Brazilian representative expressed his support, and the Security Council decided to convene a special meeting on the 4th of next month to discuss the requirements put forward by Poland.

### Albania Accuses Britain of Violating Territorial Waters; Britain Issues Statement

[Reuters, London, 30th Telegram] A British Foreign Office spokesperson said: Albania's accusation that British warships had intruded into Albanian territorial waters was obviously inappropriate. The warships HMS Saumarez and HMS Volage touched mines on October 22 in the Strait of Corfu, which is very narrow. Ships must intrude into the territorial waters of nearby countries in order to pass through, so international law has always recognized it as a highway for international transportation. In other words, international ships can make a bona fide harmless passage there.

President Truman Gave a Speech on the Opening Day of the United Nations General Assembly; The Venue Was Crowded (United Press Wireless Transceiver)

### Obey Justice and Reason to Resolve International Disputes: Truman Reaffirms U.S. Beliefs

[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 31st Broadcasting: President Truman wrote to the New York Herald Tribune today: "The representatives of various countries in the United Nations General Assembly are all striving to strengthen the understanding between countries. They represent the governments of various countries, just like members of Congress represent various parties and factions, so their opinions cannot go beyond the scope of the instructions of their respective governments. If we want to make countries understand each other, we must first explore the root causes of international disputes. We cannot force others to agree with our beliefs, nor will we allow others to force us to agree with their beliefs, but we can offer our beliefs for the test of justice and reason, and at the same time, we can ask others to offer their beliefs for the same test. None of us can surrender to force, but all people must obey justice and reason."

### Wallace Accuses U.S. Diplomacy Toward the Soviet Union of Leading Down the Path of War

[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 31st Broadcasting: Former US Secretary of Commerce Wallace said in a speech at the People's Party election rally: "Bernstein was encouraged by Vandenberg, Connally, and the Army to introduce the danger of war against the Soviet Union. He said that the US naval aircraft in Greek airspace certainly did not believe in Bernstein. At the same time, we do not believe that the United States' demand to occupy the Ball Islands, thus threatening the Soviet Union's access to the ocean, is based on the claims of members. If there is no leading line for Vanderberg and the Army, Bernstein and the State Department will not take the risk of leaving the danger of war with the Soviet Union."

### Eisenhower Refutes Soviet Foreign Minister's Remarks in Strong Language

[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 31st Broadcasting: General Eisenhower expressed his opinion in the New York Herald Tribune today, refuting Molotov's speech at the United Nations General Assembly the other day. Eisenhower said that it is absurd to say that the United States is threatening other countries. The number of U.S. troops currently stationed abroad is decreasing daily, which is bound to arouse other countries' covetousness of the United States.

### Allied Dependence of the United States and Britain - Weapon Standardization - British Plan Takes Ten Years to Complete - US Uses New Zealand and Australia as Forward Base in the Pacific

[United Press, London, 30th] The British military has drafted an ambitious plan to standardize its equipment, aligning it with the sizes and types of American ordnance. The rifle models used will be completely redesigned, as will ten-day cannons, field guns, fighter planes, and naval guns.

[United Press, London, 30th] British military officials announced that British and American military and political authorities have agreed on methods for standardizing the weapons and ammunition of the British army, navy, and air force to match American weaponry. Since the end of the war a year ago, the US and Britain have continuously exchanged information and studied this matter. The United States and Britain now have a close relationship of allied dependence, with no more individual military secrets. The establishment of a dedicated British Ministry of Defence is also related to this. The issue of weapon standardization was initially raised by the Canadian Prime Minister during the United Kingdom conference in April. At that time, Mr. King stated that Canada firmly believes that its territorial integrity and future security are inextricably linked to the United States. Therefore, defense strategies must take into account American production and scientific resources. However, there was no formal decision made during the five-nation conference. Prime Minister Attlee immediately conducted research with military authorities and subsequently delegated the matter to the British-American Joint Chiefs of Staff for further specific discussions, and an agreement was reached. According to the agreement, Britain will be able to order most of its military supplies from the United States in times of emergency, avoiding the difficulties encountered in the past. The United States will use British arsenals established in New Zealand, Australia, and other places as forward bases. It will take Britain ten years to complete this plan.

### Strong Dissatisfaction among Our Overseas Chinese Merchants with Dutch East Indies Authorities' Interference

Anglo-Dutch Indian Authorities Begin Political Negotiations

[Reuters, Singapore, 30th] Chinese shipowners are deeply dissatisfied with the Dutch authorities' interference in trade in Indonesian ports. Several weeks ago, a ship owned by a Chinese was searched by the Dutch Navy, and a Chinese sailor was shot dead by the Dutch military. The Singapore Chinese Importers and Exporters Association has sent representatives to the Chinese Consulate here to request that they petition the government to negotiate with the Dutch and demand compensation. The Dutch authorities recently announced that all merchant ships sailing into four Indonesian ports should be inspected, and even if the goods on board have paid local taxes, they must still be subject to heavy taxes by the Dutch. The overseas Chinese are extremely angry at this action by the Dutch.

[Reuters, Batavia, 30th] Representatives from Britain, India, and the Netherlands met today and decided to start political negotiations on Friday to discuss the future status of Indonesia.

### US B-29 Global Flight Plan - State Department Announces Suspension of Approval - To Avoid Accusations of Adopting a "Big Stick" Policy

[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th Special Dispatch] The US State Department announced that it has temporarily suspended the approval of the US Army Air Forces' B-29 bomber global flight at the request of the War Department. The US War Department also announced that the delay in this approval is because the State Department believes that this flight may be misunderstood as a demonstration of American military power, even though the authorities have stated that this flight is technical in nature. The Soviet Union may still regard it as another aspect of atomic diplomacy.

[United Press, Washington, 30th] The US War Department requested the State Department to approve a global flight by a squadron of B-29 Superfortresses. Secretary of State Byrnes is currently considering how to respond to this difficult issue. The State Department believes that the situation is "delicate" because showing off military might at this time will make many parties believe that the United States is rattling its saber and eager to try. The War Department's application was only formally submitted to the State Department yesterday. Some members of the State Department feel that since the end of the war, the Army and Navy departments have repeatedly tried to interfere in the State Department's formulation of US foreign policy, and the State Department is eager to avoid being accused of adopting a "big stick" policy.

### President of the Indian National Congress Talks about Sino-Indian Relations

Indians View Gandhi as a Deity

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 30th Special Dispatch] The President of the Indian National Congress, Kripalani, stated that he believes that relations between China and India will become closer in the future. Although the leaders of the Congress Party are prepared to assume the responsibilities of government, they still express doubts about Britain's desire to leave India. Judging from recent events across the country, they are still playing old tricks of divide and rule. When asked about criticism of the political situation in China, he stated that regarding the situation in China, if all parties are purely for the benefit of the general public and not for the benefit of special classes, then the domestic conflicts that both China and India are currently facing can be overcome, because the interests of the general public are indeed common and the same. He also stated that in order to promote cultural relations between the two countries, transportation should be made more convenient.

[Agence France-Presse, Calcutta, 30th] Gandhi recently traveled from New Delhi to East Bengal to inspect the riot-stricken areas and advised all believers not to crowd around train stations or docks to surround him. Gandhi has always been regarded as a deity by Hindus, and there is a saying among the people that anyone who can see Gandhi's true face will have boundless happiness. Gandhi himself stated that he did not want armed guards to accompany him. The Chief Minister of Bengal, Suhrawardy, met with Gandhi today to discuss the situation in Bengal.

[This newspaper's report] Following the Shanghai Municipal Government's automobile corruption case, the District Prosecutor's Office recently investigated a certain construction factory related to the former General Affairs Office's Vehicle Affairs Section of the Municipal Government for concealing a large amount of enemy property, as well as the former Chief of the Materials Section of the Third War Area Military Supplies Receiving Committee, Lu Shishang, and the Chief of the Vehicle Affairs Section of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Shen Wenyuan, on suspicion of abusing power and engaging in corrupt practices. This case was personally reviewed by President Song and transferred to the Ministry of Justice, which forwarded it to the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. On October 30th of last year, the Third War Area, based on a tip, stated that a certain construction factory was concealing a large amount of enemy military supplies and dispatched team member Wang Zenglue to lead several soldiers to search the premises at 360 Yanping Road. A total of over six hundred large barrels of kerosene and diesel (50 gallons each), two hundred inner and outer tires for automobiles, thirty "cong" of Monsanto saccharin, a room of foreign tiles, iron hinges, and iron hasps, sixty-five large steel windows, over seventy bundles of bamboo steel bars, and over 50,000 square feet of large foreign pine boards and over fifty "dan" of water flowing iron bars were found. At the time, due to insufficient seals, the items were not sealed and were to be transported to the Third War Area warehouse for storage the following day.

At the same time, the premises at 29 Zhoujia Road were searched, and it was discovered that the previously sealed kerosene and other items were all gone. Wang Zenglue immediately interrogated the factory's accounting staff, who admitted that 2,498 small boxes of kerosene (5 gallons each), 250 large barrels of kerosene (50 gallons each), 95 large barrels of red car oil, and 129 large barrels of diesel had been successively transported away using waybills No. 15953 and No. 15206 from October 23rd to 27th within five days. They also stated that the factory's person in charge had agreed to it with the Chief of the Vehicle Affairs Section of the Municipal Government, Shen Wenyuan. On November 1st, when Wang Zenglue led soldiers to 360 Yanping Road again to move the aforementioned materials, someone claiming to be Shen Wenyuan, the Director of the Vehicle Affairs Office of the Municipal Government, stopped the removal with a personal note from Lu Shishang, the Chief of the Materials Section of the Third War Area Receiving Committee, claiming that the materials belonged to the Municipal Government. However, no one was guarding them, nor were they sealed. Based on the above facts, it is clear that the merchant colluded with the receiving officials to conceal enemy property. After receiving instructions on September 20th of this year, the District Prosecutor's Office immediately began investigating. On the 29th of last month, Shen Zhenjia, the first Chief of the Vehicle Affairs Section of the Municipal Government after the victory, was summoned for interrogation. It was learned that Shen Wenyuan was the Chief of the Vehicle Affairs Section of the Puppet Municipal Government before the victory. After the Municipal Government was taken over, Shen Wenyuan continued to work in the Vehicle Affairs Office. In February of this year, after this case occurred, he resigned. On the same day, the prosecutor ordered Shen Zhenjia to arrest Shen Wenyuan, but Shen Wenyuan had already fled upon hearing the news. After a day and night of investigation by the police, Shen Wenyuan was arrested in a printing house on the morning of the 30th. The prosecutor in charge of the case and the clerk personally went to 360 Yanping Road and other places to inspect the premises on the previous day, and other suspects are being strictly apprehended.

### Finance Bureau Forms Working Teams - To Supervise Tax Collection in Rural Areas

[This newspaper's report] The Municipal Finance Bureau believes that the method of collecting land taxes by contractors, which was previously monopolized by local maps, has many drawbacks. A special effort is being made to improve it during the land registration process.

### 錢幣司長談　行莊復業條件　設立於抗戰發生以前　確因戰事影響而停業　並有各方面完備證件　七月十五日以前申請

［This Newspaper's Report］Recently, there has been much confusion regarding the applications for resumption of business by financial institutions (including banks, native banks, trust companies, etc.). Therefore, this reporter specially visited Mr. Dai Mingli, Director of the Monetary Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, who had just returned from visiting relatives in eastern Zhejiang Province, and raised several questions. He kindly provided the following answers: (1) The main conditions for a financial institution to apply for resumption of business are: (A) It must have been established before the outbreak of the war. (B) It must have been forced to suspend business due to the impact of the war. (C) It must have certificates from the local government and chamber of commerce, account statements from correspondent native banks, and tax payment receipts to the government. (2) The deadline for applying for resumption of business was originally set for May 5th of this year. However, due to the vastness of the territory and the enthusiastic response from financial institutions across various regions applying for resumption of business, the deadline was specially extended to July 15th of this year. It is estimated that over 1,500 institutions have applied. The Ministry of Finance is strictly enforcing the July 15th deadline. Even applications from financial institutions in remote areas will be based on the postmark on the letter, and no extensions will be granted. All matters processed after that date pertain to applications submitted before July 15th, where supporting documents were incomplete and are being expedited for submission to facilitate review. (3) Many financial institutions in pacified areas have also prepared documents and applied in advance to reserve the right to resume business. As soon as the local area becomes stable, they will begin operations, and the Ministry of Finance has approved their request. (4) The Ministry of Finance has established a review committee composed of various relevant departments to rigorously review the resumption of business applications of financial institutions. Those found to have forged documents in an attempt to deceive will be handed over to the court for strict punishment, with no leniency. (5) Regarding the management of money exchange businesses, the Ministry of Finance has drafted a complete set of management regulations for money exchange businesses. As this matter is related to the Central Bank's foreign exchange policy, it was submitted to the Central Bank for study two months ago. According to disclosures, the main points of the regulations include: (A) Money exchange businesses should clearly mark their name as "Exchange Shop." (B) They cannot concurrently engage in the business of general banks, etc. Additionally, Director Dai stated that he will be returning to Beijing within days to handle important official matters, having been away from the capital for nearly twenty days.

Buying Forces No Match for Selling Pressure: Chinese Stocks Weaken Again.

Chinese stocks weakened yesterday due to tight money supply and persistent selling pressure. The overall trend was hopeless, easily overwhelmed by short sellers. Initially, stocks opened relatively stable, but soon showed signs of weakness after opening. Yong Sha struggled around the 700 yuan mark. Guangdong-based stocks like No. 162 had some inflows and managed to hold their ground, while No. 176 also saw some buying. However, sellers, such as No. 89, repeatedly exerted pressure, leading to a worsening situation after 10:10 am. Prices were maintained at low levels, but buying forces were no match for selling pressure. Despite some rebounds, it was difficult to sustain. Around noon, buying forces collapsed again, with Yong Sha breaking the low price of 680 yuan and Mei Ya plummeting to 3100 yuan. Short sellers comfortably covered their positions, resulting in a slight rally before closing. Compared to the previous closing, popular stocks like Yong Sha, Xin Guang, and Xin He fell by less than 0.5%, while Mei Ya, Jing Fu, and Qin Xing fell by more than 0.5%. Less popular stocks like Wu He rose slightly, Rong Feng, Li An, and Cement remained flat, and the rest fell slightly. Although trading volume was low in the afternoon, some financial institutions provided support at low prices, improving market sentiment. Popular stocks rebounded somewhat, resulting in slight declines compared to the previous closing for Yong Sha, Jing Fu, Xin Guang, Qin Xing, and Xin He. Mei Ya fell by 0.5%. Less popular stocks like Tong Yi, Zhong Fang, Jing Bei, and Xin Ya Company experienced slight declines. Da Tong, Rong Feng, Zhong Si Nei Yi, Hua Feng Match, and Cement remained flat, while Wu He rose slightly. Stocks traded off-market also experienced slight declines.

US Cotton Exchange Temporarily Suspends Futures Trading, Congress Launches Investigation

[Reuters, New York, 30th] The New York, New Orleans, and Chicago cotton exchanges have temporarily suspended trading today, as concerned parties deem it necessary to suspend futures trading to thoroughly investigate the recent sharp decline in cotton prices. The Memphis spot market is the only center for spot trading in the South today. Spot prices remained unchanged at 29.45 US cents per pound, with 11,974 bales sold, compared to 6,362 bales sold yesterday.

[Associated Press, New York, 30th] In the past two weeks, since President Truman announced the lifting of price controls (which did not directly affect cotton prices), the price of various types of cotton has fallen by approximately 10 US cents per pound. The closing price on Tuesday night was less than 30 US cents per pound, while the price on October 8th was nearly 41 US cents per pound at its peak. The sharp fluctuations in cotton prices have drawn criticism from Senator Thomas, who claims that speculative conspiracies are at play, and Congress has launched an investigation.

Analysis and Observation of the Sharp Decline in US Cotton Prices

Spot prices for US cotton reached a peak of 39.78 US cents per pound this year (October 3rd). After mid-October, prices began to decline, falling to 33.45 US cents per pound on October 22nd. Subsequently, prices stabilized, hovering around 36.08 US cents per pound. After October 25th, prices continued to fall sharply, reaching 29.90 US cents per pound by the 30th, falling below the 30-cent mark. This represents a sharp drop of 9.88 US cents per pound from the peak, or 988 points, a rare phenomenon since 1920. The reasons for this sharp decline in US cotton prices are as follows: (1) President Truman broadcast on October 13th that, given the recent rise in prices affecting former President Roosevelt's plans to stabilize people's livelihoods, reasonable adjustments would be made to price policies, especially in the area of cotton textiles (this adjustment aims to suppress prices, not to raise them as interpreted in China). (2) This year's US cotton production is estimated to be the lowest in nearly a decade. Therefore, prices rose in recent months. However, recent calculations of US cotton stocks from last year and this year's harvest indicate that, after supplying domestic consumption and exports, there will still be a surplus of 4 million bales for the next year, so there is no perceived shortage, which may also be one of the reasons for the reversal of previous price increases. (3) In recent months, the Soviet Union has imported cotton to the UK, which has significantly impacted the US cotton market in Europe. (4) Short sellers are intensifying their activities in a favorable environment, which is also contributing to the decline. (5) Government wartime support measures for the 1946 cotton loan are no longer necessary, so subsidies will be reduced for at least 14,805,000 bales. (6) US textile mills' cotton consumption was 11 million bales per year during the war, but has fallen to 10 million bales after the war, a decrease of 1 million bales compared to wartime levels. These are the main factors contributing to the decline in US cotton prices. However, if we further observe the global cotton supply and demand situation, the estimated supply of cotton from all countries for this cotton year is 42 million bales, a decrease of 7 million bales compared to 1939 and a decrease of 5 million bales compared to the average from 1935-1939.

However, consumption for 1946-1947 is expected to increase by approximately 9% compared to 1945-1946. Therefore, the carryover from August 1, 1946, will be lower than the average carryover from 1935-1939.

According to the US Department of Agriculture, cotton inventories as of August 1 this year were 7.5 million bales, compared to 11.2 million bales for the same period in 1945 and 13 million bales for the same period in 1939, indicating a significant decline. Furthermore, the department predicts that the carryover as of August 1, 1947, will not exceed 4 million bales at most. The estimated production of new cotton in the United States is 8.3 million bales, the second-lowest record since 1888. In order to reverse the continued decline in cotton prices, the US Congress is considering increasing exports to Germany and Japan. Therefore, the fundamental statistics for cotton are actually quite good, and it is expected that the downward trend will soon be curbed. Currently, China still feels a shortage of raw cotton, and the deficit will inevitably require reliance on foreign cotton. Therefore, the drop in US cotton prices is an opportunity for the textile industry to obtain inexpensive raw materials, thereby reducing the cost of textiles. (Shi Xinquan)

Birthday Celebration Football Match: Donghua Defeats British Navy by a Landslide

Eleven to One: British Navy Suffers Crushing Defeat

The football exhibition match celebrating the Chairman's birthday, Donghua versus the British Navy, was held at the Yiyuan Stadium yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM. Over 6,000 spectators attended, creating a grand spectacle. The band from the Refugee and Orphanage also performed at the venue, adding to the enthusiastic atmosphere. The match began at 3:40 PM, with two halves of 35 minutes each. Chen Jixiang served as the referee. Donghua's Dai Linjing and Sun Jinshun participated in full gear, forming a formidable lineup. The British Navy, having just arrived in Shanghai from Japan, had been neglecting practice, resulting in a less-than-stellar performance. As a result, the match became one-sided, with Donghua winning by a landslide of eleven to one. The score at halftime was three to zero.

Donghua's Three Goals

After the kickoff, Donghua's five forwards advanced, and the center forward Dai shot, but the British goalkeeper Xu Men saved it. Li Yao followed up and scored, just one minute after the start of the match. After that, it was all Donghua's offense, but A Dai, A Sun, and Youliang frequently missed opportunities, failing to increase the score. At 23 minutes, Linjing scored, but it was disallowed due to Mingzhe being offside. At 28 minutes, Donghua's forwards launched a combined attack, and A Dai scored near the goal, making it two to zero. Shortly after, A Dai scored again, ending the first half with Donghua leading by three goals.

Like Entering an Unoccupied Land

After the break, Donghua replaced Zhuang Youren with Li Ning and Chen Mingzhe with Han Longhai. Donghua's offense became even stronger, and the British Navy's defense loosened. Donghua was like entering an unoccupied land. Before a minute had passed, Sun Jinshun scored first, making it four to zero. Then, Longhai scored twice in two minutes, bringing the cumulative score to six to zero. Suddenly, the British Navy's Remit committed a handball, resulting in a penalty kick. Youliang took the kick, deliberately shooting wide, as he did not want to increase the score too much. However, the British sailors were out of luck, and their defense was full of loopholes. He Dai and Longhai then scored again, making it eight to zero. The British Navy still had a blank sheet. At 22 minutes, the British army counterattacked, and Donghua seemingly allowed it. Bow Nalai scored, pulling back a goal (8-1). But within two minutes, A Dai immediately returned the favor. In the last ten minutes, Longhai scored two more goals, ending the entire game with a total score of eleven to one. Donghua won a landslide victory.

Donghua Team:

Liu Xianhan, Zhuang Youren (replaced by Li Ning), Zhang Lingen, Han Longbo, Xin Fuzhen, Yu Qaxing, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang (replaced by Chen Mingzhe)

After strengthening their efforts, Pengju scored a penalty kick after Yuanlong committed a foul, making it eight to one. Afterwards, Renyu gradually gained momentum, and the score gradually narrowed. At the end of the first half, Dahua led with thirteen to eight.

Changing sides to fight again, Renyu's situation gradually changed, and the connection became tighter. Shen Pengju and Wang Huaiding scored successively, and Wenyi scored a penalty, resulting in a tie. Soon after, Wenyi made a throw and a penalty, achieving dual merits again. Renyu took the lead with sixteen to thirteen. Dahua fell into chaos, throwing the ball in vain and gaining nothing. When Shaoqing sneaked into the basket, Renyu's scoreboard was already at twenty.

Question of Whether the Names of the Elected Are Valid

New Interpretation

### Excessive Wartime Damage and High Electricity Generation Costs: Zhabei Water & Electricity Company Explains Reasons for Higher Approved Electricity Rates

Military and Government Agencies' Waste of Water and Electricity is Especially Problematic

The Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has carefully considered the city's electricity rates and decided to adjust them starting from the first of this month. Since the Zhabei Water & Electricity Company generates some of its own electricity, with a cost of over 300 yuan per kilowatt-hour, the approved electricity price is set at 6 yuan per kilowatt-hour higher than the French, Chinese, and Pudong companies. A reporter, noting the price differences within the same city, visited the Zhabei Water & Electricity Company to inquire. The person in charge stated: "During the war in Shanghai, our company was occupied by the enemy and puppet regimes, and all engineering equipment suffered enormous losses. Since resuming operations, we have been burdened with debt from the initial efforts to organize repairs and restore power generation facilities. The approved water and electricity rates are far from sufficient to cover costs, resulting in significant losses. Although the municipal authorities have adjusted the electricity rates this time, it is still insufficient to cover costs. The price of coal for public utilities has increased from 30,000 yuan to 85,000 yuan per ton, and the cost of generating electricity independently is over 300 yuan per kilowatt-hour. Even at the highest electricity rate, it cannot cover the costs. What is particularly difficult is that our company's service area is vast, and the lines are widely distributed. During the war, most of the houses in this area were used by enemy troops and foreign residents. After their surrender and retreat, they were all allocated to our military and government agencies and their families. They owe a total of over 600 million yuan in water and electricity bills, all of which are delayed in payment. Unauthorized connections are also rampant, and the waste of water and electricity is unlimited, causing frequent transformer failures due to overload. Recently, the municipal authorities, due to insufficient power supply, have established measures to restrict electricity use. However, enforcing these measures on military and government agencies is very difficult. On one hand, we hope that all agencies will conserve resources, but if water and electricity bills cannot be paid according to regulations, it will inevitably hinder the advancement of our business. Our company believes that without a fundamental solution to the problem of unpaid water and electricity bills and unauthorized connections by military and government agencies and their families, the allocation of public power will never be rational. We are currently appealing to the authorities."

### Standards for Ordering New Ships: Aviation Industry Hopes for Revision

Impractical Regulations by the Ministry of Communications

[This Newspaper Report] Since the Ministry of Communications stipulated the standards for the civil aviation industry to order new ships, the aviation industry believes that they are somewhat impractical. For example, in terms of ship age, the regulations stipulate that it cannot exceed 28 years. However, in fact, most of the ships purchased according to this regulation were hastily built during the First World War and may not be durable. Similarly, the Liberty ships built during the war are not ideal ships for peacetime. The aviation industry is currently negotiating with the Ministry of Communications, hoping to make appropriate revisions to various regulations.

### This Newspaper and China National Aviation Corporation: Dispatch Aircraft to Celebrate Birthday: Fly Over Beijing and Shanghai: Distribute 150,000 Birthday Greeting Flyers in Both Locations

[This Newspaper Report] Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, this newspaper and the China National Aviation Corporation jointly dispatched a special birthday celebration plane to fly over Shanghai and distribute colorful birthday greeting flyers. In the afternoon, it flew directly to the capital to pay respects. A reporter from this newspaper accompanied the flight to inspect. The plane was a silver-white C-47, with a giant "longevity" character painted in vermillion red on the belly, surrounded by a square frame. The wingtips and tail were tied with red and green silk ribbons several feet long. The plane, piloted by Mr. Chen Wenhui, chief pilot of the China National Aviation Corporation, took off at 10:50 AM. It flew along the Huangpu River and the Bund, over Hongkou, the North Railway Station, and the racetrack. The racetrack, considered the center of the city, was circled several times to distribute 100,000 birthday greeting flyers. For a moment, colorful paper flew in the air, creating a dazzling scene. Looking down from an altitude of 700 feet, the crowds moving on Nanjing Road and Xizang Road appeared particularly excited. The neatly arranged teams on the racetrack lawn also waved to welcome the plane. At 11:20 AM, the plane landed at the airport to rest.

At 12:45 PM, the plane took off again and headed towards the capital. At an altitude of 3,000 feet and a speed of 130 miles per hour, it flew westward against the headwind over the early autumn fields. At 1:30 PM, it passed through Wuxi. Having learned in advance that the Chairman was in Wuxi to avoid birthday celebrations, it flew low over the city center to show respect. The crowds of people in the park were clearly visible below. At approximately 2:00 PM, it crossed a range of hills, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum appeared to the lower right of the aircraft. At 2:20 PM, it landed at Ming Palace Airport.

After a short rest, the plane ascended and flew over the city, distributing 50,000 birthday greeting flyers. The streets of the capital were filled with pedestrians, especially teams from various organizations and schools, appearing like a swarm of ants. There was even more congestion in front of the Lishi Society, creating a New Year's atmosphere.

At 3:30 PM, the plane returned with the tailwind, making the journey even faster. In just over an hour, it arrived in the western suburbs of Shanghai. At 4:45 PM, it safely landed at Longhua Airport.

[Another Report] To celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 60th birthday, the Air Force stationed in Shanghai flew a trainer aircraft from Jiangwan Airport at 9:30 AM yesterday, circling over the city and scattering colorful paper birthday wishes for an hour before returning to its base.

### Xue Jianqiu, Kidnapped Twice, Admits to Serving as Enemy Translator: Claims to Have Participated Under Orders: Prosecutor Indicts Him for Numerous Crimes

[This Newspaper Report] Xue Jianqiu, who was previously kidnapped by bandits and rescued by the police, was reported as a traitor. After investigation and prosecution by the Higher Procuratorate, the High Court held a hearing yesterday. The prosecutor's indictment stated that the defendant served as a translator for the Meiji Agency in Zhuji County. Relying on the power of the enemy and puppet regimes, he forcibly occupied civilian houses in the Jiangjia Lane of Heng Street in Zhuji and opened the East Asia Company for the enemy, serving as its manager. He also privately opened the Yongming Company, specializing in collecting materials such as wood, copper, iron, and oil for the enemy. He also led enemy and puppet troops in looting cattle and property from the villages of Shaojiang, Dalian, Changtai, Changhe, and Changyi in the county, burning more than a dozen houses belonging to Zhou Qiaonan, Shou Yongsui, Yu Jinhao, and He Xiaoqiao. He beat to death an old woman, Shou Chen, and injured more than a dozen villagers, including Shou Yongsui. He also extorted 500,000 yuan from each bao (neighborhood unit) in Dalian Township, including Licun in the first bao, Yangjiaduntou, Jiujiang Temple, Zhaojiabu Jianggao in the second bao, Shenjia in the third bao, Shanhou in the seventh bao, Zhoujiaping Qingta in the eighth bao, and Xiashantou Huashan in the ninth bao. The defendant, wearing a gray woolen robe, Western-style pants, yellow leather shoes, with his hair styled and wearing rimless glasses, looked like a college student. He stated: He is 33 years old, originally from Fujian, and lives at 99 Peng Road. He used to work as a peddler and is now unemployed. His father was an overseas Chinese in Japan, so he grew up in Japan and attended elementary school in Tokyo. He returned to China at the age of eleven. He admitted to serving as a translator for the Meiji Agency in Zhuji, claiming it was under the orders of Bi Gaokui of the Military Statistics Bureau. Later, he opened the Yongming Company, engaging in the peddling of daily necessities. From the autumn of 1943 to the spring of 1944, he also served as the manager of the Southeast Company branch, a joint Chinese-Japanese venture that bought and sold timber. After the victory, others mistakenly believed he was a traitor and thought he had money, so he was kidnapped twice. The first time was in Hangzhou last September, kidnapped by Yang Songshan, Yang Shiyu, etc. He never paid the ransom and was rescued by Bi Gaokui. The second time was on July 25 of this year, kidnapped in front of the Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan on Er Ma Road and Jiujiang Road. The mastermind was Zhang Xifu, who initially demanded 20 million, then reduced it to 10 million, but he refused. The police solved the case. Because the two attempted kidnappings and extortions failed, they attributed everything done by the enemy and puppet regimes to him. The court ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing. When Xue met with his elderly mother, he stroked her shoulders and cried, exchanging a few words before being escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.

### Embezzlement of Public Funds for Prostitution: Desertion and Escape Leads to Arrest

### Black Market for Cotton Yarn Persists: Textile Control Committee Seeks to Eliminate It: Four Resolutions Transferred to Cotton Textile Association: Meeting on Saturday to Formulate Implementation Measures

[This Newspaper Report] The Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs held its ninth regular meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Chairman Wu, Vice Chairman Li, and committee members Wang Yangxian, Yang Xiren, Wang Qiyu, Guo Dihuo, Tang Xinghai, Rong Hongyuan, and Liu Wenteng, director of the committee's business department, were present. Chairman Wu gave a speech, stating that since the third phase of cotton yarn distribution began, the black market for cotton yarn has persisted. He hoped that in addition to the more than 12,000 bales of cotton yarn that had already been distributed, the remaining yarn in stock should continue to be supplied to the market at the agreed price, in order to eliminate the black market. Discussions then began, and four resolutions were ultimately decided: (1) Whether futures or not, starting from October 25th, all sales should be made at the agreed price of 1.75 million yuan for 20-count yarn. If there were differences in the previous futures prices, the differences should be adjusted. (2) Except for futures buyers who have priority, the remaining yarn cannot be refused for sale. (3) The quantity of cotton yarn exported by each factory should be reported to the committee for record. (4) Whether futures or spot goods, the names, addresses, and quantities of the buyers should be recorded in detail and reported to the committee for record. The above resolutions were handed over to committee member Wang Qiyu to be submitted to the board meeting of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association, which will be held this Saturday, for discussion and formulation of implementation measures.

### Increase Quantity Transported to the South

There were also several other resolutions, including: (1) Increasing the quantity of yarn and cloth transported to the south. According to a survey by the Textile Control Committee, yarn prices are currently the highest in South China. Moreover, the originally scheduled quantity of yarn and cloth transported to the south was insufficient to meet the consumption demand in that region. It was resolved to increase the yarn quantity by 2,000 bales, bringing the total to 4,967 bales. The cloth quantity will be increased by 35,000 bolts, bringing the total to 110,647 bolts. The Textile Control Committee is now conducting a survey of the production and consumption of yarn and cloth throughout the country in order to compile a master table, and then allocate the distribution in a unified manner. The allocation quantity will be adjusted according to the supply and demand situation in various regions.

### Regulations on Yarn Merchant Profits

(2) Regulations on Yarn Merchant Profits: The wholesale price should not exceed 5% of the agreed price. For 20-count yarn, this means it should not exceed 1,837,000 yuan. The retail price should not exceed 10%. For 20-count yarn, this means it should not exceed 1,925,000 yuan. The other counts should be calculated proportionally. (3) The price of yarn distributed in the first week of the third phase will be based on the price agreed upon by the Price Negotiation Committee of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association. Starting next week, the yarn will be distributed according to the price list previously drafted by the Textile Control Committee. The prices are as follows: 10-count 1,520,000 yuan, 12-count 1,580,000 yuan, 16-count 1,620,000 yuan, 20-count 1,750,000 yuan, 32-count 2,320,000 yuan, 32-count double-ply 2,610,000 yuan, 40-count 2,770,000 yuan, 42-count 2,770,000 yuan, 42-count double-ply 2,790,000 yuan. The total amount of yarn distributed in the first half of the third phase is 12,004.5 bales, starting from October 26 and ending on November 10. The distribution of yarn in the second half of the third phase will begin on November 11.

The Textile Control Committee has completed the review of the data for the yarn and cloth manufacturers transporting goods to the south. However, many of the distributors' data deviate significantly from the committee's standards. It has now been decided to slightly lower the standards and conduct another review.

Foreign stocks were quite excited yesterday due to news that auctions in Hong Kong may resume by the middle of next month. Demand exceeded supply, resulting in gains of around 10% for Ewo Yarns, British United Paper, Ewo Brewery, and Asian stocks, and gains of slightly less than 10% for Jardine Matheson, Hong Kong & Whampoa Dock, and Guangdong Steel. Paper stocks rose by slightly less than 15%.

### Government Bonds Weaken

Government bonds weakened yesterday as some accounts and Fuyuan sold off shares. Trading volume was around 4 million yuan. Tongbing opened at 1,930 yuan, but as supply exceeded demand, it fell back to 1,800 yuan before stabilizing slightly. At noon, it hovered around 1,850 yuan, ultimately closing 100 yuan lower than the previous close. Jiayi, Yi, and Ding fell by slightly less than 30 yuan each, and Tongwu fell by 40 yuan.

### Tight Credit and Weak Sales: Yarn and Cloth Both Decline

The yarn market fell across the board yesterday. Factories allocated yarn were either forced by tight credit or because the count did not match the intended use, secretly selling on the yarn market. All yarns 42-count and below fell by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. In addition, actual sales in the interior were extremely weak, and quotations from Guangdong and Hankou were stagnant. Consequently, the Shanghai brokers were cautious.

Yesterday, Textile Construction Company opened six types of fine cloth and four types of serge. The prices of the fine cloth were 1,000 yuan lower than the last resolution. The Four Gentlemen serge remained at the original price due to processing costs. Very few people came to place orders. Sales to customers from other provinces have disappeared in recent days. Local traders are also unwilling to take in the goods due to the tight credit situation at the end of the month. In addition, retail sales in the city are weak due to the mild weather, so market prices have not improved. The price of Tiao Li bleaching cloth had fallen to as low as 90,000 yuan in the past two days. Yesterday, small buyers from Hankou absorbed some of the supply, and the price rebounded to 92,500 yuan, demonstrating the close relationship between supply and demand and prices.
