### Temporary Meeting of the Political Consultative Council Standing Committee; Discussion of Draft General Budget; Meeting Continues This Morning for Deliberation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The temporary meeting of the Political Consultative Council Standing Committee was held at 9:00 AM on the 30th on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall. Twenty-seven councilors attended, including Kong Geng, Wu Yifang, Chen Qitian, Luo Heng, Fu Sinian, and Su Ting. Mo Dehui chaired the meeting. The Secretariat first reported on the letter from the Secretariat of the Supreme National Defense Council forwarding the draft general budget of the Central Government for the 36th year, requesting deliberation.

### Xu Kan Attends and Reports on National Policy Guidelines

The draft was then discussed. Director-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics Xu Kan reported on the compilation and auditing method of the national budget for the 36th year, and reported on the national policy guidelines to be implemented in conjunction with the appropriations for the 36th year: (1) to initiate constitutional government, promote democratic politics, and establish people's representative bodies at all levels; (2) to strengthen local self-government, restore local order, and enable the people to live and work in peace; (3) to increase tax revenue and reduce unnecessary expenditures, so that finance will gradually return to normal; (4) to restore transportation, enhance transport capacity, and subsidize industrial and commercial development to increase production; (5) to implement farmland improvement, increase agricultural production, regulate agricultural finance, and strive to improve the lives of farmers; (6) to quickly restore schools at all levels to their original state and provide schooling opportunities for out-of-school youth; and (7) to reorganize the national army in accordance with the army reorganization and unification plan, to achieve the nationalization of the army.

### Finance Minister Yu Hongjun Answers Inquiries from Councilors

Finance Minister Yu Hongjun then supplemented the explanation, and various councilors raised questions and opinions, which Yu answered on the spot. In summary: regarding methods to increase production, the government has paid attention to agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, and the budget already includes over 153 billion for construction expenses. Because the Assets Committee is now independent, the Ministry of Economic Affairs' jurisdiction is limited to economic administration, and the Assets Committee's budget is over 230 billion. Regarding the apparently low budget for education and culture, a comparison with the 35th year will reveal a significant percentage increase, as the 35th year was only over 40 billion, while the 36th year is over 340 billion. The clearing of industries in the Northeast and how to handle Northeast circulating notes are under careful consideration and should not pose major problems.

### Special Committee Formed to Investigate Shanghai Plane Crash

Five temporary motions were then passed. Three of them concerned the request that the government thoroughly investigate the Shanghai plane crash. The following three measures were decided upon: (1) the Standing Committee will organize a special committee to go to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the accident; (2) the government is requested to promptly punish the persons in charge of the China and Central airlines; and (3) the two companies are instructed to promptly compensate the families of the deceased and the injured.

### Take Effective Steps to Protect Overseas Chinese in Vietnam

The other two motions were proposed by Councilor Luo Heng: (1) the government is requested to promptly protest to the Vietnamese government and take effective steps to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese in Vietnam; and (2) the government is requested to promptly devise concrete measures and instruct the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to promptly assist the refugees in Beijing, by issuing winter clothing, establishing dining halls and heating facilities, and cracking down on all illegal acts of embezzlement. It was resolved to send the motions to the government for earnest handling. The general budget proposal for the 36th year will continue to be deliberated at a meeting on the morning of the 31st. Minister Peng Denies Rumors Again

### Adjusting Foreign Exchange is Nonsense

Minister Peng Denies Rumors Again

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department once again refuted rumors at a press conference on the 30th, dismissing reports of foreign exchange adjustments as nonsense spread by speculators. He emphasized that the current serious economic problem lies in the severe destruction in various regions and the difficulty of reconstruction, leading to the decline of industry and commerce and the bankruptcy of rural areas. Therefore, to get to the root of the problem and solve the current economic difficulties, relying solely on financial methods will not be sufficient.

### Total Expenditures for Next Year Exceed 930 Billion; Military Spending Accounts for Over 40 Percent

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 30th. Minister Peng gave a detailed explanation of the budget for the coming year, stating that the budget is currently under review by the Political Consultative Council. After the Political Consultative Council reviews it, the Supreme National Defense Council will make the final decision. According to the analysis of the draft, there are approximately the following key points: (1) total expenditures are approximately 933.2 billion; (2) military expenses are 388.1 billion, accounting for over 40 percent of total expenditures; (3) construction expenditures are approximately over 15 billion, of which transportation expenses are approximately over 109 billion, state-owned industrial expenses are approximately over 23 billion, and the remainder is for agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and health; (4) education expenses are over 34 billion, more than four times higher than last year. Subsidies for overseas Chinese education, military education, and private schools are not included. Although they account for only 3 percent of total expenditures, the ratio is higher if various special expenditures are excluded; (5) rehabilitation and relief expenses are approximately 144 billion, of which the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration accounts for 16 billion; (6) subsidies for provinces and cities total 69 billion; (7) the second reserve fund is listed at over 4 billion, and retirement and pension expenses for civil servants are listed at 4.5 billion; (8) party expenses are not listed; (9) the total revenue is over 70 billion, more than three times higher than in the 35th year, of which tax revenue is over 36 billion, also more than three times higher. Revenue from the sale of materials and assets is over 2 billion, including enemy and puppet assets and surplus materials purchased by our government from the U.S. military. Revenue from the surplus of state-owned enterprises is approximately 9 billion, of which the Aviation Company contributes over 4 billion and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company contributes over 1.1 billion. The shortfall of over 22 billion will be made up by debt revenue. It is hoped that order and security in some northern provinces can be restored as soon as possible, and that transportation can be opened as soon as possible, so that financial deficits can be made up and the economy can be revived without difficulty.

### Fu Sinian to Go Abroad Next Spring

Plans to Go to the United States for Medical Treatment Due to High Blood Pressure

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Fu Sinian plans to go to the United States for medical treatment for high blood pressure in early spring next year when the weather warms. Fu denied rumors that Hu Shi would become the Minister of Education in the reorganized government, believing that there was no such thing. Fu believed that the outrage taken by the student community over the rape of a Peking University female student by a U.S. soldier was a natural response, and that the U.S. military should be severely punished.

### Two Locations on the Banks of the Yalu River to be Withdrawn by Soviet Troops to Korean Territory Next Month; Temporary Agreement to be Made Before Withdrawal

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 30th] Regarding the Soviet Embassy's reply to our Foreign Ministry on the withdrawal of Soviet troops stationed along the Yalu River, according to what our reporter has learned, there are over 20 Soviet troops stationed at the Lagu whistle dike over 100 li northeast of Andong City, and a unit of Soviet troops is stationed at the bridgehead of the Sea Line River, which is connected to Manho in Korea, over 20 li north of Ji'an. The Soviet side claimed that the Soviet troops in the Lagu whistle area were there to protect the Shuifeng Power Plant on the opposite bank and the safety of our dike, so a temporary agreement with us is required before the withdrawal. Our side will negotiate with the Third Pacification Zone, and Xu Kezhang, a staffer from the Shenyang Diplomatic Commissioner's Office, will be sent to inspect. It is said that after the two sides reach an agreement in Andong, the Soviet troops in the two locations will withdraw to Korean territory in early January.

### After Consultation and Decision by Various Parties, the Government Will Proceed with Reorganization; Minister Peng Talks at Press Conference

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Regarding the issue of government reorganization, Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department answered reporters' questions at a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 30th, stating that the government has invited various parties attending the National Assembly to participate in the government. Now these parties have held separate meetings to discuss, and only after they have made a decision can the foundation for expanding the government's organization and reorganizing the two Yuan be discussed and carried out. As for whether the government is considering extending a formal invitation to the Communist Party and the Democratic League, if the Communist Party and the Democratic League show signs of willingness to participate in the work of reorganizing the government, the government will not hesitate to send an invitation immediately. Peng also stated that Zhou Enlai's remarks that he does not recognize the Constitution are a baseless disparagement, as the achievements of this National Assembly's constitutional drafting work and the democratic advantages of the Constitution's contents are obvious to all and widely praised throughout the world. The Communist Party's attitude has been poor recently, and there is absolutely no intention of cooperation. The government has not yet considered sending anyone to Yan'an.

### Democratic Socialist Party's Position on the Current Situation: Immediately Resume Peace Talks Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party

[Central News Agency, This City] The Democratic Socialist Party issued six points on its position on the current situation, excerpts of which are as follows:

First, the ceasefire order should be thoroughly implemented by both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the Executive Group should participate.

Second, peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should be resumed immediately. The government authorities should send personnel to Yan'an, or invite the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party to Beijing, to discuss everything.

Third, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should resolve issues regarding local governments and troop stationing inside and outside the Great Wall with the greatest forbearance.

Fourth, in accordance with the military reorganization plan, the nationalization of the army should be earnestly implemented.

Fifth, after a foundation is obtained in the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations, it should be expanded into a national party conference. Various powerful democratic groups should also be invited to participate, to discuss all political issues and lay the foundation for the rule of law.

Sixth, from now on, the government should immediately, in accordance with the Constitution passed by this National Assembly, earnestly protect the basic freedoms of the people's body, speech, association, and academic study. In other words, it should earnestly end the Kuomintang's one-party rule.

[Another Dispatch] Zhong Changwei Wu Xianzai, Xu Fulin, Jiang Yuntian, Li Daming, Feng Jinbai, Tang Zhuxin, Sun Baoyi, and others of the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party held an important meeting at Zhang Zai's residence in Fan Yuan yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, chaired by Zhang Junmai. The main topic of discussion was the Democratic Socialist Party's attitude toward the current situation. The meeting adjourned around 6:00 PM.

[Central News Agency, This City] Zuo Shunsheng expressed his views on the issue of government reorganization, hoping that the overall situation would not be dragged on for too long.

[Our Dispatch] Zhang Junmai visited Zuo Shunsheng again on the evening of the 30th. The content of the conversation is unknown. Zuo is scheduled to leave for Beijing by train on the evening of the 31st.

### Central Political Committee to be Established Soon; Standing Committee Passes Organizational Regulations for the Committee's Secretariat; Chairmen of Ji and Sui Provinces Already Appointed

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The 48th meeting of the Central Standing Committee was held in the National Government Conference Room at 11:00 AM on the morning of the 30th, following the Central Memorial Week. Member Yu Youren chaired the meeting and passed the organizational regulations for the Secretariat of the Central Political Committee, etc. The Second Plenary Session had previously resolved to establish the Central Political Committee, which is subordinate to the Central Executive Committee. Its organizational regulations had been amended by the 30th meeting of the Central Standing Committee. It is reported that the committee will be formally established soon. The Central Standing Committee also passed the following cases today: (1) adjusting the pension for martyrs and party members; (2) Wang Renwei, chairman of the Hebei Provincial Executive Committee, was appointed as the speaker of the Hebei Provincial Provisional Assembly and resigned, which was approved, and Comrade Wang Bingjun was appointed to replace him; and (3) Zuo Yi, chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial Executive Committee, was transferred to serve as the chairman of the Chahar Province, and cannot serve concurrently. The committee member Pan Xiuren was reassigned to replace him.

### Pensions for Martyrs and Party Members to be Adjusted; Central Standing Committee Resolves

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The Central Standing Committee passed a resolution today to adjust the pensions for martyrs and party members. The main points are as follows: The Central Pension Committee will increase the amount of pensions for martyrs and party members, and the amount for this year will be issued at 100 times the amount stipulated by regulations. One-time pensions and one-time subsidies will still be appropriately increased with reference to the assessment. The assessed amount for special pensions will be increased to 200,000 yuan. However, the pensions for civil servants this year have been increased to 500 times the original amount. For example, someone with a monthly income of 800 yuan receives an annual pension of 480,000 yuan, while the highest annual pension for party members is only 90,000 yuan, a huge difference. There is a need for adjustment. The following three measures have been decided: (1) starting from the 36th year, all annual pensions and annual subsidies for martyrs and party members will be issued at 500 times the amount stated on the certificate; (2) one-time pensions and one-time subsidies will still be appropriately increased with reference to the assessment, but the assessed amount for special pensions will be increased to 1,000,000 yuan; and (3) if necessary due to factual needs in the middle of the 36th year, adjustments may be made again with reference to the civil servant pension increase measures.

### Sino-Soviet Aviation Company to Increase Airfare

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 30th] The Sino-Soviet Aviation Company flights between Hami in our country and Almaty in the Soviet Union will soon increase airfare. Currently, a full ticket from Hami to Almaty on the company's flights costs only over 5,000 yuan in national currency, 1,500 yuan for the Hami line within our country, and over 2,500 yuan for the Diyi line. After the price increase, a full ticket will cost over 350,000 yuan. The company is a joint venture between China and the Soviet Union, and the ten-year term will expire in 1949.

### Incident of U.S. Warship in Dalian

Soviet Union Accuses U.S. Reporter of Fabricating Facts

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 30th] The Zhenli Bao today published a TASS news item from the 26th, describing the arrival of a U.S. dispatch ship in Dalian, stating that the U.S. dispatch ship was actually a warship, and that the U.S. reporter Newton's reports on this incident and the Soviet Union's "ultimatum" to the U.S. warship were clearly deliberately fabricated to sensationalize the news. The news item stated that the Soviet side in Dalian did not receive notice of the U.S. warship's arrival at the port until the evening of December 18, while the U.S. warship had already arrived in Dalian. The U.S. Embassy in Nanjing had notified the Soviet Embassy that the ship was only carrying letters to the U.S. Consul in Dalian and did not mention that it was carrying passengers. However, the ship was actually carrying two U.S. reporters and a representative from the Mobil Oil Company. Since the Soviet side did not receive notification that the ship was carrying passengers, it refused to allow them to land. The ship remained in Dalian for several hours after the 48-hour deadline given by the Soviet side, waiting for the ship's captain, who had been summoned ashore by the U.S. Consul.

### China and the Soviet Union are Not in a State of War with Japan; We Have the Right to Take Over Dalian; U.S. Policy Toward China Will Urge the Soviet Union to Abide by the Sino-Soviet Agreement

[United Press, Nanjing, 30th] Foreign Ministry spokesman Ye Gongchao told the press today that the Soviet Embassy officially notified the National Government on May 23, stating that the Soviet army had completely withdrawn from the nine eastern provinces on May 3, 1946, and that "Dalian is of course an integral part of the nine eastern provinces," so the Soviet government has "handed over its continued control of Dalian in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty." Ye declined to explain the details of the Chinese Communist Party's obstruction of the government, but reiterated that this is the only reason why the National Government has not yet taken over Dalian. He also said: "We believe that there is currently no state of war between China and the Soviet Union and Japan. China has the full right to take over Dalian according to law. Government troops advanced to within a few miles of Dalian several weeks ago and stopped attacking. This was clearly out of fear of a possible conflict with the Soviet garrison, not because of the presence of communist troops in the area."

[United Press, New York, 30th] The American Policy Association on China has objected to State Department spokesman Whitsell's claim that the Soviet Union should have military control over Dalian. The association demanded that the U.S. government should force the Soviet Union to comply with the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, which states that when direct conflicts cease, China shall have the full right to deal with matters relating to the civilian population.

### Communist Military Mobilization Frequent in the Northeast; Tension Still High Around Baoding; Government Troops in Western Shanxi Continue to Recover Ma Dou Pass

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 30th] It is reported that there have been conflicts between government and communist troops in Dongjiaohe, Jilin, and the flames of war seem to be pointing towards Dunhua. It is also reported that Ji'an in southeast Tonghua has long been in the hands of government troops.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th] It is reported that communist military mobilization has been frequent in the Northeast recently. In the Yangjiadian and Sandao Gou areas near Huadian, a unit of the 24th Brigade of communist troops, about 2,000 people, has been secretly moved from Yanji. About three regiments of the 2nd Communist Army, one-third of whom are Koreans, have recently sneaked into the villages in southern Huadian. Mu Ling Liu Shouqi seems to have intentions of invading Huadian.

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 30th] The outskirts of Baoding are still tight. The number of communist troops 15 li outside the city has increased to 60,000. After the communist troops in Huangxie withdrew, the government troops gave up their garrison. On the 29th, more than 10,000 communist troops were transferred from southern Baoding and western Hebei to the vicinity of Fangshun Bridge, surrounding Wangdu.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 30th] After capturing Yonghe and Taining, the communist troops in southwestern Shanxi went on to occupy Ma Dou Pass in order to connect with Yan'an and form a transportation route, thereby controlling the entire western Shanxi. In addition to the government troops recovering Da Ning on the 24th, they also recovered Ma Dou Pass on the 27th.

### Hu Shih Returns to Beiping, Dongdan Incident Relatively Milder Than Before, Student Parade Also Passes Peacefully

[Our Newspaper Beiping 30th Dispatch] Due to Hu Shih's return to Beiping to preside over Beida's affairs, the Dongdan incident's situation has become relatively milder than before. After Hu's return, he immediately discussed with the Beiping Xingyuan the method for resolving the case of American soldiers raping female students. At 5 PM that evening, he also convened an administrative meeting of Beida. Today, Hu met with reporters and expressed his attitude towards the case, saying: "This time, the American soldiers' rape of female students has made students, professors, and myself extremely indignant. Asking them to hold meetings and parades is all permissible, but boycotting classes will delay their studies, which is not appropriate. This unfortunate incident is a legal issue, while the withdrawal of American troops from China is a political issue, and the two should not be discussed together. The remedial solutions proposed by the American military are probably acceptable, but they should be resolved quickly and not delayed. The American military does not understand the characteristics of Eastern morality, so they may not yet understand the Chinese people's indignation."

[Our Newspaper Beiping 30th Telegram] Hu Shih flew back to Beiping from Nanjing at 2:10 PM today. Hu denied to reporters the rumors that he would be appointed as the Premier of the Executive Yuan or Minister of Education. Before leaving Nanjing, he did not participate in discussions on the Inner Mongolia issue. He said: "All rumors about me are untrue. I am currently focusing on the research of the 'Shui Jing Zhu' [Commentary on the Water Classic], and have already written three prefaces to the 'Shui Jing Zhu'." A reporter asked whether the current National Assembly was a manifestation of China's politics moving towards democracy. Hu replied: "This National Assembly is a large training class or university. Given the vastness of China, it is not easy for representatives from various regions to gather in one place and even understand each other's speech. This can be said to be a good preliminary training."

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 30th Telegram] Hu Shih returned to Beiping from Nanjing by a Central Aviation aircraft at 11:00 AM on the 30th. Fu Sinian, Yang Lianggong, and others went to the airport to see him off. Before departing, Hu told reporters that because there were many school affairs to be dealt with, he would not come south for the time being after returning to Beiping. He was not yet aware of the details of the American soldiers case in Beiping, and would handle it according to the law. A reporter asked about the people of Anhui requesting a change of the provincial chairman, and Hu replied that he hoped a civil official faction would be sent to preside over it.

[Central News Agency Beiping 30th Telegram] Students from various universities in Beiping went on strike for one day today and held a parade in the afternoon to protest the American soldiers' brutal rape of a female student. More than 2,000 students from parts of eight schools, including Beida, Tsinghua, Yanjing, Fu Jen, Normal College, Sino-French University, Jiaotong University, and Chaoyang University, gathered at Beida at 1:00 PM and set off for the parade at 1:30 PM. They passed through Huangchenggen, Donghua Gate, Wangfujing, Shuaifuyuan, Dongdan, and Xianmen, turned back to Nan Chizi and Bei Chizi, and returned to Beida to disperse. The parade procession lingered at the entrance of the military mediation department for a relatively long time. The order along the way was very good. In the afternoon, more than 30 student representatives from various schools went to Xingyuan to petition. Yanjing representative Ma Jianxing and Tsinghua representative Li Zhongli entered to present their opinions. Director Li of Xingyuan was out on official business, and Section Chief Zhang met with them on his behalf, promising to forward the written appeal. The representatives then withdrew and returned to school.

[Our Newspaper Beiping 30th Telegram] Today, the parade of students in Beiping passed peacefully. In advance, the U.S. Marine Corps had instructed all U.S. troops in Dongdan not to go out. Several thick iron chains were tied at the entrance of the Dongdan U.S. military barracks to prevent U.S. troops from going out and to prevent students from rushing in. The police authorities were strictly on guard in Dongjiaomin Lane. The American residence (i.e., the current U.S. Consulate) was guarded by Chinese police. All the main intersections leading to various places in the Dongjiaomin Lane area were guarded by many police officers, and fire hydrants were prepared to prevent any emergencies. The iron gate of the military mediation department was tightly closed, and even the gaps in the door were sealed with student slogans. More than two hundred students from China University also joined the parade, but their views were different. Fortunately, due to the disparity in numbers, no new incidents were caused. Today, a small number of police officers maintained order along with the main group, and their attitude was good. It was heard that Deputy Director Zhu Weiping of the police bureau said: "If the students from Tsinghua and Yanjing are tired from walking back, I can send twenty large trucks to take them."

[Our Newspaper Tianjin 30th Telegram] Nankai and Peiyang Universities in Tianjin have gone on strike starting from the 30th to protest the humiliation of female students in Beiping by American soldiers. On the night of the 29th, the two schools held separate general assemblies of all students and jointly issued a letter to compatriots across the country. The students' emotions were extremely激昂 [激昂 means impassioned]. Nanda decided to organize a committee to protest against the atrocities of the American military, while Peiyang decided to protest to Truman and immediately hold a demonstration parade. This wave is surging and激盪 [激盪 means turbulent].

### UNRRA Various Industrial and Mining Equipment Can Be Shipped to China in Large Quantities Next Spring, Hua Fengxiang's Negotiation Results are Extremely Satisfactory

[Our City News] After the war, China's industrial and mining enterprises are in urgent need of revival, and the government authorities are very concerned about the development and restoration of industrial and mining enterprises. UNRRA has stipulated US$174,500,000 for the relief of industrial and mining equipment to China. Two months ago, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) specially dispatched Hua Fengxiang, chairman of the Industrial and Mining Equipment Business Committee, to the United States to negotiate with the General Administration on the shipment of industrial and mining materials to China. Hua returned to Shanghai the night before last. He told reporters that the negotiation was extremely satisfactory. Industrial and mining equipment worth US$170 million will be shipped to China in large quantities next spring. Currently, CRRRA has received about 20% of the total. Among this industrial and mining equipment, transportation equipment is the largest, accounting for 80% (US$140 million), and the other 20% includes railway, highway, ship, and telecommunications equipment, as well as equipment for coal mines, waterworks, electricity, construction, and machine factories. In addition, there are experimental instruments allocated to the education sector for distribution to schools, all of which are the most urgently needed materials for the restoration of China's industry and mining. Hua continued: The allocation of industrial and mining equipment in relief materials is the most difficult problem to solve. There are many reasons for this, and the most obvious are the following: (1) After the war, all countries in the world need industrial and mining equipment to help their recovery, and although the United States is an industrial country, it is difficult to meet the demand; (2) The waves of coal mine factory strikes came one after another, and the production of industrial and mining equipment was greatly reduced; (3) UNRRA's work will end, and all factories must deliver goods by next summer, which is a short time; (4) China's needs are also very large, and there is a feeling that there is too little porridge for too many monks. However, Hua believes that the results of this trip to the United States are satisfactory. China has submitted a list of required industrial and mining equipment to UNRRA, and 90% has been ordered from factories. Various equipment will flow in next spring. In addition, it has refused to accept surplus materials, because many of the surplus materials are equipment that China does not need and cannot help China's industrial and mining enterprises. Finally, talking about the housing shortage in the United States, Hua believes that the housing shortage in the United States is even more serious than in China.

### The Result of the Soviets Moving Away Factories in the Northeast, Our Industrial Development Regresses, Pauley's Letter to the San Francisco Newspaper Explains

[United Press San Francisco 30th Telegram] The San Francisco newspaper today published a letter from Edwin Pauley, the U.S. reparations commissioner, explaining that after Japan's surrender, the Soviet Union moved away industrial equipment from the Northeast, causing the Northeast's industry to come to a standstill, and even causing China's industrial development to regress for several generations. The newspaper's editorial recently analyzed Pauley's proposal to move away Japanese industrial equipment, as well as the economic situation in the East, so Pauley wrote to the newspaper's editor to explain: "The opinion that the Northeast's industry must be restored to its former state, otherwise the reparations plan will only create a dangerous industrial vacuum, is completely correct. Unfortunately, the Soviet army's removal of equipment from the Northeast during its occupation has greatly hindered the achievement of this goal. The United States' post-war policy in the Far East is to seek China's strength, stability, and unity, and to be economically self-sufficient, so that China can occupy its proper part in the economic development of a peaceful Asia. In the years around the Pearl Harbor incident, the Japanese built a huge industrial organization in the Northeast, which did contribute to Japan's economy. If this organization had remained intact, as it was on the day the Soviet army invaded, and if China had remained peaceful, the Northeast's industry could have quickly assisted China's growing economy and accelerated China's entire industrial development. The enormous capacity of the Northeast's basic industry would have enabled China to quickly absorb the industrial processing equipment that Japan used as reparations. At the same time, this would have eliminated one of the most important sources of Japan's war potential. Japan's defeat reduced its production capacity to peacetime levels, creating an economic vacuum, which China should at least be able to fill part of. However, the damage suffered by the Northeast's industry after Japan's surrender has caused China's industrial development to regress for several generations, and the policy announced by the United States has been greatly hindered. The conflict of interest between Russia and Japan in the Northeast resulted in the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, and Japan acquired Russia's rights in South Manchuria. In 1906, the South Manchuria Railway Company was established, and Japan's exploitation of the Northeast became concrete, expanding from railways to many industries as a driving force to continue penetrating the mainland. In 1931, the Japanese Kwantung Army invaded and occupied the Northeast, establishing Manchukuo and further accelerating its exploitation. The Northeast is a relatively rich place, and the Northeast has abundant reserves of various natural resources that are rare in other parts of Asia. There are only a few vast areas with surplus agricultural production, and the Northeast is one of them.

### The Right of Overseas Chinese Vendors in the Philippines to Operate Can Be Resolved in the Short Term, The Court's Preliminary Trial Orders a Temporary Suspension of the Crackdown

[Central News Agency Manila 30th Telegram] The matter of overseas Chinese vendors retaining the right to operate in local public markets "will be resolved within eight days," at which time the Philippine Secretary of Finance and city government accountants must respond to the application submitted to the court by overseas Chinese vendors protesting the removal of their business locations. According to the court's request, the officials must respond within eight days from the 28th onwards. During this period, the overseas Chinese will continue to hold their stalls.

[Central News Agency Manila 29th Telegram] The Manila District Court yesterday conducted a preliminary hearing on the market case, issuing an order prohibiting the Secretary of Finance, the Director of Finance of Manila, and the owners of various markets from forcibly expelling overseas Chinese from their stalls in the public markets. In the first instance of the case, the vendors won. Judge Ding Glason ruled to temporarily prohibit the Ministry of Finance from implementing its order to crack down on all market stalls on January 1 next year. This ruling stipulates that the vendors can be undisturbed until the court rules on the application of overseas Chinese vendors to declare the Ministry of Finance's order invalid. The applying overseas Chinese must provide a bond of 100,000 pesos (US$50,000). Local overseas Chinese are not enthusiastic about this preliminary victory. Some qualified observers even deeply believe that the overseas Chinese are destined to fail in the final trial of the case. They believe that our government should adopt a more aggressive and firm diplomatic policy and not compromise. "If the negotiations fail, the consequences can be imagined."

### The Sino-Thai Dispute Over the Disposal of Meranti Timber Has Been Resolved Satisfactorily

[Central News Agency Bangkok 28th Telegram] The issue of the disposal of meranti timber, which has recently been disputed between China and Thailand, has been resolved satisfactorily. This batch of meranti timber, totaling more than one million meters and worth 20 million Thai baht, originally belonged to four British companies in this area. After Thailand declared war on Britain and the United States in 1942, it recognized this timber as enemy property and confiscated it, and the Thailand Timber Company, run by the Thai government, auctioned it off. After Thailand and Britain established a friendly treaty, Thailand, in order to fulfill its treaty obligations, issued an order in June of this year to register all meranti timber and prohibit its sale and any changes, so that the above-mentioned timber could be purchased at a low price and returned to the British companies. After the issuance of this order, our overseas Chinese timber merchants and sawmills suffered serious losses due to the suspension of sawing work, timber decay, and falling timber prices. Our embassy in Thailand consulted with the Thai authorities on this matter in October of this year, requesting them to protect the interests of our overseas Chinese. It is reported that the Thai authorities have now agreed to abandon their plan to repurchase this timber purchased by our overseas Chinese merchants and stored in the sawmills of overseas Chinese, and our overseas Chinese timber merchants and sawmills have regained the freedom to trade and engage in sawing.

### Affected by the Situation in Vietnam, The Sino-French Negotiations Made No Progress, Liu Kai Explains the Meaning of "Neutral Zone"

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 30th Telegram] The Sino-French negotiations, which were suspended due to the deteriorating situation in Vietnam, have made no progress in recent days. There have only been some private contacts between the negotiators of both sides. Regarding the issue of overseas Chinese being harmed, Yang Wenzhong and other representatives of overseas Chinese in Vietnam have also gone to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in recent days to request the government to take prompt and effective measures. In addition, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Kai explained the term "neutral zone" at a press conference held by the Central Propaganda Department on the 30th, saying: Overseas Chinese in Vietnam mostly live in concentrated areas. The so-called "neutral zone" is only to ensure that the areas where these overseas Chinese live are not used as combat bases, so as to avoid being destroyed by artillery fire and causing harm to innocent overseas Chinese. (For news about the war in Vietnam, please read page 4).

### The Result of the Committee for Enemy-Occupied Areas Work in the Northeast: Three Liaison Offices Are Established to Handle the Aftermath

[Central News Agency Nanjing 30th Telegram] The Northeast Four Provinces Anti-Enemy Association has long been declared closed. However, since the Committee for Enemy-Occupied Areas under its jurisdiction has not been able to complete its work due to the lack of domestic transportation and unstable order since the victory, resulting in the inability to provide pensions to the dead and the inability of the living to change careers, the committee has recently issued a public notice announcing its closure and handling of the aftermath. Three liaison offices for the closure and aftermath have been temporarily established at No. 9 Yiduo Lane, Beitan Village, Jinan; Xia Nantou Road East, Shenyang; and No. 40 Tongguan Road, Tenth District, Tianjin.

### Our Judge at the Far East International Tribunal, Mei Ru'ao, Returns to Shanghai, Says that the Trial of War Criminals Can Be Completed Next Summer

[Our City News] Dr. Mei Ru'ao, judge and Chinese representative to the Far East International Military Tribunal, departed from Tokyo by U.S. military plane a few days ago. Due to weather conditions, he arrived in Shanghai at night. Yesterday, reporters visited him. According to Mei, the East Asia International Tribunal has been working very actively since the trial began on June 3. However, due to the complexity of the case, the vast scope, and the wide range of involvement, the number of witnesses and exhibits, and the number of documents and files are unprecedented in the history of world justice. In addition, the difficulties in language translation and the thoroughness of the trial procedure have caused the progress to be slower than expected by the general public. Currently, the prosecution has completed providing evidence, and the trial can be considered to have come to an end. Next is the defendant's defense stage, which is expected to begin in mid-January, and finally the evaluation and judgment. It is estimated that the entire work of the court will be completed in May or June. Mei also said that he was sent to the East in March of this year and has been there for nine months. During this time, he was ordered by MacArthur's headquarters to accompany the American judge to China. This time, he is taking advantage of the New Year's holiday to return home to report to the authorities on the organization and current situation of the court, and to collect reference books and materials needed for the trial. When asked about the date of his return to the East, Mei said that the work of the Far East International Tribunal is becoming increasingly tense. The day when the defendant's defense takes the stage is the day when the real duel of international law and justice begins. The Tokyo trial is about to enter a serious stage. At that time, both the defendant and the prosecution will concentrate their minds and show their skills. He decided to take a U.S. military plane back to Japan on January 8 so that he could participate in the 正　決鬥序幕之　, 開 [正　決鬥序幕之　, 開 this appears incomplete and may be a typographical error from the original newspaper, this is translated to 'the opening of the prelude to this duel'].

### Indictment of War Criminal Tani Hisao

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] War criminal Tani Hisao of the Nanjing Massacre case, since being taken into custody by the Ministry of National Defense Military Tribunal, and after successive investigations by Chief Prosecutor Chen Guangyu, together with other prosecutors, has gathered over nine hundred victim and witness statements collected by the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the Nanjing Temporary Council. More than forty people have testified in court. After repeated reports, the case has now been prosecuted. The indictment is excerpted below:

Defendant: Tani Hisao, male, 65 years old, Japanese, residing in Tokyo, military officer.

The above-mentioned defendant's War Criminal Case No. 35, Investigation Division of the 35th year of the Republic of China, has been concluded after investigation. It is deemed that prosecution should be initiated. The facts of the crime, evidence, and legal provisions violated are described as follows:

(1) Facts

Tani Hisao, a resident of Fujimi-cho, Nakano-ku, Tokyo, Japan, graduated from the Japanese Army Academy and the Army University. He was a radical soldier in the Japanese invasion movement, serving his entire life in military posts, including as an instructor and captain in the Army Academy's student brigade, a member of the General Staff Headquarters, and an instructor at the Army University. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, he served as Chief of Staff of the 3rd Division, transferred to Jinan, Shandong, and other places in our country, obstructing our country's unification movement. He was then transferred to the General Staff Headquarters as Chief of the Exercise Section and Chairman of the Military Investigation Committee of the Ministry of the Army. In August of the 26th year of the Republic of China, he led troops to China and fought at the Yongding River under the command of Kashiki. He then advanced towards Baoding and Shijiazhuang. On the way, he allowed his subordinates to arbitrarily rob residents, including Chen Sizhe's family, of twenty-eight boxes of clothing and antiques, as well as redwood furniture and other items, and forced Chinese women to provide sexual comfort. He then joined forces with the reserve troops of the Ushijima Misamatsu Divisions, forming one army called the Yanagawa Corps. After landing at Hangzhou Bay in early November, they advanced from Hangzhou to Kunshan, Taihu Lake, and directly attacked Nanjing, capturing Zhonghua Gate. On the morning of December 13th of that year, they entered the city and were stationed in the area outside Zhonghua Gate. On the 17th and 18th, the criminal participated in the city entry ceremony and memorial service to promote his power and to destroy our country's spirit of resistance and national consciousness. Together with the Nakajima Koso Corps, he launched the Nanjing Massacre, which shocked the world and was an unprecedented catastrophe, with hundreds of thousands of victims. The crimes of his troops during their stay from December 13th to 21st, a period of more than a week, included: first, massacre, including killing more than nine hundred people, such as Li Jinyou, Wang Zhenquan, Chen Jinfu, Zhang Shucheng, Zhou Hongshi, and Han Mashi, by shooting, stabbing, and other cruel methods in places such as Ji'e Suo, Nancun, Shazhouwei, Saihongqiao, Jihecun, Shegongqiao, Shuangqiao, and Yuhuatai outside Zhonghua Gate, and in areas such as Mendong Zhongying, Zhuanlong Lane, Cangmenkou, Jinxiufang, Renhouli, Zhanyuan Road, and Lianziying inside the city. Regarding the reasons for the killings, Wu Xueshi and others were killed for refusing to be drafted, Li Youming and others were killed even after completing their corvée labor, Yin Decai and others were killed for trying to put out fires, and Zhang Gongcai and others were killed for pleading while houses were burning. Li Sunshi was killed for seeking refuge in an air-raid shelter, Han Mashi and dozens of others were killed because they ran out of firewood and rice after being forced to provide them, Zhao Lushi and others were killed for refusing to hand over their daughters, Zhou Zhangshi and others were killed for resisting rape, Yang Liushi and others were raped or gang-raped and then killed, Zhang Shizhun and others were killed for protecting their children, and Wang Ermao was killed for crying after seeing his parents murdered. Regarding the means of killing, Deng Jiajun killed them all at once, Sheng Huailian forced them to kneel and then killed them, Feng Tianxiang and others killed them collectively, Mo Qidong and others tortured them before killing them, Cheng Yongqing stabbed them and then strangled them, and Tong Zhangyu and others were shot and then their bodies were burned. There was nothing that could not be killed, no one who could not be killed, no place where they could not be killed, and no method that could not be used to kill. It was truly a disgrace in the history of modern civilization. Secondly, rape, including raping Chen Ergun and gang-raping Yang Liushi and others, more than forty people in total, in areas such as Shazhouwei, Saihongqiao, and Jiuer Lane, Andemen inside and outside the city. Thirdly, wanton destruction of property, including Sheng Shifu, Zhang Laocun, and more than ten households in the above-mentioned areas. The various crimes are too numerous to mention. After the end of the war, the criminal was arrested in Tokyo, Japan, and was transferred to China by the Chinese delegation in Japan. He was then transferred to the court by the War Criminals Management Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense for investigation.

(2) Reasons

It is found that the defendant devoted his life's energy to promoting Japan's national policy of conquering East Asia by first conquering China. He served as a member of the General Staff Headquarters, Chief of the Exercise Section, and Chairman of the Military Investigation Committee of the Ministry of the Army, participating in the conspiracy of aggression and supporting the aggressive actions against our country. He served as an instructor and captain at the Army Academy, as well as Chief of Staff, Brigade Commander, and Division Commander, training military talents and troops with aggression as their goal. He also advanced troops into our country, obstructed our country's unification movement, infringed upon our country's sovereignty, and participated in the aggressive war against us. This fact can be verified by various actions and announcements by the Japanese Cabinet, such as the Konoe Statement, the Hirota Three Principles, and the East Asia New Order. The report of Honjo Shigeru, commander of the Kwantung Army, to the Japanese Minister of the Army, and the file of war criminal Sakai Takashi, who was ordered by Sakai Takashi, Chief of Staff of the North China Garrison Army, to launch aggressive actions in North China, can be used as evidence. The defendant has also admitted to serving in various positions, and there is a resume written by himself on file as proof, which is consistent with the above. It is found that the defendant, wherever he marched, robbed Chen Sizhe of twenty-eight boxes of clothing and antiques, as well as redwood furniture, in Baoding, Hebei. Near Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing, he extorted firewood and rice from Han Mashi and others, and then killed them when they ran out. Such crimes have been testified by the victim, Chen Sizhe, who is currently a judicial official, and dozens of eyewitnesses, such as Huang Changqing, respectively. The Capital District Procuratorate and the Nanjing Temporary Council have also sent personnel to investigate and verify the facts. It is also found that the defendant raped Zhou Dingshi and Chen Ergun and three others in Shazhouwei inside and outside Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing, raped Liu Shiqin and four others in Saihongqiao, and raped or gang-raped Wu Damu and more than ten others in various places in Jiuer Lane Huangnitang. On the march and in Yuhuatai and other places in Nanjing, he forced Chen Wangshi and others to provide girls for sexual comfort. The above facts have also been testified by the victims or eyewitnesses Chen Shixing, Liu Lishi, Chen Ergun, Wu Lishi, Zhu Xiugu, and Jia Xueshu, who have respectively provided written statements or testified in court, and have been verified by the District Procuratorate and the Temporary Council as true. It is also found that the defendant shot and killed Li Jinyou and three others at Ji'e Suo inside and outside Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing, shot and killed Wang Zhuquan and two others in Nancun, shot and killed Chen Jinfu and four others in Shazhouwei, shot and killed Zhou Xiaoerzi and hundreds of others in various places in Mendong, stabbed Xia Shulan and eight others at Xinlukou, stabbed Zhao Dian and dozens of others in various places in Yuhuatai, and collectively massacred Guangshan and more than eighty others in Zhengjue Temple, Yuhua Road, Shiguanyin, and Sifangcheng. In Tucheng Tou Gao Tibai Village and other places, he tortured and then killed Zhang Lishi, Lao Hou Mo Qidong and others. In West Street and other places, he killed Zhang Zhangyu and others and then burned their bodies. In addition to the witnesses Huang Xiuyin, Lu Long, Wang Wanshi, Lu Zhangshi, Wang Tianshi, Wang Dangyou, and dozens of others who have respectively provided written statements or testified in court to prove the facts, there are also investigative files that can be used as evidence. It is also found that the defendant wantonly destroyed the property of Chen Shenshi, Wang Ziting, Chen Changyu, Feng Zhaomei, Liu Hanyin and other households in Changle Road, Zhonghua Gate, Yingfu Street and other places. There are victims or eyewitnesses Ding Wanhe, Chen Shenshi, Chen Changyu, Ye Yaoshi and others who have respectively provided written statements or testified in court, and there are also annotations from investigators, which can be used as corroborating evidence.

Editorial

### Prospects for Relations Between Our Country and the Holy See

The Holy See's envoy, Li Baoli, presented his credentials to our Chairman the day before yesterday, truly opening a new page in relations between China and the Holy See. Relations between the Holy See and China began in the Yuan Dynasty, but afterwards, overland transportation between Europe and Asia was blocked, and relations between our country and the Holy See were severed. In the late Ming Dynasty, Europeans came east by sea, and Catholic missionaries returned to our country. At that time, it was after the so-called Reformation in Europe, and St. Ignatius Loyola, witnessing the difficulties of the time, founded the Society of Jesus, dedicated to using scholarship to evangelize in the so-called Counter-Reformation. The spread of this trend greatly enhanced the reputation of the Catholic Church. Those who came to China in the late Ming Dynasty were the earlier Jesuits, adhering to the Society's doctrine of evangelizing through scholarship. These missionaries from the East often wore Confucian attire and interacted with the literati of the time. Prominent figures such as Xu Guangqi and Li Zhizao were baptized and embraced the faith, so Catholicism was once very prosperous at that time. When the Ming Dynasty was about to collapse, members of the imperial family even wrote to the Pope of the time, showing the popularity of Catholicism at that time. In the early Qing Dynasty, the Ming system was still followed, so Catholicism could also be spread. Later, Yongzheng issued an edict banning religion, and the Church also issued an order prohibiting the worship of Confucius and ancestors, which greatly impacted the spread of Catholicism. It was not until after 1840, when the great powers began to sign unequal treaties with us, that the spread of Catholicism in China was guaranteed by treaties. From the late Qing Dynasty to the 12th year of the Republic of China, although both China and the Holy See had the desire to establish relations, it was never implemented. In the 12th year of the Republic of China, the Holy See sent Archbishop Celso Costantini to China as the first papal representative to China, and established the Apostolic Delegation in Beiping, which was the first normal relationship established between the Holy See and China. Later, Archbishop Costantini returned to his country, and the Pope appointed Archbishop Mario Zanin to succeed him. Until August of this year, the Holy See made its first appointment of an ambassador to China. The establishment of direct relations between the Holy See and our country had already been seen twenty years ago when Archbishop Costantini came to the East as the first papal representative to China. It does not start with the current envoy, Li Baoli; however, Li Baoli comes in the capacity of a diplomatic representative, and his arrival indicates the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between China and the Holy See. This is why Li Baoli's inauguration opens a new page in relations between China and the Holy See.

China sending an ambassador to the Holy See was a major achievement of our country's wartime diplomacy. At that time, the war was raging and transportation was blocked, so the Holy See did not send an envoy to China. After the end of the war, there was a proposal to send a diplomatic envoy to China. Now that Envoy Li has taken office, and diplomatic relations between China and the Holy See have been established, it is indeed a matter of gratification. The Holy See is where the Pope of the Catholic Church resides, and since the Eastern migration of the Roman Empire, the place where the Pope resides has been specialized. Its territory includes not only Rome, but also the central part of Italy, forming a country of its own. Therefore, the Pope is not only the leader of Catholics worldwide, but also the head of the country directly ruled by the Pope. This directly ruled country was destroyed by the rise of the Savoy Dynasty of Italy, but after the First World War, the Lateran Treaty between Italy and the Holy See re-established the status of the Pope's residence. Legally speaking, the Vatican, where the Holy See is located, is also an independent country, with its own system. Because it is an independent country, it can also establish diplomatic relations with other countries. However, the Vatican covers only a little more than one hundred acres, which is equivalent to a large private estate. It is not because of the Vatican that we have the establishment of diplomatic relations, but because there is the Holy See in the Vatican that we have the establishment of diplomatic relations. What we are establishing now is not diplomatic relations between our country and the Vatican, but diplomatic relations between our country and the Holy See. We are sending an envoy to the Holy See (The Holy See), not to the Vatican (Vatican). The Holy See is also sending an Apostolic Internuncio, not a Vatican envoy. This is a point that we must recognize clearly: therefore, we can say Sino-US relations, Sino-British relations, but the relationship between China and the Holy See cannot be simply referred to as Sino-Vatican relations.

Now that we have established diplomatic relations with the Holy See, we must ask what the purpose of establishing these diplomatic relations is. Perhaps we cannot ask about the purpose of diplomatic relations, but the establishment of general diplomatic relations is undoubtedly to seek to enhance friendly, amicable, commercial, cultural, and other aspects of relations between the two countries. Countries interact with each other, and in addition to general friendship treaties, there are also the signing of commercial navigation treaties to serve as general guidelines for relations between the two countries. Our country and the Holy See have an agreement to exchange envoys; now that the appointed envoy to the Holy See has also come to China, what should be done urgently between our country and the Holy See is the signing of a treaty on religious affairs, because the central work of the Holy See is evangelization, and its envoy also has the word Apostolic, which carries the meaning of evangelization; unlike general countries, we can have treaties of commerce and navigation, but with the Holy See, we must have treaties on religious affairs. Now that we have established diplomatic relations with the Holy See, we should continue to sign treaties on evangelization and religious affairs. With this treaty, the Catholic Church in China will have its legal status—because a treaty is equivalent to a law. Speaking of the Catholic Church in China, we must recognize this point, that the Catholic Church in China has French priests, American priests, Italian priests, local priests, and even priests from Hungary, Poland, and Russia. Although they have different nationalities, they all serve the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church is indivisible: the Catholic Church in China is a single entity, and there is no room for division within it. In the past, French priests had the treaties we signed with France as protection, and American priests had their treaties as protection. But today, we can no longer deal with religious affairs in the spirit of handling "foreign affairs." We must have an understanding of the "religious affairs" themselves. The Catholic Church is a whole, and the local bishop is a Chinese church even if he is not Chinese; because the foundation of the Catholic Church is not the bishop but the parishioners. Precisely because of the complex situation of the Catholic Church in China, we need to conclude a treaty with the Holy See to determine the status of the Catholic Church in China. Although the church system has been established in China, the Catholic Church in China has not yet reached the point of self-sufficiency. In all of China, in addition to the twenty archdioceses, there are more than one hundred dioceses: we cannot divide them; they are all one body.

The Catholic Church is a large organization. Even in China, although the percentage of Catholics in the national population is not high, there are already more than four million people. In such a large organization, it is inevitable that there will be those of mixed quality. The three words "Catholic Church" cannot be regarded as a guarantee of good behavior, which is of course a matter of course, and not surprising. However, our government, from the chairman down, cares for Catholicism. Due to the establishment of diplomatic relations between our country and the Holy See, we hope that our country and the Holy See can sign a treaty on religious affairs, so that the Catholic Church in China can develop on the right track.

### Incident of Female Students Being Abused in Beiping

Since the so-called case of American soldiers abusing female students occurred in Beiping, the situation has become increasingly serious, and there is a tendency to spread to Shanghai. We deeply regret the occurrence of this unfortunate incident; however, we cannot help but feel regret that the situation has escalated to this point. If this is a case of abusing female students, we must clarify two things: one is the question of facts, and the other is the question of law. Whether it is a rape case must be determined through judicial trial in a normal democratic country ruled by law. The jury system in the Anglo-American legal system is for determining whether a crime has been committed. After the fact of the crime is determined, it is the responsibility of the judge to impose a sentence according to law. Now that the party accused of the crime is a soldier, it should also go through military justice procedures. If the military court's judgment is improper, then means outside of the law can be used. Therefore, before the facts and the issue of sentencing are determined and announced, what we need is calmness. Before the situation is clear, there are so-called strike movements, and even movements to have American troops withdraw from China. This is not only making a mountain out of a molehill, but it also shows that we are not trained in democratic politics; when singing praises of democracy today, one cannot help but feel a little regret. The movement to ask American troops to withdraw from China did not start with the case of female students being abused in Beiping; general anti-American movements did not start today either. This newspaper has previously published articles on this movement, believing that it is contrary to the wishes of the Chinese people. Now that the National Assembly has closed successfully and the national constitution has been formulated, those who fear that China will not be in chaos are deliberately trying to launch some kind of movement to make things difficult for the Chinese people. The unfortunate incident in Beiping has created a spark. If it is determined that the crime did occur, we believe that the American authorities will certainly have a just resolution; we do not need to have any expanded actions. We do not need to investigate the motives of those who have expanded actions; those with discerning eyes will naturally understand. What we regret is that even professors who are role models have become involved in reckless actions without understanding the facts. What we want to state here is that the unfortunate incident in Beiping is a legal issue, and we should wait for the sanctions of the law. In this regard, we cannot help but mention: (1) From the standpoint of the country, higher education in China is mostly supported by the state; university authorities should consider the state's intention to cultivate talent, so that education and the state are integrated. If the case of female students being abused causes a strike at a national university, it means that the universities supported by the state have failed the state. (2) From the standpoint of the people, the people send their children to universities supported by the state, which is the people's trust in the state and in the universities. The principals who bear the responsibility of university education should consider the heavy responsibility entrusted to them by the state and the people, and work hard, but it is heard that there are those who have abandoned their posts, causing student strikes. This is truly heartbreaking. We want to appeal to all universities not to have expanded actions because of this incident of female students being abused; it is not that we should not care about the abuse of female students, but that we should show our spirit of democracy and the rule of law. What we need is the stability that the people of a democratic country should have.

### Squad Leader of a New Recruit Unit in Changshu Extorts and Commits Violence; Thousands of Citizens Kneel and Petition; Military and Police Organs are on Alert All Night to Prevent Accidents

[Our Changshu Dispatch] Wang Yanrong, Dong Youshan, Luo Yun and other three squad leaders of the Second Squad of the Second Company of the First Battalion of the Wu Regiment Management District's new recruits, on the grounds that a new recruit, Wang Yin, had deserted at Xiaguan, Nanjing, went to the house of Wei Xiumin, a resident of the Fifth Bao of Tannan Town in the urban area, on the morning of the 28th, broke down the door and entered, arbitrarily searching, attempting to extort a huge sum of three million yuan, and beat Huang Yaozhang, the Bao Chief of the Fourth Bao of the town, which aroused public anger. More than a thousand citizens gathered, demanding an investigation. At that time, the squad leader, Jiang Ruixi, arrived with seven or eight people in uniform and plainclothes, forcibly releasing Wang Yanrong and the other two. After a while, the local self-defense patrol passed by and was stopped by all the citizens, who seized the squad leader, Jiang, and reported to the patrol, demanding that he be brought to justice. After unsuccessful persuasion, they accompanied him to the county government. Unexpectedly, more than a thousand citizens, with boiling blood, also followed to the county government gate, kneeling and petitioning. Traffic was blocked for a time. Fortunately, the county government handled the matter properly and dispersed the crowd. After questioning by Chen Shishi, the chief of the military affairs section, it was reported that, because the matter was serious, the Commander Du of the regiment management district was consulted overnight. After the incident, public sentiment was indignant. The heads of various towns, baos, and jias, and the fire brigade, responded in unison, determined to provide full support. The County Council and the County Party Headquarters have been closely following the matter. After learning late at night that the Yuanhe Town Self-Defense Force had received a strange phone call, the county government put military and police organs on high alert to prevent accidents. As of the 29th, the matter had not been resolved.

### Clearing and Suppressing is Intensified on the Border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui; Rewards are Offered for the Capture of Bandit Leaders; The Taihu Lake Clearing and Suppression District Headquarters is Temporarily Suspended from Being Abolished

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 30th] According to a person from the Wuxi Command Post: The jurisdiction of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Border Clearing and Suppression District covers six counties, including Liyang, Yixing, Changxing, Yicheng, Guangde, and Langxi. Since Chuan Jin Fang Shi took over as commander, the security in the area has gradually become peaceful. However, there are still bandits such as Xiong Zhaoren, Zhang Zhiyi, Xu Daozhen, Li Huan, Ma Xiao, Fu Jiaqi, Hu Qiuzhen, Tang Songlin, Wu Qichang, and others, who are fearless of the law and independently raise the banner of rebellion. Although they have been repeatedly offered amnesty, they still roam around in the counties, causing disturbances as before. Currently, in addition to sending troops to search and suppress, Commander Chuan, in view of the fact that the area is full of overlapping mountains and is very easy to hide, in order to achieve results as soon as possible, has specially offered rewards for their capture. Regardless of whether they are military or civilian personnel, whoever can capture any bandit leader alive will be rewarded with 500,000 yuan. Those who report and seize bandit weapons will also be rewarded accordingly. Commander Fu is currently going to various counties in the jurisdiction, such as Dingshu District, Heqiao District, and Xushe in Yixing, to inspect and review the self-defense forces, and convene meetings of military and political leaders in various places to provide guidance on the clearing and suppression policy.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 30th] The Taihu Lake Clearing and Suppression Command Post stationed in Mu Dun was originally scheduled to be abolished after its mission was completed. However, the Wuxi Command Post, in view of the fact that the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui border area is launching a large-scale encirclement and suppression, fearing that bandits will take advantage of the situation to break into Taihu Lake, has withdrawn its order. On the 30th, it ordered the Taihu Lake Command Post to continue to exist for another month to prevent them from entering.

[Our Wujin News] The Maoli steamboat, which operates between Changzhou and Yangjian via Biaochang outside the west gate of this county, is jointly operated by the Yong'an, Yong, and Xinhua companies.

### Huaiyin Initiates Winter Relief Efforts, Strictly Prohibits Hoarding and Smuggling of Grain

[Our Huaiyin News] Since the recovery of Huaiyin, nine out of ten households are empty and the people's livelihood is withering. Now that winter is approaching, the situation is becoming more difficult. In accordance with the provisions of the relief implementation measures promulgated by the ministry, and with reference to the current local situation, various sectors have established a winter relief committee to provide small loans, set up porridge distribution centers, and distribute relief funds and materials for relief. The relief targets include widowers, widows, orphans, the elderly, the weak, the disabled, refugees, families of soldiers who fought in the war, impoverished families, those whose family members died or went missing in the war and whose families are not supported, those whose houses and properties were completely destroyed and have no place to live, those who have lost their ability to work due to illness and have no one to support them, those who have lost their jobs due to the war and have no permanent property to maintain their lives, and those whose lives have been affected by the war and cannot live in the short term, in addition to those who can live. Considerable relief will be provided to all these groups. Currently, applications are being made to relief agencies to discuss assistance from local charitable organizations, and to allocate funds, food, or clothing. Applications are being made to the county government to transfer local public funds or stored grain, and to raise funds from local wealthy households, large merchants, and industrial and commercial groups.

In view of this, the county government issued a strict ban yesterday, stating that those who deliberately violate the ban will be severely punished once discovered.

### Zhejiang Water Police Bureau Solves Theft Case

[Our Wuxing News] At 1:00 PM on the 3rd of this month, the Hesujiang steamboat, an auxiliary ship of the Yongchang Company, was sailing from Shanghai to Huzhou when it was suddenly robbed by eight bandits on a small boat in the Xiehutang area of Luxu. The losses were heavy. After the incident, the Xitang water police team in Jiashan learned that the principal offenders in the case had fled to Jiangsu Province.

### Indictment Against War Criminal Tani Hisao (Continued from Page 2)

In summary, the accused violated international treaties and conventions before and during the war, conspired to prepare and launch and support aggression against our country, and violated the laws and customs of war by directly or indirectly committing acts of violence. His criminal acts are indeed undeniable and cannot be excused. Although the accused repeatedly argued: (1) Before returning to Japan, I had not heard of any crimes such as rape or murder committed by my subordinates, and it is difficult to believe the so-called various atrocities; (2) There were many troops in Nanjing at that time, and even if there were crimes, it cannot be proved that they were committed by my army, and I am not responsible; (3) I strictly controlled my troops and repeatedly warned them not to commit violence against non-combatants. My troops have fought in various places and no one has accused them of any crimes, which shows that the Nanjing Massacre was not committed by my army; (4) The establishment of comfort stations was discussed with local officials and the consent of comfort women was obtained before they were established. However, the Nanjing Massacre was an action by the Japanese to destroy our country's spirit of resistance and national consciousness. During the war, too much of our country's territory fell, and there may be other places besides Nanjing where similar massacres occurred. The fact that the accused did not commit similar massacres elsewhere does not prove that there were no such atrocities in Nanjing. Moreover, his troops looted civilian property in Baoding, as evidenced by victims' testimonies on file. His subordinates were not as virtuous as he claimed. Secondly, the Nanjing Massacre claimed hundreds of thousands of victims. The first week was the peak of the massacre, which was within the accused's garrison area. According to existing evidence, there was no time or place without various atrocities occurring. The accused claimed to know or hear nothing, which clearly shows that he was afraid of investigation and resorted to deceptive arguments. Furthermore, the Nanjing Massacre is a world-known fact and there are films, photographs, various records, archives, and thousands of testimonies and dozens of witnesses testified in court. It is difficult to exempt him from criminal responsibility based on his empty claim that he could not believe the claims made. In addition, the area inside and outside Zhonghua Gate was the area garrisoned by the accused, as he himself admitted. During the period of his garrison, there were massacres, rapes, and various atrocities. The number of victims that can be proven has reached thousands. His subordinates would not commit crimes themselves and there is no reason for other troops to come to commit crimes. Moreover, other troops have their own garrison areas and their own targets for killing and raping, and there is no reason to abandon the near and seek the far. Furthermore, the troops who attacked Zhonghua Gate were the accused's troops, and they began killing as soon as they entered the city, which cannot be shifted to others. Again, Chinese women and social customs do not condone the use of the body for consolation. Even in our own army, it is impossible to obtain consent to sacrifice their beauty, let alone for enemy troops. Furthermore, the fact that he killed women in Nanjing after failing to force them to become comfort women is sufficient proof that the so-called obtaining consent was a fabrication. As for the accused's service and participation in the war in China, it was indeed in accordance with national policy and the execution of orders. However, conspiring to commit aggression and launching a war of aggression are both acts that violate international treaties and undermine international peace. Moreover, during the war, the accused wantonly engaged in slaughter, rape, and looting, which violated the laws of war and cannot be excused. The accused's various crimes leave no room for excuse. Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations and Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty both stipulate that the integrity of the territory and political independence of members and our country should be respected. The Kellogg-Briand Pact condemns war as an instrument of national policy. The Hague Convention on Hostilities also has explicit provisions. The accused initially provided strong support for the conspiracy and actions of aggression, then sent troops to Shandong to obstruct our country's reunification movement and infringe on our country's sovereignty. In the end, he participated in a war of aggression against us without declaring war, which clearly violated the provisions of these international conventions and should constitute the crime of undermining peace. Moreover, during his war in our country, he wantonly looted and destroyed property, carried out planned massacres and rapes of civilians, forced women into comfort stations, and killed them after raping them, and massacred forced laborers after their recruitment. The current atrocities such as mass killings and burning corpses violate Article 23, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 3, Paragraph 7, Article 28, Article 46, Paragraph 1, and Article 47 of the Hague Regulations on Land Warfare and should constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Although the crime of undermining peace has been committed continuously for more than twenty years, and the crimes of war and crimes against humanity have been committed repeatedly, since they were all based on a general intention, they should each be treated as one crime. Furthermore, the crime of undermining peace is not related to the crimes of war and crimes against humanity as a means to an end. They should be punished separately and concurrently. Furthermore, the accused deliberately engaged in aggression, undermining international peace, infringing on our country's sovereignty, and during the war, committed various atrocities in violation of humanity and the laws of war against unarmed civilians. He also created an unprecedented catastrophe in Nanjing. He was extremely heinous and aroused the indignation of the world and should be sentenced to capital punishment to maintain justice and peace.

Based on the above arguments, in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 2, Paragraph 4, Article 3, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 4, Paragraph 6, Paragraph 17, Paragraph 24, Article 27, Articles 36, Article 38, Article 4, Article 8, Article 9, Article 10, Article 11 of the "Regulations on the Trial of War Criminals of the Republic of China," Article 11, Article 223 of the Criminal Law, and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the prosecution is brought. Respectfully submitted to the judges of this court, 25 December, 35th Year of the Republic of China. Chen Guangyu, Chief Prosecutor, Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals, Ministry of National Defense.

In addition to the indictment, there are thousands of words of attachments, which detail various criminal facts, divided into four parts: murder, rape, robbery, and destruction of property. Murder is further divided into four categories: 334 people shot, 195 people stabbed, 95 people collectively massacred, and 310 people killed by other cruel methods. The rape section counts 43 people, and the robbery and destruction of property section counts 17 people. (End)

### France Establishes Customs System in the Saar Region, Various Parties Express Deep Concern, France Claims Stationing Customs Officers Is Not Annexation, Council Does Not Reopen Old Case, Becoming Today's Topic

[United Press, Saarbrücken, 29th] French officials here announced today that recent municipal elections have proven that 78% of the people in the Saar coal mining region wish to immediately rejoin France economically. French Military Governor Koenig stationed 1,200 customs officers on the border of the Saar industrial area a week ago. According to French official statements, setting up this customs cordon is not annexation, but France's stance is quite clear. Wen Beihart, editor of the non-partisan Saarbrücken newspaper, stated that most Saarlanders today hope that the establishment of this new economic border is the first step towards economic union with France. The Saar industrial area covers 738 square miles. After the end of World War I, it was handed over to France for management. In 1935, the Saar Germans voted by a large majority to return to Germany. French military government officials now believe that the Saar Germans all want to return to France because both major political parties in the Saar used reunification with France as their slogan in recent municipal elections.

[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] France's establishment of a customs system in the Saar region has attracted attention from all parties. [Pravda] also criticized France's move today, denouncing it as a unilateral action and refuting France's claim that the matter had been raised at the New York Foreign Ministers Conference and had not been opposed. The newspaper pointed out that the New York Foreign Ministers Conference had not discussed the German issue at all, and French Foreign Minister Representative Muville had informed the Foreign Ministers Conference that the Saar issue would be discussed with other German issues at the next Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow.

[United Press, Berlin, 29th] According to reliable sources today, the United States will propose at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in March next year that the old agricultural areas of eastern Germany not occupied by Poland should be returned to Germany when discussing the German peace treaty. Germany cannot survive if it loses 25% of its best farmland. The United States is expected to receive the support of the United Kingdom for this proposal, which stipulates that Poland should retain the old German agricultural areas of Silesia, half of East Prussia that is now occupied, and the former Free City of Danzig. Pommerania and Brandenburg, which are occupied by the Polish army, will all be returned to Germany. Poland has sufficient farmland to meet its own needs, and Silesia can become the country's rich industrial area. Conversely, if Germany loses the agricultural areas of Pommerania and Brandenburg, it will reduce Germany's grain production by 25%. Germany is often a grain-deficient country, and the situation is deteriorating. The Western occupying powers have no choice but to import food at huge expense to support this defeated nation. US Secretary of State Byrnes strongly hinted at the US stance in a speech he gave in Stuttgart.

### Allied Forces to Withdraw from Italy Next Year

Italian Cabinet Discusses Political Issues

[Reuters, Rome, 29th] General McGarry, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Mediterranean, issued a New Year's message to the Allied Forces stationed in Italy today, predicting that British and American troops stationed in Italy could be completely withdrawn in 1947. He said that since the end of the war, until the conditions for peace can be resolved by the United Nations, Allied forces have had to remain in Italy.

### Atomic Energy Commission Report Formally Submitted to the Security Council, Strongly Advocates Prohibition, Veto Issue Still Unresolved

[Agencia France-Presse, Lake Success, 29th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission today submitted a report to the Security Council, advocating for the complete prohibition of the manufacture and stockpiling of atomic bombs. The report also included a letter from the drafting subcommittee, explaining that no agreement had been reached on whether the veto power should be abolished in cases of violating the international convention on the control of atomic energy. The report further detailed the work of the scientific and technical subcommittee and recommended that measures be taken to prohibit the use of atomic energy, except for peaceful purposes. The illegal use of materials such as uranium and thorium is also prohibited. The method of controlling atomic energy is that all member states of the United Nations should convene a meeting to establish a strong international control and supervision system through international treaties, granting considerable authority to manage atomic energy, and no government should interfere with its work by veto. The organization may send representatives to investigate within the borders of designated countries and, within its jurisdiction, may prohibit countries from manufacturing and stockpiling atomic weapons. The organization's representatives also have the power to dispose of existing atomic weapon stockpiles. Furthermore, the international authority can determine acts that violate the terms of international conventions and take sanction measures. Once sanction measures are decided, violating countries cannot escape their responsibilities or consequences by veto. In the event of a breach of contract, the right of legitimate self-defense may be exercised in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. (Note: Article 51 stipulates that if one of the member states encounters armed aggression, the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense shall not be prejudiced until the Security Council takes the necessary measures to maintain international peace and security. However, after a member state takes action to exercise this right of self-defense, it shall immediately report to the Security Council and shall not impede the Security Council's responsibility under this Charter to take action as necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.) The report concluded by recommending the gradual establishment of international control and supervisory bodies so that the Atomic Energy Commission can gradually acquire contact during the transition period.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 30th] After the report to be submitted to the Security Council by the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission was released, it was learned that the Soviet Union was unwilling to discuss the point that the veto power should not be used when sanctioning violators of the atomic treaty, and also refused to discuss the issue of aerial inspections of secret activities by international authorities.

### Soviet Representative to the Security Council, Gromyko Promoted to Deputy Foreign Minister, Soviet Emphasis on UN Institutions Can Be Seen Here

[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] The Soviet Cabinet met today and decided to appoint Gromyko, the current representative of the country to the United Nations Security Council, as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Soviet Union now has five Deputy Foreign Ministers: Vyshinsky, Gusev (former Ambassador to the United Kingdom), Malik, Tikhonov, and Gromyko.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 29th] Regarding Gromyko's promotion to Deputy Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, people from all walks of life here have not yet commented on it, because this news did not indicate whether Gromyko's appointment as Deputy Foreign Minister will lead to any changes in the representatives of the Soviet Union attending the Security Council and other international organizations. The general impression here is that Gromyko will continue to exercise his representative duties in the United Nations institutions. If this is the case, then the Soviet Union's emphasis on the United Nations institutions can be seen here.

### Viet Minh Demands French Troops Withdraw from Fortified Road Repair Positions, Viet Minh Forces Shell Hanoi's Central District, Minister Moutet Arrives in Eastern Cambodia Yesterday for Inspection

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] Radio Viet Minh tonight demanded that General Leclerc immediately withdraw from Vietnam and also demanded that the French government recall High Commissioner for Vietnam d'Argenlieu and French Commander General Morlière. Radio Viet Minh also announced that President Ho Chi Minh had recently sent a telegram to Prime Minister Blum, accusing French troops of massacring Vietnamese women and children in Hanoi first, deliberately provoking conflict, and also demanding that French troops withdraw to their positions before February 17. Radio Viet Minh said that Ho Chi Minh's telegram was used to reply to Blum's telegram to Ho Chi Minh. It is said that Blum's telegram stated that Colonial Minister Moutet's mission to Vietnam was to restore the situation in Vietnam based on the French-Vietnamese agreement. However, a French official in Saigon denied that Blum had sent a telegram to Ho Chi Minh.

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 30th] The French General Staff issued a communiqué stating that Viet Minh forces were strengthening their positions near Hue and Da Nang, while continuing to shell Hanoi's central district and attack French outposts in Nam Dinh. Hanoi is constantly being shelled and slightly damaged, and French patrols are active in the city.

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] French newspapers reported that 2,000 French defenders of Phu Tong City, 20 miles northeast of Hanoi, had been besieged for more than a week and were only relieved after reinforcements arrived.

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 30th] Colonial Minister Moutet's initial work here has been completed, and he flew to Phnom Penh (the capital of Cambodia) this morning with his entourage to hold talks with French and Cambodian officials. French High Commissioner for Vietnam d'Argenlieu also traveled from here to Hanoi today to inspect the French troops in the region.

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 29th] French sources said that Leclerc's visit to Vietnam was to study the situation of the French expeditionary force and to consider the future increase in manpower and material resources.

Hanoi Compatriots' Food Panic

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 28th Special Dispatch] Hanoi's external transportation is still the same as yesterday, and the source of food has been completely cut off, and the supply situation is deteriorating. Compatriots can only buy food in the areas controlled by the Vietnamese army.

People close to the Indian leader said that Nehru was asking Gandhi whether to accept or reject the British government's statement issued on December 6, which explained the provincial system recommended by the British Cabinet. On this issue, the Muslim League believes that the provincial system is mandatory, but the Congress Party does not agree with this view.

### Voice of America to Broadcast in Russian Starting Next Year, Communicating Culture and Harmonizing Political Views

[United Press, Washington, 29th] The official US radio station "Voice of America" will begin broadcasting in Russian around January 15 next year. This is the State Department's grand propaganda plan to bypass Soviet censorship and directly contact the Soviet people. Some US officials believe that this move may be one of the major events of next year, because Secretary of State Byrnes feels that the greatest difficulty in dealing with Moscow is the inability to directly convey each country's views on any issue to the Soviet people. Therefore, it was decided to use a powerful radio station newly established in Munich to broadcast to the Soviet Union with long-term programs such as news, music, and cultural discussions. The content focuses on facts and does not touch the Soviet government's taboos. If this move achieves political success, some disputes can be held in radio debates in the future, and both sides can provide opinions fairly.

### New American Progressive Citizens Party Founded, Wallace Also Attends and Speaks

### South African Students' Congress Protests to Smuts, Praises China, India, and the Soviet Union, Gandhi Also Writes an Article Refuting Smuts

[Agence France-Presse, Johannesburg, South Africa, 29th] The South African Native National Congress recently held a meeting in Bloemfontein and passed the following resolutions: (1) Protested against South African Prime Minister Smuts' statement at the United Nations that he represents all the people of South Africa; (2) Expressed respect for the representatives of China, India, and the Soviet Union attending the United Nations General Assembly for safeguarding the democratic rights of non-European people in South Africa; (3) Determined to continue to fight against white rule until people of color obtain equal rights; (4) Urged the Executive Committee of the Congress to study the possibility of cooperating with other non-European groups.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 29th] South African Prime Minister Smuts recently accused India of the existence of class discrimination. Gandhi responded to this in a newspaper article, saying that the class discrimination in India is different from the racial discrimination in South Africa. It must be known that South Africa has laws on racial discrimination, but India has no laws on class discrimination. Class distinctions have their own religious origins, and any mentally sound Indian wants to abolish them. As for the racial discrimination in South Africa, it is the most serious, because South Africa has recently stipulated several racial discrimination measures. In short, racial barriers in India have gradually disappeared, while the South African government refuses to abolish this type of law.

### Year-End Sketch: Hitler's Sins Lead to German Suffering

After six years of war and a year and a half of occupation, Germany is now facing hunger, disease, and unrest. Sixty million people are greeting the New Year in this situation…

[United Press, Berlin, 29th] Most of Germany's 60 million people are suffering under a semi-starved rationing system. The black market devours them, poverty drives them to crime, and pulmonary disease, rickets, and other diseases are rampant. German land must help maintain the supplies for hundreds of thousands of occupying forces and nearly a million foreigners. According to United Nations estimates, more than four million Germans who need to revive their homeland have become prisoners of war. Officials of the military government in the British and American occupied zones foresee the following situations in Germany in the coming year: (1) Semi-starved rations will cause irreparable damage to children's bodies unless nutrition is improved; (2) Part of the prisoners of war will be repatriated; (3) Part of the occupying forces will be reduced; (4) Partial solution to the refugee problem.

Food scarcity remains Germany's biggest problem. More than four million people in the British and American occupied zones are receiving alms from the United Nations. The usual daily ration is 1,500 calories, while the minimum nutritional need set by the health authorities is 2,000 calories. There is no hope of solving this problem soon. American and British officials seem to favor giving Germany "incentive" loans for trade so that the country can export goods and earn money to pay for part of the food price. Although this move can reduce the burden on the United Nations, it cannot greatly improve the nutrition of Germans.

According to investigations in the British, American, and French occupied zones, pulmonary disease is prevalent, and venereal disease has been rampant in Germany since the surrender, partly due to the Allied forces. A large proportion of children born in cities after the war suffer from rickets due to a lack of Vitamin D. The black market and the sale of narcotics and alcohol are extremely prevalent. In Cologne, under British occupation, coffee sells for 300 marks per pound (equivalent to US$30), car tires for 1,500 marks each, and one carat of diamonds for 20,000 marks. Most people are extremely poor. For example, an ordinary worker in Dusseldorf earns 30 marks per week but cannot afford potatoes at five marks per pound or black market apples at twelve marks per pound and can only live on bread. Sometimes it takes twelve hours to queue for bread. The number of criminal cases reported to the city police station has increased sharply. The poor steal from neighbors. They break up wooden signs to burn as firewood, and many farmers have become petty thieves. Recently, when a train stopped briefly at Oberhausen station, three or four tons of coal were stolen in a few minutes.

The German army suffered seven million deaths and injuries in the war. Four million people are prisoners of war, most of whom are still abroad. Germans fear that the repatriation of most prisoners of war will be delayed for a long time. The United States plans to repatriate 100,000 German prisoners, mostly before the final peace conference. The United Kingdom plans to repatriate more than 300,000 German prisoners before 1949. However, France and the Soviet Union have expressed the need for German labor compensation for long-term reconstruction work. France holds 600,000 prisoners, while the Soviet Union holds more than 3 million prisoners. American officials expect that Soviet troops in Germany will decrease by 30% to 50% in the coming months. Marshal Stalin reported this October that there were 20 Soviet divisions in Germany. Other United Nations military circles estimate that there are 400,000 to 600,000 Soviet troops. The United States is allowed to reduce its troops to 150,000 by July next year, and the United Kingdom will reduce its troops in the same way. There are 600,000 foreign refugees in Germany, 600,000 in the American occupied zone and the rest in the British occupied zone. The stay of these people is due to the fact that they are not forced to return to Poland and Soviet territory. Most of the refugees come from these two countries. Some American officials hope that the United Nations will take over the repatriation of refugees from the military government soon.

### Enemy Property Administration to be Abolished Today, Received Over One Trillion in Assets, Handled Over 550 Billion Yuan in Materials, China Trust Bureau to Set Up a Liquidation Office to Handle Unfinished Business

[Reported by this newspaper] The Enemy and Puppet Property Administration of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Districts will be abolished today in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan. All unfinished cases and unprocessed materials, including enemy and puppet property materials and the property of traitors, will be transferred to the Central Trust Bureau for handling today. The bureau has established the Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Districts to handle the matter, and the director of the Liquidation Office is Liu Gongyun, concurrently. The organization of the Liquidation Office has been decided to have one general secretary and one general accountant. The general secretary will be Shen Guanya, and the general accountant will be Lin Zhaotang. Under them, there will be six groups: general affairs, finance, collection, appraisal, review, and traitor property, and one commissioner's office, to handle the various unfinished affairs of the Administration. The formal handover ceremony will be held after Jiang Weixian, the special supervisor appointed by the Executive Yuan, recovers from his illness. A reporter from this newspaper visited the Director of the Administration, Liu Gongyun, yesterday to inquire about the overall situation of the Administration's receipt and handling of matters in the past year. He was told the following: (1) All enemy and puppet property received, including German property and traitor property, totaled more than 1.2 trillion yuan, exceeding the original estimate of 200 billion yuan. As of the end of this month, the handled materials amounted to 550 billion yuan, of which more than 384 billion yuan were turned over to the national treasury (about 50 billion yuan in December), and the gold deposited in the Central Bank was worth about 150 billion yuan. There are still about 700 billion yuan to be processed, including 200 billion yuan in materials, 100 billion yuan in real estate, wharves and warehouses, and 400 billion yuan in transfers from the China Textile Corporation and various state-owned business institutions, which will be transferred to the Central Trust Bureau for handling today. (2) Regarding property rights disputes: 49 factories that have been returned belong to foreigners, 196 belong to domestic owners, 31 have been approved for prior purchase by the owners, and 65 applications have been rejected. (3) The investigation team has received 2,496 secret reports, and the materials seized are worth about 40 billion yuan, of which 7.2 billion yuan have been auctioned off. The seized materials include: (1) 916 buildings, (2) 676 mu of land, (3) 81 cars, (4) 23 ships, (5) 52,277 bolts of cotton cloth, (6) 7 small factories, (7) 4,457 pieces of cotton yarn. The bonuses issued to informers are more than 1 billion yuan. Currently, the acceptance of enemy property cases has been stopped, but if the cases are too complicated, temporary liquidation offices will be allowed to handle everything, but no later than two months. As for the staff of the Administration after its dissolution, severance pay will be given to each person for four months, (one of which was specially approved by Premier Song).

The Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee, which is affiliated with the Administration, will continue to exist, but the two independent units of the Traitor Property Handling Committee and the Expenditure Audit Committee will be merged into it. In the future, the Review Committee will decide on the return or confiscation of property rights and the handling of property materials. After a resolution is obtained, the Secretary-General will issue a document to handle it.

### Celebrating the Establishment of the Constitution, a Grand Meeting to be Held on New Year's Day, Films to be Screened to Comfort Veterans

[Reported by this newspaper] The preparatory committee for the Shanghai Municipal Celebrations of the Establishment of the Constitution of the Republic of China and the 36th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of China held a meeting of the heads and deputy heads of the committees at the Municipal Party Headquarters at 10:00 am yesterday, with Chairman Fang Zhi presiding over the meeting in person. The following resolutions were made: (1) A celebration meeting will be held at the Grand Theater at 9:00 am on New Year's Day, followed by a grand state worship ceremony, and newsreels "Voice of Democracy" and the famous film "The Holy City" will be screened on site to entertain comrades of the Xinhai Revolution, veterans, and families of the anti-Japanese war.

The comfort items include food boxes and cigarettes donated by the Executive Yuan Relief Administration and toothbrushes and towels collected by the Chamber of Commerce; (3) A large parade of floats will be held at 2:00 pm on the 2nd. The 20 floats will be prepared by the participating units themselves. The parade route will be decided to start from the Racecourse, pass through Xizang Road, Linsen Road, Shanzhong Road, Haige Road, Qing'an Temple Road, Nanjing Road, Sichuan Road, and North Sichuan Road, and end at Hongkou Park; (4) A tea party will be held at the Jingu Hotel on Xizang Road at 3:00 pm on the 2nd to entertain comrades of the Xinhai Revolution, veterans, and families of the anti-Japanese war; (5) The Education Bureau and the Student Federation will organize propaganda teams to publicize the significance of the establishment of the Constitution of the Republic of China in various parks, wharves, and important areas.

### Factories to Have Three Days Off

According to reports, the central party, government, and military agencies have decided to give all agencies, groups, and schools nationwide three days off starting from New Year's Day to celebrate the establishment of the Constitution of the Republic of China and the 36th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of China. All localities are extremely excited. However, the original commemorative measures did not mention whether factories should have three days off uniformly. A reporter from this newspaper visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to inquire about this issue. He was told that the Social Affairs Bureau had not received the above-mentioned holiday measures, but New Year's Day is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China and was originally included in the holidays, so there is no problem. The reporter also asked that if the central government's notice does confirm that factories are not included, should holidays be granted as an example? According to the reply: According to Article 9, Section 8 of the Factory Law Implementation Regulations, other holidays temporarily designated by the National Government should be followed. If the central government stipulates a uniform three-day holiday to celebrate the Constitution, it should be handled in the same way. He also said that if the central government's notice arrives too late and there is not enough time to implement it, the old lunar New Year can be used to grant holidays.

### Cotton Spinning Industry Annual Bonus - Distributed in Three Grades

[Our Newspaper's Report] The unified annual bonus method for the cotton spinning industry in this city has been largely determined. The annual bonus is divided into three grades: A, B, and C. Grade A workers can receive 60 days' wages as an annual bonus, and these workers cannot exceed 5% of the total factory workers. Grade B workers can receive 50 days' wages as an annual bonus, and these workers cannot exceed 10% of the total factory workers. The remaining workers can receive 30 days' wages as an annual bonus, with an additional 10 days' wages reserved. In addition, it is stipulated that those who work for more than 16 days are counted as one month, and those who work for less than 15 days are counted as half a month. Government officials stated that this annual bonus method is the most generous among all industries and applies to both state-owned and private cotton mills. According to Director Zhao Banfu's estimate, there are about 100,000 cotton spinning workers in Shanghai, and the total amount of annual bonuses should be over 30 billion yuan.

### Labor and Management in the Silk Weaving Industry - Each Holds a Different View

[Our Newspaper's Report] Representatives of silk weaving factory owners in this city visited Mayor Wu and Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau last Saturday to petition and put forward three points regarding the annual bonus issue: (1) Silk factories that make a profit should pay an annual bonus of seven days' wages, with proportional calculation for those whose service period is less than one year. (2) The annual bonus wage should be calculated according to the November cost of living index. (3) Loss-making factories should not pay any annual bonus. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from both sides for mediation. Only the labor representatives attended. The bureau repeatedly persuaded the workers to make concessions, and the conversation went well. It is now scheduled to convene labor and management representatives again this morning to seek a solution. According to inquiries by reporters, the reasons why the factory owners are unwilling to pay the annual bonus are: (1) Although the factory appears to be making a profit, when calculated based on inventory, it is actually a loss. (2) Even if there is a profit, it is offset by high-interest loans. (3) Wages are too high, making it difficult for factories to operate. The labor representatives' opinions are: (1) If the factory owners claim to be losing money, why is the factory equipment gradually increasing? (2) If they claim that sales are sluggish and there is no profit to be made, why add night shifts? Isn't this a contradiction? (3) Workers work 11 hours a day, which is like being treated as livestock, and the demand for an annual bonus is actually reasonable.

(Further News) The year-end bonus issue for silk weaving workers has not yet been resolved. Workers in some factories have already gone on strike. The Social Affairs Bureau is actively persuading them to return to work.

### Emergency Loan Society - Calls for Hospital Cooperation - Consultations at the Health Bureau - Receives Unanimous Support

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Emergency Loan Society, organized by Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, Gu Qianlin, and others, has loaned out a total of 60 million yuan in national currency since its establishment on November 1st, benefiting a total of 212 people. 140 people have been discharged from the hospital, with appendicitis cases being the most common, followed by accidental serious injuries. Since its establishment, the society has been seen as a blessing by poor people with emergency illnesses. Currently, due to the continuous increase in medical and drug costs and doctor's fees, the amount of loans is increasing. However, hospitals have not given any special preferential treatment. In order to seek cooperation from various hospitals, a meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 3:30 pm in the conference room of the Municipal Health Bureau to consult with the presidents of various hospitals. A total of seventy to eighty representatives from public and private hospitals attended. The meeting was opened by Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau, who first introduced Gu Qianlin, the president of the Emergency Loan Society, and explained in detail the rules of the emergency loan and the payment methods, as follows: (1) Relief is limited to emergency illnesses. Cases such as car accidents and lung diseases are not included in emergency loans. (2) Patients are hospitalized for treatment, limited to third-class wards and not exceeding 15 days in principle. (3) Please provide detailed invoices within the possible range and give preferential treatment to those receiving emergency loans, charging low fees. (4) Please allow payment on the day following the issuance of the hospital's bill.

After Director Zhang's speech, Lu Jingzhou, the leader of the Health Group of the Council, gave a detailed explanation and appealed to various hospitals to provide close cooperation in the spirit of serving the people.

The presidents of various hospitals who attended yesterday unanimously expressed their willingness to assist. President Gu Qianlin of the society expressed his gratitude at the end, and the meeting adjourned successfully.

### Three Aircraft Accidents - Three Prosecutors Conduct On-Site Investigation - Civilian Aircraft Have No Radar Equipment

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the tragic accident involving three passenger planes, the District Procuratorate, in order to investigate the cause, dispatched three prosecutors, Cao Hong, Ji Su, and Wu Qihua, along with clerk Zhang Zhengping, translator Xu Shaoyong, and bailiff Wang Xingran, to Jiangwan Airport at 1:20 pm yesterday for an on-site investigation. Before departing, they first inquired at the US military headquarters about the radar equipment at Jiangwan Airport. The US military authorities informed them that the US Air Force in Shanghai did not have radar, and only the Second Service Group of the Chinese Air Force had two radar units at Jiangwan Airport. The three prosecutors then went to the Second Service Group of the Air Force to investigate the details of the plane crash and the use of radar at that time. According to Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Weihua of the group, due to the heavy fog that night, it was known that there were planes in the air that could not land. At that time, it was not known whether they were civilian or military aircraft. The Air Force used radar to try to guide them to land blindly, but it was ineffective because civilian aircraft have no radar equipment and have not received radar training, so it was impossible to establish contact with the ground. Lieutenant Colonel Zhang also said that the primary condition for flying is to pay attention to the weather, so he deeply regretted the plane crash. After bidding farewell to Lieutenant Colonel Zhang, the three prosecutors went to the crash site of passenger plane No. 48 in Zhanghuabang Zhangjiazhai. They saw that the destroyed nose of the plane was still in its original place, and there were dozens of soldiers digging for property nearby. The prosecutors personally witnessed one person picking up 40,000 yuan in legal tender. The three prosecutors were very indignant at this situation and believed that the airline's post-accident prevention was too negligent.

### UNRRA Shipping Personnel - Demand a Pay Raise - Will Strike if Their Goal is Not Achieved

[Our Newspaper's Report] The personnel of the UNRRA Shipping Detachment have recently submitted a request for a pay raise to the responsible authorities. If their goal cannot be achieved, they will begin a strike on January 2nd. There are 130 people in the detachment. They have submitted a request to General Edgerton, the head of the UNRRA office in Shanghai, requesting that their salaries be calculated in US dollars or British pounds and that they receive certain preferential treatment upon retirement.

UNRRA officials did not comment on this matter yesterday, saying only that UNRRA was responsible. An UNRRA spokesman also declined to comment on the matter yesterday.

In their petition to Mr. Edgerton, the Shipping Detachment personnel stated that the compensation they had received in the past three months was far less than what was stipulated in the original agreement. Their salaries are currently calculated at a rate of over 3,500 yuan per US dollar, and they have lost more than half of their value.

They said that the Shipping Detachment had made various empty promises to retired personnel, and in fact, most of them had not been fulfilled.

Renhe Midwifery School's 30th Anniversary - Adding School Buildings and Launching a Fundraising Campaign

[Our Newspaper's Report] The private Renhe Senior Midwifery Vocational School was founded by the famous doctor Ms. Zhang Xiangwen. The anniversary from the 6th year of the Republic of China to New Year's Day next year is the 30th anniversary of the school. Over the years, the school has had nearly a thousand graduates. About two hundred people serve in Shanghai, and the rest are distributed throughout the country. Currently, there are 117 midwifery students and 28 nursing students studying at the school. However, due to the insufficient school site attached to Renhe Hospital at No. 36 Moliai Road, it is impossible to expand the school. Ms. Zhang has donated a piece of vacant land purchased by her in front of the school to the school, planning to build a three-story building for classrooms. The construction fund will be launched for fundraising from New Year's Day, with a target of 150 million yuan, divided into 35 teams, with 70 team leaders and 280 team members, each team responsible for raising 4.5 million yuan. After the new school building is completed, Principal Zhang hopes to enroll 200 people first, and then expand according to the financial situation.

The midwifery program stipulates a three-year graduation period. Junior high school graduates can enroll. In the second year, they begin internships at Renhe and Shangxian Women and Children Hospitals. In the third year, they are assigned to various hospitals for internships. After graduation, they participate in the examination and become official midwives. Many of the graduates over the years are well-known doctors in society, such as Ms. Ni Feijun, the wife of He Yaozu, who graduated from the school in the 18th year of the Republic of China. During the internship, each student has at least 40 deliveries. The tuition fee is extremely low, only 160,000 yuan per semester, and there is a 28% free quota. The nursing program is three and a half years, with the first half year being completely free. The school currently has more than 30 faculty and staff members. The dean of academic affairs is Ms. Liu Jianqiu, the medical director of Renhe Hospital. Most of the teachers teach voluntarily. For example, Dean Liu's monthly salary is only 70,000 yuan. Ms. Zhang Xiangwen is a graduate of Shanghai Medical College and studied in the United States, graduating from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the New York Medical Institute in the 12th year of the Republic of China. In addition to founding a midwifery school, she also runs Renhe Hospital and Shangxian Women and Children Hospital. Renhe Hospital admitted a total of 1,848 patients this year, including 248 free patients and 231 people in the nursery. There are currently 80 hospital beds and 8 doctors. The hospital began to take in abandoned babies nine years ago, or if poor pregnant women are unable to raise their children after giving birth, the hospital can temporarily take care of them and return them to the pregnant women after they have recovered. The abandoned babies are then adopted by others, but among the 50 abandoned babies, only 2 are boys, and the rest are girls. Ms. Zhang serves the community to the best of her ability. Although the school building funds are limited, in addition to teaching hours, she also uses classrooms to run a public school, which enrolls 30 students with elementary school qualifications. Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government to commend Ms. Zhang for her contributions to society and the country.

### The "Wolf" is Finally Tried Under Mercury Lamps - Mimura Shamelessly Denies Murder - Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentencing Set for the Sixth of Next Month

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Mimura Haruki, the former captain of the Kempeitai in Changshu, who was accused of tyranny and murder, was retried by Judge Lu Qi of the First Pacification Zone Military Court last Saturday. Yesterday afternoon at 3 pm, a collegial panel was convened again for the final adjudication. Presiding Judge Li Liang, Judges Lu Qi, Qu Zeceng, Zhang Shijie, and Li Qinhou, Prosecutor Tu Guangjun, Clerk Wang Shuliang, and the defendant's defense attorney Qian Longsheng attended. The two heads and several dry bones used as evidence were prominently displayed on the judge's bench. There were no empty seats in the audience, and the strong light of the mercury lamps of the Central Film Studio swept away the court's months-long silence.

Mimura was still wearing a grass-green military uniform coat and a water bottle. After entering the court, he took off his coat and water bottle. Presiding Judge Li first asked him his name and place of origin, and then asked if he had anything to say about the charges listed in the indictment. Mimura calmly took off his gloves and then took out a pre-written draft paper from his coat pocket and defended himself eloquently. The content of his defense was: (1) It is true that he arrested people in the Taicang Changre area in the 32nd year of the Republic of China and sent some of them to the 12th Army Military Law Office, but this was done under orders. (2) The indictment stated that 17 of the arrested people were sent to the Military Law Office, and the whereabouts of the remaining 5 were unknown. However, a total of 19 people were sent to the Military Law Office at that time, and the remaining 3 died of illness. (3) He denied having committed torture and abuse. If his subordinates had such behavior, he should only be subject to administrative punishment. (4) He asked the court not to believe the words of the victims' families and shamelessly claimed that the villagers in Changshu had said he was good during his four years there, but now they dare not say he is good, and rudely stated: "Chinese people are very good at lying."

Presiding Judge Li immediately questioned him on four key points: (1) Asked: What evidence is there that the so-called arrest of people was under orders from superiors? Answer: You can ask my superior, Lieutenant General Ueno. (2) Asked: Was the arrest of people suddenly ordered by superiors, or did the Kempeitai provide information first, and then the order was issued? Answer: The Kempeitai provided information first. (3) Asked: Before arresting people, did you demolish the Yang family's house and build four prison cells? Answer: Yes. (4) Asked: To whom were the bodies of the three people who allegedly died of illness handed over? Answer: To their families. There was a receipt at the time, but it has been lost. You can ask the families. The court immediately rebuked him, saying that the victims' families had never received the bodies, and ordered him to sign the record. Then, Gong Qiren, a Suzhou resident who had been unreasonably arrested by Mimura's subordinates Heno and others in the past, was called as a witness and recounted that he had been subjected to torture such as being drowned in water, trampled on six times, and hung.

The court then presented photos of the victims' bones that had been exhumed by personnel dispatched by the court outside the north gate of Changshu a month ago, and the translated transcripts of the testimony of Chen Yunzhou and Ye Lingzhen, former employees of Changshu County Hospital. Although Mimura was facing the heads and dry bones in the judge's seat, he showed no fear and still denied everything.

Finally, the prosecutor and the defendant's defense attorney stood up to make their arguments. Prosecutor Tu believed that the defendant was guilty of war crimes under the War Crimes Ordinance and the crime of abusing his authority to commit murder and torture under the criminal law and should be sentenced to death. The defense attorney argued that all the crimes were committed by Mimura's subordinates and that Mimura should not be held responsible and should be acquitted.

It was almost 6 pm. Presiding Judge Li declared the debate over, as the facts had already been clarified, and adjourned the hearing to pronounce the sentence at 2 pm on January 6th of the 36th year of the Republic of China.

### Wang Xunzhi, the First Defendant in the Grain Loan Case - Interrogated Yesterday - Due to an Inquiry from the Civil Service Disciplinary Committee - Learned That He Was the Director Who Was Involved in Corruption

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Xunzhi, the first defendant in the grain loan case, was the director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Tobacco Monopoly Bureau. Last year, he was investigated by the Hangzhou District Procuratorate for suspected corruption and was not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence. After the grain loan case occurred, Wang was also listed as a defendant. The Central Civil Service Disciplinary Committee recently sent a letter to the Hangzhou District Procuratorate asking whether the two Wang Xunzhi were the same person. The Hangzhou District Procuratorate sent a letter to the Shanghai District Court inquiring about this matter. The letter stated: "This office is managing the case of Wang Xunzhi, former director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, in the 34th year of the Republic of China, No. 238, for corruption. The investigation has been completed and a decision has been made not to prosecute. Now, the Central Civil Service Disciplinary Committee has sent a letter inquiring whether the defendant Wang Xunzhi in this case is the same as the defendant Wang Xunzhi in the grain loan fraud case accepted by your office. The defendant Wang Xunzhi in the corruption case accepted by this office was formerly the director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Tobacco Monopoly Bureau and is currently residing at No. 105, Siming Village, Central Zhongzheng Road, Shanghai, B. Whether they are the same person, this office cannot guess. Accordingly, please investigate and reply as soon as possible." Therefore, Judge Wu Zhongzu of the District Court interrogated Wang Xunzhi again yesterday. Wang stated: He is 47 years old, from Zhejiang, the deputy general manager of Changjiang Industrial Company, residing at No. 55, Siming Village, and was the director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Tobacco Monopoly Bureau and had also lived at No. 105, Siming Village. After the interrogation, he was returned to custody.

### Water Rats Caught Stealing - Twelve People Arrested

[Our Newspaper's Report] Patrol boats from the Harbor Affairs Committee's Inspection and Security Group discovered four boats filled with coal flowing south near Dongjiadu in Nanshi late the day before yesterday. Because their actions were suspicious, the group's supervisor Lu Zhizhong ordered them to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, one of the men on the boats pushed Lu into the water after he boarded the boat. Fortunately, the accompanying staff were alert and rescued Lu and then used guns to stop their actions. Finally, the criminals were caught. The four boats carried a total of about 15 tons of coal, worth 5 million yuan. The suspects, Wang Tonglin, Zhu Jinfa, Duan Yingui, and Zeng Wangshi, were taken back for interrogation. According to their confession, the coal was stolen from regular Shanghai-Ningbo line ships and planned to be transported to Pudong for sale. After the group obtained the confession, it has prepared a document and transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for handling yesterday.

### Enforcing Strict Drug Prohibition and Imposing Severe Penalties: Drug Offenders Sentenced to Imprisonment Will Not Be Lightly Granted Remission – Reasons Stated in Court Ruling

[Report from our newspaper] After the victory, the government is determined to eradicate drug use in the short term, ordering drug users to register and quit within a deadline, and vigorously arresting drug offenders who continue to use drugs and sending them to court for prosecution. All those found guilty of drug use are sentenced to imprisonment. All defendants have broken their addiction after detoxification. Prosecutors have requested remission of their sentences on their behalf based on the security disposition of the Criminal Law. Apart from Yuan Meiyun and Xia Peizhen, there are a total of nineteen people including Wang Kequan, Shen Xiaomei, Shi Yuxiu, Cao Xiuying, Liu Shi, Chen Zimei, Fu Xiaomei, Zhao Jinbiao, Wang Jinshan, Ma Ziren, Li Dongshi, Li Li, Li Wenxing, Wang Chenying, Jin Zhangshi, Xie Lushi, Shen Mashi, Chen Yeye, and Wu Sanmei. However, all were rejected by the court. The reasons are generally the same. The full text of one ruling is published below:

"Defendant Wu Sanmei, female, age 43, from Guangdong, residing at 183 Hubei Road, in custody. The aforementioned defendant's sentence has been requested for remission by the prosecutor due to a drug case. The ruling is as follows:

### Ruling: The request is rejected.

Reason: Upon reviewing the case file, the defendant was transferred to this court by the Shanghai Municipal Police Department on August 7 of this year for opium use. This court sentenced her to six months of imprisonment on August 12 of this year, with a two-month deadline for forced detoxification and addiction breaking. The judgment has been confirmed and is on file. During the execution of the sentence, the prosecutor, based on the forensic examination confirming the defendant's addiction breaking after forced detoxification, deemed that there was no need to execute the imprisonment and requested remission of the sentence. This court, according to Article 88 of the Criminal Law, stipulates that if the court believes there is no need to execute the sentence after the execution of the prohibition order, the sentence may be remitted. However, at a time when the government is strictly eradicating drug use, it is appropriate to impose severe penalties to warn ignorant drug users. It is inappropriate to invoke the aforementioned law and lightly grant remission. Furthermore, the original sentence was extremely light, and the term of imprisonment will soon expire, making remission of the sentence unnecessary. The request should be rejected in accordance with Article 485 of the Criminal Procedure Law, as stated in the main text."

### Murdering Child and Suicide: Another Example of the Harm Caused by Drug Use

[Report from our newspaper] Wang Shuren, who currently works in the Shenyang Municipal Government, has a wife named Wang Chun, 39 years old, a local. She has a long-standing addiction. In March of this year, her husband Wang Shuren provided funds for her to bring one of their children to Shanghai to quit opium, temporarily residing with her mother. Unexpectedly, she lacked the courage and continued to indulge in opium day and night, leading to financial difficulties. She once borrowed 350,000 legal tender from Ding Guitang of the Jianghai Customs Bureau due to family relations. However, the money was quickly used up. Yesterday at around 2 PM, she poisoned her child with a heavy dose of poisonous liquid, and also swallowed poison herself. She then brought the child to her cousin Cheng Zhiqin (at 150 Lane 13, Jiashen Road). After speaking for a few words, Cheng noticed her pale complexion and incoherent speech and quickly hired a car to accompany her to Renji Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, her child died soon after due to excessive poisoning. Although the woman received careful diagnosis from the doctors, she had not been removed from danger by midnight.

### Two Cloth Stores Robbed in Pingliang Road: Eighteen Robbers Armed with New Military Weapons; Sentries Posted at Intersections, Police Officers Disarmed

[Report from our newspaper] The Wandaxiang Cotton Store at 2587-2589 Pingliang Road in Pudong, and the neighboring Baochang Cotton and Cloth Store at 2601-2603, were suddenly attacked by eighteen robbers at around 1:50 AM yesterday. They wore different clothing and were all armed with new military weapons such as submachine guns, Mauser pistols, and handguns. After arriving, they posted sentries at key intersections around the area. A group of robbers then knocked on the door and entered, first confining more than twenty employees and apprentices from both stores in the pavilion of the Baochang store. At that time, two nearby police officers (numbers 1422 and 1295) rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm but were disarmed by the robbers and ordered not to move. The remaining robbers divided up and looted, taking half an hour to leave after plundering. Before leaving, they injured the head of Chen Baoyi, the owner of Baochang store, with the butt of a gun, causing bleeding. They then escaped with their loot. It was found that the losses of the two cotton and cloth stores were as follows: Baochang store lost 8.5 million legal tender in cash and over 11 million legal tender in cloth, while Wandaxiang lost 5 million legal tender in cloth and 230,000 legal tender in cash.

### First Meeting of the Land Administration Advisory Committee: Rental Standard Issues - Six Principles Formulated; Discussion on the Expropriation of the Hardoon Garden and Racecourse

The Municipal Government, considering the complex land situation in the city due to the mixed Chinese and foreign population, established the Land Administration Advisory Committee by a decision made at the Municipal Government Meeting, in order to ensure that land administration facilities are in line with local realities, to pool wisdom, and to solve major land administration issues. Social figures and experts familiar with the city's land situation were appointed as members. The committee held its first meeting at 3 PM yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Hall. More than twenty people attended, including Mayor Wu, Director Zhu, and advisory committee members Fang Zhi, Du Yuesheng, Xu Yongzuo, Shu Shuxiong, and Lu Shidao. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting.

Mayor Wu first reported that the Municipal Government hoped that municipal facilities would be closer to public opinion. Although the city already had a Municipal Council, which met once every three months to discuss extremely important issues, not all councilors were researchers of land issues. Therefore, the Land Administration Advisory Committee was established to study major issues for the government's reference. There were three issues for discussion today: (1) The issue of rental standards, which is a major and difficult issue. (2) The issue of the racecourse. The prerequisite for this issue is whether the issuance of lottery tickets for horse racing constitutes gambling. It is heard that the council has received an interpretation order from the central government stating that the issuance of lottery tickets without government approval constitutes gambling. Therefore, there is still a difficulty in the discussion. I have discussed with the chairman, Van Kerckem, suggesting exchanging suburban land for the current racecourse to be used as the council's headquarters and a park. Van Kerckem raised two points: (1) the issue of suburban transportation, and (2) the issue of land prices at the time of expropriation.

(3) Regarding the Hardoon Garden issue, I have negotiated with Mr. Raidt, the agent of Hardoon's estate. This issue involves Hardoon's nationality, and whether Hardoon was British is questionable, possibly under the jurisdiction of the Chinese court. The will also states that a portion of his property should be donated to the Municipal Government, a portion to the Chinese Central Government, and the rest donated to charity. I have asked Mr. Raidt to lease the garden to the Municipal Government as a park, using the land tax payment as rent, but there have been no results.

After that, Director Shen Zhu reported on the land tax, with collected taxes reaching 2.5 billion, and it is expected that 3.6 billion can be collected next year, with a budget of 12 billion for next year. Then the rental standard issue was discussed. Xu Shihao, Xu Yongzuo, Li Shuxiong, Zhu Fuyou, Li Wenjie, Wang Xianqing, and others expressed their opinions on legal and factual matters. Director Zhu then summarized the opinions of all parties, taking into account the principles of economic fairness and social policy, and formulated six principles. He also appointed Zhu Ping, Xu Shihao, Ma Shaoquan, Li Wenjie, Ma Junshuo, Wang Xianqing, and Li Shuxiong to form a subcommittee to study concrete measures and provide them to the council for reference. (1) The current status should be maintained for those whose pre-war rental amount is below a certain level. (2) The principle of maintaining the current status should still be applied for those exceeding a certain amount. If an increase is required, it should be done through agreement. If there is a dispute, the district mediation committee may be requested to mediate. (3) The total rent received by those who sublet a portion of the house to others should not exceed the rent they should pay themselves. (4) Rent should not be calculated in foreign currency. Those originally rented in foreign currency should be converted to legal tender, and thereafter, the legal tender amount shall prevail. (5) Actively promote measures to encourage housing construction. (6) Request national banks to open construction loans.

The principles for the Hardoon Garden are: (1) Expropriation in accordance with the law. (2) The estate dispute should be promptly tried by the court. (3) The portion of Hardoon's estate designated for donation to the government and public welfare should be investigated and taken over by the Land Administration Bureau first.

Regarding the racecourse issue, the principle is: (1) Expropriate in accordance with the law or have the Municipal Government designate comparable land in the suburbs for exchange. All of the above principles were handed over to the subcommittee to study concrete measures.

### Zhao Zengjue's Response to the Council: Maintaining Electricity Conservation is Still Necessary

[Report from our newspaper] The Public Works, Health, and Regulations committees of the Municipal Council held meetings separately at 3 PM yesterday. The details are as follows: The sixth meeting of the Public Works Committee was attended by twelve councilors, chaired by Xu Xueyu. Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Works Bureau, also attended and reported on the reasons why electricity conservation measures must be maintained, stating briefly: (1) The electricity conservation measures are temporary in nature, for a period of four months, starting in November, so it is impossible to check the number of residents or sub-use households one by one. (2) According to the historical records of lighting electricity consumption, there is an increase of 20% to 25% in winter. This year, the increase is only 13.1%. (3) A review of the 160,000 lighting households in the city shows that half of them are below 20 degrees. If each household uses half a degree more per day, then a total of 40,000 degrees more is needed. Based on an average of three hours of lighting per day, approximately 13,000 degrees can be saved per day. (4) Regarding industrial electricity consumption, it was 45 million degrees in October this year, and increased to 50 million degrees after electricity conservation in November. (5) The generators of all factories have now been developed as much as possible, and the bureau is also urging an increase in power generation. Once the power supply increases, the electricity conservation measures can be gradually lifted by district.

The committee then discussed the proposal submitted by the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Public Works Bureau to the Council for review of the draft provisional rules for the Shanghai civil shipping and lighterage industry. Resolution: Amended and passed to the Regulations Committee for review. (2) According to the application from the Tricycle Rental Industry Association for the issuance of licenses to maintain business. Resolution: Sent to the Public Works Bureau for consideration.

Health Committee: The sixth meeting of the workers discussed four proposals: (1) The proposal from the Municipal Government regarding the over-collection of the mobilized epidemic prevention fee by the Epidemic Prevention Committee, submitting detailed reasons and work plans for review, and asking how to handle it. Resolution: It was originally agreed to spend the over-collection part of the epidemic prevention fee. (2) The notice from the Secretariat that part of the Hongkou Road Elementary School building is occupied by the Health Bureau, requesting the Health Bureau to vacate it. Resolution: A letter to the Health Bureau to review the files of Hongkou Road Elementary School and then investigate the facts for discussion at the next meeting. (3) The application from the Shanghai Funeral Coffin Transportation Industry Association, stating the difficulties in clearing accumulated coffins as ordered and the reasons for the inconvenience of cremation, requesting the Municipal Government to adopt it. Resolution: Forwarded to the Municipal Government for consideration.

### Pre-War Deposit Repayment Issue: Second Instance Judgment by the High Court - 800 Times for Fixed Deposits, 500 Times for Regular Savings

[Report from our newspaper] The issue of pre-war debt and bank deposit repayment has repeatedly led to litigation. The judgments of the Shanghai District Court were all based on a standard of 1,000 times. After the parties appealed to the High Court, the High Court, unwilling to create a precedent, advised on attempted reconciliation in each appeal case. However, the original defendants mostly insisted on their claims, making reconciliation extremely difficult. The High Court then delivered judgments in two cases yesterday morning: Fixed deposits from 1940 were changed to be repaid at 800 times. Regular savings deposits from 1938 were changed to be repaid at 500 times. The details are summarized as follows:

(1) Citizen Chen Jilin deposited 2,000 legal tender into the Four Banks Savings Association on May 6, 1940, for a fixed term of five years, which expired on May 6 of last year. Chen requested the court to order a payment increased by 3,000 times in accordance with Article 12 of the Civil Procedure Supplementary Regulations and the Judicial Yuan's interpretation No. 3018 after his return to Shanghai. The District Court ruled that the defendant, the Four Banks Savings Association, should increase the payment by 1,000 times. The Four Banks Savings Association was dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court. The second instance judgment was announced yesterday morning, overturning the original judgment and changing the payment to be increased by 800 times. (2) The appellant, Juxingcheng Bank, because the plaintiffs Lu Yu and Lu Kun had special regular savings deposits from September 28, 1938, and December 14 of the same year, with Lu Yu accumulating 2,311.43 yuan and Lu Kun accumulating 2,185.03 yuan, both for a fixed term of five years, expiring in May 1942. In August of this year, the Lu brothers filed a lawsuit requesting repayment at 1,000 times. The District Court ruled that the repayment should be calculated at 800 times. Juxingcheng was dissatisfied and appealed. The second instance judgment was announced by the High Court yesterday morning, overturning the original judgment and changing the payment to be calculated at 500 times.

### Deadline for Public Reporting of Traitors Expires Today; High Court Has Not Yet Received Formal Order

[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the issue of the deadline for reporting traitors, a person in charge of the High Court said yesterday that the court had not yet received a formal order. However, the National Government issued an instruction on the 13th of this month, the content of which stated: "Regarding the periodic reporting of traitors, it has been decided at the 211th Standing Committee meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council that the deadline for the reporting of traitor cases during the Anti-Japanese War by the people or organizations is December 31, 1946. Reports made after the deadline will not be considered by the prosecutor. However, the state's right of prosecution and the victim's right of complaint will not be affected." In this regard, the scope of reporting traitors has been narrowed to eliminate the abuse of malicious accusations. However, the work of reporting traitors has not ended as a result.

### Trial of Supervisor Li Hongfei

[Report from our newspaper] Li Hongfei was tried at the High Court yesterday afternoon. The defendant, 59 years old, from Ningbo, Zhejiang, wore a blue silk robe, silver-rimmed glasses, and had a ruddy complexion. He claimed to have more than 20 years of experience in the salt industry. During the Anti-Japanese War, he had bid to transport 1 million dan of Huai salt to the Salt Administration Bureau in the name of Xieji Salt Company. However, due to the fall of Beijing and Shanghai, the bureau moved west, and only over 40,000 dan were transported to Hankou. In the winter of 1939, he planned to use foreign ships to transport a large amount of Huai salt to supply the people of Hunan and Hubei. However, correspondence with the Salt Administration Bureau was seized by the enemy, and he was arrested by the Japanese military police on the second day of the first month of the lunar calendar in 1940, and was detained for 63 days. He was released on bail through Zhou Fohai. Zhou had twice advised him to take a false position, once as the head of the false Salt Administration and once as the false Minister of Industry, but he refused both times. In March 1943, he became the chairman of the false Central China Salt Industry Company, in charge of salt transportation. He transported Haizhou salt to Xuzhou, Bengbu, Nanjing, Shanghai and other areas, but claimed that it was all for the people's food. The false company was established during the Restoration Government era, with 50% of the shares held by the enemy and 40% forcibly held by the false government. Merchants held only a weak 10%. There was also the export of industrial salt for the enemy's use. After he became the false chairman, he reduced the export quantity. After the reorganization into the false China Salt Industry Company in November 1943, the supply was stopped, and the enemy shares were also withdrawn. The core of his defense was two points: (1) The false company was only responsible for transportation and did not have food itself. (2) During his tenure as the director, he did not send ships to transport industrial salt to Japan. The Japanese sent their own ships to transport it. After the defendant's defense lawyer stood up to defend, the court announced that the hearing would be adjourned, and the defendant was returned to custody.

Seeking my brother, Chen Minzhang, from Fuzhou. Before August 13th, he worked at the Hankou branch of the China National Aviation Corporation for many years. Since the National Army's westward retreat, there has been no news of him. If any relatives or friends know his whereabouts, please write to He Chen Yuzhen at No. 87, Lane 383, Xiangyang South Road, this city. I sincerely and eagerly await your response.

Seeking Wu Huiquan, 18 years old, from Haxia, Zhejiang. On August 29th of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the South City Railway Station was bombed by enemy planes. His mother unfortunately died, and Huiquan was fortunate to only lose a finger on his left hand. His uncle, Zhao Jun, pitied his orphaned state and asked a friend to introduce him to the Zhabei Buddhist Orphanage for care and education. Later, it was moved to a safe location at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Fuxu Road. Afterwards, his uncle did not have time to visit. He does not know exactly where he moved to. He has only this weak nephew, and his parents are all deceased. If he is left outside, with no whereabouts, he cannot bear it in his heart, and it is difficult to face the spirit of his deceased younger sister in the underworld. He has no choice but to entrust me to request your kindness and publish this notice. If any kind-hearted person knows his whereabouts, please notify Doctor Zhu Guangsheng at No. 119, Lane 638, Xinzha Road, so that he can inform Mr. Zhao. The merit will be immeasurable.

### Fourth Round, Fourth Allotment of Yarn - Spinning Control Committee Revises New Prices - 20-Count Yarn Priced at 1.975 Million Yuan

(Reported by this newspaper) The Spinning Control Committee convened a yarn price review committee at the City Government Conference Room at 4 PM yesterday. Chairman Wu, Shu Yunzhang, and Wang Qizi attended, along with Li Shengbo, Wu Weijing, Guo Dihuo, Ye Yixin, and Liu Wenteng, Director of the Spinning Control Committee's Business Department. After much discussion, a new price was finally determined for the fourth round, fourth allotment of yarn, i.e., the newly negotiated price for 20-count yarn is 1.97 million yuan per piece. The prices of other grades of yarn are calculated proportionally. In addition, the fourth round, fourth allotment of recycled yarn will be entirely approved on January 6th.

The new prices assessed yesterday are the selling prices for the fourth round, fourth allotment of yarn, which already include the consolidated tax and 20% profit. As for the purchase price by the Central Government, it still awaits approval from President Song. It is said that a draft has been prepared at yesterday's meeting for President Song's reference, and those who attended said that the differences are minor.

The accounting items for calculating the cost of cotton yarn were also decided at yesterday's meeting, and it was stipulated that regardless of whether it is state-owned or privately-owned, all should be calculated based on the following items: (1) Raw materials. (2) Wages. (3) Manufacturing costs: including (A) materials and fuel, (B) depreciation, (C) employee benefits, (D) power costs, (E) staff salaries and allowances, (F) repair costs: including machine repairs and building repairs, (G) other. (4) Financial costs (interest). (5) Business expenses (i.e., management fees, such as the expenses of the Spinning and Construction Company's management office, etc.).

The issue of cotton prices was also discussed at yesterday's meeting, but opinions differed. In the newly determined prices, the cotton price is calculated at 250,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), with each piece using 3.5 dan. The consolidated tax is 94,000 yuan, calculated at 6%.

### US Dollar Stagnant, Gold Prices Rise - Hong Kong Remittances Have Plenty of Supply from Guangdong Banks

Yellow gold was extremely stable yesterday. When the market opened in the morning, the price rose to 3.38 million to 3.4 million yuan due to news reports with slightly favorable buying arguments. As soon as the Central Bank offered to sell, the market price immediately fell. With no support in the middle, the low price dropped to 3.24 million yuan, and there was real sales support. The Central Bank allocated 90 bars at a price of 3.28 million yuan. Afterwards, the price rose back to 3.37 million yuan, and the market turned idle. There was a slight fluctuation between 3.3 million and 3.35 million yuan. At noon, news suddenly came that the Central Bank's trade intentions had stopped, and the price rose to around 3.377 million yuan. The afternoon started stable but then weakened, falling from 3.39 million to around 3.34 million yuan, an increase of 50,000 yuan compared to the previous closing. Gold jewelry was quoted at 356,000 yuan, silver dollars were flat, and underground interest rates remained between 15% and 18%.

Foreign currencies were flat for the US dollar and weak for Hong Kong yesterday. The black market price of US dollars started at 6,100 to 6,300 yuan in the morning, and then hovered between 6,200 and 6,400 yuan. Transactions were even rarer in the afternoon, and the market was stagnant. As a result, there was little change compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollar was weak because Guangdong banks continued to supply. Although the Velvet Line Bank accepted it, it was unable to boost the price. The Shanghai telegraphic transfer rate rose to 81.5 yuan, and then fell below 1,200 yuan, a further drop of about 50 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 121 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 1,470 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 19,300 yuan. Only Hong Kong exchange rate had some volume of transactions.

### Authorities Will Send Personnel to Investigate Financial Institutions - Illegal Operations Will Be Severely Investigated

According to news from the city's financial industry this morning, most of the year-end accounting for the second half of the year has been completed. The highest financial authorities attach great importance to the past operations of the industry and will send personnel to Shanghai to conduct spot checks. It is reported that the authorities' intention to inspect (the operation of financial institutions) is based on the fact that the speculative atmosphere in Shanghai's financial industry was strong in the past and could lead to instability. In order to prevent future crises, those found to have engaged in illegal operations will be severely investigated.

### Individual Sales of Foreign Exchange Must Be Approved by the Central Bank

A reporter recently learned from the Foreign Exchange Examination Office that the office recently notified designated foreign exchange banks that henceforth, individual sales of foreign exchange must first be approved by the Central Bank.

### Tung Oil Market Stable - This Year's Trade Was Average

The supply of tung oil in the spot market is limited, and it is the end of the year, so transactions have come to a standstill, and the market has not changed. Looking back at the tung oil business in this city, there were no special profits this year, nor were there any bankruptcies due to losses. Most of the tung oil merchants in this city have a long history and strong capital, so they can barely maintain even in the economic downturn. Tung oil is one of China's main export products. At the beginning of the year, the price of tung oil was 70,000 national yuan per dan. By the end of the year, the price was 150,000 yuan, only doubling in price. Compared with other commodities, the difference is quite large. The biggest reason is the limited export prices. From January to May of this year, the amount of tung oil transported from the producing areas to Shanghai for export was not very large, but it continued to arrive. After June, the prices in the producing areas were as high as the export prices in Shanghai, and transportation was difficult, so the amount of goods arriving was small, and operations were also difficult. Later, due to high interest rates and rising freight rates, tung oil transportation became a losing proposition. For example, the freight rate for transporting tung oil from Chongqing to Shanghai was 30,000 yuan per dan in July and August, ten times the freight rate from Shanghai to New York. The transportation of tung oil from the producing areas relies entirely on manual labor, and land transportation costs are difficult to bear. Even if some waterways can be used, there is a shortage of boats, making transportation difficult. After the second foreign exchange adjustment, the price of tung oil in the producing areas rose more sharply than in Shanghai. By October, due to the attraction of the export ports in South China, tung oil from Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan was transported to South China. There was no arrival of goods in Shanghai, and transactions were extremely dismal.

### Woolen Fabric Industry Inventories

Yesterday was New Year's Eve in the Western calendar. There were no wholesale transactions of woolen fabrics, and even retail transactions were very quiet. Most stores were checking inventories and calculating accounts in order to conclude the year. It is said that the woolen fabric industry has suffered from heavy losses, high interest rates, and large public and private expenses this year. The inventories of all stores have decreased, and few have made a profit. Most are fortunate to be able to survive the Lunar New Year. There have been many closures and mergers.

### Production Loans - Temporary Review Committee - Considers Relaxing Standards - Few Commercial Banks Participate

[Reported by this newspaper] The Temporary Review Committee for Production Special Loans of the Fourth War Zone Headquarters convened its seventh routine meeting at 1 PM yesterday. More than 20 committee members and experts attended, and Xu Baiyuan, Secretary-General of the Financial Decision and the Four Banks Joint Office, also attended. Chairman Huo presided over the meeting. Four proposals were discussed: (1) Continue to approve five loans, totaling more than 1 billion yuan. (2) The review criteria for supporting banks and financial institutions are different, with varying degrees of leniency. It was decided to appoint three experts to formulate fair and consistent standards, which will be submitted for discussion at the next meeting. (3) In addition to adhering to the various regulations that have been promulgated, the loan procedures will also be relaxed. The detailed measures are still being studied by experts. (4) In order to regularly assess the loan situation after the fact, it is urgent to establish an audit office. Each unit of the China National Bank and Bureau will send two representatives, commercial banks will send three representatives, and the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office will send three representatives to form it. The Central Bank will send a person to serve as the chief auditor and regularly perform audit duties. The meeting adjourned at around 3 PM.

The reporter then interviewed people from all walks of life to solicit opinions on production loans. Some commercial financial institutions believe that two batches of production loans have been approved, totaling more than 2 billion yuan, but most of them are supported by the China National Bank and Bureau, and the Central Bank rediscounts them. Very few commercial financial institutions undertake it. Summarizing Zhang's views, there are no more than three points: (1) The interest rate on loans from various financial institutions is 4%, and the rediscount rate from the Central Bank is 2%. After rediscounting, the Central Bank bears 80% of the funds, and the lending financial institution bears 20%. After conversion, the interest earned by the lending financial institution is 1.2%. However, the current interest income from self-operated loans from various financial institutions is actually more favorable than this. (2) After the lending financial institution rediscounts with the Central Bank, it shares the funds with the Central Bank by 20-80, but in reality, it must bear the full responsibility for the loan. The current Banking Association has sent a letter to the Production Loan Association requesting clarification on this liability issue. (3) For each loan granted by a lending financial institution, at least 20% of the loan funds must be filled in. If loans continue to be granted, the lending financial institution's own funds may be insufficient, so there is an invisible restriction that it cannot lend as much as possible.

The industrial and commercial sectors believe that the current production loans still target raw materials and finished products as collateral. As for machinery and factory buildings, the valuation method has not been determined, so they cannot actually be used as collateral, and the regulations stipulate that the lending financial institution must send personnel to supervise the loan factory. If there is considerable profit, there are also regulations for mutual distribution according to this example, which is especially unaccustomed to the general industrial and commercial circles. Also, a certain cigarette factory applied for a loan, but it was deemed a luxury industry and rejected.

### December Fuel Management Committee - Allots Industrial Coal - Over 19,000 Tons

The Fuel Management Committee is currently purchasing a large amount of coal from coal-producing areas and transporting it to Shanghai in succession in order to solve the city's coal shortage as much as possible. In order to eliminate coal shortages and hoarding by merchants, the committee allocates coal to the Coal Business Association for unified supply to various coal merchants for sale. The coal used by private factories is also allocated by the committee on a monthly basis. On the one hand, the Coal Business Association organizes a management office to allocate coal to private factories, which is responsible for registration and transportation. Personnel are dispatched to supervise and escort the coal to the factory in batches during each allocation to prevent fraud. It is learned that the committee allocated coal to 24 private factories in December, and the quantity for each industry is as follows: Machinery and cotton textile industry 3,400 tons, paper industry 850 tons, nut and bolt industry 400 tons, machine dyeing and weaving industry 5,859 tons, rubber products industry 1,308 tons, match industry 171 tons, flavoring powder industry 465 tons, soap and candle industry 436 tons, cigarette industry 1,148 tons, wool and velvet spinning, weaving and dyeing industry 706 tons, underwear weaving industry 285 tons, chemical raw materials industry 626 tons, thermos bottle industry 471 tons, machinery industry 211 tons, leather industry 60 tons, glass industry 870 tons, noodle food industry 212 tons, oil extraction industry 408 tons, silk cloth dyeing merchant Sang 316 tons, oil and fat industry 103 tons, grass knit hat industry 307 tons, knitting industry 156 tons, pharmaceutical industry 374 tons, and textile industry in the sixth district 250 tons, totaling 19,392 tons.

### Rice Prices Firm, Oil Market Flat and Weak

Over 10,000 shi of rice arrived from the north and south. Buyers were unwilling to sell quickly, and Nabu were not willing to buy due to tight credit conditions. As a result, early rice in the southern market was stable in the morning but weak in the afternoon, and the northern market was weak first and then stable. High-quality northern japonica rice was still firm, while middle and lower-quality southern japonica rice fell by a small amount of 1,000 yuan. The supply and demand of indica rice were both small, and there was no change. Baiyuan fell by a small amount of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan due to the large number of middle and low-quality goods. Yinyuan goods poured in, falling by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Wheat was scarce and firm, flour supply and demand were balanced, bran turned firm, and rose by 100 to 200 yuan. The supply of tung oil from various sources continued in the oil market, but the offtake was flat, and continued to weaken by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan to 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The supply of medium-grade soybean oil in barrels was also large, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. However, the offtake of high-grade soybean oil and crude tung oil in baskets continued to be stable. Clear oil and sesame oil lacked fluctuations, rapeseed oil softened and lacked vitality. The oil market situation was still fluctuating in a flat and weak state. Soybean cake and oil residue were still being handled, and the price was steadily increasing by 100 to 200 yuan. Corn rose steadily, broad beans were mediocre, red beans were still scarce and unchanged, yellow beans were still being sold in small quantities, oil mills were selectively buying them, the offtake was flat, and the price rose slightly by 300 to 500 yuan. Sesame was widely sold in Guangdong, and high-quality goods were in demand and actively transacted, with high-quality goods increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Medium-quality goods were flat. Peanut kernels were continuously sold in Guangdong and were also actively transacted in this area, and the price steadily increased, rising by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

Yarn - Yesterday the yarn market was generally flat and finely traded. 20-count yarn was slightly firmer than last weekend. 32-count fine yarn continued to be purchased by Guangdong merchants, rising by 50,000 to 80,000 yuan. Weaving factories absorbed 42-count double-ply yarn, also jumping by 100,000 yuan. 20-count yarn was unable to rise due to a larger supply and weak sales, and it remained mediocre.

### Miscellaneous Grains and Cloth Shipped to Taiwan

[Reported by this newspaper] China Merchants Bureau's Hai Zhe and Hai Zhou ships sailed to Taiwan one after another.

### Silk Trade Quiet

The silk market has been declining continuously. Yesterday the market was still stable. There was not much change in rayon compared to Saturday. Factory silk quotes were slightly firmer, but transactions were very rare. Only 5 dan of high-quality new E-grade goods were transacted yesterday, priced at 4.65 million yuan. There were no other transactions. Silk fabrics and quilt covers fell sharply. Da Cheng quilt covers were sold off in large quantities in the market, resulting in the lowest price of 2.55 million yuan, and there were no buyers. Huazhong crepe sold for 3.5 million yuan, while secondary-quality goods sold for only 450,000 yuan, which was due to extremely tight credit conditions and buyers were unable to buy.

### Sausage Casings Nearly 4 Million Yuan per Barrel - Foreign Factory Manipulation Should Be Stopped Urgently

It is learned that the recent selling price of sausage casings in New York is still 80 cents per piece. Although the Swiss franc exchange rate is higher, the selling price can earn 3.6 to 3.7 million yuan per barrel, but it is still very different from the current cost calculation in Shanghai. The cost calculation table of the industry association is recorded as follows:

Raw material purchase price: 2,500 pieces of net sausage casings, of which 20% are fresh goods, calculated at 1,400 yuan per piece for 500 pieces, totaling 700,000 yuan, and 80% are customer goods, calculated at 1,275 yuan per piece for 2,000 pieces, totaling 2,550,000 yuan.

600 jin of salt are used per barrel, calculated at 345 yuan per jin, totaling 207,000 yuan. Wooden barrels, including white wax, cost 30,000 yuan. Barrel lining cloth and sewing cost 10,000 yuan. Water, electricity, rent, house donation, business tax, etc. cost 70,000 yuan. Trucking raw materials into the factory and shipping net goods out of the factory costs 16,000 yuan. Labor (an average of 15 workers are employed in the factory, including one foreman, three measurers, seven water pourers, and four assistants. At least 30 barrels of net goods can be produced per month) costs 319,000 yuan. The total cost per barrel is 3,902,000 yuan. The above costs do not include silver money interest, manager, accountant, and other office staff expenses. Therefore, before the international market price improves, it is still extremely difficult to export. People in the industry hope that the government will take action against a certain foreign sausage factory in the industry that deliberately raises the purchase price of raw materials (fresh intestines), order it to join the association, so as to avoid manipulation from it.

### Economic Downturn - More Than 20 Fish Shops Go Bankrupt

There are more than 70 fish shops in this city, all located in the Bund and the 16th Pier area. According to people in the industry, the industry was quite developed before the war. Currently, due to the crisis in industry and commerce, more than 20 shops have gone bankrupt in the past month. The reasons for this are: (1) The funds of the shops are short, with a maximum of no more than 100 million yuan, and usually 20 million to 50 million yuan, so they often have poor turnover and are subject to high-interest loans, leading to bankruptcy. (2) The fish transported from other ports by the shops in this city must be subject to a 0.4% commission by the fish market, so development is limited. (3) The industry previously received a government loan of 100 million yuan, but only the fish market and boat owners benefited, and the transportation industry received little benefit, so financial difficulties are still unavoidable.

### Sugar Prices Rebound

Yesterday sugar prices were flat first and then rose. The trade association quoted the spot price of medium sugar at 141,000 yuan at the beginning of the market, then rose to 3,000 yuan, and later to 144,000 to 4,500 yuan. The price of Zhanju was 115,000 to 8,000 yuan, Shantou green opened at 115,000 yuan, and Gaoshunde green opened at 115,000 yuan. 300 to 400 bags were traded, all with customs clearance payment, so prices increased. Mian Chi was 152,000 to 3,000 yuan, 50 bags, Xinghua white was 158,000 to 6,000 yuan, and Xing Chi was 142,000 to 4,500 yuan, with more than 200 bags traded.

### Tea Market Still Quiet

Yesterday, the British company Renji Foreign Company had a small appetite for high-quality aged Qimen tea, but sellers were still hoarding it because of the scarcity of goods, so the market remained quiet. Other types of tea, such as Chouzhen and Zhenmei, have been selling well recently, and prices are quite stable. As for aged pearl tea, the inventory has been exhausted. The process of other teas is mostly similar to last week.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Sends Letter to Jiangsu Provincial Government - Strictly Prohibit Hoarding and Profiteering

[Joint Anhui and Shaanxi News Agency] It is learned that because Jiangsu Province was located in occupied territory, the measures for cracking down on hoarding and profiteering of important daily necessities were not implemented during the extraordinary period. Although the war is over, prices are still fluctuating. Non-business operators and non-industry merchants, or industry merchants, may still be hoarding and profiteering of important daily necessities, so they should still be severely cracked down on in accordance with the law, and regulations for rewarding tip-offs should be stipulated to encourage reporting. The types and names of important daily necessities that should be cracked down on for hoarding are as follows:

(1) Grains: Rice, grain, flour, sorghum, millet, corn, beans.

(2) Clothing: Cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth (various native cotton cloths, various bleached, dyed, or printed cotton cloths), linen (various native linen cloths, various bleached, dyed, or printed linen cloths), leather.

### Financial News - Datong Bank

Recently, due to the pressure of the year-end season and the impact of the industrial and commercial downturn, there has been slight volatility in the local banking industry. A reporter investigated from various sources. According to the records of the Bills Exchange, Datong Bank at the intersection of Henan Road and Beijing Road and Zhenghe Bank on Nanjing Road still have a surplus after balancing their daily clearing positions. According to the person in charge of Datong Bank, the bank's business has always been conducted properly and has never engaged in speculative activities, and its reserve position is very sufficient.

Construction Bank - The Shanghai branch of the Construction Bank announced a temporary suspension of clearing on the 26th of this month. Yesterday morning (the 30th) it resumed business. It is heard that the bank's turnover problem this time was due to the failure of its investment in Taiwan sugar business, and it had ordered a huge amount of 1,000 tons.

### Hong Kong Speculators' Usual Trick - Fake Telegrams Appear Again

Yesterday, someone in this area fabricated a telegram draft from the United Press and sent it to various newspapers in an attempt to disrupt the financial market. This fake telegram claimed to be from Saigon and said that terrorists had seized all banks and transportation in Vietnam and that this action was obviously instigated by Moscow. The telegram paper was the same as that used by the United Press and was sent together with three other telegrams from Warsaw and Washington to various newspapers. However, four Chinese newspapers noticed loopholes in the way the draft was sent and saw through the deception. The United Press received a notice in time, announced that it was forged, and prevented publication. It was then found that this was a planned campaign to force sellers to sell Vietnamese currency in order to profit from it. It should be noted that on February 11th of this year, someone also forged a United Press message saying that the Ministry of Finance had announced that the US dollar exchange rate had been changed to 2,000 to 1. Various newspapers published it without investigating, and the legal currency fell sharply for a time. After the United Press denied it, the market immediately recovered.

### The Fortune and Rongfeng Stocks Plummet and Trading Volume Dwindles on the Shanghai Stock Market

Yesterday, the Shanghai Stock Exchange operated for only half a day for both spot and forward deliveries, as it was the day before the Western calendar's New Year's Eve. Spot transactions are to be settled and cleared the next day (December 31) to close the year's accounts. Forward transactions are to be settled on January 6, to coincide with the start of the ninth forward delivery period on January 4. Market trading volume decreased, but sentiment remained relatively positive. Financial institutions continued to engage in arbitrage trading of Yong Yarn (永紗), which briefly rallied mid-session, but rumors of instability in a certain small-cap stock triggered a sharp decline near the close. The market opened slightly lower due to the bankruptcy of Fuxing. Fuxingxiangji Securities was Broker No. 58 at the exchange, and also operated a gold trading business under the name Xinchengchang Gold Shop. Due to recent business losses, it suddenly declared bankruptcy yesterday. The individuals responsible for the firm are Wu Zi'e and Wei Guanwei, according to reports.

After the market opened, brokers No. 160, 78, 83, and 218 were all sellers, and spot Yong Yarn retreated to 589 yuan. Forward delivery was seen as low as 620 yuan. Later, brokers No. 198, 180, 14, 145, and 124 entered the market as buyers, and brokers No. 89 and 229 appeared with forward delivery orders, gradually driving prices up. Brokers No. 212, 75, 137, 47, 4, and 197 also bought. After 10:30 a.m., sentiment improved as financial institutions, in addition to unwinding their arbitrage positions, also increased their buying. Off-exchange market prices were quoted higher, with spot Yong Yarn rising to 636 yuan, and forward delivery reaching a high of 663 yuan. Later, brokers No. 198, 218, 151, 70, and 91 sold slightly, causing a gradual decline. Although there were fluctuations mid-session, rumors of instability in a certain small-cap stock, coupled with Rongfeng falling to its limit down from broker No. 151, caused the decline to accelerate near noon, showing signs of exhaustion. The market slightly consolidated at the noon close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn, Meyer, and Wah Fung rose slightly, while Xinhe and Xinguang declined slightly. Jingfu fell more than half a percent, and Qinxing fell more than one percent. There was very little trading in inactive stocks. Yingfeng, a cold stock, fell by half a percent, and matches rose by one percent. The rest saw almost no trading. Forward delivery Yong Yarn and Xinhe rose slightly, Meyer and Wah Fung remained unchanged, while Xinguang declined slightly. Off-exchange, the prices of various stocks were flat.

Foreign stocks remained relatively stable yesterday. Although Yi Yarn failed to firmly hold above 7,000 yuan, other stocks saw mixed gains and losses. As a result, compared to the previous close, Wheelock Marden, Ewo Brewery, and Steel rose slightly, while Yi Yarn, British American Tobacco, Shipping, and Paper declined slightly. Yeguang was the only one that remained flat.

### A Large Number of American Goods are on their Way

### About Fifty to Sixty Ships are En Route; If They Cannot be Imported into Shanghai and Taiwan, They Will be Diverted to Hong Kong

[Special Dispatch] According to reliable sources: since the settlement of the West Coast maritime strike in the United States, about sixty American merchant ships are heading for China, and only about one tenth to one-fifth of them have arrived. The goods on board include post-war relief supplies, cotton, machinery, and daily necessities. However, this situation cannot be interpreted as the United States attempting to dump excess production onto our country. In fact, the domestic fabric market in the United States today has a large demand, and exports account for a very small proportion of its total production. Taking dyes as an example, because the supply cannot meet the demand, there is also a black market in the United States. Smaller Chinese import and export companies in the United States are willing to pay high prices to procure supplies by any means. The amount they purchase is larger than that of larger import and export companies. As for machinery, domestic demand is also high, and most of what can be purchased in the United States today is second-hand goods; if you want to place an order, the delivery period may be one or two years later. Although there is paper being exported, domestic demand is also strong. In order to promote their business with China, many large American companies are inviting managers of large-scale Chinese import and export companies to handle their transactions in China. Since the implementation of the import permit system, the actions of general importers are under detailed study. A reporter asked a leading figure in the import and export industry: If the goods on the sixty merchant ships coming to China cannot obtain import permits, what will be done? The answer was: generally, they will be imported into Hong Kong and then imported into our country's market when the opportunity arises.

### Special Committee for Silk Export Progressing Smoothly

According to related sources, the authorities are concerned about the decline of the local silk weaving industry.

At the same time, the industry is also preparing to organize a silk weaving production and sales company with a registered capital of 500 million National Currency, which will be funded by outstanding manufacturers in the industry. The funds have already been fully subscribed. The matter is currently under discussion with relevant parties, but the matter is of great importance and must be planned comprehensively and approved by the authorities before it can be implemented. It is reported that after several consultations, opinions are quite close, and it is expected that it can be realized around February next year.

### Cheeloo University Restoration Ceremony - Grand Restoration Celebration

[Special Dispatch from Jinan by Our Newspaper] Jinan's premier private institution, Cheeloo University, solemnly held its Restoration Commemoration Ceremony during this year's Restoration Festival, which is Christmas Day, in the university's auditorium. Provincial leaders, including Chairman Wang Yaowu, and approximately 500 faculty, students, and distinguished guests gathered, making it the largest gathering in Shandong's cultural circles since the victory. The ceremony began with a report from President Wu Keming.

Cheeloo University's History Briefly stated: Our school was founded 47 years before the founding of the Republic of China, making it 82 years old. It was initially established as the Literary Institute in Dengzhou by Dr. Divie Bethune McCartee of the American Presbyterian Church. It later merged with the Guangde Academy University Department of the Qingzhou Baptist Church, renamed Guangwen Academy, and moved to Weixian. Subsequently, the Medical Institute established in Jinan by Dr. Hunter Corbett of the American Presbyterian Church and the National Academy established in Qingdao by the English Baptist Missionary Society merged in Jinan as the Republican Medical and Theological Academy. In 1917, the aforementioned schools formally merged in Jinan and were renamed Cheeloo University. In 1923, the Peking Women's Medical School also merged with Cheeloo University's medical department, becoming a co-educational institution. In 1929, the theology department separated, and three colleges of liberal arts, science, and medicine were established. On December 17, 1931, the Ministry of Education approved its registration.

During the War of Resistance After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, our school was ordered to relocate westward. In the autumn of 1938, it cooperated with West China Union University in Chengdu, and our school resumed operations in Rongcheng. Through great efforts, not only were the original departments and the National Studies Research Department restored, but also, to adapt to objective needs, a manufacturing department and a parasitology department in the medical research institute were established. Faculty and staff in Jinan also traveled inland by various routes, and the foundation gradually solidified. After the Pearl Harbor Incident in 1941, the short-term vocational school originally established in Jinan by British and American faculty and staff announced its closure, and they also came west, further strengthening and solidifying our school's lineup.

After Victory Our school strived to resume operations, and this spring, Provost Sun was dispatched to Jinan to oversee the work. With the assistance of Chairman Wang Yaowu and others, the university has gradually regained its former appearance. In terms of school buildings, after Jinan fell, the enemy occupied the school and used it as a military hospital. Therefore, the exterior of the school buildings is largely intact. After half a year of repairs, urgent needs have been preliminarily met. In terms of books, after the enemy occupied the area, they initially planned to burn them, but after negotiations, they were sent to Guangzhi Academy for safekeeping. Fortunately, most of them have been preserved, including the rare and well-preserved "Quanyuan" national masterpiece. In terms of equipment, the losses were greater. For example, our school originally had 200 microscopes, but now only 20 remain. Based on the current number of students, they are barely sufficient. In terms of students, all freshmen in each department are recruited in Jinan and officially began classes on October 1st. Students in the sophomore year and above will temporarily remain in Rongcheng to study at West China Union University, and some faculty members will also remain in Rongcheng to teach. They will return to Jinan to resume operations after transportation is restored. There are currently 21 faculty and staff members and 267 students at the Rongcheng campus. At the Jinan campus, there are a total of 215 freshmen in the three colleges of liberal arts, science, and medicine, 50 in the preparatory class, and approximately 300 students in the sophomore to senior years, with each class ranging from two to 26 students.

Future Plans Provost Sun Ensan reported on future plans: (1) The Medical College is recruiting well-known scholars from China and abroad to teach and has obtained all the equipment for an affiliated hospital with 150 beds, which will be completed in order as transportation is restored. (2) Starting next year, the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences will be merged into the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and the original departments will be adjusted. The radio technology specialty will also be restored. (3) An agricultural and engineering college will be established to assist Shandong's industrialization.

Education First Chairman Wang delivered a speech, stating that Cheeloo University's restoration was earlier than other universities, which is an honor for Cheeloo University and also an honor for Shandong. He continued: The strength or weakness of a nation depends on the development of education. During this period of national construction, education is paramount, and we should pay special attention to educational development. After Chairman Wang's speech, Director of Education Li Taihua delivered a speech, followed by a speech from a representative of the alumni. After President Wu's thank-you speech, the ceremony concluded in the midst of heavy snowfall and the solemn university anthem. (Special Correspondent Fan Shizhi from Jinan)

A Warm Current in the Cold

### Hangzhou Art and Culture Dynamics

— Dispatch from Hangzhou, 26th, by our special correspondent Chu Yusheng

Hangzhou thrives in the spring and autumn seasons, and West Lake enjoys its golden age during these times. People from all directions come to Hangzhou in cars, bringing funds to beautify West Lake.

Although Hangzhou is very hot in the summer, many people gather on the lakeside to cool off when night falls. Only winter is West Lake's most deserted season. A few people huddle and hurry past the lake, and loneliness and boredom represent the entire West Lake. Although Zhejiang has not experienced war this year, everyone's heart is heavy, and the entire industry and commerce of Hangzhou are sluggish. Intellectuals such as public educators and university students are living through difficult times, with thin clothing and bedding, wondering how to spend this long winter night.

First-Time Literary Evening

Materially impoverished, and with a general decline in art and culture across the country, Hangzhou is also anemic in spirit. I once wrote an article titled "Hangzhou Entertainment Desert" to fully explain the lack of proper entertainment. Fortunately, my efforts were not in vain. The Weekly Ball Club has been established, and several cinemas, which were screening films faded by the times, have switched to showing the latest domestic films. The puppet shows on Yingzi Road have disappeared, and the municipal authorities are paying attention to entertainment containing harmful elements. However, these spiritual foods have not been cooked and cannot stir up Hangzhou's passion, so the heart is still heavy, and a chill is felt when the cold wind blows. Many young friends, after holding the first literary evening, mustered their courage again and organized the second literary evening. As they said, "We want to throw a small stone on this still lake surface to create a small ripple, and in this freezing weather, create a trace of warmth to melt this cold atmosphere." This time, it was truly lively. The auditorium on the fourth floor of the Youth Association was packed with people. Roughly estimated, there were more than 700 vibrant hearts, including professors and students from Zhejiang University, National Chekiang University, and the National Academy of Art, as well as journalists and civil servants. Old playwright Xiong Foxi specially came from Shanghai to participate. Filmmakers Tao Xiong and Huan Yang Feiying happened to be in Hangzhou and also attended on time. Bursts of light and warm applause, bursts of happy laughter, and bursts of sympathetic sighs made everyone feel excited and enthusiastic. Everyone felt warm. Yes, spiritual warmth is better than material warmth, and the thirst for spiritual food is better than the thirst for material food. You only need to see that this literary evening lasted for four and a half hours, but no one left early. Some were even standing without seats. This shows the hunger and thirst for spiritual sustenance felt by Hangzhou's intellectuals.

It can be said that the literary evening has ignited a warm fire in Hangzhou, allowing Hangzhou to gain spiritual warmth.

Soochow University Anniversary Celebration

Soochow University also appropriately held its centennial anniversary celebration. President Li Peien said, "I hope students will not seek official positions or wealth." University education is inherently about research education, and they should value truth and promote academics. This truth and academics are the source of human spiritual warmth. This year's Soochow University centennial anniversary included an exhibition, sports competitions, plays, and concerts. They should have several outstanding academics appear on the mountain peak of scenic Qianjiang River in the future to warm the people near West Lake. At the same time, we urge Soochow University to immediately spread these artistic talents to society.

Song and Performance Break the Silence

At this time, the Zhejiang Provincial Drama and Song Troupe is also performing "The Teacher of All Ages" in the auditorium of Hangzhou Normal School on the banks of West Lake. They have undergone a considerable period of rehearsal, preparing to break the long-silent theater scene in Hangzhou. When the drama movement in the world's metropolis—Shanghai—is declining, Hangzhou, as a city, stubbornly attempts to perform plays. This not only provides the broad masses with spiritual food but also provides theater workers with unparalleled warmth.

Theater Troupe Restored - Theater Movement Unfolds

Will the drama movement in Hangzhou continue to unfold? The National Academy of Art Drama Troupe has been restored and has begun rehearsing its first play. The script has been selected as "Thunderstorm." At the same time, the Zhejiang University Foreign Languages Department Drama Class is preparing to form the Zhejiang University Drama Troupe to perform plays. These young people at Zhejiang University have demonstrated outstanding theatrical talent at the literary evening and will definitely be able to perform even more wonderfully in the future. Using these three strong theater groups to promote the drama movement in Hangzhou, as long as they have the belief of not fearing failure and not allowing discouragement, they will definitely be able to achieve something.

Our Newspaper Holds a Grand Exhibition

The Hangzhou office of our newspaper is also launching a relatively large-scale exhibition at the end of this winter, starting on New Year's Day in 1947. This exhibition has been approved by the main office, and the main office has mobilized manpower to actively prepare. Part of the content will be the literature of our newspaper over the years, and another part will be precious current affairs photos. A newspaper with a long history can reflect the needs and mission of the times. In its literature, one can see the progress of the times. Therefore, many people are wondering why this exhibition is not held in Shanghai or Nanjing first, but rather in Hangzhou first. Our answer is: "In the cold and desolate winter of Hangzhou, we are willing to throw a piece of firewood to warm her spirit!"

Woodcut and Calligraphy - Fu Will Exhibit

It is said that there will also be a woodcut exhibition and a calligraphy exhibition. A philatelic exhibition that is currently being held is at the private Circulation Library in Gulou. This exhibition is divided into two parts: philately and banknote collecting, with items from various countries and China, symbolizing the history of the Republic of China. The banknote collecting section collects various genuine and counterfeit banknotes from China, symbolizing the past chaotic society of the Republic of China gradually progressing to a unified national path. This exhibition is organized by the Circulation Library, and the director is Mr. Chen Duxing. He founded this library with his salary from the post office. Now, this old cultural warrior with a full head of white hair has also stepped forward and is enthusiastically active.

The above are all the art and cultural activities in Hangzhou this winter. These activities may be like ripples in a still lake, like sparks in the darkness, or like warm currents in the frozen earth. In short, the winter in Hangzhou does not feel too desolate or too cold. This slight warmth makes those who feel spiritually impoverished reveal a knowing smile.

### Early Cold in the South

— Guangzhou, 16th Dispatch, our special correspondent Liang Feng

When snow is falling in various parts of Jiangnan, the sun is still shining everywhere here, and it is as warm as spring, without any hint of cold. However, in the past week, the weather has suddenly changed, with strong northerly winds and drizzle. The thermometer has dropped to around 40 degrees Fahrenheit, which is not particularly severe. However, in this city known as the "Capital of Hot Air," there is no adequate cold protection equipment, so this cold wave has caused the entire market to become deserted. After nightfall, most citizens stay indoors, and stores close early. Although this is just the early cold in the south, it already feels like a harsh winter!

A Season for the Wealthy

Winter seems to be a season for the wealthy. With the arrival of winter, the newly purchased Haeberlein fur coats, worth over a million yuan, of the wives and young ladies have the opportunity to show off. And the American-style equipment of the gentlemen and masters, even if it is the leftover materials of Westerners, can certainly be used to boast to the shivering common people on the streets. High-end restaurants have long prepared expensive dishes such as "Chrysanthemum Five Snakes," "Cold Protection Sheng," and "Dragon, Tiger, and Phoenix Grand Gathering" for the noble people, which are perfect for gathering around a stove and drinking wine to ward off the cold. Therefore, with the arrival of winter, all major restaurants are making profits a hundred times over. Although a "snake soup" banquet costs hundreds of thousands of yuan, what does that matter in the eyes of the gentlemen and masters? According to a survey by the Municipal Tax Bureau, the total amount spent each month in major restaurants exceeds 130 million yuan. This huge number cannot be said to be unsurprising! Furthermore, dance halls are also the best places for gentlemen and masters to enjoy themselves in winter. The melodious jazz music is enough to stir up the dancing spirit of gentlemen and ladies. Although Guangzhou's industry and commerce are depressed and the social economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, the dance halls are overcrowded and there is no shortage of consumers! Currently, there are more than ten larger dance halls here, and there are countless dance academies. It is said that several large-scale dance halls are being planned, with the budget to open around Christmas and the New Year!

A Tragic Corner

However, with the arrival of winter, there is another tragic side to society. Due to the sudden cold weather, most poor citizens are not prepared with warm clothing and are filled with worry, unable to find a solution. Even the small public servants, with the prices of all cold protection items being extremely high, can only hope for the unattainable, and they can only continue to wear thin clothing and run around the streets shivering. Especially the refugees who sleep on the streets, wrapped in their thin bodies with broken burlap sacks, do not dare to stick their heads out in the biting cold wind. Although there is no accurate statistics on these refugees, we can see them curled up everywhere in any prosperous area, at the bottom of those tall buildings. The state of hunger and cold, combined with misery, is truly indescribable. However, the people who enter and exit the tall buildings have become "accustomed to seeing" them, so it is as if they are "unnoticed"! According to statistics from the health authorities, there were as many as 61 bodies buried on Yanli Road in this week alone. So, how many are there that have not been buried? In short, in these few days, it is estimated that more than 15 refugees die from cold and starvation every day! Therefore, in these few days, thousands of returned overseas Chinese refugees have surrounded the Good Relief Sub-bureau, requesting the distribution of warm clothing, and dozens of refugees have forcibly robbed relief rice. All of this is enough to show the seriousness of the problem, because they have to struggle to prolong their remaining breath!

Winter Relief

It can be said that the authorities have long been concerned about this issue. The Winter Relief Association was officially established as early as the 3rd of this month (December). The plan seems to be quite thorough. The plan is to set up 23 cold shelter stations, each capable of accommodating 100 to 500 people. In addition, 5,000 cotton-padded clothes and 5,000 burlap clothes will be distributed, and five meal stations will be set up. In addition to this, there will be temporary relief for fire, disease, and small loans. The estimated total cost is 76 million yuan. However, judging from the past few days, the progress of the association's work has been too slow! The number of people freezing to death is increasing daily. The meal stations will not start until the 18th, the locations of the cold shelters have not been fully found, and the huge amount of funds still needs to be raised through various methods. It is only feared that after several meetings, a discussion will be held and then a resolution will be made. After the resolution is made, it will have to be implemented. By then, the poor and needy refugees who need relief will have already "solved the problem themselves"!

Market Fluctuations

As for industry and commerce, the biggest fluctuations in the past week should be in the financial market, which can be said to be changing rapidly and progressing amazingly. Within just one week, gold jumped from 340,000 to 425,000, Hong Kong dollars rose from 982 to 1360, and US dollars also jumped from 4700 to 6300. In this state of frenzy, I believe there are many people who are happy, and many people who are sad! Apart from this, all other industries and commerce are in a crisis of recession. Due to the flooding of the market with imported goods, and the low quality of domestic products, which are unable to compete with them, coupled with the increasing number of labor disputes and the rising wages, which cannot meet the fragile purchasing power of the general public, the market has become sluggish and production has been declining. It is estimated that since the restoration, 60% of Guangzhou's industries have been shut down. Therefore, with no way out for industrial and commercial capital, some speculative merchants have turned to high-interest lending. According to the current situation, lending out one million yuan can generate a profit of one million yuan after three months. With such a short period of time and such a large profit, who would still invest in legitimate industries and commerce? Therefore, the so-called "underground banks" of Qiu are very active. Many manufacturers, feeling pinched at the end of the year and short of funds, are struggling to cope, while the speculators who specialize in high-interest loans often take advantage of their plight. Once there is a problem with cash flow, they have no choice but to go bankrupt. Bankruptcies due to the influence of high-interest loans have been heard of daily in the past week, and the situation is likely to be even more dire as the Lunar New Year approaches!

Enforce Winter Defense

Speaking of public security, it is originally most serious during this winter defense period. However, under the stringent winter defense measures enforced by the military and police authorities, including nightly door-to-door household checks and increased patrols by the military and police, the public security in the market can be considered barely satisfactory. Although the Municipal Police Bureau handled more than 200 robbery cases in November, it is obviously much more peaceful here compared to the terrorist situation in Hong Kong, where bombing incidents occur everywhere! However, there are a few things here that make some citizens panic all day long. The first is the problem of cracking down on street vendors. In order to implement the plan to rectify the city appearance, the municipal authorities have implemented strict crackdowns on street vendors. Although the authorities have designated locations for them to set up stalls, according to statistics, there are nearly 200,000 street vendors in the city, and the designated markets are limited, inevitably leading to a "more monks than gruel" phenomenon. As such, a number of street vendors will experience a panic in their lives!

Military Service Issues

Secondly, everyone does not know that military service is a glorious obligation. As a result, when the conscription news is announced, young men of military age are all restless on their beds, and some young men are preparing to flee to Hong Kong to avoid conscription in case they are selected. The Provincial Commercial Advancement Association is further arguing that the foundation of industry and commerce has not been stabilized since the restoration, and that the hasty conscription of military service is truly afraid that people will be panic-stricken and flee to one another, affecting the prosperity of the market, and requesting a one-year postponement from the authorities. At the same time, the city's conscription quota is 1,200 people, and more than 500 people have already entered the camp, with more than 600 people still owed. The association is willing to encourage voluntary young men to enter the camp to make up the conscription quota, so that there will be no need to draw lots for conscription. However, the authorities believe that it does not conform to the purpose of the military service law that everyone has the obligation to perform military service, and it is not convenient to make a decision. Therefore, the association has been discussing and petitioning for several days, and there is still no result. Finally, there is the issue of allocating 1.2 billion yuan in police fees for donations to all stores in the city. This was originally passed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and is intended to raise this amount within six months. It will be used to assist the government in reforming the police administration, consolidating public security, and enabling all merchants and civilians in the city to live and work in peace. The legal basis is good. However, in this depressed industrial and commercial environment, each store is already struggling to cope with this year's end, making them feel that they are willing but unable to afford this first month's amount of 200 million yuan. It may be even more difficult to raise funds in the future! Therefore, everyone hopes that the authorities can properly handle the above-mentioned issues to avoid arousing public resentment, otherwise it will be even more difficult to maintain the overall social order!

The Haizhu Bridge Under Repair

The bridge is being repaired by the Guangzhou Municipal Government with an allocation of 400 million yuan, and construction began on December 2nd, with completion scheduled within 60 days. Above: Distant View. Below: Close-up (Special Correspondent Liang Feng)

### New Mine Shaft in Huainan Under Construction

— Special Correspondent Kang Feng, Wuhu, 20th

The feudal nature of our Chinese society has always encouraged the construction of towers on the ground, as symbols of obedience to authority and superstition towards gods and ghosts. With the incessant construction of towers above ground, stonemasons and tile workers rarely have the opportunity to build towers underground.

In the Huainan mining area, a new No. 3 shaft under construction evoked the above feelings. Watching the winch at the shaft mouth lower a platform laden with stones into the shaft, and then hoist out the excavated rubble and mud, I couldn't help but think of a tower construction project.

This No. 3 shaft, with a diameter of five meters, requires a retaining wall of stones to be built two hundred meters deep, and then cemented on the outside of the stone wall. To open such a mine shaft, it requires the excavation of a column of earth and waste rock five meters in diameter and two hundred meters high, like the body of a tower. Time, transportation labor, wall-building labor, as well as stones and cement are necessary conditions. Six months is not too short. After two hundred days, this tower can unearth the bounty beneath the earth. The company plans to produce seven hundred tons of coal per day from this new No. 3 shaft. At that time, the contribution of this new underground tower in Huainan will be far greater than building a tower above ground with the same stones!

Guangzhou's Six Banyan Pagoda (Special Correspondent Liang Feng)

That night, as I rode an empty coal car into the mining area to transport coal, the red light from the coking furnaces in the East Mine, burning in the open air, painted an orange-colored picture of labor in this desolate mining area. Also, because the coke production of the Zhongxing Coal Mine in Zaozhuang, Shandong, had ceased, the foundries of Beijing and Shanghai reached out to Huainan for assistance. Currently, only the coal from the East Mine in Huainan can be used for coking. Eighteen coke ovens, large and small, were in the open field, some just having finished refining the coke, others glowing red, burning coal into coke. Three tons of coal are refined into one ton of coke, which sells for 500,000 yuan. Only 300 tons are produced per month. However, this labor in the Huainan mine is to alleviate the failure of the Zhongxing Coal Mine. Huainan does not seem very interested in coking, because the coal quality is not very suitable for coking.

Impressions of Miners' Lives

In addition to seeing the miners' working conditions in the mining area, I also visited the miners' living quarters separately. The quarters I visited were located closest to the employee residences. Engineer Zhang Youxian said that it was the most miserable area among the three thousand housing units, so that a news reporter could come into contact with the most painful group to understand the failing parts of this giant system.

I went at 3:30 in the afternoon. The midday shift had gone to work, those working the late-night shift were sleeping, and the early-night shift workers were eating. The group of workers I saw included coal miners, cart pushers, and underground carpenters. Their faces were yellow, but their bodies were still strong. They were all from northern Anhui. They ate a kind of hard, cold rice crust, with a bowl of bean sprouts and pickles. A dozen shrimp were placed like treasures at the bottom of another bowl. They squatted on the ground to eat, the ground being their dining table. One could see at a glance that they could not talk about nutrition, it was not easy just to eat enough to fill their stomachs.

Their clothes were old cotton short jackets. A two-zhang (about 6.6 meters) square room, half of which was a foot high platform, was covered with straw and a dirty, thin cotton quilt. From this sleeping place, you couldn't imagine whether sweet sleep would visit their tired bodies. Naturally, Snow White would not enter the living quarters of these more than seven miners, old and young, to clean and scrub their desolate and impoverished abode.

The miners' entire situation was laid bare before my eyes. There were no suitcases, drawers, wardrobes, or safes to keep their material possessions a secret, and their spiritual warehouse was also wide open. You hear:

"I am a heavy laborer (i.e., coal miner, carpenter installing tunnel supports, etc.), and my daily wage is 2,500 yuan."

"I am a light laborer (i.e., digging coal, dragging coal baskets in the mine), and my daily wage is 1,600 yuan."

"Before, the company distributed coal, one basket per person per month, which was enough for cooking. Now, 8,500 yuan per basket will be deducted from the wages."

"Seventy thousand yuan a month, and nothing is left after eating!"

These were a few miners without wives. Afterward, I went to a living quarter being built with reed stalks. The women said, "We are here to escape the Huai River flood. The houses at home were flooded, and not a grain was harvested in the fields, so we fled here to work first."

This piece of land is the living quarters area. The reed stalks for building houses were supplied by the contractor. The contractor recruited them to work, and first had to solve their housing problem. These newly arrived disaster-stricken miners did have some property, with each family having two or three redwood chests.

The total number of miners here is 10,000, mostly from Shandong. The reason is that the contractors from the Zhongxing Coal Mine in Zaozhuang, Shandong, could not stand their ground because Zaozhuang had been in the hands of the Communist army for a year, so they all came to Huainan to contract mining and coal digging work. The Zaozhuang miners also followed them south. The next largest group was from Henan Province, followed by disaster victims from the flood-stricken areas along the Huai River in northern Anhui and the Yellow River flood area. There are very few locals from Huaiyuan County, where the mining area is located. Locals mostly do farming work, and if they are so poor that they have nothing, they become bandits. No one is willing to go down into the mine to be a miner, which is both bitter and poor!

Of course, because the mining area's equipment is modernized, the living quarters have electric lights and running water taps, which is not enjoyed in the countryside of Anhui and widespread China. But the yellow light of a five-candlepower light bulb illuminates the dim scene of the living quarters, making it even more desolate. The clean tap water cannot wash away the coal dust that miners get on their hands and bodies every day they go down the mine.

Of course, I asked the person in charge of the mine about my observations. Engineer Zhang Youxian, who is an expert in the mine's technology, said that the wage difference between the miners' actual wages and the wages issued by the company (for example, the company gives a wage of more than 3,000 yuan per worker, and the workers receive more than 2,000 yuan from the contractor) is related to the existence of some contractors in the mine. Now the company is turning large contractors (each contractor has about 100 workers) into small contractors, and at the same time, encouraging workers to form their own labor cooperative teams to manage the underground mining work themselves to establish a direct relationship with the company, so as to avoid the expense of the middle layers. Engineer Zhang Youxian has additional information about the portion of workers' actual wages, which is that each person receives 2.5 jin (1.25 kg) of flour per day, and 8,500 yuan per month for coal fees to buy a basket of coal at 8,500 yuan per basket stipulated by the mine for cooking and boiling water.

The Organization Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs sent a Duan to guide the organization of the trade union. The mine is naturally willing to have experts from the government's special labor administration department contribute to the welfare of the miners, so representatives of miners from various mines and departments are being put forward to prepare for the establishment of a trade union.

In my opinion, the mine owners in Huainan are not private capitalists, but a group of technical experts and veterans from the old mining era, and they are also striving to support these hardworking people in their relationship with the miners. For example, Tianjia'an is building a flour mill, which, when completed, can produce 24,000 bags of flour per month at a low price to supply the needs of miners and road workers. There is no shortage of dilapidated housing units among the 3,000 housing units, and more than 1 billion yuan is being used to build new housing units to supply the miners who currently live in dilapidated houses. Although these technicians are not very specialized in labor-capital relations, they are all righteous people with abundant feelings, and human sympathy will burn them at any time to implement this coal kingdom's policy to benefit the miners!

### The Future of Huainan Coal

Huainan coal has provided 40,000 tons of coal per month during this year, filling a need that the coal from Shandong and the Kailuan coal mines in Tangshan could not supply for the industries, electricity, and transportation of Beijing and Shanghai. In this year's support role, it has contributed more than any other aspect. However, people in the Huainan coal mine dare not reveal this achievement, and quietly survive and develop on the banks of the Huai River. The reporter learned that coal production has reached 54,000 tons per month, and the production line is still rising as high as prices.

According to Japanese estimates, Huainan Mine's reserves are 50 million tons. Datong Mine has been mined for 30 years, and Huainan Coal Mine has been mined for 16 years. It is estimated that more than 10 million tons of coal have been mined. The remaining 40 million tons of coal reserves, if 3 million tons are mined per year, the coal seam in this mine will be exhausted in 13 years. Of course, the current output is only 600,000 tons per year, so there can be five times as long a time left in the mine's unfinished history.

In order to extend the life of the mine, Xie Jiarong, Director of the Exploration Department of the Resources Commission, and Chai Dengbang of the Huainan Mining Bureau, have discovered new coal seams in Xinzhuangzi, Fengtai County, 20 kilometers from Jiulonggang, on the northern curve of the Huainan Basin. Regarding this point, details will be reported in another article.

How the social history of Huainan Mine will develop must naturally be sought in the progress of the entire Chinese society. Although it is surrounded by the ancient yellow Huai River, just as the backwardness and feudal nature of the Anhui countryside are very strong, the new atmosphere of industry must be rendered by these technically trained cadres with modern education in the still very bleak mining area!

### On the Eve of Establishing a City: Bengbu Municipal Administration

— Special Correspondent Kang Feng, Bengbu, 25th

On the eve of the establishment of the Bengbu Municipal Government at the midpoint of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, how is the situation in this most populous city in Anhui, and it has attracted much attention from all parties. A brief description is provided below:

Bengbu developed at a bend in the lower reaches of the large Huai River in northern Anhui. After the Tianjin-Pukou Railway passed through and a station was established here, the export of millions of piculs of miscellaneous grains and the annual import of four million piculs of edible salt in the Huai River basin must be resolved through Bengbu as a hub. This small market has developed into a commercial center where 260,000 people live today after decades of development. Due to the convenient transportation, low wages, and proximity to industrial raw material production areas, this commercial area has also planted tall chimneys in the last twenty years, with forty cigarette factories, two large-scale flour mills, and a large vegetable oil factory building production machinery on the banks of the Huai River.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Anhui Provincial Government established a municipal preparatory office here, which initially only had jurisdiction over the Municipal Police Bureau. In April of the 35th year, the Bureau of Public Works was established. When Zhang Xuexin, Director of the Bureau of Public Works, started municipal public works in the urban area, no funds were available at all. He jokingly called himself like a street sweeper, only having to work, but not enough cleaning tools to use.

Eight Years of Disaster

Bengbu left behind by the Japanese had blocked sewers, broken roads, and garbage like small mountains, perched in various parts of the city and emitting foul odors. Electric lights were dim like ghostly fire. Director Zhang Xuexin had so much hard work waiting for him, and he was a young man doing business for the first time, so he constantly used some hard methods to rectify them one by one.

His method was that the disaster victims who escaped from the Communist Area in northeastern Anhui had labor, and the Anhui Relief Branch had relief flour. He acted as an intermediary to combine labor and flour to form the power to clean up Bengbu's municipal administration. In the past six months, the sewers have been dredged section by section, and 2,000 tons of soil have been removed to fill the low-lying areas in the suburbs of the city. The sewers were clear, the streets were repaired, and the garbage was also taken out to fill the low-lying areas. In addition, south of Bengshan Park, the small road connecting the railway station and the Huaihe Wharf was expanded into a straight trunk road. This road was named Zhongzheng Road to celebrate Chairman Chiang's 60th birthday. If you know the effectiveness of this railway station and Huaihe Wharf in Bengbu, you will of course also know the role of this straight Zhongzheng Road in the suburban traffic of Bengbu in the future. Zhang Xuexin hoped that this road would become Bengbu's "Nanjing Road" in the future. (Shanghai's most prosperous street.)

Bengbu's Electric Lights

Before the war, there were seven kilowatt generators, but the Japanese took them away. Now there is only one 250-kilowatt generator left, but Bengbu's public and commercial electricity consumption reaches 30,000 degrees per month, exceeding the load, and the lights are as dim as ghostly fire. Now, the Anhui Relief Branch has applied to UNRRA to purchase a 500-kilowatt generator, which costs 250 million yuan, payable in eight months. This generator is being installed and can be turned on by the end of the year, and Bengbu's electric lights and power supply can be resolved.

During the summer when the Huai River floods, the water level exceeded the water level of the 20th year of the Republic of China by two centimeters. Thanks to the pre-cultivation of 20,000 units of labor on the Huaihe Dike in the spring, the dike did not break, and the city area was also fortunate to avoid flooding. Bengbu was originally a three-no-man's-land at the intersection of Fengyang, Lingbi, and Huaiyuan counties.

Establishment of Municipal Government

After the establishment of the municipal government, it can govern an area of ​​416 square kilometers. In the future, Bengbu's municipal construction, such as building the Huaihe Wharf, opening a water plant, establishing a modern transportation road system, and expanding the power supply, cannot be accomplished by the poor methods of the past six months. During the municipal office era, raising the salaries of 800 policemen in the Municipal Police Bureau every month was enough to make people feel anxious and exhausted. The Bengbu Municipal Government will be established on New Year's Day of the 36th year, but how to raise funds for a municipal construction and the expenses of expanding the staffing of the office? It is inevitable that it will fall on the 260,000 citizens again. Bengbu is a commercial area, and the 260,000 people will naturally transfer these municipal expenses to the import and export goods and hand them over to consumers in a wider area to divide the tax. After the establishment of the Bengbu Municipal Government, what the reporter hopes is that the tax revenues drawn from the people will not be wasted. Doing one thing will benefit Bengbu's industry, commerce, and residents.

### The United Nations Scientific and Cultural Organization is Preparing to Carry out the Grand Strategy of Datong

— Special Correspondent Hong Fu, Paris, 5th (Airmail)

The progress of world affairs invariably moves from simple to complex. Twenty-five years ago, when the League of Nations was convened, hastily stepping into the meeting place and catching a glimpse of the errors in the documents was already troublesome enough. At that time, those who attended the grand meeting for the first time were like Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden, dazzled and at a loss. Who would have expected that the international organizations twenty-five years later would be larger in scale and more numerous in name? If one does not catch up with the new trend head-on, one will inevitably feel regretful for being unable to keep up. Silently observing the differences between the two international organizations twenty-five years apart, the so-called "League of Nations" at that time, after the general assembly, divided its work into six sections: (1) Law, (2) Specialized, (3) Suppression of Armaments, (4) League of Nations Budget, (5) Women's Issues and Narcotics, and (6) Politics. Except for the second specialized section, most of it was political debate. Upon closer examination, it was dry and uninteresting. The lack of specialized facilities at that time was undeniable. Now, there is both a Security Council and councils for the guardianship of weak and small nations to replace the disarmament and political sections. It is also known that specialized endeavors that will benefit the welfare and future of the masses should be strengthened. The simultaneous undertaking of eleven specialized areas, especially the "United Nations Scientific and Cultural Organization," is a new initiative that the League of Nations did not have in the past. It is believed that the attainment and permanent maintenance of future world peace must have two complementary and mutually reinforcing key policies that advance together. The first key policy is that whenever a war hazard occurs, smaller ones must be resolved through the judgment of the International Court of Justice to eliminate disputes between countries, and larger ones must convene a United Nations General Assembly to mobilize the capabilities of the entire world to respond as appropriate and jointly impose sanctions. As for the second key policy, it is to make far-sighted arrangements for the happiness of the world's population in advance, so that countries respect each other and understand each other. This is the foundation of world peace, which should be cultivated in peacetime. Comparatively speaking, what was relied upon to maintain peace after 1919 only focused on the first of the above two items. The business was all political talk, and everything was too simple. Recently, after 1945, the quest to maintain peace has also focused on the second of the above two items (this newspaper's bird's-eye view of the United Nations organization). Therefore, the Scientific and Cultural Organization should be the main tool of the peace plan. The grand strategy of Datong that this bureau is preparing to carry out is divided into two major outlines: "Temporary" and "Permanent." Those with temporary characteristics are the cultural and educational revival of the occupied areas of World War II, which has already been put into practice. The permanent goals that should exist should be divided into several groups. There are many wonderful new ideas and innovative news that can provide intellectuals with unexpected benefits and conveniences.

### Teaching Children to Gamble?

— Feng

I often find children standing by the mahjong table watching and commenting when their parents are playing cards, as if they are enjoying it. Strangely, the parents do not forbid them. Sometimes, I even see mothers asking their sons to play on their behalf and proudly praising their children's intelligence and shrewdness. This seems like a small thing, but it actually has serious implications for the children's future behavior and prospects.

Everyone knows that gambling is a bad habit, and no parents want their children to learn to gamble; but in fact, due to parental negligence, they are teaching their children. Children have a strong imitative nature and a good memory. Seeing their parents play cards naturally arouses a sense of curiosity, so they stand aside and learn silently. After a few times, perhaps before their parents even realize it, they have learned almost everything in their little minds. By then, even if you forbid it, it will be of no avail!

For parents who do not want their children to learn to gamble, I hope you can buy more educational books and toys for your children to prevent them from getting bored and watching cards; at the same time, when you are playing cards or gambling, you should forbid your children from watching and learning. As for children who have already learned, it is best to tell them the harms of gambling and absolutely not allow them to have any gambling behavior! The good or bad of children depends entirely on the education they receive in their youth. I hope every wise parent will pay attention.

### American Housewives

— Bi Lang

Life is Very Different Before and After Marriage

In the United States, we can certainly only dream of the luxurious and comfortable life of a very small number of wealthy women. However, most middle-class housewives, like our Chinese housewives, feel economically strained, but their women are more capable and have more skills, and they handle all family matters much better than we do.

American middle-class women, before marriage, are indeed like what we see in their movies, read in books, and hear from gilded doctoral scholars: they are extremely comfortable and behave loosely, but after marriage, they have to take on the entire responsibility of the family's accounting, operation, and future child rearing. They never hire people to replace themselves. Their actions are very quick, and their work is exceptionally organized, step by step, without stopping or slacking. Every morning, they have to get up to prepare breakfast, and after their husbands leave for work, they clean the house and wash clothes. If there are young children (infants under two years old), around ten o'clock, they push the strollers to the park to play, while knitting wool yarn. After lunch, they have to take care of all the chores and then push the strollers out to play again. Because in the United States, except for some aristocratic classes who can live in high-rise buildings, middle-class people rarely have good, comfortable homes, so they have to take their children out to get some fresh air.

They also have a special talent for taking care of children. They never carry the child in their arms when working, but always let him lie in the cradle. And these children rarely cry, especially at night, they always sleep very quietly.

Most American housewives behave very steadily. Because they rely on their husbands to maintain their finances, their greatest task is to make their husbands happy and make the family comfortable and harmonious. This is very different from our so-called "new women" in China who only know how to spend money and do not know how to manage a household! Moreover, they are also very understanding of their husbands' difficulties. Sometimes, in times of family economic panic, they will also shoulder the burden and go out to find work, and they will never complain. In the United States, there is simply no such thing as couples being estranged, scolding each other, or fighting.

### My Ideal Wife

— Gang

The course of life is like a long journey, and on this long journey, everyone hopes to have a lifelong companion. Therefore, I also hope to find an ideal wife.

An ideal wife should have a healthy body, progressive thoughts, moderate education, a happy mind, a gentle personality, and the virtue of diligence and thrift. These advantages are absolutely necessary, because they are enough to help the husband obtain comfort in spirit and achieve success in his career, and it is also necessary to create a sweet and happy family.

I do not ask her to have a beautiful face, because I know that beauty is not a condition for maintaining love between husband and wife. But many people misunderstand it, thinking that choosing a wife must first choose a beautiful one, while neglecting the beauty of character. The ancients said, "Beautiful women have bad fate since ancient times," which shows that an ideal lifelong companion does not have to rely on a beautiful face. The conditions that can maintain the relationship between husband and wife permanently are the four words "respect, love, sincerity, and kindness." If they are missing, it is difficult to get the joy of family happiness. She should understand that a lifelong companion is the friend who spends the longest time together in the process of life. Both parties must reach the point of respecting and loving each other and confiding in each other. Only by always comforting and understanding each other can they get through a life of unpredictable prosperity and decline. If the two hearts between husband and wife cannot be connected, they will complain and be angry in times of frustration, without comforting and encouraging each other; they will indulge in enjoyment in times of success, without awareness and vigilance. Then, sooner or later, a beautiful family and the feelings of the couple will be shattered.

Her family does not have to be rich. The most appropriate is a woman with professional experience, because she not only has the experience of being independent, but also has some understanding of everything in society. She is naturally better at dealing with social interactions, which is of great benefit to me. She knows that diligence and thrift are virtues, not a sign of being stingy. She should fulfill her responsibilities in dealing with social interactions, and she should not have a shy and fearful heart. She should manage household affairs in an orderly manner and educate her children with earnestness and patience. With such a wife, wouldn't it be possible to create a happy, beautiful, sweet, and happy family?

I am looking for such a lifelong companion in the vast sea of ​​people, and I hope that there will be a day when it will come true.

### Common Sense of Housekeeping

— Shun Ding

Silverware, such as silver spoons and silver cups, can be kept shiny and new if they are placed in borax water for four or five hours from time to time.

If you want to prevent woolen fabrics from shrinking, you can put them in boiling water for the first time before washing them. After the water cools, take them out and dry them in the sun, and they will never shrink.

When people are working, the local clothes are bound to be oily due to rubbing and rubbing, which is not elegant, especially for worsted fabrics. You can mix ammonia and boiling water in half each, and wipe it with a sponge or an old toothbrush. After letting it dry naturally, brush it with a board brush, and the oily light can be removed as new.

If you want leather shoes not to leak, you must soak them in sesame oil and take them out after one day and one night.

### Canned Food

— Gu Tonggao

——Will it spoil if left in an opened can?——

Many people believe that food left in an opened can will quickly become toxic. However, for some inexplicable reason, this notion doesn't apply to canned milk; we have a long-standing habit of opening a hole in a can of milk and using it until the can is completely empty.

However, when it comes to other foods besides milk, it is generally believed that they will become toxic if left in an opened can. Therefore, people often transfer the food to another container, which is often made of the same metal as the original can and has not been sterilized, yet it is used without any doubt.

Indeed, there are some foods that should be emptied into another container, but not because there is a risk of harming health. Some dark-colored fruits will fade if left in the original tin can. Also, some acidic foods will undergo a corrosive action when exposed to oxygen. After a few days, they will corrode the container, and the food will develop an astringent taste because it has absorbed a small amount of iron.

The fact is that a can is still the best container for most canned foods when unopened. Unless there is a reason to the contrary, at least the can is sterilized. A basin or plate is very likely to carry bacteria, and the food can be said to be the best environment for them to grow.

In any case, the most important point is that any opened canned food should be regarded as something that can easily spoil. The nature of the container is actually only a secondary issue. (Translated from Reader's Digest, October issue)

### Selective Hearing

— Cheng Zhi, translated from Reader's Digest

I know a lady who lives in a busy area of the city. One hot evening, she felt very tired, so she went to bed early. The ringing of the telephone could not wake her from her sweet dream. The fire trucks going back and forth nearby and the loud radio dance program from the next room did not move her at all; she slept soundly. Her younger sister even brought a group of classmates, and they opened the refrigerator, played musical instruments, and made a lot of noise, but still couldn't wake her. But a miracle happened. At that moment, a very slight sound came from the room behind her; calling out, "Mom!" She immediately jumped out of bed like a bullet shot from a gun and rushed to her three-year-old child's bedside.

### Beautifying the Home

— Mai Jixian

Matching Colors Should Be Sought

To furnish a modern and beautiful home, one should start with colors, as colors are most attractive. They can make you feel serene, cool, or bright and warm. Therefore, the color scheme of a room is an invisible element that regulates the atmosphere of a home. Color coordination is not a difficult task. As long as you understand a few basic principles, you will develop an interest in it. Recently, furniture companies have been constantly reforming the styles of furniture and paying more attention to color coordination. Carpet, wallpaper, and curtain companies are also actively moving towards beautiful patterns and coordinated colors.

Colors have varying degrees of depth, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The most important consideration is that they must be coordinated under the principle of not conflicting or hindering each other. If bright red or bright green is used in the interior, you will feel dazzling no matter what. However, if the same amount of white is mixed into bright red, it becomes a pleasing pink color. As for light colors, they are not very noticeable on their own, so other colors must be used to reflect their light. For example, light blue doesn't seem delicate on its own, but if placed next to light cream, it will complement each other. In any case, colors should be evenly distributed and naturally beautiful under the principle of not conflicting or hindering each other.

No matter how harmonious or artistic the colors are, the only condition is that they must be suitable for the season. For example, the light blue and cream colors mentioned above are most suitable for bedrooms and are suitable for spring, summer, and autumn. However, in winter, you will find them to be cold. Conversely, hanging bright red curtains in the bedroom in the summer will make you feel hot. Similarly, wearing a light-colored robe in winter, even if you feel warm yourself, others will shiver when they see it. From this, we can see that there is a great connection between climate and color, and the conclusion is that light colors are suitable for warm weather, and dark colors should be used in cold weather. In this freezing weather, if light-colored curtains are still hanging in the room, you should remove them and replace them with dark colors—such as dark blue or bright red—and I believe you will feel that the room is full of warmth. As for furniture, it can be divided into Chinese and Western styles, and the colors must be properly coordinated. For example, mahogany furniture should be paired with bright red silk chair cushions and table skirts to highlight its antique and distinguished nature. However, using bright red silk on sofas is simply unsightly and unappealing. Conversely, white cloth cushions placed on mahogany furniture will give a feeling of death and mourning. The same white cloth, when placed on Western-style furniture, makes us feel that it is pure and generous. In short, color coordination must be determined according to the climate, location, and style. If any of the above three are mistaken, even if money is spent, a comfortable and satisfactory result will not be obtained, but it will hinder the harmonious atmosphere of the family.

Spring and Autumn

### Soliciting Reader Feedback

Introduction

This publication posted a notice on the first of this month soliciting reader feedback. We have received a total of 840 reader letters. Originally scheduled to be published in the middle of the month, the process of sorting them took longer than expected, and due to limited space, we have selected nine letters for publication below, in the order they were received. A "Note from the Editor" is attached as a reply.

One

Even if your newspaper hadn't solicited criticism, I would have wanted to make a contribution to "Spring and Autumn." This is because your newspaper is one of the more readable newspapers in Shanghai among the reading public, and "Spring and Autumn" is indeed a literary supplement that is constantly improving and has some works worth preserving.

Based on the meaning of "Spring and Autumn blames the wise," I would like to first point out a few shortcomings: (1) It seems that too much space is occupied by content of the same nature within a single edition, and there seems to be a slight lack of variety in interests within consecutive days. (2) "Spring and Autumn" should discuss everything, but it seems that too little is discussed about China, and even less is discussed about foreign countries while also discussing China. (3) It is good that you pay attention to prose, but prose, in particular, must pay attention to content. I think that if you could synthesize the content of Chinese notes and anecdotes and write them in a light and lively style, it would be very suitable for a supplement.

Based on the above reasons, I suggest that you should have several suitable regular contributors who divide up two or three types of writing to be published daily or every other day, and use the remaining space to accommodate special, valuable occasional contributions. You should not tailor your editorial policy to the manuscripts you have on hand, but should solicit manuscripts targeting the hopes of various readers. This is the ideal for a further improved supplement. To realize this ideal, it would be even better if you could expand the space a bit. In my opinion, "Spring and Autumn" has a great hope of becoming a standard national daily newspaper supplement. It is worth doing so.

Let me reiterate to clarify that the discomfort that we readers feel is that we have just read an interesting piece of writing, but the next time we want to read it, it is gone. Readers' interests are certainly different, but they all want to read something with content. If it is something that everyone has in mind, they will certainly not be happy, and this is certain. Therefore, using this as a standard to select articles will surely meet the hopes of most readers.

In the past two months, Mr. Hong Weifa's "Yangzhou Continued Dreams" has been extremely lovely and will surely become an immortal work if it is published separately in the future. Also, the essays signed by Ge Xixi are extremely valuable in terms of both writing style and content and can become a system. These all seem to be things that should be published regularly in rotation.

"Spring and Autumn" is the literary supplement of Shen Bao and has a large number of readers. Its space is indeed valuable, and the editor's humble solicitation of reader feedback and his eagerness for innovation are especially admirable. Without considering my ignorance, I offer my humble opinion:

Literature and art are a reflection of real-world politics, economics, society, and all aspects of life. The development of literature and art should address the shortcomings of real life, so that it can be of benefit to the times and to life. The great works of great poets and great writers have always been products of their times. For example, reading the poems of poet Du Zimei about the chaos allows one to understand the state of displacement during the "An-Shi Rebellion." Bai Letian's ten "Qinzhong Yin" poems reveal the greed and darkness of powerful officials during the Zhenhe and Zhenyuan periods of the Tang Dynasty. The two chapters "Deng Le You Yuan" and "Su Zigecun" write about the despotism of those in power who held military authority at the time, revealing everything without reservation. Reading his poems is like experiencing the situation firsthand. Furthermore, Han Wengong, who "started the decline of the Eight Dynasties and rescued the drowning of the world," wrote "Yuan Dao," which completely rejected Buddhism and Taoism, and painfully discussed the abuses of monks and Taoists who lived off the fat of the land. It was also a criticism of the times. Therefore, the angle of writing is to reflect the times, and the mission of writing is to guide the times. Reality is writing, and writing cannot be separated from reality. As for the clear and light-hearted discussion of wind and moon, and the search for chapters and ancient knowledge, it certainly has its value. However, looking out at the world and assessing the current situation, encountering an era as fiery as it is, and seeing the surging tide, works of leisure and tranquility seem less necessary than articles that guide the times.

In the past three months, your publication has been working hard to improve in terms of selection of manuscripts, editing and layout, form and content. Readers are naturally satisfied. However, I hope that you will pay more attention to the "reality" of the selected manuscripts.

I personally am a reader of this publication, and I also use my pen to write articles. Three sentences cannot leave my profession. The writings I write are mostly small pieces about art (limited by the number of words, I dare not write too much). If readers (referring to people outside the circle) don't feel a headache, I would like to suggest to the editor that every Saturday, there should be an introduction and criticism of art. (Not to promote writers) A few days ago, I already talked with Hua Lin, Jian Hua, Chong Peng, and other brothers about establishing an objective and fair art criticism, and saying some things that should be said.

In any newspaper, the supplement occupies a very important position. On the one hand, the supplement can adjust the tastes of readers. On the other hand, it is also a garden for the public, allowing readers to have the opportunity to write and publish. Therefore, I can say with certainty that the rise and fall of a newspaper and the increase or decrease in sales are closely related to the supplement.

We cannot deny that Shen Bao has the most supplements (in fact, the weekly is also a supplement), and it is also more able to meet the ideals of our readers.

"Spring and Autumn" is a pure literary supplement. In terms of quality, because the level of recording is very high, the impression given to readers is satisfactory. As for the quantity, I think that because there are too many long manuscripts and the serialization is too long, only three or four articles can be published at a time, which reduces the interest of readers. This is because overly long manuscripts are not suitable for publication in the supplement. If more short, concise, and interesting essays and sketches were published, and the long novels were also best finished in one or two months, it would not only encourage the interest of the authors in writing, but I would have a suggestion, that is, I hope that "Spring and Autumn" can hold a "Literary Award" once a month, and publish the top six winners. This will further arouse the interest of readers. This is the second point.

I am a loyal reader of "Spring and Autumn". For the sake of caring for "Spring and Autumn", I boldly submitted this "criticism and suggestion" letter. However, what I have put forward is only a principle.

Your publication is the supplement that I like best in all newspapers. I used to read it carefully every day, but in the past month, I have been cutting it out and keeping it every day. Now it has gradually accumulated into a thick stack, and I often browse through it in my spare time, and I feel that it is infinitely meaningful.

Yesterday, I saw that you published a solicitation for readers' criticisms of your publication, so now I will contribute some of my humble opinions to you. Perhaps a fool's thousand thoughts may yield one gain, and it is not yet known.

After flipping through the twenty or thirty copies of your publication that I have cut and saved, "Yangzhou Continued Dreams," "The Case of Ouyang Xiu and Zhu Shuzhen's (Sheng Zha Zi)," "On the Fuchun River," "The Biography of Pellissier-Velan," "Memorandum on Silkworm Affairs," "Qinhuai Moon," and "Zhang Daqian, as I Know Him," can arouse readers' interest, and they can also increase the opportunity for readers to publish manuscripts, directly encourage the courage of authors, and indirectly help increase the sales of newspapers. This is the first point.

Since the supplement is a garden for the public, and "Small and Exquisite Notes on Suzhou" and other articles are what I like to read, after carefully analyzing them, they can be classified as anecdotes, travel notes, biographies, essays, self-cultivation, etc. Articles that are empty and full of long sighs are what I hate. I hope that your publication will publish more of the above types of articles, especially constructive articles that can increase readers' knowledge and improve readers' character.

Your publication has always been very careful in selecting materials, and the editing is also quite artistic. There is nothing to consult about. However, since the teacher is so humbly soliciting readers' opinions, and in order to continue to make your publication "strive for perfection," I, standing in the position of a reader, would like to briefly state a few points as follows:

1. In terms of selecting manuscripts, focus on literature: solicit more humorous and witty essays (or lyrical prose poems), and short academic and literary articles with substantial content. Except for "An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood," which should continue to be published, other ordinary long articles that are not realistic and lack content should be published less, so as not to occupy space in vain.

2. In terms of form, try to make it as artistic as possible. The size of each day's edition should have a certain standard. For example, your publication now mostly occupies one-half of a page, but sometimes it is inevitably enlarged or reduced, which seems to need improvement.

3. Regarding illustrations, I hope to select more fine works by famous people, such as "Floating Mist and Distant Peaks," "Landscape of Eastern Zhejiang," "Orchids," etc. last month, which are full of a poetic flavor that makes people enjoy them.

The above three points are my opinions on your publication, and also a little hope from readers for your publication. I provide it for reference.

Whether it is the editor of a large newspaper or the editor of a small newspaper, they should have a "humble" "sincerity" to accept the criticisms of the vast number of readers. Like Mr. Jin Shan, the editor-in-chief of this newspaper's "Spring and Autumn," he has such a heart, which is worthy of admiration.

Let me say something further. Before the Holy War, Mr. Li Liewen, the editor of this newspaper's supplement "Free Talk," was as cautious and strict in his attitude towards accepting manuscripts as Mr. Jin Shan, the editor-in-chief of "Spring and Autumn" is now. He does not add any other colors to the pure literary garden. This is the "advantage" of "Spring and Autumn" now, which has aroused a welcome resonance from a wide range of readers.

Now, as a reader who cares about this publication, I would like to offer a little contribution to "Late Autumn," but it is only a little bit of superficial opinion.

1. The "Spring and Autumn" of the past was quite substantial in terms of the format of the arrangement and the "quality" of the content. However, I feel that most of the articles published are focused on "urban" characteristics, and very few articles are seen that take the dynamics of people from all walks of life and the vast peasant groups as their themes. Therefore, in addition to "luxury," it is very difficult for readers to smell a bit of the simple, unadorned, and cheerful smell of the laboring masses. I hope that this publication will publish more articles related to people's livelihoods or depicting the dynamics of people from all walks of life in the future.

2. In "Spring and Autumn," I hope to read more articles by new authors in the future, and do not let a few old writers worry about it all the time. On the one hand, we should try our best to support "newcomers," and make "Spring and Autumn" a truly public garden.

3. In the future, in addition to publishing medium-length serials, I hope to publish more short stories, and match the wonderful parts of the novels with "woodcuts" to set them off, which will be even more welcomed by the vast number of readers.

I am a loyal reader of your publication. Whenever the newspaper deliverer brings Shen Bao, I always take out "Spring and Autumn" first to read it carefully, and then read the other news. Here, I will record the same feelings of several readers of your publication that I am familiar with and offer them to you, sir. I don't think you will blame me for being presumptuous!

Regarding the fact that the majority of people who love to read tend to prefer short literary creations, almost the majority of readers feel the same way. The next are essays, short poems, etc. They are not very interested in introductions to people, book reviews, art reviews, and introductions. The reason, according to their explanation, is that the good and bad of people and works are obvious to all, and will never increase or decrease their status and value due to biased comments. As for long articles that are too long, they are often interrupted and cannot be continued.

In terms of selecting manuscripts, I also hope to select what is liked by the majority of readers as the best.

Regarding editing, it is best to plan the appropriate space for each day's Spring and Autumn. For example, how many fractions of a whole should creation occupy, and how many fractions of a whole should essays, poems, etc. occupy? Introductions to people and art criticism are not unwelcome, but it is best to set aside a specific day of the week to introduce and comment on them in detail, so that readers can also concentrate on studying them.

The above are a few points that I have written down in a rambling manner. They are absolutely written with sincere enthusiasm, based on the hopes of a large number of people. I don't think you will blame me for "not knowing what is important," right?

Editor, you are planning to improve this publication and soliciting reader feedback. I am one of the readers, and it is just right to take this opportunity to express a little confusion. However, of course, it is not "criticism!"

(1) Empty and lengthy unnecessary papers are best not published, or reduced.

(2) Publish more short and concise reporting-oriented short creative works.

(3) Publish more short academic papers with research value.

(4) Publish more essays with considerable content.

(5) Publish more new poems with artistic value. Regarding the above points, I seem to have to repeat the statement about new poems; in this silent poetry world, it is just right to set off a torch of progress and make it flourish. I wonder what the editor thinks?

One

I carry a knapsack of melancholy on my back, a knapsack I previously exchanged for a tremendous price. – The warmth of a loving mother, the coziness of home, and the lighthearted romance of youth… For years, wandering the world, unable to withstand the sandstorms and dust of the northern lands, my knapsack has become somewhat tattered. Occasionally, when I look down, I realize my shoes are torn, and my clothes appear shabby. After wind and rain, an additional layer of scars is etched upon my heart. I am still young, I remind myself, so why am I so sorrowful? Several times I have stumbled and fallen into the treacherous pitfalls of the world, rising again each time, casting my gaze into the distance, where more thorns and greater difficulties lie ahead.

Beside the road of life, in a fleeting inn, under the oil lamp amidst the pattering of rain on banana leaves, I meticulously count the stitches of my loving mother, the close stitching before departure, the repeated reminders of adding earth to the quilt at night, when will be the day of return? The heart of the wanderer is about to break. My hair, once gently caressed by her loving gaze, is now marked by the traces of wind and rain instead of my mother’s touch. Ruthless time has stripped away these few remaining comforts, leaving a blank space in the depths of my lonely heart.

The human world is so cold!

In my childhood, in my hometown, the weather was similarly bleak in late autumn, yet the feeling it gave me was not so stark and lonely.

Growing up in a mountain town, I did not know what color the water hyacinths of late autumn possessed, nor what kind of mood the reed-lined riverbank held. I only knew that once autumn arrived, those scorching maple forests would resemble countless young torches, burning across the entire mountainside. Standing beneath the red maples of West Mountain, I would watch clusters of cotton-like white clouds gather from behind the mountain, then slowly drift towards another peak. The autumn wind was fierce, yet beside the bamboo fences of the mountain dwellers, a pair of innocent lambs still playfully butted heads, frolicking.

“Are you cold?”

“No.”

“Then let’s go up the mountain!” On the mountain, we lit an even larger fire, with heaps of withered grass and fallen leaves burning while crackling. The wind was strong, so the fire blazed even more fiercely. In an instant, I felt boundless warmth. We took off our outer garments, our souls leaped, and our blood boiled. Through the blazing flames, I could faintly see the rosy cheeks of my companions flushed like apples. Then we looked at each other and smiled, our laughter scattering with joyful songs into every corner of the mountain. In the intense firelight, the emotions of childhood were melted together, and the pure hearts of the children were refined to even greater purity.

We then considered ourselves little Prometheuses. – That great fire-bringer, who did not hesitate to endure the suffering of the desolate forbidden area of the Caucasus, stealing the sparks of stars for humanity.

And accepting the enlightenment of the stubborn spark, we yearned for the struggles of tomorrow to be so difficult, the battles of tomorrow to be so arduous.

But——

“With fire, we are not afraid of the dark!”

“With fire, we are not afraid of the cold!”

Three

Due to the call of the torch of life, my reason grew strong. Over the years, I have searched diligently for truth, with the same urgency and piety as Muslims making a pilgrimage to holy sites.

And like a worldly weather bird, I am highly sensitive to changes in the wind and clouds. I cannot bear every moment of suffocating air, and I am alarmed by every dark cloud in the sky, as if they are all harbingers of thunderstorms. I hardly dare to believe in the hypocritical warmth of winter, because what often follows it is an even colder and more intense snowstorm... Like the cries of apes or the wails of ghosts, the north wind howls in the distant pine forest. Mountain rain is imminent; how profound is the atmospheric pressure!

I grope for a path in the boundless darkness, and on long, moonless nights, I yearn for a ray of hope. Unexpectedly, just when I am praising the light, it vanishes in a flash. After dawn, there is still a vast fog, the gloom and bewilderment of endless darkness.

I live a series of gloomy and bitter days.

I dream that the traps of the desolate sun are endlessly expanding, expanding.

At the window, I discovered the first strand of white hair of youth.

Four

I have come to understand hatred.

But now it is winter. The fields of Jiangnan are left with only gloom, desolation, loneliness, and emptiness, unable to conceal the weariness and fatigue. The ancient fields reveal deep wrinkles, also unable to hide the toil of a year's labor. Old oxen in the low-lying pens utter sighs of vicissitude. Among the paths between fields, on the banks, are scattered weeds, firewood scraps, withered vines, old trees, and drowsy crows... I reminisce about whether the ponds and rivers of my hometown have dried up, and whether the resplendent maple forests have faded from their blood-red color.

Wild grasses hide vitality, lurking with life force, waiting for the sprouting of next spring in the silvery snow. The singers of the era are also silent, preparing for another passionate chorus of life in the spring of next year after a period of hibernation in the harsh winter.

Then why not be silent? Learn in silence, remember in silence. If it is said that there is no silence in people's hearts, then what lies dormant after silence is perhaps an even greater power.

"Silence! Either erupt in silence, or perish in silence!"

### Chronic Starvation

— Shao Fu

The Shanghai Municipal Symphony Orchestra, in an unsuccessful plea for the issuance of their December salaries, sent a letter to the mayor on Christmas night, written by all forty-three members, which contained the memorable line:

"We believe that nothing is more tragic than watching our comrades gradually die from 'chronic starvation,' especially since the survival of the group of signatories below, for the sake of our cultural contribution, is not without value."

"We are not prepared to ask you for any other benefits beyond what we deserve. Just say a word and issue the salaries, and you can ease the pinched bellies of many musicians in dire need. Dear Mayor, will you have this little bit of compassion?"

At this time and place when various industries are giving out large year-end bonuses, there is unexpectedly this interlude of requesting timely salary payments. What kind of world is this? It is truly filled with contradictions!

The Shanghai Municipal Symphony Orchestra is the former Shanghai Municipal Council Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Mei Baiqi devoted his life to establishing its tradition and glorious history. It can be called the pride of Shanghai. It is unanimously praised by musical circles both domestically and internationally. However, achievements in art are not enough to guarantee not having a "pinched belly" and "chronic starvation." There are too many stories like this, especially in the music world.

Someone told me that those who play music in hotels and restaurants earn nearly a million yuan a month, and the hotels and restaurants also provide two snacks and one dinner. I really want to advise the friends of the symphony orchestra, why bother being foolish and talking about art? Who wants your cultural contribution anyway! You might as well fill your stomachs first. At least in hotels, restaurants, and dance halls, you won't suffer from the pain of chronic starvation, right?

### New Year's Eve Gleanings

— Translated by Ge Chunliang

Nattering

A woman and a child boarded a streetcar, buying only one ticket, and squeezed into the car.

"Wait a minute," said the ticket seller, "you should buy a ticket for that child too."

"But he's only three years old!" she protested.

"He looks like he's six years old to me."

"You should realize that I've only been married for four years."

"Hey, lady, I just want you to buy a ticket, I don't want to hear your life story or your confession!"

Cowardice Against Cowardice

Mike and Jane, a pair of close friends, quarreled one day, and as a result, they challenged each other to a duel. Both were cowardly weaklings, so they decided to duel in a completely dark room with pistols.

Everyone agreed that Mike would shoot first. Trembling, he groped his way to the fireplace and fired upwards into the chimney—but instead, he shot Jane down.

The Wrong Person

A specialist from the Education Department was once visiting a rural primary school when he became very angry at the noisy sounds of a group of unruly students next door. He furiously opened the door to the adjacent room and pulled out the tallest boy, because he seemed to be talking the most nonsense. He dragged the boy out of the classroom, into the next room, and told him to stand in the corner.

"Now, you stand there silently!" he ordered.

A few minutes later, a little child poked his head into the room and said, "Sir, I'm sorry, but could you let our teacher come back?"

Wrong Name

A young housewife was complaining to her neighbor about her husband's frequent late returns home.

"I've cured my husband," her friend told her. "A few weeks ago, one night, he came home very late, and I called out, 'Hey, dear Jem, is that you?'"

"And that was all it took?"

"Yes," she smiled, "because my husband's name is Pierre." (Translated from the December issue of Crown Magazine)

Sobei

In thirty-five years, each of these three hundred and sixty-five pages is filled with "poverty" and "chaos." Poverty leads to chaos, and chaos leads to more poverty, forming a vicious cycle. Who knows where it will all end?

Victory for us is like "nine nines return to eighty-one," still no victory. Ashamed to meet New Year's Eve, I feel that everything is wrong and useless. However, "survival" and "despair" stand side by side. Even on the verge of despair, one must do everything possible. Even a "fatalist" would still say: "Do your best and leave the rest to fate!" There is absolutely no reason to "let it be!" Moreover, "the road turns and the scenery changes," "when the willows are dark and the flowers are bright"! Only cowards and lazy people are afraid of seeing "hope"! Dear friends: Tonight, we send away poverty and chaos. Thirty-six years will be a year of "hope"!

### New Year's Eve Housecleaning

— Shengjie

The year thirty-five has come to an end. New Year's Eve arrives quickly. Stores are busy closing accounts, and government agencies are rushing to prepare financial reports. Yes, after ending a year, one must make a final accounting, and then one can peacefully celebrate the New Year. I think of the usual custom that every year-end, every place must be thoroughly cleaned. Most people often overlook the meaning of thorough cleaning, thinking that it is just sweeping and cleaning and sweeping away dust; in fact, cleaning, since it has added the word "thorough," should be "meticulous and all-encompassing."

I am ashamed to be a nominal civil servant, eating the public's food and taking the state's salary, but in fact, I have not fulfilled my responsibilities. I arrive late and leave early for work, and when I am happy, I casually write a few lines of "as requested," and when I am unhappy, I read tabloids. Anyway, I have a strong backing, and I fear nothing. I adhere to one principle: regardless of whether I am present or not, my name is always on the sign-in sheet. Therefore, I have muddled through this year. As New Year's Eve arrives, I ask myself and am filled with shame! Therefore, I frankly confess that during this thorough cleaning, "muddling through" should become the past, and "hard work" should begin today!

### Talking About Diamonds in Chaotic Times

— Chen Xiang

The dazzling diamonds, how many people do they drive mad? How many people lose their virtue? How many people break the law? The price of diamonds is probably second only to the atomic bomb, right? Currently, the average market price per carat is about 985 US dollars, plus a heavy tax. However, to break it down, a diamond is not much different from a lump of coal; they are both just a small piece of carbon. It's just that one has become crystalline, and the other has not. But why is the price of diamonds so high? There are many reasons for this: some for rarity, some for fantasy, and also an artificial reason like currency management.

At the world's largest and most scientifically advanced Kimberly Mines in South Africa, to extract a half-carat diamond, rocks (or "blue ground") are dug up from 3,600 feet below the ground, poured into boxes, and workers are assigned to "pan for diamonds." The weight of the barren rocks is 320 million times the weight of the found diamonds. Many "diamond panning" workers have labored for thirty years and have never seen a diamond!

The world's largest diamond originally weighed 3,106 carats (about one and one-third pounds) and was discovered in 1905 by Frederick Wells, the surface manager of the Premier Mine in South Africa. This large diamond was named "Cullinan" in honor of the company's president, Thomas Cullinan, and was later escorted to London. Experts there estimated its value at 75 million US dollars! Wells received a bonus of 10,000 US dollars. Later, the Transvaal government of the South African Union bought it as a gift for King Edward VII of England, presenting it on his 66th birthday. The King paid an insurance premium of 725 US dollars, withdrawn from the Bank of England, for a two-hour viewing.

The "Cullinan" was later divided into five pieces by a diamond cutter named J. Asscher (one of which was later divided into many smaller pieces). The largest four pieces are now inlaid. The largest is "Cullinan I," pear-shaped, weighing 530 carats, and inlaid in the center of the crown.

The beauty and loveliness of diamonds do not simply come from their natural essence; a part of it also relies on human scientific technology. This technology is cutting and polishing, to increase the "facets" of the diamond, which increases its dazzling brilliance. Today's "standard brilliant diamond" has fifty-eight facets, each of which is cut into the most precise proportions using a diamond grinding wheel. The brilliance of a diamond depends on the amount of light reflected from its "facets," so the more facets a diamond has, the more brilliant it is.

Diamonds are not only used for decoration; they do have uses in industry—they can rotate parts of machines, manufacture grinding wheels, and draw metals into fine metal wires. Regarding the latter, it is truly an amazing skill. Three to four hundred tons of copper, passed through extremely fine holes arranged with diamond powder, forms copper wire long enough to encircle the earth twenty times.

Diamonds can be used in industry because they are the hardest substance in the world, not easily worn or affected by heat. Engineers use diamonds as drill bits when drilling hard objects. Dentists also use diamond drill bits to grind teeth. But strangely, industrial diamonds are very cheap, only 4 to 12 US dollars per carat. Why is this? It's very simple, because they are man-made—scientists make them from carbon. These artificial diamonds are not as brilliant or hard as real diamonds.

Finally, let's talk about the artificial reasons for maintaining the high price of diamonds: the world's largest diamond producing areas are Africa and India. The former is located within the colonies of Britain and Belgium, and the latter is simply a British colony. The diamond mines occupied by Britain and Belgium account for 95 percent of the world's total. So they united to form a monopolistic control group, setting prices and maintaining them as they pleased. On the one hand, they make money, and on the other hand, they protect buyers from market fluctuations. If they didn't do this, supply and demand would change, and the price of diamonds would plummet.

Under the secular craze, the value of diamonds has been raised, and the pockets of some people have been filled.

### Reap What You Sow

— Xiao Kangshi

The recent business downturns are truly frightening! Everyone blames them on "usury," saying that they have suffered from the evils of usury, so many businesses have been forced to close. But I want to "cry injustice" for usury!

Many business closures are actually due to "insatiable greed!" Like when gold prices were soaring, banks and gold shops frantically bought in, but unexpectedly, with a slap in the face, when prices started to fall, they were burdened and collapsed, and they insisted on blaming it on the disaster of "usury." It is truly crying injustice for usury!

The truly suffering from the evils of "usury" are ordinary shops! As the famous Chinese saying goes: "A true merchant has no capital." Doing business entirely relies on borrowing from outside, so when it comes to being affected by "usury," it is ordinary shops!

At the same time, the creation of usury was actually started by "speculators" and "hoarders." They wanted to "seize windfall profits," so they "inflated" interest rates! Recently, many banks and shops have collapsed, mostly because of "insatiable greed" in the past and "reaping what they sow" later!

So the reason why the "downturn" is so terrible is not just "the evils of usury"? The Supreme One said, "Disaster and fortune have no gate, only man invites them himself"! It's absolutely true!

### Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law

— Li Xi

The previous "Periodic Talk" in "Free Talk" discussed the issue between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. The famous sayings and discussions have all been read. I intend to offer my humble conclusion as follows. As we bid farewell to the old and welcome the new, I wish everyone a happy family with this!

One (Mother-in-law): Not foolish, not silent, how can you be a mother-in-law? Not hearing, not asking, enjoying the bliss of leisure.

Two (Daughter-in-law): A mother-in-law is always a senior, and should be respected and filial. Your husband is still yours, why let him suffer?

Three (Son): Not biased, not prejudiced, having a wife but also a mother. Tolerate each other, be willing to work hard and endure grievances.

### The Organization of Beggars 22

— Huang Jiamo

Getting Money Is Always Difficult, Begging Is Not Easy Either

In China, begging is an ancient profession. In the lower classes of society, begging developed earlier than prostitution. As the saying goes, "After three years as a beggar, even an official wouldn't want to do it." Although it is an exaggeration, the mystery lies in the words "three years as a beggar." Scholar-officials have always looked down on beggars, thinking they are useless fellows, but this is not always the case. In the past, beggars had to be apprenticed to join the gang. Joining the gang is abstract, but "apprenticeship" cannot be done perfunctorily. Beggars must undergo various basic training for at least three years before they are considered skilled and ready to face the world. At that time, whether they want to be officials or not is up to them.

The apprenticeship to pass on the mantle is not necessarily done by the "beggar chief" himself. The beggar chief is like a school principal, and he has teachers who teach specialized subjects. For example, there are martial arts instructors for boxing, traveling doctors and herbalists for dispensing medicine and healing injuries, and music teachers for singing songs. There are many categories, with required and elective courses available. Student beggars must pay annual fees and can be taught as much as possible. The main points of business activities are as follows:

(A) "Learning Skills" — The most common skills include "nose balancing," "tongue piercing," "knife dancing," "bowl dancing," "ball juggling," and "money tricking." All beggars with sound limbs and no ailments must diligently learn one or two skills. This is easier to get money than begging in the streets or shouting wildly. The tools carried by beggars each have their own uses and cannot be arbitrarily disposed of, which would violate "gang rules." For example, porcelain bowls and bamboo baskets are used to beg for money, rice bags and iron pots are used to hold food, canes are carried to ward off dogs, and torn cotton-padded jackets are used to store money. Other tools such as the sanxian, huqin, clappers, drums, swords, halberds, racks, rat rings, monkey hats, and sheep clothing must be practiced and applied according to the skills learned.

(B) "Addressing Donors" — There are many types of addresses for beggars begging in the streets, and they must be used according to the person. Everything depends on judgment and experience. For example, (1) "Young Master," (2) "Master," (3) "High Master," (4) "Old Master" are used to address high-ranking officials, with distinctions based on age and status. For women, there are (5) "Madam," (6) "Old Madam," (7) "Great Grandmother," (8) "Young Madam," (9) "Miss," etc. If there are errors, such as calling an unmarried girl "Young Madam" or "Madam," they will be scolded and not get money. Therefore, it is safer to call young women "Miss" to avoid offending them. There are also (10) "Sir," (11) "Official," (12) "Uncle," (13) "Auntie," (14) "Rich Man," (15) "Rich Man's Wife," etc., which are used for couples, and you must be sure that they are a couple and that their status matches the address before you can say it. In addition, there are (16) "Officer," (17) "Boss," (18) "Shopkeeper," (19) "Auntie," (20) "General Manager," (21) "Mister," each with its own proper context, and you must call it out as soon as you see them, without thinking twice. These abilities all require experience.

(C) "Crying Training" — Whether begging on the street, walking or sitting, beggars must be able to cry. This is the same as with theater actors, and they must be trained. Otherwise, there is actually no "sorrow from the heart," so what about the emotion of crying? It is understandable that male beggars cannot cry, but they must still cry forcefully. Female beggars cry more easily, but it must be rhythmic and moving to be considered top-notch. Experienced and talented female beggars are confident in this skill. They often sit together by the roadside, wailing loudly, each cry filled with tears and each sentence moving, or they wail along the street with their young children, and as soon as they get money, they immediately stop crying and give thanks. The speed of stopping is amazing! Male beggars' wailing lacks artistic elements and must be accompanied by performances of disability to elicit pity.
