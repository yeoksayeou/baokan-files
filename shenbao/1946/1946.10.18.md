### Government Political Consultative Conference Representatives Arrive in Shanghai to Invite Various Party Members to Beijing; Optimism Pervades the Capital

[Our Newspaper Report] Government representatives Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen, and three others, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM via China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane. At the airport, Mr. Wu told reporters that he was here as a government representative to the Political Consultative Conference, inviting various parties, factions, and social elites in Shanghai to go to Beijing for discussions. Representatives from the Third Force of the Political Consultative Conference had hoped that the government would express its position on the ceasefire and send personnel to Shanghai. Now that the Chairman's message has been announced, and we have arrived here. Mr. Shao Lizi strongly avoided speaking, only smiling and repeatedly saying, "Your news is truly accurate."

Mr. Wu then met with our newspaper's reporter at his residence, stating that since the Chairman's message was published, people in the capital have become more optimistic about the prospects of peace talks. In this message, the government has already made significant concessions, such as on the issue of communist controlled defense zones and so-called local political power. When Mr. Wu mentioned the military actions in Zhangjiakou, he said in an extremely mournful tone that the National Army's attack on Zhangjiakou was truly a last resort, a painful matter to discuss! If the Chinese Communists could faithfully implement the two ceasefire orders of late January and June 7, or agree to the government's proposal for a ten-day ceasefire on the Zhangjiakou front, why would it have come to this! Military issues cannot be resolved simply with the word "ceasefire." How to achieve a ceasefire still requires negotiation. The proposal for a ten-day ceasefire in Zhangjiakou was intended for this purpose. There is still one month until the National Assembly. If the eight measures outlined in the Chairman's message can be implemented, an informal five-person meeting should be held as soon as possible to discuss government reorganization. Simultaneously, a three-person group should be formed to resolve military issues, and the Constitutional Draft Review Committee should complete its unfinished work on the constitutional draft. Then, all of this should be summarized and submitted to the Political Consultative Conference's comprehensive group for discussion. Then, convening the National Assembly in one month will surely lead to a satisfactory resolution, and the meeting date should not be affected.

When a reporter asked how the defense areas for Communist troops in the Northeast would be determined, Mr. Wu replied that they would still be determined according to the June Zhaojun Plan. When asked why the list of National Assembly representatives was delayed, Mr. Wu said that the government was truly waiting for various parties to submit their lists. As for the Youth Party's nomination list, Mr. Wu said he was unaware of it. Mr. Wu also expressed his hope to bring back the Chinese Communist Party's list of representatives when he returns to Beijing.

Mr. Wu and others will first exchange views with representatives from the Third Force and will likely visit Zhou Enlai on Sunday. Their return to the capital is likely to be next Monday.

Third Force Representatives

Discussed for a Long Time at Fan Garden

Yesterday morning, representatives from the Third Force discussed for a long time at Zhang Junqin's residence in Fan Garden. After Mr. Wu arrived, Mr. Zhang visited to talk. It is heard that the Third Force representatives have scheduled a banquet for Mr. Wu and the others tonight.

[Huizhong News Agency, Our City Report] This morning, a reporter inquired at Zhou Enlai's Shanghai office for news. The response remained a concise "no comment," with the added explanation: "It's too early in the morning, we have only seen the newspaper reports."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th Report] According to reliable sources, when the central government discussed the Chinese Communist issue on the 16th, Lei Zhen had just returned to Beijing from all directions and was summoned to report. The gist was that President Sun entrusted him to convey the suggestions of various parties in Shanghai. After exchanging views with the Shanghai Democratic League, the Youth Party, social elites, and representatives from various factions of the Political Consultative Conference, they reached a general agreement. However, after contacting the representatives of the Third Force and the Chinese Communist Party, they still hoped that the government would first make a clear statement of willingness to cease fire, and it would be best to appoint one or two government representatives to the Political Consultative Conference to Shanghai for consultations to show sincerity. If so, everyone could return to Beijing to reopen peace talks, and the opportunity could be expected to mature quickly. After Mr. Lei's report, some committee members advocated that the government should openly express its willingness to cease fire, as long as the representatives of the Chinese Communist Party and various parties immediately go to Beijing, peace talks can be reopened immediately. The Chairman further clearly instructed that the government can issue a message, declaring the government's consistent tolerance and sincere efforts to seek peace. Once this news spread, the atmosphere of optimism in Beijing has intensified in the last two days. This afternoon, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, and Lei Zhen went to Shanghai, and Chinese and foreign people have great expectations.

### Issue of Government Committee Appointment Terms

Currently During a Period of Negotiations with Various Parties

Standing Committee Decides to Postpone Discussion

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th Report] The term of office of the Government Committee was originally set at three years, the same as the Chairman's. Whether the current committee members should be re-elected or reappointed when their terms expire was submitted to the Standing Committee's regular meeting on the 16th for discussion. It was generally believed that the issue of reorganizing the government is currently being negotiated with various parties, and the situation has entered a delicate stage. Therefore, it was decided to reserve the case and postpone the discussion to show the Kuomintang's sincerity in expecting various parties to participate in the government. Therefore, the rumor that the term of office of the current Government Committee has been decided to be extended until the government is reorganized at the National Assembly is not true.

Strongly Criticizes Those Who Advocate War Rumors

People of the World Unanimously Loathe War

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th Report] US Ambassador Stuart Delivers said in a speech at the Rotary Club here today, vigorously advocated "world culture," which is a single supranational government. Ambassador Stuart expressed his deep hatred for the ongoing war. He also expressed in a straightforward manner that he believed that the psychology of the people of the world's loathing of war is even more certain than the expectation of peace. The people of the Soviet Union, like the people of the United States and other countries, do not want to see war again. He also emphasized that the people of the world all expect peace, and the people of China are no exception, because the people of any country view it as such. He fiercely criticized those who advocate war rumors, "that is, those who often say that a third world war is inevitable." Those who are accustomed to spreading rumors say that the Soviet Union and the British and American forces will fight. Ambassador Stuart also put forward the theory of "international democracy," that is, "world consciousness generated from our own selves." He believes that the new world structure should be a whole, in which countries can cooperate with each other without interfering in the politics of other countries.

### Truman and Bernays Discuss US Policy Towards China; Marshall's Return Home Will Have a Significant Impact

[French News Agency, Washington, 17th Report] After Secretary of State Bernays returns home from Paris, he will handle various important foreign policy issues. How to make China internally unified under the central government is one of the issues. Special Envoy Marshall's return home will likely have a significant impact on US foreign policy in China. It is reported that Ambassador Marshall's return home is very likely because he needs to report to the government. From the overall situation, the Department of the Army favors the United States strengthening its assistance to the Chinese central government, while some members of the State Department, on the contrary, favor reducing this assistance, forcing the central government to continue to make concessions to the Chinese Communists.

### National Army Counterattacks in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway; Offensive and Defensive Battle Reopens; National Army Heading North from Anyang Reaches Linluoguan

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th Report] The National Army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway began a counterattack southward at noon on the 17th. By 5:00 PM, the vanguard had forced the recently lost Songlin Store. Upon hearing the news, the Communist troops at the station withdrew in advance and ambushed two platoons. The station can be recovered on the evening of the 17th. This time, the National Army's counterattack adopted a steady approach, ensuring that recovered areas would not be lost again. The Communist troops still used their method of avoiding the real and attacking the empty. On the morning of the 17th, they gathered considerable troops and approached the Zhuozhou and Yongle stations from both sides, attempting to achieve a restraining effect. In the east of Gaobeidian, more than 20,000 people have also gathered since last night, with a tendency to reinforce along the Gaobeidian-Songlin Store Avenue. The offensive and defensive battle in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has reopened. It is reported that Zhoukoudian, west of Liulihe, has been captured by the Communist troops, and the branch line has been completely destroyed. It has been proven that the attack on Yuanshi County and the station south of Shijiazhuang by the Northern Army is inaccurate. According to traffic statistics, from September 29 to date, the Communist troops have destroyed a total of 100 kilometers of railway in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, nearly 60 iron bridges, railway tracks transported to the mountains, sleepers burned, and the roadbed dug into a curved ditch two meters wide and one meter deep. It is estimated that it will take a month to completely repair the entire section to be able to operate.

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 17th Report] Under the coordination of the army and air force, the advance troops of the National Army heading north from Anyang have reached Linluoguan and are continuing to advance. Furthermore, there are fierce battles in the Zhaogun and Yaocheng areas near Shimen.

### General Chen Reports on Military Affairs at Reception for Chinese and Foreign Journalists in Beiping; Reporter Group Arrived in Huailai Yesterday Evening for Inspection

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th Report] At a press reception on the 17th, General Chen Cheng declared: After the recovery of Zhangjiakou, the government hopes to resolve the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party through political means. If unfortunately a military solution must be used, he believes that it can be resolved in as little as three months or as long as five months. It does not necessarily have to take 20 years as Zhou Enlai said. General Chen is very optimistic about the military situation, believing that the Communist troops are unable to counterattack Zhangjiakou. Datong is also not in danger of being captured again. Currently, the Zhangjiakou and Huailai passes on the PingSui Railway have joined forces, and the road between Zhangjiakou and Datong will definitely be opened within five to seven days. Those who are disrupting the northern section of the Pinghan Railway are local Communist troops and will be cleared up in the short term. As for restoring traffic, it is said that if the government uses military force to open up the Jinpu and Pinghan railways, it is estimated that it can be achieved in two weeks. In answering reporters' questions, Chen implied that the next target of the National Army would not be Yan'an. When answering the question of whether the National Army would attack Yan'an, he repeated his previous remarks in Nanjing, saying that Datong, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde are one battlefield, but he did not include Yan'an. When a reporter asked whether the government would open up the traffic to Yantai in order to restore maritime traffic, Chen replied that if the Jinpu Railway is opened up, Yantai would not be a problem. Chen reviewed the battle of Zhangjiakou, saying that the troops of the 12th War Zone attacked Zhangyuan unexpectedly, which resulted in the first victory. The importance of the recovery of Zhangyuan lies not only in its strategic position but also in its economic value. In the future, after the PingSui Railway is repaired, food can be transported eastward, and coastal yarn and cotton can be transported westward, which is of great importance to the lives of soldiers and civilians. Chen estimated that since June, the Communist troops in Guannei have suffered at least 200,000 casualties, among which the Li Xiannian's troops have suffered the most losses. Although the Communist Party can use "mobilization" to replenish its personnel losses, the loss of weapons and ammunition and the disintegration of combat morale cannot be replenished. A reporter asked whether domestic military conflicts might lead to international disputes. Chen replied that the Communist Party had said that the National Army's siege of Zhangjiakou would trigger the international situation, but in fact no such incident occurred. At present, all countries in the world hope that China will be peacefully unified. General Chen's press conference was held at the Beiping Foreign Affairs Building at 5:00 PM on the 17th. More than 50 Chinese and foreign reporters attended, and it lasted for an hour and a half before it ended.

[Central News Agency, Huailai, 17th Report] A group of 15 Beiping reporters arrived in Huailai at 5:00 PM on the 17th to inspect the battlefield.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 17th Report] A group of Chinese and foreign reporters will go to Zhangyuan on a special plane at 8:00 AM on the 18th and return to Beiping that night. The group includes nine foreign reporters, twelve Chinese reporters, and one person each from the Film Studio and the State Propaganda Office.

### No War in Shandong Province; Government-Controlled Areas are Increasing; National Army in Northern Jiangsu Encircles Xinghua on Three Sides

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 17th Report] There has been no war in Shandong Province in recent days, and the areas controlled by the government are increasing, which gives the people unparalleled comfort. Traffic on the Jiaoji Railway is being repaired day and night, and commercial traffic between Jinan and Qingdao has been opened, but the unreparied sections of the road temporarily require the use of manpower. There are still more than 100,000 Communist troops left near the sides of the Jiaoji Railway, who have temporarily stopped attacking the National Army, but the authorities have reported that Lin Biao recently transferred more than 10,000 elite troops from the Northeast, concentrated in Dalian, and landed in Yantai and Longkou, attempting to attack the Jiaoji Railway again. The National Army is investigating and preparing. The main force of the Communist troops in the area north of the Jiaoji Railway, south of the Yellow River, west of Boxing, and east of Jinan has withdrawn and is completely under the control of the National Army. The National Army can reach the vicinity of Boxing and has recovered Qingcheng County. The National Army in southern Shandong has recovered the traffic line between Oucheng and Zaozhuang. The northern advance is also going smoothly, and the recovery of Zhongxin Ji County is only a matter of time. The traffic line from Yanzhou to Jixian in southwestern Shandong is completely controlled by the National Army within 30 miles. Furthermore, the main force of the Communist troops in the area west of Jining, south of Fan County and Shouzhang, has retreated north, and the National Army is clearing up the scattered Communist troops.

### Trade Between China and Britain Should be Resumed as Soon as Possible

Speech by Chairman of the British Chemical Industry Association

[French News Agency, London, 16th] The Sino-British Chamber of Commerce recently held a dinner party here. Sir McGowan, Chairman of the British Imperial Chemical Industries Association, said in his speech that he eagerly hoped that China and Britain could resume trade as soon as possible and exchange goods. If China and Britain do not exchange goods with each other, China will be unable to develop and improve the living conditions of its people. China's long and heroic war of resistance has won the world's infinite admiration. But the impact of war is longer than the war itself, which can almost be asserted. As for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the United Kingdom has generously contributed a lot. In the past, the United Kingdom invested a lot of capital in China. As far as our company is concerned, it has also helped China develop its dyes and other chemical industries. But before China can realize industrialization with the help of the United Kingdom, we would like to see China's political situation stabilize. Therefore, the British Imperial Industries Association does not want to invest in factories in China before China's political situation can stabilize. Unfortunately, the current domestic situation in China has not yet stabilized, and the financial laws and regulations promulgated by the Chinese government have not yet met the reasonable needs of foreign investment. British industrialists are deeply concerned about the unfairness of certain tax rules in China and the large-scale tax evasion by some illegal businessmen. Tian Xi, the Chinese Ambassador to the UK, stood up and replied that he firmly believed that maintaining friendship between China and Britain would greatly benefit the stability of the world situation, and that he would always promote the relations between the two countries.

Mayor Zhang Lun and his wife, Mrs. Sun Yuanliang, commander of the Garrison Department, and more than 20 heads of various agencies went to see them off. Mrs. Cripps was very reluctant to leave and expressed that she would never forget the kindness and friendship shown by all sectors of Chongqing.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th, United Press] Vincent, the chief of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department, stated that there were no secret agreements regarding China at the Potsdam Conference.

Spokespersons of the State Department have not been able to directly and officially deny this in the past three days because the association claimed to wait until Vincent returned from New Zealand to explain this. At the same time, although the spokespersons of the State Department denied the specific agreements mentioned by the association, they did not answer whether secret agreements were established at Potsdam. Vincent emphasized that no such agreement was established at the Potsdam Conference, and that he knew this because he had participated in the conference at the time.

Editorial

### Time, Oh Time, Will Not Return! — Hoping the CCP Will Carefully Not Miss This Last Good Opportunity

At this time when the current situation is approaching another important turning point, we feel particularly gratified after reading Chairman Chiang's announcement regarding handling the current situation, which was released the day before yesterday. The release of this announcement reiterated the government's fundamental stance of consistently adhering to a political solution for domestic political problems. At the same time, it emphasized the urgency of the national people's desire for peace, adopted many opinions from other parties, and fully expressed the government's consistent desire for a ceasefire. The release of this statement truly holds profound significance in handling the current situation.

Moreover, if we explore the reasons behind Chairman Chiang's release of this announcement, we will undoubtedly increase our understanding of the government's sincerity for peace. This understanding will be further strengthened by the visit of Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, and Lei Zhen, representing the government in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, which will allow us to hold optimistic views on the future of peace talks. Recalling the developments of the past four or five days, President Sun Ke carried suggestions from third-party figures from Shanghai back to Nanjing on the 13th and presented them to Chairman Chiang on the 14th. That evening, Lei Zhen, the Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), came from Nanjing to Shanghai. On the 15th, he spent the entire day in Shanghai visiting representatives of various parties and factions, as well as socially prominent PCC representatives, exchanging opinions in the hope of jointly urging CCP representatives to come to Nanjing to discuss and realize peace. On the morning of the 16th, Lei Zhen returned from Shanghai to the capital and attended the Supreme National Defense Council, reporting on the results of his consultations in Shanghai. He said that all parties were willing to do their best to mediate and enable the CCP to continue peace talks with the government, but hoped that the government would first make a kind of ceasefire statement in order to gain the trust of the CCP. If one or two government representatives from the PCC could be sent to Shanghai to invite them, it would be even more promising for a harmonious outcome. This is the reason for Chairman Chiang's announcement of significant concessions the day before yesterday and the reason why Wu and Shao, along with Secretary-General Lei, came to Shanghai yesterday to consult. Understanding this process will surely strengthen our belief that the government genuinely desires peace, and its sincere attitude should be able to move even metal and stone.

Because the government holds such a broad-minded attitude, the government seeks peace so urgently, and the people, after eight years of war, yearn for recuperation and rest as much as a great drought yearns for rain clouds, we expect that any party should put aside their grievances and make peace, turning swords into plowshares. The appeal issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council to the CCP and representatives of various parties yesterday, urging them to come to Nanjing for discussions, truly represented the voice of the people. We have no other words but to appeal to the CCP representatives to come to the capital on an appointed date and have open and honest discussions. Today should not be a time for empty calls for a ceasefire, but a time when everything is ready, and we should all practically agree on specific measures for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire. Today, we are not concerned about when the ceasefire order will be issued, but about when any political party will express its sincerity in abandoning the use of force.

Now that all parties believe that as long as the government makes a statement on the ceasefire issue, it can elicit a positive response, lead to the reopening of peace talks, and enable a comprehensive solution to the deadlock, then Chairman Chiang has already declared in his announcement that the government is prepared to issue an order to cease military conflicts, as long as there are concrete measures. This demonstrates the government's sincerity in wanting to cooperate with all parties. In order to reach a state where the cessation of conflict can be guaranteed, the military three-person group must resolve the issues of the communist army's stationing and the unified organization of the communist army into the national army by an appointed date. Only when the stationing of the communist army is resolved and the unified organization is completed can the cessation of conflict be truly achieved. At the same time, to resolve domestic political disputes, the informal five-person meeting must be convened simultaneously with the military three-person group meeting, and the agreement of the five-person group must be submitted to the PCC's comprehensive group to reach an agreement in order to carry out the reorganization of the national government, so that all issues related to politics and military affairs can be resolved. As for the various issues regarding the draft constitution, a Constitutional Draft Review Committee should be convened immediately to review it quickly so that it can be submitted by the government to the National Assembly as a basis for discussion. At the same time, as the National Assembly is scheduled to convene, the Communist Party should also submit its list of representatives as soon as possible. Therefore, the eight points listed by Chairman Chiang in his statement are truly concrete measures to achieve a comprehensive and permanent cessation of conflict and to deliberate on resolving domestic political disputes. If the Communist Party truly strives for peace and unity for the sake of the country and the people, it should emulate the wisdom of the Indian Muslims and the spirit of the Congress Party in resolving grievances and making peace, change its course decisively, and order its representatives to come to Nanjing for discussions immediately to promote the realization of peace.

The government has already opened the door to peace widely and extended the hand of peace. Although the CCP's beliefs are different, they are still part of China. At this time and in this place, they should know where they stand. Time, oh time, will not return! May the CCP carefully not miss this last good opportunity!

### After the Restoration of Traffic Between Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Gaoyou, Passenger and Freight Transport is Extremely Frequent. Thirteen Ports Along the Yangtze River North and South are Opened for Civil Aviation.

[Report from our Zhenjiang office on the 17th] After the restoration of traffic between Zhenjiang, Gaoyou, Yangzhou, and Gaoyou, freight transport is extremely frequent. In Gaoyou, high-quality rice is priced at 20,000 yuan per stone, and medium-quality rice is 18,000 yuan. In recent days, the food transported south from Gaoyou has been continuous. As a result, rice prices in Zhenjiang and Erdi have already shown a downward trend.

[Report from our Nantong office] The Pacification Commissioner, in order to ensure the safety of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, had previously announced the closure of several ports. Recently, in order to facilitate the commercial transport of civilian ships, it was newly stipulated that the following thirteen ports along the north bank of the Yangtze River—Ren Port, Tiansheng Port, Xiaoli Port, Bawu Port, Tianxing Bridge, Kouan, and along the south bank: Pupu, Fushan, Shiyi Port, Dongjie Port, Tian Port, Shen Port, and Shuanglong Port in Yangzhong—are open for navigation.

### Disputes Over the Allocation of Seats in the Wuxi Council Election. The Chamber of Commerce Expresses Its Intention to Withdraw and Not Participate.

[Report from our Wuxi office] The election of formal councilors in this county has been completed, and the preliminary work of examining the qualifications of candidates for public office in Classes A and B has also come to an end. Regarding the issue of seat allocation for county councilors, the county government has decided that the 199 townships in the county will produce 100 councilors, and the remaining vocational groups will produce 43 councilors. The method of joint elections in various townships has been announced and should not encounter any difficulties. However, regarding the 43 seats for vocational groups, the allocation of seats to various vocational groups should be calculated according to the number of members in each vocational group, as stipulated in the election regulations for councilors promulgated by the Ministry. However, the number of members in each vocational group in this county varies greatly, leading to divergent opinions on the allocated number for this provision from all parties. Subsequently, the county government temporarily calculated and allocated seats in accordance with the aforementioned regulations based on the statistics of the number of members in each vocational group, and then gathered opinions from all parties and sent personnel to the province for instructions. The planned number of seats for each group is: 22 for labor unions, 12 for farmers' associations, 5 for chambers of commerce, 3 for educational associations, and 1 for free professional groups. However, the county chamber of commerce believes that if allocated in this way, the rights of those engaged in industry and commerce to participate in politics will be excessively restricted and deprived. In order to implement the spirit of democracy and the original intent of legislation, they have specially telegraphed the Ministry of Interior, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Department of Civil Affairs, referring to the National Assembly representative election law, which stipulates that the number of representatives produced by vocational groups such as labor unions, farmers' associations, and chambers of commerce in all provinces should be equal, and requested that it be quickly promulgated. Supplementary regulations stipulate that special circumstances may be handled flexibly to conform to the actual situation and demonstrate fairness. At the same time, free professional groups such as the local journalists' association, lawyers' association, and medical association also expressed dissatisfaction and jointly submitted a request to allow the five groups included in free professions to be elected separately in order to demonstrate fairness. Yesterday, at the eighth meeting of directors and supervisors of the county chamber of commerce, this issue was raised for discussion by Chairman Qian Sunqing, who believed that industry and commerce are the main source of all taxes and donations, and that the nature of regions and groups is different. In the current democratic era, the establishment of public opinion organs is intended to seek reasonable representation for each region and profession. If the number of vocational seats is not evenly distributed, the chamber of commerce will have no choice but to withdraw from participating in the election. After unanimous agreement, it was decided to withdraw and not participate.

### Jiaxing Suspends the Collection of Police Donations

[Report from our Jiaxing office] The local Chamber of Commerce previously stated that the donation collected by various counties had already been clearly ordered by the central government to be suspended. However, the Jiaxing County Tax Collection Bureau had included the item of donation in the amount of housing donation collected, which the public could not afford. They telegraphed the executive Yuan requesting a clear order to stop it in order to relieve the people. It is now known that the Executive Yuan has approved the telegram to order the Zhejiang Provincial Government to order the county to suspend the collection.

### Mingguang Checks Household Registration and Captures Japanese Soldiers

Jiading also conducts surprise checks

[Report from our Mingguang office] A household registration check was conducted in Mingguang Main Street Town late last night. A Japanese Railway Corps technical soldier, Roja Matsukichi, was captured in Cao Fu Bao. He was taken to the town office and transferred to the county government for interrogation.

[Report from our Jiading office] At 11 p.m. on the 13th, the county government's military section, together with the county security team and the garrisoned Jiading Parachute Brigade, conducted a surprise household registration check. Thirteen thugs posing as public officials were captured in the Nanyang Hotel and the residence of the traitor Chen Fuxiang outside the South Gate, and a handgun was confiscated. They then went to Nanxiang, Huangdu, Anting, Fangtai, Waigang, and other places to conduct checks and captured several more thugs and three short guns. They were immediately sent to the county government for investigation. It is reported that these thugs are related to the car robbery case on Yuan榻 Bridge in Nanxiang this time.

### Changshu Farmers' Association Requests the Opening of the Baimao Sluice Gate to Drain Accumulated Water from Farmland

[Report from our Changshu office] The local county farmers' association stated that the county experienced a violent storm for two days and one night in the latter half of last month, and the low-lying farmland was flooded. In addition, because the water level of the Yangtze River is higher than that of the inland rivers, the Baimao Sluice Gate has been closed until now, and drainage has become even slower. It is now approaching the autumn harvest season, and the accumulated water in the fields is still more than one foot deep in some places. Farmers not only have difficulty working, but also easily get sick from standing in the water all day as the weather turns cold. They have specially telegraphed requesting that the Baimao Sluice Gate administrator be instructed to investigate the water level of the outer river and inland rivers and open the Baimao Sluice Gate when the tide passes in order to facilitate drainage and benefit the autumn harvest.

### Suzhou Land Price Standards Are Deemed Too High by the Provisional Council

[Report from our Suzhou office] The local Land Consolidation Office was ordered on the 21st of this month to estimate the land price standards in the urban area. After convening relevant agencies for joint assessment, it was assessed and divided into fifteen grades, with the highest price being 20 million yuan per mu. This evaluation is the basis for future land value tax collection. However, the set price is much higher than the current market price. Compared with the price set in the tax deed two months ago, it is also more than ten times higher. The people have just survived the disaster and will be unable to bear the burden. Local residents Fan Junbo, Zizheng, and Song Zicheng requested a re-evaluation. At the same time, the local public opinion organ, the Provisional Council, also invited County Chief and Zhang Zizheng, the director of the Land Consolidation Office, and other relevant personnel to hold a meeting at 10 a.m. on the 15th to review the matter. The Land Registration Office firmly stated that there could be no changes and declared that the government had clearly ordered the land administration agencies to handle the investigation and estimation of land prices. It then publicly read the prices set for each level in the county, pointing out that they were estimated at a lower level compared to the 80 million yuan per mu set in Zhenjiang. As a result, a fierce debate broke out in the meeting. The councilors stood up one after another, denouncing the Land Registration Office for conducting inaccurate investigations, arbitrarily estimating prices, and disregarding public opinion. The matter may be submitted to the province for review.

### Suzhou Land and Grain Office Refutes Landowner Demands. Collecting Rent Along with Grain and Paying Taxes Collectively Are Not in Accordance with Laws and Regulations.

[Report from our Suzhou office on the 17th] The local Land Improvement Association previously formulated measures for collecting rent along with grain and paying taxes collectively in order to protect the interests of landlords, and established a General Office for Rent Collection and a Grain Purchase Committee to be responsible for promoting these measures. These measures have been reviewed and approved by the County Provisional Council and are being submitted to the County Government for approval. Our Suzhou-based special correspondent believes that although these measures protect the interests of landlords, collecting rent along with grain will invisibly increase the burden on tenant farmers, and paying taxes collectively will invisibly harm government tax revenue, which will have a significant impact on the entire finances. Therefore, they visited the person in charge of the Land and Grain Office on the 17th to inquire about their opinions. According to the interview, although this year's land tax is levied in kind, land rent is still collected in accordance with the 25% rent reduction method to show the government's concern for tenant farmers. The Land Improvement Association's proposed measures for collecting rent along with grain and paying taxes collectively have been reviewed and found to be inconsistent with laws and regulations, and have been rejected and not approved.

[Report from our Suzhou office] The county's collection of land tax in kind has begun. The Provincial Order previously organized a Land and Grain Office, and the personnel for the subordinate branch offices were formally announced on the afternoon of the 15th as follows: (1) He Jianyan, Director of the Chengxiang Branch Office. (2) Dong Fei, Director of the Mu瀆 Branch Office. (3) Dong Chonghua, Director of the Hushuiguan Branch Office. (4) Song Zidong, Director of the Huangdai Branch Office. (5) Gui Wanli, Director of the Weiting Branch Office. (6) Chen Jingbo, Director of the Xiangcheng Branch Office. (7) Luo Zhiping, Director of the Chen涇 Branch Office. (8) Zhu Shufan, Director of the Heng涇 Branch Office. Each branch office will also have a deputy director, who will be appointed by the Provincial Order at a later date. The collection of kind work must be completed by December 15.

### Danyang Self-Defense Force Training

### Eliminating an Evil in Punan, Notorious Bandit Lu Ajin is Arrested; He Once Served as an Enemy and Puppet Secret Agent, Poisoning the Local Community

[Report from our Songjiang office] Lu Aji, who was rampant in Punan, Songjin, and Fengyi during the period of occupation, was sentenced to life imprisonment in the 鉴河 监狱 before the War of Resistance. When the war broke out and Songjiang was occupied, the 监狱 seized the opportunity to escape back to his hometown. With the help of his sister, Mei Gao, he obtained a machine gun and several rifles, gathered bandits, and initially used the name of the guerrilla force to extort money, kill people, and set fires. The local people suffered countless losses. Later, he was suppressed by the 62nd Division of the National Army and joined the 13th Division of the puppet army, serving as the company commander of the machine gun company. Under the guise of 清鄉, the local people suffered again, and there are still lingering fears. After the 13th Division of the puppet army was reorganized, he joined Zhang's puppet police station as a secret agent. He became sworn brothers with Liu Guoqiang, the head of the puppet police station, and 巡官 陆振山, and worshiped the Japanese officer Watanabe as his adoptive father. He specialized in arresting and killing patriotic people, and there were quite a few of them. Last fall, after the victory of the War of Resistance, the bandit knew that his crimes were unforgivable and fled without a trace. Recently, the bandit, seeing that there was no movement, secretly returned home a few days ago. Unexpectedly, his evil deeds were full, and the Punan Tinglin Police Station learned of this and secretly sent squad leader Qiu and several others to capture the bandit at his home. A quick pistol and dozens of bullets were found on the bandit's body on the spot. The Tinglin Police Station prepared a document to transfer him to Songjiang and handed him over to the county government for interrogation. It has been found that the bandit accumulated a lot of wealth during the eight years of occupation and acquired more than a thousand acres of fertile land.

### A Rich Merchant's Estate, Women File Lawsuits

[Report from our Suzhou office] The late silk and cloth merchant Yao Junyu, during his lifetime, founded silk and cloth shops such as Qian Taixiang, Da Youheng, Xie Daixiang, and Xie Ji, and was a famous rich merchant in Suzhou. He had three sons and five daughters: the eldest son, Xuanyu; the second son, Jing 荣; the youngest son, Shuwei; daughters 绣梅 (married to Wu), 艳梅 (married to 荣), Mingmei, Qinmei, and 似英. Yao died of illness before the war and did not leave a will. In addition to the cloth shops, his estate also included Lifa Soap Factory, dozens of houses, Mobil Oil Company stocks, and farmland. During the period of occupation, the relatives discussed the analysis of the estate, but the result was abandoned due to the opposition of Xuanyu and others. After the victory last year, Qinmei requested an analysis of the estate because her marriage was approaching, but was again blocked by her brothers and sisters. Therefore, in June of this year, she filed a petition with the local court requesting that inheritance be ordered in accordance with the law. After repeated unsuccessful mediation by the Civil Court, the first hearing is scheduled for 9 a.m. on the 19th of this month. In addition to issuing summons to the plaintiff Yao Yanmei, the defendant Yao Xuanyu and his wife, and eight sisters, Yao's chief accountant Ma Yonghe, and the managers of the four major cloth shops, 史毓生, Shi Zisheng, Zhang Meisheng, and Wang Weibo, have also been summoned to testify in court.

[Report from our Changshu office] The only remaining Taiping Heavenly Kingdom document in this area, the "Bao'enfang Stele," has recently been rediscovered in the ruins of the county party headquarters. As early as the twelfth year of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the people of Yi built a Heavenly Dynasty archway outside the South Gate to commemorate Prince Zhong, Li Xiucheng. Today, the street name there is still called Heavenly Dynasty Archway, and the archway was named Bao'enfang. A stone stele was erected next to the archway, with the preface to the Bao'enfang Stele engraved on it. In the Qing Dynasty, the relics of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were almost completely destroyed. Only this stele was hidden by nearby houses and was not destroyed. In the early years of the Xuantong period, it was moved to the Rice Industry Primary School, and twenty-five years later, it was moved to the County Party Department. During the war, the buildings of the County Party Department were destroyed. Recently, the county government reorganized the ruins into a sports field, and it was discovered again.

### Xicheng District's Suppression Campaign is in Full Swing; Surrendered Bandits Are Willing to Enlist Remaining Gang Members; Counties in the Border Area of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Encircle and Suppress on Three Routes

[Report from our Wuxi office] Xu Yuanruo, the commander of the Wuxi sub-district of the Xicheng Joint Defense Zone, stated that Dongting, Anzhen, and Dangkou districts in eastern Wuxi have always been bandits' dens. Now that the suppression campaign is in full swing, in order to eradicate the source of bandits and appease the local area, he specially set out on the 15th with Chief Tang of the Civil Affairs Section of the County Government and his entourage to inspect the Xicang area, and summoned the former Civil Affairs Section Chief of the puppet Xidong County Government, Zeng Junfeng, who had already surrendered, to listen to a report on the bandit's work experience. Commander Xu greatly comforted him for Zeng Bandit's frank attitude and sincere words, and immediately appointed him as the Commissioner for Appeasement of Wuxi County to carry out appeasement work in order to achieve the mission of appeasement. There is also the female bandit Huang Suying, who has also been arrested. The female bandit directly admitted her guilt and expressed her willingness to accept appeasement and repent.

### Ministry of Finance Dispatches Personnel to Investigate Illegal Money Houses in Liuhe

### Taixing Provisional Assembly Accuses Former County Magistrate of Falsely Reporting Losses and Embezzling Requisitioned Property

[Our newspaper's Taixing dispatch] The Taixing county seat was breached by the Communist army, and shops and residences were looted. The losses suffered by government agencies were enormous. The provincial government, in order to investigate the disaster situation and local losses, dispatched personnel to conduct a detailed investigation and requested all agencies to submit reports. However, the former county magistrate, Xu Peiqi, reported losses of over 27 million yuan from the treasury. Later, local residents learned of this and were quite surprised. The county government was in arrears with various agencies and unable to meet its financial obligations. It had to borrow from local merchants to pay expenses. If the treasury had such a large sum, why borrow from merchants? The county provisional assembly sent a letter to the former county magistrate, requesting him to attend a public announcement. However, upon receiving the request, he dispatched Tang Mingxu, the chief of the Second Section, to represent him, claiming he would soon be relieved of his post. Tang's report on the losses was preposterous and the items did not match, further arousing suspicion. Local residents are now paying close attention to the falsified funds. The provisional assembly has filed a complaint with the inspector, the Judicial Yuan, and the administrative agencies, listing his crimes and embezzlement of requisitioned materials, such as over 1,000 dan (担, a unit of weight) of opium, hundreds of dan of wheat and rice, over 50 boxes of pig fat, over 400 newspapers from Hengqingchang and other stores, and hundreds of boxes of foreign goods and matches.

### Suzhou's Commerce Declines; Reputation as "Paradise" Difficult to Maintain; Wang Xiaolai Discusses Impressions in Suzhou

[Our newspaper's Suzhou 17th dispatch] Wang Xiaolai, the director of the National Federation of Commerce Preparatory Committee, and Fang Zhichao, the director of the Shanghai Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu's office, arrived in Suzhou together around 10:00 AM on the 17th to attend the inaugural meeting of the Shaoxing Seven Counties Suzhou Association. Wang and Fang delivered speeches, offering words of encouragement. After the meeting, this reporter interviewed Wang, who shared his impressions of Suzhou. He felt the general situation was good, but was deeply concerned about the decline of Suzhou's commerce after the war, which was vastly different from before the war. The crisis was pervasive, and if this continued, the commercial economy would soon collapse. The former reputation as a "paradise" could not be sustained. He stated that after the National Federation of Commerce is established, he will make suggestions and quickly seek relief measures. He also hopes that the relevant local authorities will quickly formulate concrete plans to rescue the situation. Wang also stated that the National Federation of Commerce has decided to be established in Nanjing on November 11th, and representatives from various regions are required to report to Nanjing by the 5th. Although the hidden crisis in industry and commerce is present everywhere, it is even more severe in Shanghai. A special economic committee has been established to coordinate rescue measures and is actively planning. In the afternoon, Wang inspected the Suzhou-Changzhou Highway and had the intention of raising funds to build the Suzhou-Jiaxing Highway to facilitate cargo transportation. He then toured famous scenic spots. That evening, he attended a banquet hosted by business leaders in the county and took the night express train to Nanjing to preside over the affairs of the National Federation of Commerce.

My Views on Repaying Long-Term Savings

Reading reports from various places about lawsuits concerning pre-war bank long-term deposits, which resulted in court judgments ordering banks to compensate depositors at a rate of one thousand times the original amount, I cannot help but feel moved. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, prices have skyrocketed, often several times a month, resulting in prices being thousands, if not tens of thousands, of times higher than before the war. As a result, salaried civil servants are struggling to survive. In light of this, the government has issued clear orders to increase salaries to a reasonable level. Since the victory, the price index has continued to rise daily, leading to adjustments every three months, as has been publicly announced. Furthermore, gold and foreign exchange, which are subject to government control, have continued to increase. As President Ju stated in response to inquiries from reporters in the capital, "Based on the price index, one thousand times is not an exaggeration. The value of rice, cloth, and other items has increased five thousand times, or even ten thousand times, compared to before the war." He continued, "This matter is of great importance and involves many issues. If it is not resolved, there will be many disputes when pre-war debts are repaid and long-term savings are withdrawn upon maturity. I have discussed this matter with Minister of Finance Yu, and we are currently discussing solutions."

President Ju is a legal authority, and his remarks are fair and accurate. I believe that the court's judgment of repaying pre-war deposits at a rate of one thousand times is a great loss to depositors. If depositors had not adhered to savings regulations and withdrawn their deposits to invest in other assets, the value would undoubtedly be four to five thousand times higher, if not tens of thousands of times higher. If banks repay pre-war savings at a rate of one thousand times, taking five thousand times as a minimum, would depositors not suffer a loss of more than four-fifths? Banks are the hub of finance, and bank staff are economic professionals. They cannot claim ignorance of the impact of deposits on depositors. Since they are aware of this, human conscience cannot be extinguished! As Mr. Zizhu said, "Two thousand yuan could buy a house before the war, but now it is not enough to buy four sheng (升, a unit of dry measure) of rice." I know that the officials in charge will not do this, nor will they bear to do it! The number of long-term savings depositors is not very large. Wealthy families do not make long-term deposits. Long-term depositors must be law-abiding citizens without speculative or get-rich-quick fantasies. They may be saving for their children's education, marriage, or for their own old age. It is not easy to raise funds at once, so they plan ahead, accumulating little by little over ten or twenty years. Therefore, pre-war long-term savings should be repaid to depositors at a rate of at least five thousand times to be fair. Even if banks suffer significant losses as a result, the government should openly withdraw enemy and puppet assets to compensate the banks. The devaluation of currency is due to enemy aggression. If the enemy had not launched an invasion, China's monetary system would be stable, and there would be no distinction between pre-war and post-war. Using enemy and puppet assets to compensate depositors for their losses is justified in principle. It is simply a matter of the banks handling the transfer of funds. Furthermore, regarding education expenses, the state provides public funding for poor students, and the cultivation of one student requires considerable state funds. Now, there are people who, with the ambition of self-reliance, make long-term savings to pay for their children's education expenses. I know that the government should commend them, not allow depositors to lose their support. Banks cannot be allowed to use unilateral reasons (assuming that commercial banks deposit 20% of their funds in the national treasury and cannot use them) to commit unconscionable acts. The people of China are sympathetic and speak out against injustice. I will speak out on behalf of all small depositors, sympathizing with the court's principle of repaying pre-war long-term savings at a rate of one thousand times, and advocating that the repayment amount should be at least five thousand times or seven thousand times. I also agree that the Chief Justice and the Minister of Finance should discuss solutions and issue a clear announcement as soon as possible to quell public anger. I look forward to this with great anticipation. (Zhou Zilu)

### Investigation into Göring's Suicide Completed, to Be Announced Today; Bodies of Eleven War Criminals Cremated and Secretly Buried

[Our newspaper's dispatch] London, 17th (broadcast from Nuremberg): The investigation into the truth of Göring's suicide has been completed, and the results will be announced today.

[Our newspaper's dispatch] Paris, 17th (emergency broadcast from Nuremberg): The bodies of the ten Nazi war criminals and Göring, who were hanged in Nuremberg Prison, have been cremated, and their ashes have been secretly scattered in various locations.

### Speculation on Source of Poison

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 17th] After Göring's suicide in prison, the authorities may summon many people to investigate how he obtained the poison. Göring's wife may also be summoned. She said goodbye to her husband in prison on October 7th. When she left the prison, her face was stern, but there were no tears in her eyes. Others who will be summoned include Göring's lawyer, Dr. Stahmer, Dr. Frucher, a German doctor who examined Göring under the supervision of an American doctor, and 27 German prison staff. These Germans had been thoroughly searched before entering the prison and had never left after entering. The poison Göring took must have been obtained recently, because if it had been hidden for a long time, the effect would not have been so rapid. Speculation abounds. Some say that Göring's wife may have given him the vial of poison when they kissed goodbye, or that the German barber may have secretly tucked the vial into his collar when he was giving Göring a haircut. However, according to prison authorities, no one has been arrested in connection with this case so far.

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 16th] Major Teich, an officer in the Nuremberg Court Security Department, said, "As far as I know, it is impossible that Göring received the poison from his wife. The last time Göring's wife met her husband was ten days ago. At that time, the two stood behind a thick sheet of glass, and Göring was also handcuffed. The two did not kiss. I believe Göring secretly hid the poison when he was arrested."

### Early Signs of Suicidal Thoughts

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 17th] According to an official at the Nuremberg Court, Göring made remarks related to suicide nine days before taking the poison. When asked to sign a document, Göring took off the paper clip and said, "It is best to take this back, lest the guard think I plan to use it to hang myself." Judging from other incidents, it can be proven that Göring's intention to commit suicide was decided when he heard the verdict of hanging, and he may have discussed the matter of taking poison with Ribbentrop during the trial. Since the sentencing, Göring's conversations with prison guards and his behavior have unconsciously revealed a certain idea in his mind. Dr. Gilbert, a prison psychologist, said that Göring was most unhappy about the rope after hearing the verdict, and later asked his defense lawyer to apply for a change to execution by firing squad. Then there was the humorous incident with the paper clip. Göring also revealed his fear of hanging during a conversation with Dr. Keller, the chief psychiatrist of the Nuremberg Tribunal. At the same time, the authorities ordered an officer of the U.S. Third Army, in a capacity unrelated to the case, to conduct an investigation into the Göring poison case. His report is expected to be submitted to the four-nation commission within two days.

### U.S. Prosecutor Advocates Continuing to Try German War Criminals

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th] Jackson, the prosecutor of the European International Military Tribunal, recently returned to the United States and submitted a lengthy report to President Truman, which has now been released by the White House. It advocates that the occupying countries in Germany should try the remaining German war criminals who escaped the net. The United States should immediately begin trying the unrepentant Nazi Party members, industrialists, soldiers, politicians, diplomats, and police in its occupied areas. According to Jackson, their crimes are no different from those of other war criminals who have already been sentenced.

[United Press, Berlin, 16th] The Allied military authorities announced today that the seven Nazi war criminals sentenced to imprisonment by the International Military Tribunal, namely Hess, Funk, Raeder, Schirach, Speer, Neurath, and Dönitz, will be imprisoned in Spandau Prison in the British-occupied sector of Berlin, because it is small and easy to defend. After the prisoners enter the prison, they will be guarded by an international guard. It will take about a month to prepare, but the date of their transfer from Nuremberg to Spandau Prison has not yet been determined.

### Southern Tribes Reach Compromise with Government; Internal Strife in Iran Ends; Bevin Guarantees Non-Interference in Iranian Internal Affairs, Expresses Strong Desire to Establish Friendly Relations Between the Two Countries

[United Press, Tehran, 17th] According to the official gazette published here today, the rebellion of the southern Iranian tribes against the Iranian government, which has lasted for several months, has agreed to stop, and the Iranian government has promised the tribes more representation in the Fars provincial government.

Both sides have agreed to increase the number of Fars provincial representatives in the parliament, extend the railway line to Fars province, pardon the rebel people, and select provincial government officials from the residents of Fars province.

[Reuters, London, 16th] Foreign Secretary Bevin, in the House of Commons, stated that recent events in Iran have affected British-Iranian relations. He said, "The British government solemnly declares without hesitation that the rumors that British officials in Iran secretly participated in a conspiracy against the Iranian government are completely unfounded. The British government is very willing to establish good relations with the Iranian government and is constantly improving them. Britain wants to see Iran prosperous, strong, independent, and free from foreign interference." Soviet newspapers and Iranian broadcasts have repeatedly publicized unfounded rumors about British officials. The British government will try to inform the Iranian people of the truth. Bevin added that recent unrest in southern Iran and the arrest of tribal leaders led the Iranian government, based on certain intelligence, to hastily claim that the British Consul in Ahvaz, Trolod, was complicit in the tribal rebellion. The British government, after investigation, proved that Trolod was innocent and informed the Iranian government, which accepted the British assurances. Therefore, this incident should be considered closed. The British government hereby declares that British diplomats and consuls in Iran have been ordered not to interfere in the country's internal affairs. The British government is very satisfied that British officials in Iran have not violated this directive.

### U.S. Government Suddenly Stops Economic Aid to Czechoslovakia

[United Press, Washington, 16th] The United States today suddenly stopped the $90 million economic aid program to Czechoslovakia, apparently out of anger, because Czechoslovakia supported the Soviet Union at the Paris Peace Conference in accusing the United States of attempting to economically enslave Europe. The State Department took the following actions immediately after the end of the conference: (1) The $40 million loan granted to Czechoslovakia this spring, which was mainly used to purchase surplus U.S. Army and Navy assets, totaling $50 million, was canceled. Goods worth $10 million had already been shipped and were allowed to be delivered. (2) The Czechoslovak government's negotiations with the U.S. Export-Import Bank for a $50 million loan were indefinitely suspended.

### Interior Minister's Overt Declaration of Turkey's Determination to Resist Aggression During Eastern Tour; Su Bao Refutes Absurd Claims of Building Defenses Along the Turkish Border

[Ankara, United Press, 16th] Turkish Interior Minister Sokman 修, while inspecting the eastern provinces, stated in a speech in Oçîren today: "If we are attacked, all freedom-loving nations in the world will side with us, and any invading nation daring to act unjustly will meet the same fate as Germany and Italy."

It is widely believed that the reply will reiterate Turkey's position.

[Moscow, United Press, 16th] A Reuters correspondent reported that the Soviet Union has taken large-scale military measures along the Turkish border. The Soviet magazine "New Era" refuted this today, deeming it wishful thinking and suggesting that the correspondent would be better off spending their time reporting on their own country's military actions abroad.

### Soviet Union Announces New Budget with Scientific Research Funding Increased to £200 Million; News and Truth Newspapers Publish Appreciative Comments

[Moscow, United Press, 16th] The Soviet government announced its new budget today, in which funding for scientific research has been increased to approximately £200 million, while defense spending has been reduced to approximately £3.432 billion, calculated at pre-war exchange rates. Soviet newspapers have expressed praise for this. "News" published an editorial on its front page stating: "The development of scientific research funding has greatly increased, approximately 32.4 times that of last year. Stalin stated before the elections in February this year: 'We not only need to catch up with foreign scientific achievements in the shortest possible time, but also surpass them.' This statement has been put into practice. In the future, special attention should be paid to the large-scale construction of various scientific research institutes." "Truth" stated: "For the past five years, our country has survived on a military budget. All national resources and the full strength of the people have been directed towards a single goal: to defeat the hateful enemy. Huge amounts of materials have been controlled by the state and used for the front lines; the new budget reflects the new tasks of the new era. In 1946, the Soviet Union is concentrating most of its resources on rebuilding war-torn areas and restoring pre-war industrial and agricultural levels."

### U.S. Naval and Air Forces in Japan Conduct Landing Exercise

[Chigasaki, United Press, 17th] U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force today jointly dispatched 1,000 troops to conduct a landing exercise on the beach here (southwest of Yokohama). The United Nations originally planned to attack the Japanese mainland in May of this year, with a landing planned at this location.

U.S. Eighth Army Commander Lieutenant General Eichelberger stated that this is the largest exercise in the Pacific since the war.

### "Bat" Bomb with Radar Nose Can Automatically Search for Enemy Ships; U.S. Navy Aircraft Conduct Exercise Test Launch

[Chincoteague, Virginia, United Press, 16th] Radar-guided glide bombs, hailed as the vanguard of future weapons, were exercised by the U.S. Navy near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina today. This was the first glide bomb launched to attack a fleet. The bomb, weighing 1,000 pounds, is attached to the belly of a "Bat." Launched from a fighter or patrol aircraft, the "Bat" glides in the air for more than ten miles in search of its target. The "Bat" is equipped with radar in its nose, enabling it to automatically search for enemy ship movements and correct errors caused by aiming and wind. This type of bomb was tested on Japanese ships a few months before the end of the Pacific War with considerable success. Currently, four-engine patrol bomber squadrons are learning to use it here.

### Japanese Chieftains Repeatedly Delayed Promise to Attack Soviet Union from the East

Soviet Presentation of German Documents

[Tokyo, United Press, 17th] The Soviet side presented evidence at the International Tribunal today stating that Japanese diplomats and military personnel had assured Germany that Japan would immediately respond in the East as soon as Hitler launched a blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union in the West, despite the Soviet-Japanese neutrality treaty. However, they later failed to fulfill this promise. The Soviet prosecutor presented a secret telegram from former Nazi Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima, dated July 5, 1941, at a time when Hitler's troops had already begun attacking the Soviet Union. The purpose of this telegram was clearly to exert pressure on the Japanese government to fulfill its promise to attack the Soviet Union from the East. Other evidence presented by the Soviet Union showed that the Japanese side repeatedly delayed, claiming that the Japanese army needed more time to prepare.

### Siam to Use Return of Territory as Principle for Negotiations with France

[Bangkok, Reuters, 16th] Siamese Foreign Minister Charoon, in an exclusive interview with a Reuters reporter, stated that the Siamese government has been authorized by the parliament to conduct Franco-Siamese negotiations based on the French proposal. Yesterday's resolution by the parliament does not mean that the government has fully accepted the French proposal, but only accepts the principle of returning the four provinces as a basis for seeking a final solution.

### British Youth, a Sadistic Killer of Young Women, Hanged

### U.S. Army Air Force Announces 3,000 Existing Flying Fortresses

New Giant B-50 Aircraft Under Development

[Washington, United Press, 17th] The U.S. Army Air Force announced today that it currently has 3,040 B-29 Flying Fortresses ready for combat, a larger number than at the end of the war.

According to the wartime contract of 1944, the last aircraft was delivered in June of this year, and there are currently no contracts in place. The Army Air Force's current plan is to focus on the larger B-35 and B-36 aircraft. In addition, it will manufacture the B-50 aircraft (an improved version of the B-29 aircraft), with a larger tail and engines, which can increase the flight range and speed.

### American Southern Many Missionaries (Part 1) A Sea of Farewells, All Waiting for Ships to Return to China

— (Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing)

[New York, Airmail, September 15] The South, the scenic American South, is not only the production area of cotton and tobacco, but also the hometown of missionaries. Walking on the streets of New York and Chicago, occasionally groups of three or five veterans will come up to you and say something like "Ding Hao" or "Good Weather" in Chinese. These people are considered Americans who have "drunk seawater," and they have a heroic pride revealed in northern society; but in the South, Americans who can speak, understand, and write Chinese are not a big deal. This group of people are missionaries. When I went to Tennessee to visit the TVA, I suddenly had a toothache on the train. As soon as I arrived in Knoxville, the first thing I did was visit an elderly dentist in his sixties. In the waiting room, I sat reading the newspaper. A kind old lady leaned over and gently asked me, "What is your surname?"

I was startled and shook her hand. She said that her name was "Mrs. Tu," and her husband was currently in China. Before the Chinese War of Resistance, both she and her husband were missionaries for the China Inland Mission in Changde, Hunan. She returned to the United States during the war and is now waiting for a ship to return to China. She said that she loved Changde more than her hometown in Tennessee, "but China lacks science and industry. So before leaving, I need to check my body. If my teeth are bad, I should have them extracted to avoid getting sick after returning to China." I asked her how to spell Mr. Tu's English name. She said very simply in Chinese, "Just call me Mrs. Tu. I like Chinese characters." She started demonstrating with a pencil in the waiting room, and many southern people with a "rural" flavor stretched their necks to look at her. In Knoxville, the most "qualified" missionaries besides Mrs. Tu were Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton. I met him at the only Chinese laundry in Knoxville. He saw my laundry ticket, reached out his hand, and said, "Are you Mr. Mao? It's an honor to meet you." He saw my name in the local newspaper. He wrote the three Chinese characters "Hai Mo-deng." In fact, his original English name was Hamilton, exactly the same name as the American statesman Hamilton whom the Father of the Nation mentioned in the Three Principles of the People when discussing the founding of America. When he was preaching in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, a Chinese friend gave him the name Hai Mo-deng. He said, "From then on, my surname is Hai, and my son's surname is also Hai." That night, Mr. Hamilton brought a very beautiful young lady to pick me up for a discussion at a relative's home. On the way, I asked him, "When are you returning to China?" He said he was leaving soon, "but the red bandits are very rampant near Xuzhou." His daughter then asked, "What are red bandits?" Hamilton patiently told her, "Bandits are robbers, and red in Chinese characters means the color red. Therefore, in Chinese, we don't call them the Communist Party, we call them red bandits." He added, "Because the Communist Party has no religion, no spiritual life, and no moral values, so we generally call them bandits." The educational spirit of this foreign pastor moved his daughter, and she nodded frequently. At that day's

family discussion, Hamilton introduced me to many old ladies and several retired pastors. Hamilton's wife and son were also present. Her Chinese was even better than her husband's. She asked me to write the characters for "cat" and "horse" for many devout old ladies to admire. At least, in the eyes of this group of old ladies, Mrs. Hamilton was the "hero" in their minds. Hamilton spoke a long farewell in English, thanking them for their farewells. He said, "This time I go to China, although Xuzhou, Jiangsu, is surrounded by the Communist Party, although my life is in danger, although China's economy is very difficult; but for the Lord, for Jesus Christ, I must go bravely." He also said, "A truly devout disciple of the Lord must have the faith to face life and death. This time I go to Xuzhou, maybe I won't come back, maybe I'll never see you again, but my heart is very calm, all for the Lord!" Everyone around was very quiet, and Miss Mary, who often had a smile on her face (Hamilton's daughter), also stared intently.

### Old Executioner Has Killed Over 200 People

According to a U.S. soldier friend, Woods is not tall, but very sturdy, with brown hair and a receding hairline.

### Grain Loan Case Offenders Transferred to District Attorney's Office Yesterday, Detained After Afternoon Interrogation, Wang Daren and Ren Xingya Were Calm During Transfer, Whole Case to be Expedited for Closure

[Our Newspaper's Report] The grain loan embezzlement case has been recently approved by Chairman 將 and transferred to the judicial authorities for trial. After receiving the order, the Garrison Headquarters transferred the six key offenders in the case, Wang Daren, Ren Xingya, Wang Xunzhi, Wu Rong-sheng, Zhuang Hanzhang, and Wang Meile, along with all case files and account books, who were detained in the headquarters' detention center, to the District Attorney's Office for handling yesterday morning.

At 9:40 am, Wang and the others were escorted onto a red-headed, black-bodied prison van, which also contained more than a dozen petty thieves and burglars. The Garrison Headquarters dispatched a platoon leader from the Special Service Company, Wang Huadong, leading eight soldiers fully armed for escort.

The prison van arrived at the entrance of the District Attorney's Office at 10:55 am. The petty thieves and burglars got off the van first, followed by the grain case offenders, with Wang Daren bringing up the rear. Wang was wearing a dark blue Zhongshan suit, holding a briefcase, as fat as before, with a very good complexion. Ren Xingya was small and thin, wearing a gray suit, smiling with his teeth showing. Wang Xunzhi and the others were all wearing Chinese clothing, with indifferent expressions. After getting out of the van, Ren frequently nodded to people, with an extremely calm attitude. The offenders then walked into the hall, where personnel from the District Attorney's Office sequentially asked them their age, origin, and address, and then pressed their fingerprints before sending them to the detention center for detention.

In the afternoon, Prosecutor Wu Qihua, who had just returned to Shanghai from Nanjing, opened the court for investigation. It is reported that this case has been delayed for a long time and will be expedited.

### Holds a High Position in Political Circles, Memorized Names of Over 100,000 People

Farley's stay in Shanghai and plans will be decided based on circumstances. He told reporters that if time permits, he may host a press conference. The main task of this visit is to inspect the company's business. Although he has now abandoned politics for business, he is still very active on the American political stage, so this trip may involve political relations. After a brief stay in Shanghai, he will go to Tokyo to inspect the company's business. It has not yet been decided whether he will go to Nanjing. Farley holds a very high position in American political circles. President Roosevelt relied heavily on his efforts during his four election campaigns. He is intelligent and capable, and he also has a special talent, that is, he can remember the names of people he meets once. He can name more than 100,000 people in England.

Farley came to Shanghai alone this time, without a secretary. He will stay at the Cathay Hotel. Yesterday, he was invited by U.S. Consul General Davies for a welcome dinner. Mayor Wu will host a banquet for Farley at his private residence on Anfu Road at 8 pm tonight, accompanied by the two Davieses.

[Our Newspaper's Report] At 6:35 am yesterday, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway's down-bound 92nd train, with first, second and third class cars, totaling eleven carriages, was traveling from Jiaxing to Shanghai.

### Wu Yifang on the New Woman

"An exemplary woman should be the center of the family, a good citizen, and a success in her career."

[Our Newspaper's Special] Female educator Dr. Wu Yifang, President of Ginling College, specially rushed to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday to give a lecture at the invitation of the American Women's Association of this city.

Dr. Wu wore a purplish-brown long-sleeved cheongsam, black leather shoes, and her hair was braided in a bun behind her head. She looked energetic, and no one would believe that she was over fifty years old.

At 4 pm yesterday, Dr. Wu raised the following question to dozens of American women at 133 Yuanmingyuan Road. She said: People often say, "Studying is a waste for women. Once they get married, everything is over." How can we correct this erroneous view? — Only by using women's own power to fight for a legal status.

What is the status of women in the new China? Dr. Wu divided it into three aspects: (1) Status in the family — Historical examples tell people that women and family seem to be inseparable forever, so people generally say, "In the end, you always get married, why study?" In fact, even in the family, the status of women is still very important. There is an old Chinese saying: "See what a child will be at three, see what they will be at nine." It can be seen how important education is in childhood. A woman who has received higher education must be the center of the family, providing her children with an excellent environment. It is not enough to simply beautify children's clothing; it is necessary to cultivate one's children into sound citizens, healthy, resilient, with nationalistic ideas and a national outlook. (2) Status in society — In addition to being the center of the family, the new woman should broaden her horizons and become a member of society. China will soon implement constitutional government, and one should also take a strong interest in and actively participate in the election of National Assembly representatives. (3) Career — How to choose a career for women? Dr. Wu said: "Don't choose a career that is showy, easy, or profitable. The secret to success in a career lies in interest. Choose a career that suits your interests, so that you can do it with all your heart and soul. Generally speaking, social services, education, medical services, and law are more suitable for women, because women are careful, cautious, and have compassion. And past facts tell us that men and women are completely equal in intelligence. As long as we are willing to work hard, we are not afraid of not succeeding."

Finally, Dr. Wu said excitedly: "This is the time, women should work hard. In the process of rebuilding China, the power of women is indispensable. We must enrich ourselves and prepare to exert our strength! Marriage should no longer be the end of a woman's career, but a beginning. We must continue to move forward. An exemplary woman should be the center of the family, a good citizen, and also a success in her career!"

Dr. Wu's lecture ended in applause. The Chinese and foreign guests who attended the meeting rushed to shake hands and greet her. In the midst of the chaos, the reporter frequently asked about the recent situation of Ginling Women's University, and learned that Ginling College has been steadily holding classes. Because the school's equipment suffered the ravages of war, it is still simple and crude after the resumption of the school. Therefore, it feels inconvenient everywhere. But the spirit of the teachers and students is commendable. They wash their faces with cold water and sleep on hard floors, but no one complains! After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Dr. Wu's first thing was to go to the China Travel Service to inquire whether the scientific instruments ordered from the United States had arrived. Dr. Wu was very happy to tell the reporter that "The instruments have all arrived, they arrived two months ago, and they can be transported to Nanjing immediately, so the students can use them." Her enthusiasm for running the school seriously aroused my infinite respect! The students of Ginling College are happy. Because they have such an excellent president!

### The Two Roads Corruption Case: After Six Hours of Trial and Debate, Sentencing Set for the Morning of the 24th; Accused Confront Each Other, Revealing Ugly Behavior; Merchants All Confess to Borrowing Money; Yu Xiangyan Demands Changes to Recorded Testimony, Leading to Arguments

[Report from This Newspaper] The major corruption case at the Materials Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration, after its preliminary hearing on the 20th of last month, was originally scheduled for a second hearing on the 1st of this month. However, due to the presiding judge, Mei Erhe, falling ill, it was postponed until yesterday for the opening of the debate. All thirty-six accused, including detained Railway Administration employees and implicated managers and assistant managers of various commercial firms, as well as Ding Shuhui, former Deputy Director of the Materials Department, and Lu Runbao, wife of Zhang Bokang, appeared in court. Twenty-two defense lawyers for the accused and more than thirty reporters from various newspapers were present, causing the public gallery to be overcrowded. The trial began at 9:25 AM and concluded at 3:50 PM. After the accused confronted each other and the defense lawyers of each defendant presented their arguments in turn, the presiding judge announced the conclusion of the debate and set the sentencing for the morning of the 24th of this month. Unexpectedly, as Judge Mei finished speaking, Yu Zongluo, the defense lawyer for Yu Zhonglu, manager of Shengchang Hardware Store, suddenly stood up from the left side of the defendant's lawyers' seats and shouted, "The right to the final debate in this case belongs to the prosecutor!" The entire court was shocked. According to Article 283 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the right to the final debate in a criminal case should belong to the defendant. Although Judge Mei explained in court that the prosecutor's statement was supplementary and not a debate, more than twenty defense lawyers still argued amongst themselves. At this time, Yu Xiangyan also demanded to correct the testimony record, leading to an argument with the recorder. Simultaneously, family members of another defendant also took the opportunity to demand bail for their relative, crying and causing a commotion, making it almost impossible to maintain order in the court. The six-hour "fatigue trial" concluded in this chaos.

### A Dense Mass of Heads in the Defendant's Dock

Yesterday, due to the debate, the lawyers arrived in court unusually early. At 9:25 AM, the bailiff shouted, "Court is now in session," and Judge Mei Erhe and the prosecutor filed out, followed by the court clerk. Subsequently, the defendants Zhang Hongtu, Yu Xiangyan, Jing Weijun, Wang Renmao, Chen Jingyao, Zhu Biwen, Zhang Kaiyuan, Zhang Zelong, Zhu Peizong, Gu Zhenmin, Yu Peien, Xia Dingwu, Sun Xuesan, Xu Chuangui, Cai Zhidao, He Zuen, Li Jie, and merchants Yu Zhonglu, Shi Qingxiang, Li Fenbin, Jin Yunting, Li Binfen, Wang Yunxian, Wu Lianqing, Shi Yaoting, Yang Wenli, Shen Liansheng, Zhou Jinhua, Xu Binghong, Yu Yifu, Li Xingxin, Shen Huixiang, Xin Dingfu, and thirty-six others, were brought to court by the bailiffs and stood in three rows in the defendant's dock. After Judge Mei called out each name one by one, he first questioned Shi Qingxiang, a hardware merchant who had not been present at the preliminary hearing, and then confronted Jing Weijun, a Railway Administration employee who handled the receipt of commissions. Jing Weijun suddenly denied receiving money and giving gifts, while the managers of various commercial firms confessed to borrowing money, creating contradictions in their testimonies.

### Zhang Bokang and Zhang Hongtu Confront Each Other in Court

Then, Zhang Bokang and Zhang Hongtu were brought in for confrontation. Zhang Bokang testified: "Before December 20th of last year, one morning, I went to Director Zhang's house and delivered one million yuan of bribes, including 400,000 yuan in cash and 600,000 yuan in checks. Zhang Hongtu did not want the checks and kept the cash." Zhang Hongtu said, "Last December, when the Railway Administration first took over, the work was busy, so I went to the office every morning, regardless of holidays or weekends. Zhang Bokang's claim that he came to my house to see me in the morning is inaccurate, which shows that it is fabricated." He also presented four rebuttals: (1) Zhang Bokang was introduced to the Railway Administration by me. If there was collusion and corruption, I could have taken advantage of it. Why would I repeatedly request to replace him? (2) Yu Xiangyan is not a Railway Administration employee and cannot advise on Materials Department affairs, let alone distribute commissions. (3) I never authorized the receipt of commissions when purchasing materials. This can be investigated. (4) According to everyone's testimony, I was in Hangzhou and had not returned when the commission distribution method was determined, so I could not have participated.

### Two Wives Face Off

Lu Jian, Zhang Bokang's wife, and Yu Xiangyan were brought in for confrontation. Lu Jian denied that her husband's defense lawyer, Wang Xiaowen, was hired by Chen Bozhuang, and that Chen Bozhuang was willing to bear the future education expenses of Zhang Bokang's children. Yu Xiangyan insisted on his claim. Another witness, Deputy Director Ding Houfu, stated that although he was the Deputy Director, the Director had all the power, and he knew nothing.

The debate began at around 11:00 AM. Prosecutor Quan explained regarding Yu Xiangyan that Yu had evaded arrest after the case was exposed and could not be considered as voluntarily surrendering. He stated that the confessions of various accused regarding the acceptance of commissions and other criminal acts were all instructed by Yu. Yu's defense lawyer, Zhu Kuangming, argued that the prosecutor had no concrete evidence of Yu Xiangyan's corruption and that it was not sufficient to establish a case. He also stated that the confessions of the accused could not prove that the defendant had committed any actual criminal acts. Zhang Bokang's defense lawyer, Yu Chengxiu, also argued that the defendant was indeed an "honest man," as the Railway Administration's official letter to the District Procuratorate stated that Zhang Bokang was loyal and honest, and that Zhang Bokang had indeed contributed to the exposure of the case and the understanding of the truth. Subsequently, the lawyers present in court completed their arguments one after another.

### After Six Hours of Trial, the Conclusion of the Debate is Announced

Prosecutor Quan Gang stood up to supplement, dividing his arguments into two aspects: facts and law. In terms of facts, all merchants had admitted to Jing Weijun borrowing money, with one firm reaching over seven million, which shows that such a large amount was not an ordinary gift. He also stated that the prosecution had used very few confessions from the accused while they were in the Railway Administration, but had used more self-confessions, because self-confessions are more reliable. As for the legal aspect, the use of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption was very much in line with the spirit of the legislation, and merchants should bear legal responsibility and cannot be measured by past customs. At this point, the court announced the conclusion of the trial, which aroused dissatisfaction among the defense lawyers. At this time, judges and lawyers, after more than six hours of continuous debate and questioning, were exhausted, and the defendants could no longer stand. The trial ended there.

### A New Means of Transportation: Three-Wheeled Automobiles Will Appear in Shanghai; Passengers Can Hire Them Along the Way

It is reported that several rickshaw companies and three-wheeled vehicle manufacturing companies in this city, anticipating the possibility of being banned by the authorities, have changed their approach and ordered a large number of three-wheeled automobiles from abroad to Shanghai to organize a three-wheeled automobile rental company for business. It is said that the original price of these three-wheeled automobiles is about 400 US dollars per vehicle, plus tariffs and freight, totaling about 430 US dollars, equivalent to more than 1.5 million legal currency. These vehicles can travel 75 miles per gallon of gasoline and can carry three ordinary passengers. It is also reported that the capital of the three-wheeled automobile company, which is about to be established, will be approximately 300 to 500 million yuan. In the future, after its official establishment, the business method will be similar to renting three-wheeled vehicles. The daily rental fee will be determined by the numbers indicated on the newly installed "taximeter" on the vehicle, and there will be no branch stations like those of automobile rental companies. They will also park at designated parking areas in transportation hubs, just like operating three-wheeled vehicles.

### A Parricide Case Causes a Sensation in Beixinjing; Neighbor Proclaims Old Father Kicked to Death

[Report from This Newspaper] Ma Atao, a 56-year-old villager from Majiazhai Township in Beixinjing, northwest of Shanghai, had a son named Shunyu, 32 years old, who was disobedient and unfilial. He not only refused to listen to his father's teachings but also resorted to beating him, causing a breakdown in their father-son relationship. The day before yesterday, they argued again over a minor matter, and Shunyu punched his father repeatedly and kicked him violently. Ma was unable to resist and was kicked in the abdomen, causing him to fall to the ground in extreme pain and die shortly afterward. After the incident, Ma Shunyu hastily prepared a coffin for burial, attempting to conceal this monstrous crime, but as he was preparing for the burial, neighbors, spurred by a sense of justice, secretly reported it to the Beixinjing Sub-bureau. The sub-bureau immediately dispatched officers to the scene to stop the burial, arrested the unfilial son, and took him to the station for interrogation. At the same time, the body was sent by car to the morgue on Changde Road for examination, where it was found to have numerous injuries. This tragic case of parricide has already caused a sensation in the town. It is reported that the perpetrator confessed immediately after being arrested and was transferred to the District Procuratorate for legal action yesterday afternoon.

### Bandit Hides Hand Grenades; Arrested Again as Soon as He Leaves Prison

[Report from This Newspaper] On April 25th of this year, military police, acting on a tip-off, went to room 204 of Jisheng Inn, No. 196 Fujian Road, and arrested five bandits, including Zhang Fugeng. After the police station investigated and confirmed the facts, they were transferred to the court for trial and were sentenced to imprisonment. After Zhang Fugeng was released from prison a few days ago, he suddenly went to Jisheng Inn yesterday morning, claiming that he had hidden something in the room and wanted to go inside to retrieve it. However, since there were lodgers in the room at the time, the tea server told him to come again in the afternoon. Zhang did return at the appointed time and secretly dug up the floor in the room, took out a hidden hand grenade, and intended to take it elsewhere. The tea server discovered it, fearing an accident, and secretly reported it to the police station, which arrested Zhang and the evidence and took them to the station for interrogation.

### The Land Administration and Health Committees of the City Council Held Their Second Meetings Yesterday Afternoon

Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, Hu Wenyuan, Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, and He Zhifu of the Xingye Trust Company were present.

It was decided to revise and pass it. In addition, a temporary motion was passed, requesting the municipal government to calculate all rents for housing leases in legal currency.

[Another Report] The Health Committee of the City Council also held its second meeting at the City Council at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than ten people, including Pang Jingzhou, attended.

According to research results, primary schools can charge 2,000 yuan per person, middle schools can charge 3,000 yuan per person, and private schools can charge an additional 50%. Subsequently, the discussion of three temporary motions began.

### The Shortage of Electricity Generation Reaches a Serious Stage; Factories Take Turns Shutting Down

[Report from This Newspaper] Mr. Ledlow Aird, manager of the French-Chinese Water and Electricity Company in this city, announced yesterday that the shortage of electricity generation in the company has reached a serious stage, and with winter approaching, electricity consumption is bound to increase. Therefore, all factory users must stop using electricity between 5:00 PM and 10:00 PM every day. The company also sent a letter to all residential users, urging them to save electricity as much as possible. Mr. Ledlow said that in the former French Concession area, electricity consumption has recently increased by more than 80% compared to before.

Mayor Wu invited the conveners of various committees of the City Council to dinner the day before yesterday to discuss the matter of saving electricity. The consensus was that the current electricity consumption of residents accounts for only a small portion of the city's total consumption, and electricity consumption has been reduced to the lowest level, so it should not be reduced further. Therefore, no decision was made at that time, and it will be discussed again at the Public Utilities Bureau meeting next week.

The Heaviest Burden at Twilight

Mr. Farrah, general manager of the Shanghai Power Company, also doubts whether this method of saving electricity by users will help the city's electricity situation. If the electricity consumption of each residential user is reduced by 20%, then the situation in the former French Concession and Zhabei can be improved because most of the users are residential. However, it will not help the Shanghai Power Company. The current lack of power generation is not due to a lack of fuel, but because the power company's power generation capacity cannot bear the burden at a certain time of day. The most difficult time for the Shanghai Power Company now is from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM. In order not to exceed the company's maximum load, many factories have to shut down during this hour.

Reducing electricity consumption by 20% for residential users can only save 2.5% of the company's total electricity consumption. Moreover, if users are only asked to reduce electricity consumption, the time when users reduce consumption may be late at night, rather than the twilight when it is most necessary to save.

Factory Power Outage Times in Various Districts

Regarding factory electricity consumption, three methods are still used: rotational power outages, daily power outages, and emergency power outages. In the Shanghai Power Company area, the yarn mills are divided into six groups, with daily power outages. Two groups are from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, two groups are from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM, and two groups are from 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM. At the same time, each group takes turns having a full-day power outage within six days, from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Small factories have been divided into six groups for rotational power outages since the day before yesterday. Factories in the Zhabei area have adopted two types of power outages: rotational power outages and emergency power outages. In the Huashang Pudong Er Company area, all factories will have a power outage from 5:30 PM to 9:30 PM every day.

### The Joint Celebration of New and Old Directors of the Shanghai North Second District Fire Brigade

In the Zhabei District of this city, as early as the late Qing Dynasty, local gentry organized the Shanghai Commercial Fire Brigade. After repeated wars, the only surviving fire brigade in North Shanghai was the Second Volunteer Fire Brigade of the North Shanghai District. Fortunately, the association was still there, but it was full of holes and the losses were untrue. In June of this year, after the association worked hard, and under very difficult material conditions, it managed to recover. At 6 PM the day before yesterday, a joint celebration of new and old directors was held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. More than 50 people attended, including Xi Yushu, Zheng Ziliang, Ye Binyong (representative of the Fire Department of the Municipal Police Bureau), etc. Chen Weihan, executive director of the North Shanghai Fire Brigade United Association, attended the meeting as the temporary chairman and immediately invited Pan Gongzhan to be the honorary chairman, Xi Wangshu and Yin Tiyang to be the chairman and vice chairman, Zhao Junhao to be the executive director, Chen Zhengrui and Yang Qingpan to be supervisors, Qu Shichang and Zhang Nanbao to be economic directors, Zhou Dongming, Huang Jiping and Rao Siyan to be social directors, Xu Shaotang to be the director of the association, and Ni Runsen to be the deputy director.

### Deeply Afraid of Causing Trouble, But Trouble Still Occurs; Legs Broken Under Police Car

[Report from This Newspaper] In front of the Asia Company at the intersection of Zhongshan East 1st Road and Zhongzheng Road, at about 5:00 PM yesterday, a tram of a certain French company was parked there. Subsequently, a US Army jeep, number 41533, also blocked it from behind. At the same time, a British Company tram, number 737, was traveling north from the south and approached the jeep. At that time, traffic police officer Zhang Zhengmin (31 years old, from Anhui), number 1763, saw the situation and was deeply afraid of causing trouble, so he hurried up to watch. Unexpectedly, he was knocked to the ground by the British Company tram number 737, which did not brake in time, breaking both legs. After being sent to the hospital for treatment, the doctor said that the policeman's legs had to be amputated and he would become disabled.

### Study the Establishment of a "Municipal Court" to Resolve Housing Lease Disputes; Prevent Unscrupulous People from Manipulating and Profiteering; Those Who Forcibly Occupy Houses Will Have Nowhere to Hide

[Report from This Newspaper] Mayor Wu told reporters yesterday that the municipal government is currently studying the establishment of a "Municipal Court" specializing in handling housing lease disputes in order to completely eliminate the practice of demanding key money and raising rents when leasing houses. He also hired Mr. Hoyer Millick, former Chief Justice of the US Court in China, as a legal advisor. Hoyer Millick is currently a legal advisor to Mobil Oil Company, and he stayed in China for a long time before the war and is very familiar with the situation in Shanghai and Chinese law.

The court will formulate various clear regulations to prevent unscrupulous people from manipulating and profiteering by renting. After the court is established, all rental disputes can be effectively resolved. According to municipal government regulations, for all pre-war old tenants whose houses were occupied by the enemy and who still live in them after the war, their original lease is still valid.

Mayor Wu said that the housing problem in this city is indeed very difficult, and it will still take some time to resolve it. The biggest problem a month ago was the houses left behind after the withdrawal of enemy aliens. Before the establishment of the Housing Allocation Committee, many people were illegally forcibly occupying them. After the establishment of the Municipal Court, the ruling can be enforced and evacuated within one month.

### Measures to Eliminate Funeral Homes and Limit Coffin Storage, Requiring Separate Burial by Year's End

After the war, our city was once nearly an isolated island. The coffins of deceased citizens were transported out of the city, leading to significant operational challenges. Businessmen seized the opportunity to establish funeral homes, often hastily constructing buildings on rented land, which had a significant impact on hygiene. The Health Bureau has drafted six measures to address this: (1) Immediately announce a deadline for all coffins to be separately buried or transported to their ancestral homes by the end of the year; (2) Each funeral home should promptly notify the families of the deceased to comply with the deadline; (3) During the clearance period, the deceased should be buried within one month of encoffining; (4) The Health Bureau will send personnel to investigate the number of coffins stored in each funeral home, accurately determine the quantity, and mark them as substandard or unclaimed to prioritize cremation; (5) Each funeral home should report the number of coffins relocated for burial or transported back to their ancestral homes to the Health Bureau every ten days; (6) In addition to the existing Hami Road crematorium, the Health Bureau will temporarily designate additional cremation sites in consultation with the Land Administration Bureau.

### Hidaka Tomiaki Testifies in Court Yesterday, Exposing German-Japanese Conspiracy Against the Allied Nations

Cooperation between the two countries continued until Japan's surrender

The trial of twenty-seven Nazi war criminals continued yesterday in the U.S. military court. Lieutenant Colonel Hidaka Tomiaki, former head of the Japanese Intelligence Department in North China, testified, exposing the German-Japanese conspiracy against the Allied nations. After Germany's surrender, the Japanese military suffered successive defeats. They also had two major concerns: one was the fear that the U.S. military would transfer troops from the Western Front to the Pacific and the Philippines, posing a greater threat to the Japanese army; the other was anxiety about the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan, which would affect the Japanese army's operations in North China. Hidaka Tomiaki, who was in charge of intelligence work in North China, maintained close contact with various staff members of the Ohlert spy network. The main figures in North China intelligence were the Germans Kuhlsaat and Panla. After Germany's surrender, the Japanese were deeply worried. One evening, Hidaka Tomiaki met with Kuhlsaat, who believed that, based on the Potsdam Conference, the Soviet Union would likely maintain its consistent policy in the near future and would not join the Allied nations in fighting Japan. Moreover, the Soviet troops on the Western Front were currently being demobilized in large numbers, so the Far Eastern war situation was expected to remain largely unchanged. Kuhlsaat also told Hidaka Tomiaki that, according to the information they had obtained, the U.S. military's troop movements to the Pacific might end within two months, at which time they would pose a great threat to the Japanese army in the Pacific. The Japanese military at the time attached great importance to this intelligence, even studying the news from the Associated Press, United Press, and other news agencies in detail, believing that they might uncover behind-the-scenes political news. German-Japanese cooperation never ceased for a single day until Japan's surrender. This group, which used the consulate as a haven, ended its dream of attacking the Allied nations.

### A Lady is Raising Funds for a Nursery, But Lacks Suitable Housing

Hoping Enthusiastic People will Help Sponsor this Righteous Cause

My sense of responsibility prompts me to help her make an appeal to the enthusiastic people in the community, in order to jointly complete this good deed, so that the sisters in this city can get the opportunity to entrust their children as soon as possible.

All report data will be submitted to the Textile Management Committee for research, so as to determine the entire countermeasure. It is heard that Mayor Wu once stated that the distribution price of cotton yarn in the future will be determined as far as possible without rigid regulations.

The situation of the government bond is the same as the previous day, and the transaction is still more than 4 million yuan. The money industry has supply and the silk industry bank has demand, and the situation is still peaceful. Tong Bing opened at 1,980 yuan in the morning, and the high price did not exceed the 2,000 yuan mark, and it fell back to 1,860 yuan, and the closing price stood above 1,900 yuan, and the result was a slight increase of 40 yuan compared with the previous closing, A and B rose 30 yuan, and Ding Wu was flat.

### Repaying Pre-War Deposits Only Increased Interest Rates Said

It is heard that all pre-war deposits should be paid according to the face value, but the interest rate will be slightly increased, roughly increased to 300 times or 500 times, that is, a deposit of one yuan before the war can be paid 300 yuan or 500 yuan.

### Bank Tightening Credit Chongqing Yarn Numbers Panic

More than 50 will go bankrupt, the industry is holding a meeting to seek aftercare

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 17th] Due to the recent surge in yarn prices in the Chongqing cotton yarn gang, they are vying to make short sales. The interest rates were universally tight the day before yesterday. Banks are tightening credit, so most of them cannot handle the receipt and delivery. If one occurs, it will immediately affect the whole city. As of noon today, more than 50 yarn factories in the cotton flower street area are planning to close down. The cotton yarn industry guild is now calling an emergency meeting of all directors and supervisors to seek aftercare. Some yarn merchants are asking mediators to intercede with various creditors, admitting to repaying debts in installments, in order to avoid the name of bankruptcy, but because the proposed repayment time is as late as the year after next, the tense situation cannot actually be alleviated.

### Gauze Declined Sales Stagnant Interest Rates Too Tight

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, the yarn market took a sharp turn for the worse. The guest sales were particularly palatable in the midst of the tired domestic market news. 20-count yarn, except for the special Double Horse, the rest of the large and small brands all dropped by 30,000 to 40,000. The 16-count yarn was particularly stagnant, because the cost of towel factories was not cost-effective, and there was even less interest. Fine yarn also fell by 135,000, and the trend is still very weak.

The cloth market was still weak and powerless yesterday, because there were no guest sales at all, and the cloth prices in Hankou and Tianjin also had a downward trend, and there are still many goods that have been purchased by various gangs but have not yet been loaded, so sales are stagnant. Although Fangjian's asking price was reduced to 2,000 yuan, there were still few applicants. The interest rate has not turned loose, and the actual sales are stagnant, which are the two major reasons for the weakness.

### Truth About Gasoline Price Increase Oil Prices Have Not Moved, Expenses Have Increased Slightly, and There is No Reason for Taxis to Increase Prices

Yesterday, various newspapers reported that all gas stations in the city announced a price increase on the morning of the 16th, an increase of 150 yuan per gallon compared with the 15th, which was 1,300 yuan. Therefore, the Taxi Industry Association also plans to convene a meeting in the next few days to continue adjusting prices. According to this newspaper's investigation, the price of gasoline is originally divided into two types: one is the delivery price of the Pudong oil depot, which is 1,060 yuan per gallon, and has not changed. The other is the delivery price of gas stations in the city. The old price was 1,150 yuan, and the difference of 90 yuan is the transportation and labor costs from the Pudong oil depot to the barge, transported to Puxi, poured into the oil tanker, and then transported to the gas station and poured into the small oil pool. This difference of 90 yuan was originally stipulated in March of this year, and it has been 7 months since then. Various oil companies have repeatedly wanted to increase it, but it has not been achieved. Recently, due to the huge deficit in revenue and expenditure, they have especially increased it by 150 yuan, which is 240 yuan, so the delivery price of the Pudong oil depot will not be changed, and it is still 1,060 yuan, plus a difference of 240 yuan, which is the new gas station price of 1,300 yuan. If the taxis in this city increase the selling price of gasoline by 150 yuan per gallon, they will have to increase it by 3,000 yuan per hour, in other words, each car needs to use more than 20 gallons per hour, which is definitely not the case. Therefore, if taxis ask for such a large price increase, it is definitely not due to the increase in gasoline prices.

### The Amount of Profit Tax in the 34th Year, the City Chamber of Commerce Discussed the Principles, and Those Who Have Not Filled in the Report Will Be Severely Punished

Simplified Collection of Profit Tax in the 34th Year: Three months ago, Wang Fuzhou of the Tax Bureau came to Shanghai and hosted leaders of the Chamber of Commerce, the Lawyers Association, and the Accountants Association at the International Hotel, announcing that the budget for the collection of profit tax for the first category of profit-making businesses in the city was 60 billion yuan. The industry and commerce were greatly shocked. The various industry associations filled in the report of the capital amount, turnover, and net profit of each member to the Chamber of Commerce, and asked the Chamber of Commerce to strive to reduce the assessment to the government based on the actual situation. The Chamber of Commerce also specially set up a tax specialist committee to preside over the matter, and has been negotiating back and forth with the tax authorities for a long time. At 4:00 PM yesterday, the persons in charge of ten important industry associations such as cotton spinning, dyeing, cotton cloth, silk satin, department stores, enamel, cigarette rolling, rubber, and paper were convened to discuss the specific methods of reporting and paying taxes. The Chamber of Commerce was attended by Du Yuesheng, Xu Jilun, Luo Qinghua, Pan Shihao, and others. After a long period of discussion, it is heard that the principles have been decided, but because the amount reported by each industry is too different from the government's budget, it will be increased to a certain extent in accordance with the simplified collection precedents of the rear. Those who have not yet filled in the report will be severely punished by the Secret Affairs Authority. At 4:00 PM this Saturday, a large number of industry associations will be convened again to announce the universal increase method, so that they can jointly comply.

### Carnation Milk Powder Prices Fall, Orders Arrive, Hoarded Goods Come Out

After the war, American Carnation milk powder sold well in the Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou areas. Because of its cheap price and good quality, the Chinese people like to use it very much. Later, hoarders saw that the goods were profitable, so they hoarded them one after another. When the exchange rate rose, the price was even higher for a while. The retail price of each 5-pound can was as high as 35,000 yuan. It is now learned that the orders for the second half of the year have arrived, and hoarders have come out one after another. The goods are more expensive and the prices have fallen. The retail price of a 5-pound can is only 26,000 to 7,000 yuan. Yesterday's wholesale price for a 5-pound can was 290,000 yuan per dozen.

### New Tea Sales Gradually Move

Since Xiehe Foreign Company started processing Wenzhou New Zhenmei, Renji Foreign Company has also been involved. The process was protracted due to the seller's insistence, and finally made progress. Other new Wenhong and Xin Bailin are also being consulted by export companies. As for the high-quality Chencha, although the buying interest is still enthusiastic, the supply is scarce and the transaction is declining. Chen Wenhong, Indian merchants, foreign companies and the goods side have a lively transfer, and the market is prosperous. The domestic sales of red and green tea are still only fried green tea, and the street sales are still good, and the rest are narrow.

### China Trust Bureau Officially Sold Artificial Silk Yesterday, the Black Market Collapsed, and Manufacturers Applied for About 700 Boxes

[Our Newspaper Report] The Central Trust Bureau, as an agent for selling government materials, the Property Committee, officially sold artificial silk yesterday. The opening price was 2.8 million yuan per box for 120-count bright and semi-bright Tianqiao brand artificial silk, and 2.75 million yuan per box for 120-count bright assorted brand artificial silk. The target of this distribution is temporarily limited to manufacturers. The Silk Weaving Industry Association compiled and registered a total of 315 manufacturers applying for a total of 694 boxes and one package of artificial silk before 10:00 AM yesterday. The China Trust Bureau is expected to allocate all of them according to the plan. According to the distribution method, each manufacturer needs to pay off all the loans today, but because of the tight time, the manufacturers and the China Trust Bureau have agreed that all of them will be paid off before 12:00 noon tomorrow. It is heard that the monthly distribution volume of the China Trust Bureau is about 2,500 boxes. Because it has passed half a month this month, it is about 1,500 boxes. The next distribution date has been set for next Monday. According to Liu Qingyi, the executive director of the Silk Identification Industry Association, the China Trust Bureau currently distributes artificial silk twice a week and will never be interrupted, so I hope that colleagues in the industry will not hoard and avoid eating their own fruit. At present, the fabrics used by colleagues in the industry mostly use 75-count and 150-count artificial silk, and I hope to quickly change to 120-count. It is heard that 6,000 boxes of Japanese artificial silk will continue to arrive in Shanghai in November.

In addition, China Textile Construction Company also has more than 330 boxes of miscellaneous brand artificial silk, which are jointly distributed with the China Trust Bureau. There are a total of three types: 120-count bright semi-bright miscellaneous brand artificial silk, and the price per box is also 2.75 million yuan. One is 50-count semi-bright miscellaneous brand artificial silk, and the price per box is 2.45 million yuan, a total of 206 boxes. The target of this distribution is mainly artificial silk merchants, one box per household. If the manufacturers have been allocated in this period, the quantity will be deducted from the quantity that each manufacturer should be allocated by the China Trust Bureau this month. Yesterday, the artificial silk market opened weak, and the 120 Tianqiao bright was called 4.2 million yuan, and no one asked about it. Then it fell to 4.1 million yuan at the close. It was even more empty in the afternoon, and there was no transaction when it was called 4 million yuan. As a result, it was 350,000 yuan shorter than the previous day, and the other numbers also fell by 300,000 to 350,000 yuan.

### The Wild Rise and Fall of Chinese Stocks: Initial Anxiety Followed by Delight

Chinese stocks experienced an even more dismal situation yesterday. Trading volume in the market was unprecedentedly low. Even the previously popular Yong Yarn shares at times faced a lack of interest. Off-market brokerages feared they had no chance of recovery and continued to decline. However, rumors of favorable settlements suddenly boosted buying interest. From the opening in the morning until the noon closing, a steep decline occurred every half hour. Although there were several small rebounds midway, the sellers remained as steadfast as Mount Tai, showing no panic. The buying pressure was ultimately overwhelmed, and prices fell to their lowest levels near noon. Before the closing bell, there was a slight rise. The noon closing results showed that, except for Rongfeng, China Silk, Liann An, and Five Harmonies, almost all stocks experienced significant drops. In the afternoon, carrying on the momentum from the post-market rally, the market immediately stabilized. Support from the Cantonese community appeared, transforming the situation. At the same time, short sellers covered their positions, gradually pushing prices higher. Moreover, the growing rumors of favorable settlements further strengthened investor confidence. Due to next-day settlement arrangements, the market reversed its course near the closing bell, rapidly climbing significantly. Yong Yarn, Mayer, New Light, Qinxing, Xinn He, Matches, and Huotong all exceeded their morning highs. However, China Silk shares fell below their previous lows. Compared to the previous closing prices, Yong Yarn, Jingfu, and New Light saw slight decreases, while Mayer and Qinxing experienced slight increases. Among the less active stocks, China Textile, Rongfeng, Matches, and New Asia Company each experienced slight declines. Datong, Lian An, Hua Feng, Five Harmonies, and Cement remained unchanged. Unified, China Silk, Jinglun, and Underwear each fell by half a percent. The total trading volume for both the morning and afternoon sessions reached 7 million shares. Off-market stocks continued to fall.

Foreign stocks initially appeared weak, but later, with the arrival of foreign firms and strong rumors of listing, they rebounded. Yi Yarn rose from 8,300 yuan to around 9,000 yuan. The closing results showed that Yi Yarn, Paper, Yi Beer, and Asian Steel all experienced squeezes. British United saw a slight decline, while others remained unchanged.

### Saving the Tea Industry: Economic and Financial Ministries Pass the Buck; Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Urges Swift Action

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce requested that the authorities continue to handle tea barter trade and other matters. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating: “Upon examination of the four items mentioned in the affiliated association’s telegram, except for tax exemption, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, the remaining three items are related to your Ministry’s responsibilities. We are deeply disappointed and perplexed by the instruction to ‘forward a letter to the Ministry of Finance for review.’ Furthermore, we have received a Western-style telegram from the Ministry of Finance, Jing Shui San Zi No. 7398, stating: ‘We have received your telegram Dai 0350 Zi No. 140 from September. After investigating the export of tea, the government, to encourage exports, has approved tax exemptions or rebates as proposed. However, strict regulations should be implemented regarding tax exemption procedures to prevent abuse. The Taxation Administration is currently consulting on the review, and once finalized, it will be widely implemented. As for the requests for continued export subsidies, continued tea barter trade, and using economic diplomacy to expand markets, these fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.’ This contradicts your Ministry’s intention to ‘forward a letter to the Ministry of Finance for review.’ To save international trade, swift action is crucial. We respectfully request that your Ministry take early action. If you believe it is necessary to consult with other ministries, please promptly send a letter for consultation.”

[Our Newspaper’s Dispatch] The Sino-Japanese barter trade arrangements for the next year are currently being negotiated by a specialist from the Central Trust Bureau in Japan. The specialist has not yet returned. It is reported that both sides intend to expand the scope of the barter.

As for the goods that China can supply to Japan, in addition to the salt and bran from this year, it is planned to add soybeans from North China and grass cloth from Guangdong.

### Requesting Exemption of Unified Tax on Exported Wool Products

[Our Newspaper’s Dispatch] The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce recently stated that the unified tax rate on wool products is similar to the general customs export tax. If the export tax is waived but the unified tax is levied instead, the burden on exporters will be doubled compared to before the export tax exemption. This goes against the government's intention to promote export trade. Therefore, on the 16th of this month, a petition was submitted to the Ministry of Finance requesting that, following the precedent of tax exemption for exported tea, all exported wool products that have not been taxed should be exempted, and those that have been taxed should be refunded. This would increase the export opportunities for domestic goods.

Director Chen Xuanzhen presided over the meeting and briefly stated: "This morning, we have invited Mr. Xie Xunchu to give a lecture on middle school teaching problems, and this afternoon, we have invited Mr. Shen Yizhen to discuss middle school administrative organization and equipment problems. This symposium is to review how the supervisory work should be carried out, and we have specially invited educational experts to participate in the discussion." Then, Xie Xunchu gave his lecture. Xie said: "Current teaching seems to be going down a narrow path, focusing only on the students' academic performance and not studying how students perform well or poorly. First of all, it should be clarified that teaching should be based on learning. The relationship between teaching and learning is how students learn, and then how teachers teach. We must first study the method of learning, and then study the method of teaching." He gave two examples of written language teaching and composition teaching to analyze the learning steps of students and the guidance methods of teachers. The supervisors who listened all agreed that Xie's talk was based on his practical experience in educational research. Finally, Xie emphasized that the center of all problems in education is the teaching problem. We must use scientific methods to solve the difficult problems in teaching. He also said that if the teaching problems in primary and secondary schools are not solved by scientific methods, the teaching performance will not be improved. In the afternoon, Shen Yizhen gave a lecture. Shen briefly stated: "Regarding the issue of middle school administrative organization, there must be a basic concept, that is, to make the best use of talents, make the best use of resources, and spend money wisely, so that the efficiency of educational administration can be improved. As for the factors of administrative organization, there are no more than (1) expansion of educational opportunities, (2) progress of educational science, (3) the responsible educational administrative agencies and their laws, (4) the history of the school, (5) the environment of the school, (6) the implementation of national policies, (7) the school's finances, and (8) the school's talent. We must study all of these together in order to generate a reasonable and good school administrative organization. What is a good administrative organization? It can be divided into (1) division of labor, (2) clear responsibilities, (3) vertical and horizontal connections, (4) economy, and (5) proper personnel coordination. Furthermore, how to use the administrative organization can be divided into (1) effective leadership, (2) participation of all teachers, (3) opportunities for review, and (4) assessment." Then, he raised the issue of middle school equipment, first explaining the reasons for the expansion of modern school equipment, which are no more than (1) increased educational opportunities, (2) increased wealth of the country and people, (3) industrial development, and (4) improved educational standards. Speaking of the types of equipment, he introduced a survey by Koos of the United States of 156 schools' school building equipment, each of which was found at least three times or more and included in the statistics, totaling 109 types. Finally, he spoke of the standards for equipment, using the book "Middle School Building Standards" published in the United States as an example, saying that school building standards can be divided into seven categories: (1) location 100 points, (2) construction 155 points, (2) general equipment 270 points, (4) classrooms 145 points, (5) special classrooms 140 points, (6) public places 140 points, (7) offices 50 points, totaling 1,000 points. This is a school building evaluation table. If it is below 500 points, it is not qualified. This evaluation table may be used as one of the research materials for inspecting school buildings in Shanghai. After the lecture, the meeting adjourned at 6 p.m.

### Hongqiao Sanatorium

Half-Price Lung Disease Checkups for Students

According to a Reuters dispatch from London on September 6th, Dr. Shandao Jimmo, a lung tuberculosis expert from the United Nations, stated at a press conference that the high rate of lung disease patients in China must be treated as a social disease and given attention. The rate of this disease is especially high among students, exceeding the rate among adults in other parts of the world by four or five times. Because China has failed to obtain basic hygiene facilities and personal preventive examinations, millions of people will die from lung disease. This year's X-ray examination of 3,224 people showed that the age of patients was from 18 to 33 years old, accounting for 73% of the total number of patients, and the number of young people with lung tuberculosis is shocking. The Hongqiao Sanatorium, located at 990 Linsen Road in this city, in view of this situation, has specially agreed with the various university federations that all new students must undergo X-ray anti-tuberculosis examinations in order to eliminate the source of infection. All students with sufficient proof can prevent the spread of infection, protect their health, and ensure public safety.

### The Lecture Hall of Zhongshan University, the Sacred Site of the Founding Father's Speeches: Telegrams Sent to the Chairman Requesting Funds for Repairs

[Our Newspaper's Guangzhou, 17th Dispatch] The lecture hall of the National Sun Yat-sen University on Wenming Road in this city is the sacred site where the Founding Father gave his lectures on the Three Principles of the People. During the War of Resistance, it was damaged by the enemy and puppet regime. The walls are peeling, the beams are broken, and the monuments are shattered. Without special funds for repairs, it will be difficult to restore its former glory. Xu Ergong, Li Weiguang, Liu Yulin, Guo Zhaohua, and other members of the university's alumni association, in view of this, jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, requesting him to allocate special funds for repairs in order to enhance the spectacle and perpetuate its longevity. At the same time, telegrams were sent to the former presidents of the university, Zou Lu, Dai Chuanxian, and Zhu Jiahua, asking them to sincerely request Chairman Chiang to promptly approve the allocation of funds for repairs so that it can be completed as soon as possible.

### Guo Zhen Cup Volleyball Tournament: Huayan Wuben Wins

The Guo Zhen Cup men's and women's volleyball tournament, originally scheduled for two games today, was held earlier at 5:30 p.m. yesterday at the gymnasium. The strength of the two sides was vastly different, so the result was that Wuben and Huayan both eliminated their opponents Fuhua in straight sets. The results are as follows:

### The Zhung Lun Team Suffers Defeat to Inskas Yesterday

Lack of Experience Leads to Panic

The Luoyang Zhung Lun basketball team lost to Inskas in their fourth match last night due to a lack of experience and confusion. The result was 51 to 32. In the first half, Zhung Lun was only behind by four points, 19 to 15. The Zhung Lun team last night seemed completely different from when they defeated the Giants the night before. Because they were panicked and unable to calm down, the whole team lost contact and became a mess. They also missed their shots, due to their inability to calm down in a big game. Inskas, on the other hand, played very smoothly and made every shot. The Westerners were in the lead all the way in the first half. Zhung Lun chased to 19 to 15, only two points behind. In the second half, Zhung Lun fell sharply and collapsed, which was very regrettable. The result was 51 to 32, a difference of 19 points.

### In the Lush Green Soybean Field A Horrific Massacre The Blood Debt of Forty Citizens in Xitangqiao, Changshu — Sun Jingzhi

The Tyranny of the Enemy's Military Police

A few days ago, Mr. Dong Deren, a reader of this newspaper, mentioned in a letter, "...In Tangqiao, twenty or thirty people were taken away by the enemy's military police and swept away by aircraft." Recently, we received a manuscript from Mr. Sun Jingzhi, confirming that it was a true and undeniable matter. Mr. Sun is from Tangqiao and personally experienced the tragedy. The article truthfully describes the situation in detail, and its purpose is very important: First, it can be used as a reference for military tribunals; second, it can allow righteous people in the world to understand more about the atrocities of the Japanese army; and third, it can also alert the Chinese people not to be forgetful because of leniency. - Editor -

The Beginning of a Tragic Story

When the reporter picked up this pen, his heart was under some kind of strong oppression, and he was palpitating very badly. I don't know what tone and what words I should use to describe the following tragic story without any omission. Everyone admits that the warlords of Japanese imperialism are murderous demons. In this large-scale war of aggression, on the front lines and in the occupied areas, they have used their cruel bestiality and vicious methods to kill many innocent compatriots and create many tragedies. What I want to report here is one of the thousands of facts in this regard.

In describing the beginning of this story, the first thing to make clear is that this tragedy occurred in the autumn of July or August of the 27th year of the Republic of China (the month and date can be investigated). It was the season when the golden wind was refreshing and the edamame was just bearing fruit. Changshu had only been occupied for a year, and the enemy's forces only occupied a city area, and the surrounding areas were all in the hands of guerrillas. At that time, the organization of the guerrillas was independent and unsystematic. Their role was to resist Japan and protect the people (in fact, most of them were afraid of the Japanese army, but extortion and other things did not occur), so they were generally welcomed by the local people.

The Guerrilla Leader of Tangqiao

Tangqiao is a large market town more than thirty miles outside the west gate of Changshu. At this time, the Japanese army rarely passed through there. On the one hand, the town's self-defense forces were also very strong, and there was no disturbance from bandits, so many people from the city or various villages came to take refuge, and the market was booming for a while. The guerrilla leader stationed in Tangqiao at that time was Pang Yun, who had hundreds of soldiers. (The rural guerrilla force was already considered very large.) He had complete firearms and strong strength, so he had a great reputation in all directions. The Japanese army, on the one hand, saw his power and feared him, and on the other hand, wanted to use him, but Pang Yun always stood still. Sometimes he even clashed with the Japanese army (such as destroying highways, bridges, etc.). At that time, his trend was very expanding, and many aspects surrendered to him, and he slowly established contact with other places. The enemy was very afraid of him, so he foreshadowed a conspiracy to destroy his troops. Beforehand, there was a lot of news in Tangqiao Town that the Japanese army was coming to sweep.

Guns and Cannons Attacked from Three Sides

That day, at five o'clock in the morning (the date is not clear, probably the 26th day of the seventh lunar month, which is expected to be tested), the sky was not yet bright, and gunshots were found in the east of Tangqiao. Then the north and south sides followed, and the gunshots became more and more urgent, and closer and closer. In the middle, there were also the strange continuous sounds of machine guns and the booming sounds of grenade launchers. I still remember the sound of bullets rushing and hitting the roof ridge at that time, and the roaring sound of small steel cannons, which were played vividly, simply making every Tangqiao person tremble on the ground. About half an hour later, the sky slowly turned white, and the gunshots also thinned out. The sky was bright, and the scene on the street had changed. The Japanese army was all over the streets, searching and harassing from house to house. At that time, the residents were so scared that they did not dare to go out, knowing that the Japanese army was coming to sweep. According to the confirmed results of the investigation: when the Japanese army swept into the streets this time, all the guerrillas had gone away. Therefore, what they seized were only some broken and unusable firearms and three people suspected of being guerrillas. One was District Chief Qian Choushen, one was shop assistant Song Wengui, and the other was a formal guerrilla member. The district chief's detention was because he stood up on his own, because he had to maintain local security and had to come out to entertain. Later, he finally sacrificed for the people of the town. The shop assistant Song Wengui, because his shop was a rich family in the countryside and had a lot of contact with the guerrillas, on the one hand, a banner presented to Pang Yun by the people of the town was found in his shop, which not only destined Song Wengui to die, but also implicated the people of the town.

The Second Sweep by the Japanese Army

After the Japanese army issued a notice to appease the people, it began the second part of its sweeping work at 10:00 AM. He set fire to all the places where the guerrillas usually haunted, and the fire oil and firewood of each household were looted at once. It is estimated that the City God Temple, the Central Hotel in the center of the town, Song Wengui's dyeing workshop, and several civilian houses were burned because they were considered bandit dens. At that time, because firefighting was prohibited (in fact, no one dared to save), many people were affected, and the cries were only audible to wolves and dogs.

After the enemy carried out a large-scale burning, in order to distinguish whether the residents of the town were communicating with the guerrillas, they forced the residents of the town to go to the highway on the east street of the town, Niuweiba Bay, to conduct a large-scale interrogation (the author's home was more rural, so I was spared from going). They forced District Chief Qian Shoushen to confess truthfully (at that time, the district chief was considered to be elected by the guerrillas, but he was actually publicly recommended by the people, because Qian was a scholarly family and a good citizen). At that time, District Qian was afraid that he would die, and he could not confess, so he suffered a lot of whips, kicks, and physical pain. The enemy's military police also ordered him to hand over the town chief (surname Zhu, name to be tested, now the manager of a yarn number in Changshu). He also held this position concurrently, so Town Chief Zhu was spared. The Japanese army forced Song Wengui to confess. Poor Song Wengui was only eighteen or nineteen years old, and he could not confess. The Japanese military police had no way but to use another method to interrogate him.

A Unique Interrogation

The interrogation was like this: the Japanese called the residents of the town one by one to come forward and asked the interpreter to ask Song Wengui: "Do you know this person? What is his occupation?" If Song Wengui answered that he did not know, he would be considered a guerrilla and ordered to stand aside. Or, if your accent is not like a local, or if your situation and behavior are flustered, or if your answers are different, you will also be in trouble. (At that time, a barber from northern Jiangsu Province and a storyteller from Suzhou Province were killed because of this. The names of the above can be tested. Especially the storyteller, who had a strong national consciousness, which is worth noting here.) As a result of the interrogation, the crowd was divided into two realms: more than forty people stood under the shade of the trees, and a large group of people stood under the scorching sun. Because at that time they did not understand what this meant, there were also people who called friends and stole away, and those who were afraid of the sun automatically went to the shade of the trees. The district chief also stood in the shade of the trees. A villager surnamed Ma thought that the shade of the trees was a safe area and repeatedly slipped over, but was pulled back, and finally slipped over again. Who could have imagined that these people under the shade of the trees were "dead men"? These wronged ghosts can be regarded as an episode in the tragedy. (Note: The villager surnamed Ma is the nephew of the author's domestic worker, which is reliable.)

Forty People Were Innocent Executed

After the interrogation was over, the Japanese military police tied up the forty or so people standing in the shade of the trees with a rope. On the one hand, they announced the release of the remaining group and made a speech: The general idea was that these forty or so people were all bad elements and would be executed immediately. I hope that others will be good citizens. On the one hand, after the release, they drove this group of poor people into the lush green soybean field and told them to kneel down. The brutal Japanese army set up machine guns on the highway. According to what one of the people who escaped from the tiger's mouth said later: (This person can be investigated) At that time, they saw the situation and begged for help, and the cries were indescribable. Snap, snap, a few simple sounds, and they all fell down. (District Chief Qian Shoushen, Song Wengui, and a guerrilla soldier were all inside, and the rest were all common people. The names can all be investigated) The violent Japanese completed the last scene of their massacre. According to the person who escaped from death, after the Japanese army swept, they went around for three or four weeks, and those who were still struggling were rewarded with bayonets. (Note: This person was spared because he was lying under the bloody corpse, breathing motionless. One of his fingers was hit by a bullet, and his name can be investigated.) After the Japanese army completed its massacre, it went its separate ways, leaving only a gust of Xiao Xiao's autumn wind and the blood of more than forty innocent compatriots splashed on the lush green soybean leaves.

The tragic story is over here, and the reporter reiterates. This is a true fact. I was only eleven or twelve years old at that time, but the terrible memory in my young mind is deepening as I get older. In the past eight or nine years, I have never forgotten it, so I can absolutely guarantee that there is no inaccuracy. I only regret that I can't write articles well. Maybe this article of mine is too peaceful, but the fact is true, the fact is more tense, more terrifying, and more tragic. I believe that the people of Xitangqiao will leave this terrible stimulus to their descendants even after a hundred years, and will never let it be submerged.

Map of the Situation around the Battle of Jining (Specially Drawn by the Newsroom of This Newspaper)

### Prelude to the Battle of Jining: News from Fengzhen on the 5th, Special Correspondent Liu Yingyuan

Before the PingSui Railway was built, Jining was just a desolate mountain village called Laoya Zui (Crow's Beak), with only forty or fifty households. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, after the train laid sleepers from Fengzhen to Laoya Zui, because its name "Shou" was not well-known, the name of the spring in the flat land twenty miles south of Laoya Zui was chosen as the station name. Therefore, on many provincial maps, we only see Pingdi Quan (Flatland Spring) and often cannot find Jining. The former Pingdi Quan is now renamed Lao Pingdi Quan (Old Flatland Spring). Jining was established as a new county in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China when General Feng Yuxiang supervised the Northwest Border Defense. It was located in Pingdi Quan and governed the area east of Liangcheng Zhuozi Mountain and north of Fengzhen Guancun.

A Glimpse of a Strategic Situation

Pingdi Quan is 360 li east of Zhangjiakou, 320 li west of GuiSui, 270 li south of Datong, and more than 400 li north of Pangjiang, south of the Outer Mongolian border. It stands at the crossroads of these important towns in the three provinces of Jin, Cha, and Sui. The arrival of the PingSui Railway in Pingdi Quan further increased its military value and made it a city for foreign Mongolian trade and the concentration of grain production in Sui East and Cha North. During Xu Shuzheng's frontier planning period, an airport and barracks were built in Pingdi Quan. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, General Feng Yuxiang built the PingPang Highway to Pangjiang, making it accessible in all directions. To the south, it could guard the gateway to Shanxi; to the north, it could cut off the Zhangku Highway and oversee the movements of Outer Mongolia; and to the left and right, it could support the capitals of the two provinces of Cha and Sui.

Jining, GuiSui, and Datong stand in a tripod formation, while Jining, Zhangjiakou, and Datong also form a mutually supportive position. Therefore, after the ceasefire order was issued on January 13th of this year, the Communists did not first attack Datong but instead forcibly occupied Jining. After Jining was captured, they immediately launched an offensive against Datong. If Datong were to fall, the situation in GuiSui would be unimaginable. Therefore, in order to relieve Datong and protect GuiSui, the National Army had to recover Jining, and in order to besiege Datong and consolidate Zhangyuan, the Communists had to defend Jining. Thus, the fierce Battle of Jining, following the Battle of Siping Street, was triggered. The so-called Jining Victory reversed the precarious situation in the north, and its significance lies in this.

Pingdi Quan is 1,400 meters above sea level, and the climate is particularly high and cold. Around May and June, snowflakes can still be seen flying at night. The train from GuiSui to Jining and from Datong to Jining both travel uphill. West to Zhuozi Mountain and east to Guancun are rolling hills. East to Zhangjiakou, the train passes through a plain before entering the mountain valley. North to Pangjiang, there is no need to cross ridges and mountains to reach the瀚海 basin. The county seat is built on a flat beach surrounded by mountains on the southwest and the Guanwang River on the northeast. It is difficult to approach the city walls from the northeast, and even if one enters the city through the Bawang River, it is impossible to gain a foothold due to the control of the mountain peaks on the southwest. Therefore, Jining is easy to defend and difficult to attack.

Protecting Jining are three famous mountains. These three mountains are not particularly steep, but they have military value due to their proximity to the city of Jining. Because all the hills outside Jining are not as high as these mountains. The famous mountain west of the city is called Wolong Mountain (Sleeping Dragon Mountain), which faces the west gate of Jining and protects the southwest corner of the city. The mountain south of the city was originally called Huangjia Liang (Huang Family Ridge). In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, Tang Enbo's troops built excellent national defense works here, so it was renamed Tiejun Mountain (Iron Army Mountain). During the Japanese occupation, a fortified barracks was built in the depression between Wolong Mountain and Tiejun Mountain to fill the gap between the two mountains. The mountain southeast of the city is called Laohu Mountain (Tiger Mountain), which not only overlooks the entire city but also monitors the grassland through which the Bawang River flows. During the construction of national defense works in the twenty-sixth year, tunnels were built, leading to the basement of the county government office.

Jining is the only county town with an urban scale on the PingSui Railway. The railway runs through the city from north to south, dividing the entire city into two parts: the east side of the railway is called Qiaodong (East of the Bridge), and the west side is called Qiaoxi (West of the Bridge). During the Feng Yuxiang era, there were eighteen main roads. Now there are only eight roads with shops and households, surrounded by earthen city walls, with concrete steel-reinforced bunkers underneath. Because Jining was very prosperous in the past and surrounded by stone mountains, the buildings in the city are quite tall and sturdy. For example, the station, water tower, railway hospital, worker residences, locomotive yard, electric company, county government in Qiaodong, and the Fuzhetang, flour company, mosque, post and telecommunications bureau, police station, and Mengjiang Hotel in Qiaoxi can all be turned into defensive fortifications for street fighting by simply piling up sandbags and installing barbed wire.

Communist Defense Deployment

After forcibly occupying Jining on January 18th of this year, the Communists began to repair the national defense works from before the twenty-sixth year and strengthen the fortifications built by the Japanese invaders after the twenty-sixth year. They spent four or five months building these fortifications. Their operational plan for defending Jining was to hold key strongholds with a small number of elite troops, and use a large number of troops to encircle the periphery in order to attract the National Army to the city of Jining, and then encircle and annihilate them. In July and August of this year, they mobilized troops from the "JinSui" and "SuiMeng" military regions to conduct four or five offensive and defensive exercises. They were confident that after first dispelling the National Army's spirit in Zhuozi Mountain, they would be able to crush the National Army into minced meat on the outskirts of Jining and make dumplings.

Their original plan was for the Independent First Brigade of the "SuiMeng Military Region" to hold Zhuozi Mountain for two days to wait for the arrival of the Fourth Brigade and the Training Brigade and engage the National Army in a field battle. Who would have thought that the Independent First Brigade only held Zhuozi Mountain for two and a half hours before losing the fortifications with six layers of defense? The Fourth Brigade, which had reached the Eighteen Stations, and the Training Brigade, which had reached Niujia Chuan, also suffered devastating blows from the National Army. Therefore, they abandoned the field battle and assigned the Twenty-seventh Regiment of the Second Brigade of the "JinSui Military Region," the Ninth Regiment of the "SuiMeng Military Region," the Fifth Regiment of the 358th Brigade, and the Guard Battalion of the "SuiMeng Military Region" as the defending troops. The defense position of the Twenty-seventh Regiment was on Tiejun Mountain, the Fifth Regiment of the 358th Brigade was on Wolong Mountain, and the Guard Battalion of the "SuiMeng Military Region" was on Laohu Mountain. In addition, there were more than 10,000 troops of unknown designation, commanded by Yao Zhe, commander of the "SuiMeng Military Region," to defend various strongholds in Qiaodong and Qiaoxi.

According to prisoners of war, the Communist forces participating in the Battle of Jining this time numbered about seventeen brigades, fifty-one regiments, totaling more than ten thousand people. We discovered units such as the New Fourth Brigade, the Independent Fourth Brigade, the Provisional Fourth Brigade, the 358th Brigade, the Training Brigade, the Independent First Brigade, the Independent Second Brigade, and the Fourth Column of the Guerrilla Detachment of the "JinJiCha Military Region" on the periphery of Jining. The Communist defense of Jining distributed three-quarters of its forces on the periphery. Before Zhuozi Mountain was recovered, the villages near Jining were stationed with all the elite troops of the "JinSui Military Region." After Zhuozi Mountain was recovered, most of the troops of Nie Rongzhen's "JinJiCha Military Region," which had been besieging Datong, were also transferred to the command of He Long's deputy commander Zhang Zongxun to participate in the Battle of Jining.

Our Side's Offensive Posture

In this Battle of Jining, both sides had more than 100,000 troops. Our side set out in three routes. The left-wing "Fuxing" Column was entirely cavalry, composed of the "Tieqi" (Iron Cavalry), "Qingshan" (Green Mountain), and "Changcheng" (Great Wall) detachments. They spread out from Wuchuan through Taolin to the PingPang Highway and the Fengji Railway Line, in order to both block the Communist援軍 from Shangdu and cut off the communication between Fengzhen and Jining. The right-wing "Tangsheng" Column was based on the "Huiguang" (Return Light) and "Zhengdong" (East Expedition) detachments, combined with cavalry detachments such as "Xianfeng" (Vanguard), and attacked Tianjia Zhen (Old Ningyuan City) from GuiSui, heading straight for the outskirts of Liangcheng, Fengzhen, searching in the Dahai Po Plain, so that the Communist forces in Sui East and Yan North could not coordinate with each other. Our main force, the "Lijin" Column, led the "Shengli" (Victory), "Shaonian" (Youth), and "Huanghe" (Yellow River) detachments, advancing east along the railway line on September 1st. On the morning of the fifth, the "Shengli" detachment, in coordination with the "Shaonian" detachment, captured Zhuozi Mountain, and then crossed the mountains north of the railway, arriving at the Tuchengzi area northwest of Jining on the eighth. On the afternoon of the ninth, they entered the attack preparation position. When the attack was launched on the tenth, the "Shengli" and "Huanghe" detachments assaulted the city, and the "Shaonian" detachment was used as a reserve force to encircle the urban area from the southwest. On that day, the "Shengli" detachment seized Tiejun and Wolong Mountains, the "Huanghe" detachment was blocked from breaking into the city from the west, and the "Shaonian" detachment suffered wave-like encirclement attacks from the Communist outer forces. From the afternoon of the tenth to the morning of the twelfth, the situation was deadlocked. On the twelfth, the "Shengli" detachment occupied Qiaoxi. In the afternoon, the "Guoguang" detachment of the "Tangsheng" Column was sent to reinforce. After a night of bloody battle, the army began to withdraw on the afternoon of the thirteenth. Our side completely recovered Jining after midnight.

There was another attacking force of the National Army, namely the armed returning people from the Yan North, Cha North, and Sui East regions led by the Democratic Defense Work General Team. These soldiers, wearing leather jackets and headscarves, played a significant and decisive role in the Battle of Jining. The First General Team commanded by Yang Yuanfu and the Third General Team commanded by Zhao Dayi prevented the Communist forces in Yan North and Cha North from supporting Sui East. The Second General Team, led by Wei Chunmei, fully joined the various attacking National Army units in charging and breaking through enemy lines, and took on all the reconnaissance, guiding, transportation, and stretcher-bearing work, so that the National Army did not suffer any major losses and instead won brilliant victories. Therefore, Commander Chuan said: "The victory in this Battle of Jining is a victory of the people's will."

### Thrilling Outer Perimeter Battles: Consecutive Capture of Two Mountains

On the dawn of September 10th, the main force "Lijin" column of the National Army launched an attack on the outer perimeter strongholds of Jining. The "Shengli" detachment was tasked with capturing Wolong and Tiejun Mountains, the "Huanghe" detachment was tasked with breaking into the city from the northwest direction, and the "Shaonian" detachment arrived at the line of Luotuo Bozi Houjia Village before dawn, serving as a reserve force for the attack and protecting the flanks of the entire army. The "Lijin" command post was also set up in Luotuo Bozi on the same day, with heavy equipment and supplies stationed in the Lama Temple west of Jining City. Our attack route was from northwest to southwest, then turning northeast to attack the city. After discovering the sounds of gunfire, the Communist outer perimeter forces moved from southeast to southwest, planning to encircle the northwest in a counter-encirclement.

The "Shengli" detachment, attacking Wolong and Tiejun Mountains, ordered the Second Detachment to capture Wolong Mountain and the Third Detachment to capture Tiejun Mountain simultaneously. The Communists had set up seven layers of defensive fortifications on these two mountain peaks. The first and second layers were minefields, the third layer was barbed wire, the fourth layer was an electric fence, the fifth layer was also barbed wire, the sixth layer was a wide and deep outer moat, and the seventh layer was a copper-reinforced concrete bunker surrounded by circular communication trenches. From the bottom of the mountain to the top of the mountain, the distance was about three li long. This time, the brave National Army was not afraid of death, and the stubborn Communist forces also did not want to lose their lives, so the battle was extremely fierce. We used heavy firepower to first block the firing holes of the bunkers, and then infantry stepped over the minefield and electric fence lines, jumped into the outer moat, and pounced on the top of the mountain, so the casualties were heavier than in previous battles.

After the "Shengli" detachment launched a simultaneous attack on Wolong and Tiejun Mountains, the Second Battalion competing for Wolong Mountain broke through the positions of the Fifth Regiment of the 358th Brigade in one hour. Therefore, the Communist forces extracted a portion of the Twenty-seventh Regiment of the "JinSui Military Region" defending Tiejun Mountain to reinforce Wolong Mountain, and ordered the soldiers to jump out of the outer moat and engage the National Army in a self-destructive bayonet fight. As a result, the First Battalion of "Shengli" was blocked. After the Third Battalion first captured Tiejun Mountain, they sent a portion of fresh troops, passing through the southwest corner of Jining from the north of Tiejun Mountain, bypassing the back of Wolong Mountain, where two barracks with Communist troops were stationed, and attacking the defending Communist forces from both the front and rear, crushing them. Wolong Mountain was occupied before dusk.

### Glimpses of Rural Women in Guilin

— News from Guilin on the 8th, Our Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong

In the eyes of Jia Baoyu, a romantic figure who appreciated his own talents, women were like gentle spring water. However, the women who grew up in the southern borderlands were, in people's eyes, like shrubs on a stone wall, mysterious and strong....

The women of Guangxi do not have the graceful and delicate beauty of the Suzhou Terrace, nor the natural beauty of the Northern land. From the most objective aesthetic point of view, health is their only advantage in terms of physique. They are crude and lack any delicacy. For thousands of years, apart from the legendary Green Pearl who grew up in Bobai Village, there have been no stories about peerless beauties. But I believe that when you hear that a woman is more capable than a man, you should feel that it is more beautiful than the story of a beauty!

Throughout the vast countryside, whether in the east, south, west, or north, from the mountains to the plains, women are the main force in agricultural affairs. From plowing and sowing to harvesting rice, from harvesting rice to winter plowing, chopping firewood, and cutting grass, there is nothing that is not a woman's job. What about men? Men have become women. Their jobs are to carry water, cook, deliver food, and take care of the family, and other than that, they are idle all day long, standing in the east, sitting in the west, drinking and gambling, living happily like pigs. (Of course, there are also some men who work together with women, but that is mostly in the poor mountain areas). Women and men sing mountain songs and go to the city to pay grain and rent, and sell rice on the market. With a bamboo hat on their shoulders, bare feet, and the leaping of their towering breasts hiding infinite vitality, plus a blush on their faces, who can say that a straight pine tree is not more beautiful than a weak willow?

"Men plow and women weave" is a traditional precept, but "women plow and women weave" is also a lovely reality. In the idle days of winter, women weave their own clothes with their own hands, as well as new clothes for their husbands and children, and take them to the market to sell cheaply. The women in Fuchuan and He County in Guilin East rely on weaving all year round, spinning yarn from August to December, and weaving from December to July. It is truly "chickens crow and enter the loom to weave, night after night without rest." The cloth they weave becomes other people's clothes, but they themselves wear tattered clothes painstakingly, so they have the saying that their clothes are "new for three years, old for three years, patched for three years." Even more pitiful is that many weaving girls wear out their entire youth on the loom, working for others, and in the end, the wealthy areas have become a city of sorrow for prolific old women.

Women who grow up in areas with backward consciousness and feudal remnants have infinite suffering. The marriage trading system still exists throughout the Guangxi countryside and even in the cities. A wife is indeed like a piece of clothing, and the right to decide whether to keep or discard her is entirely in the hands of vulgar men. Peasants selling their wives and officials selling their concubines are commonplace. A wife is "movable property." As long as she only says a few words to an unfamiliar man, not to mention anything else, after a ton of scolding, a matchmaker will come to raise someone to "marry a wife." However, it is a matter of course for a husband to go to the mountains to sing mountain songs and drink and make trouble with other women, or to take three or five concubines. It is even not uncommon to bet away money or pawn his wife when he is so poor that he has no other choice.

Due to the pain of marriage, coupled with women's strong self-reliance, a deformed phenomenon has become widespread in the countryside, and cannot be controlled by official laws. The specific term for this phenomenon is called "not settling in the husband's home." When a woman marries into her husband's family, she packs up her belongings and returns to her parents' home after three or seven days, farming and weaving for herself, living freely. She may or may not return to her husband's home for a year, or three, five, or seven years. She may stay in her husband's home for three or five days and then slip away, leaving her husband with nowhere to complain. There are many lawsuits arising from not settling in the husband's home. Women who stay in their parents' home do not do good things, and just a layer of sexual temptation leads to many scandals. So in some places (such as the countryside in Guinan, Wuming, and Du'an), women often return to their husband's homes only after their bellies are swollen in their parents' homes, and they shamelessly change to their husband's homes, without any "problems". Therefore, there is a joke: when you meet people in these places, never call them "big brother" or "old man." Otherwise, you are sure to be beaten.

### Modern Medical Treatment of Peptic Ulcers (Part 2)

— Xue Bangqi

(C) Other Drug Treatments

We all know that patients with peptic ulcers, especially those with pyloric obstruction, often experience spasms in their stomach muscles. Therefore, the application of antispasmodic drugs is often effective in relieving symptoms and reducing the patient's pain. The commonly used antispasmodics are atropine or belladonna-like drugs. Other acid-neutralizing drugs, such as aluminum hydroxide gel, aluminum phosphate, and magnesium trisilicate, can be used as alternatives to Xuepei's powder, depending on the circumstances.

Larostidine (i.e., Histldine) lacks specific effects on peptic ulcers. As early as 1936, the American Medical Association pointed out its low efficacy and uselessness. According to Kirby's rigorous clinical experiments, its therapeutic effect is even inferior to ordinary Xuepei therapy.

Recently, there are many over-the-counter drugs advertised on the market, but none of them are truly effective. Do not delay your illness by using them indiscriminately. Moreover, many drugs, if used improperly, can be harmful rather than beneficial. Do not blindly follow suit.

(D) Treatment of Gastric Bleeding

The treatment of gastric bleeding must be determined according to the amount of bleeding at the time and the consequences of the bleeding. Generally speaking, after discovering gastric bleeding, the patient should immediately lie in bed and rest completely. Many patients are often extremely frightened and nervous when bleeding, which increases gastric peristalsis. All of these are detrimental to recovery! Many family members around the patient panic and make a big fuss, which increases the patient's anxiety. This attitude is most undesirable! Therefore, for the sake of the patient, it is best to decline visits from all relatives and friends and give the patient a good rest. Even close family members such as spouses or parents and children should calmly serve by their side to comfort the patient. In terms of medical care, morphine injections can be given as appropriate to make the patient calm and comfortable and obtain true physical and mental rest.

In the case of massive bleeding, various emergency measures, such as blood transfusions or injections of glucose saline, can be used as appropriate to restore blood volume, prevent shock, and replenish water loss and other important symptoms. However, the method, timing, quantity, and speed of application must be carefully considered by the doctor before proceeding. Otherwise, improper timing, excessive transfusion volume, or excessive speed may increase bleeding!

In terms of diet, patients usually gradually start eating 24 to 48 hours after the bleeding stops. During the fasting period, if the patient is extremely thirsty, small ice cubes can be held in the mouth. Afterwards, the diet can strictly follow the Xuepei's diet and conditioning method mentioned above, but the initial amount should be halved.

Many doctors instruct to place an ice pack on the stomach to stop bleeding. This measure must also be considered according to the condition. If the patient has already shown signs of shock, or the application of the ice pack causes the patient to shiver, the result will not only be useless but counterproductive.

There are many hemostatic over-the-counter drugs on the market. Based on our experience, they have no special effect on gastric bleeding. This point is consistent with the opinions of foreign experts. Do not rely on them and neglect routine treatment, which may delay important matters!

(E) Surgical Treatment

This article does not intend to discuss the various surgical treatments for peptic ulcers. However, in what circumstances should surgical treatment be considered? The following can be listed:

(1) Acute gastric or duodenal perforation.

(2) Chronic ulcer perforation or gastric deformity after perigastritis.

(3) Ulcers with malignant tumor changes.

(4) Pyloric obstruction with definite and significant food retention.

(5) Repeated bleeding with no significant improvement with medical treatment.

(6) Chronic ulcers that are ineffective with other various treatments.

(F) Recently Introduced Highly Nourishing Therapy by Xu

(1) Development of Xu's Highly Nourishing Therapy
Since Xuepei's famous therapy was published in 1923, there has been no remarkable innovation in the treatment of peptic ulcers for more than 20 years. Until recently, Xu Zhaotui, a Chinese scholar, discovered during his research on protein metabolism in the United States that the application of high nourishment has excellent effects in treating peptic ulcers. From then on, a glimmer of dawn has appeared in the treatment, which is also the glory of the Chinese medical community.

When Xu returned to Shanghai this spring, he published part of his research work to his medical colleagues. In the beginning, Xu gave highly nourishing therapy to four patients with peptic ulcers who had decided to undergo surgery. The original purpose was to supplement the patient's physical strength and nutrition, hoping to benefit during the operation. However, to his surprise, four days later, the patient's stomach pain suddenly subsided, the symptoms subsided, and they could walk out of the hospital on their own without the need for surgery or continued treatment. Seeing such an extraordinary and superior result, Xu immediately continued to conduct large-scale research on highly nourishing therapy for peptic ulcers. The results further confirmed the superiority of his therapy and attracted the attention of medical circles around the world.

(2) Principles of Xu's Highly Nourishing Therapy

Xu uses amino acids (protein hydrolysates) plus glucose and maltose to replace the patient's entire diet. Xu himself explained the principles of this highly nourishing therapy as follows: (1) Amino acids (protein hydrolysates) have a gastric acid neutralizing effect. (2) Amino acids or protein hydrolysates are already digested proteins, which do not require further work from the stomach, so the stomach and upper duodenum can have sufficient rest. (3) Ample nutrition can increase healing ability and speed.

(3) Application of Xu's Highly Nourishing Therapy

Xu also has certain rules for the application method, which can be briefly described as follows:

Application of drugs—(1) Amigen (containing 12% nitrogen). (2) Glucose and maltose.

Dosage—(1) Each kilogram of body weight is formulated with 60 cm units of nitrogen per day, that is, 5 cm of Amigen. (2) For example, if the patient weighs 50 kg, the daily requirement is 50 x 5 = 250 cm of Amigen. (3) Each cm of Amigen contains 3.7 calories, so the calories obtained from Amigen per day are 250 x 3.7 = 925 calories. (4) If the patient needs 2,000 calories per day, the insufficient calories are 2000-925=1075 calories, which are supplemented with glucose and maltose. The daily requirement is 1075+4=269 cm.

Administration—Divide the daily dose into eight or nine times according to the symptoms, and take it once every two hours. Use Yongchong to mix it.

Treatment date—Take it for two weeks first, and then handle it according to the situation.

We have no way to carry out large-scale application of Xu's highly nourishing therapy due to the lack of local medicines. We dare not say how effective or superior it is now. According to the results of 63 cases recently selected and treated by Xu: 47 were excellent, 13 were very good, and 13 were ineffective. However, these patients were all cases in which other drug treatments had completely failed. Today, Xu has such achievements, which is undoubtedly excellent, and it is more effective than the previous treatment methods.

The period of treatment for patients treated by Xu is still short, and it is difficult to predict whether there will be a recurrence in the future after recovery. Xu himself has repeatedly stated that his highly nourishing therapy can only turn progressive ulcers into a path to recovery, and there is no certainty that it can be cured. Highly nourishing therapy has now attracted the attention of medical circles everywhere, and the extent to which it can be developed in the future remains to be seen with continued research and progress.

The above-mentioned treatment sections are all closely related to each other. Be sure to take care of all aspects during treatment and do not focus on one thing and lose sight of the other. During the treatment period, the patient's cooperation, patience, trust in the doctor, and determination to undergo long-term treatment are all essential for success! We sympathize with the various difficulties of the patient's family in treatment and hope that in the near future, the medical community can have newer developments to shorten the treatment period and reduce the difficulty of treatment.

### A Little Knowledge Is the Most Likely to Cause Trouble

— Zhang Ming

—In consultation with the municipal health authorities regarding the training of Chinese medicine—

As the Western saying goes: A Little Knowledge is a Dangerous Thing, which means that a little knowledge is the most likely to cause trouble. It is indeed a well-known saying. The reason why children are prone to causing trouble and suffering is that they have suffered from "a little knowledge."

On October 3, Dagongbao reported: "The Municipal Health Bureau believes that our Chinese medicine practitioners adhere to old methods and lack new knowledge, and plans to assist the Chinese Medicine Association in holding lectures to enable them to understand chemistry, physics, physiology, pharmacology, pathology, biomedicine, etc."

If this news is true and it is really implemented, it is tantamount to giving atomic bombs to children to play with. It is just as dangerous and just as unreasonable!

If Chinese medicine is to be scientific, unless all Chinese medicine is abandoned, there is no other way. Because culture is holistic, and science is especially holistic. What is not holistic and unsystematic is not science. Zhang Zhidong's policy of "Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning for application" has already ruined the Manchu Qing Dynasty and suffocated the Republic of China. I hope the wise authorities will not be poisoned by this again. Naturally, the health authorities' policy of training Chinese medicine practitioners is exactly the opposite, which is to "Western learning as the foundation and Chinese learning for application," but its violation of the holistic nature of science and the creation of piecemeal false science are no different. The Tao is basically an inappropriate point.

From a practical point of view, the characteristics of old medicine are mysterious, which is philosophized to put it nicely, and confused to put it frankly. The characteristic of scientific medicine is precision. One is one and two is two, and there must be no sloppiness or ambiguity. Good high school training is required (those with a slightly lower level cannot even pass the medical school entrance examination) plus more than six years of rigorous training, and its level is two to four years higher than that of ordinary universities. Such long-term and rigorous scientific training is absolutely necessary, because doctors deal with the health of patients, and the lives of patients are in their hands, so they must be trained to reach the stage of "thorough understanding," otherwise a little knowledge will easily cause trouble. Now the Health Bureau hopes to pass on the essence of scientific medicine to Chinese medicine practitioners who have not received good high school scientific training in a short period of time. It is not only impossible, but also extremely dangerous.

In medical schools, it is still difficult to pass on scientific medicine to medical students who have received scientific training, and those with slightly inferior qualifications often repeat classes and eventually drop out. Now, we want to use short-term lectures to hope to make Chinese medicine, which is mysterious and mysterious in terms of yin and yang and five elements, scientific. It is tantamount to seeking fish from trees and a fool's dream.

If it is forced to be implemented, it will inevitably create a large number of pseudo-scientific "Western medicine practitioners," and then all crimes will be attributed to "Western medicine practitioners."

Authentic "Chinese medicine practitioners" use herbs and bark with mild medicinal properties, which is not very dangerous. However, this disguised "Western medicine practitioner" applies scientific medicine drugs and other treatment methods in a half-understanding way, which is even more dangerous.

Because the drugs used in scientific medicine are either the essence of herbs and bark, or synthetic chemicals. Especially the latest special drugs, most of them have strong medicinal properties. In order to obtain their maximum therapeutic effect and avoid their harmful side effects, accurate diagnosis of pathogens and various tests must be made before they can be effective. As for various diagnostic and treatment methods, they must undergo rigorous specialized training before they can be used freely and without error.

Now, to try to combine this precise knowledge of scientific medicine with the yin and yang and five elements in the minds of Chinese medicine practitioners is not only incompatible, but will inevitably create a large number of disguised Western medicine practitioners with a little knowledge. How can we imagine the danger?

If you want to make Chinese medicine scientific, you must abandon all Chinese medicine and then lay a scientific foundation to accept all the training of scientific medicine. There is no other way. The policy of using Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning for application will not work, and applying it to medicine is even more dangerous, extremely dangerous!

Before the Anti-Japanese War, the death of a certain military leader in the capital due to the injection method of a certain Chinese medicine practitioner across the clothes, and the death of the young son of a certain leader in the capital during the Anti-Japanese War due to the morphine injection of a certain Chinese medicine practitioner are all examples of so-called "scientific Chinese medicine." I hope everyone will be vigilant.

Finally, I hope that the municipal health authorities will abandon this risky attempt.

### The Crisis of Peptic Ulcers

— Zhong Xueli

Peptic ulcers, commonly known as "stomach diseases," can be divided into two aspects: internal and external. The external ones affect the country, society, family, and relatives, while the internal ones cause lifelong suffering and can be fatal at any time. Now, let's briefly describe them in separate items as follows:

A. External: Peptic ulcers are extremely common. There are no reliable statistics in our country. According to the estimates of Hsrst and Srewart in the United Kingdom, about one-tenth of the population suffers from this disease at some point in their lives. It can be seen that the common degree of this disease is almost no less than that of active tuberculosis, so it is indeed a public enemy of the public. Fortunately, most patients recover on their own without knowing it after the acute period; a small number of patients, unfortunately, turn into chronic peptic ulcers, which affect their spirit and physical strength year after year. Although the commonality of this disease has no distinction between men, women, old, and young, men are often more likely to suffer from it than women due to living environment and other factors. The former is almost four times the latter. Young people who work hard, are mentally stressed, ambitious, and agile are especially prone to the disease. Personal career, family economy, and social and national progress are inevitably greatly affected.

B. Internal: In addition to harming the population, peptic ulcers have the following possible crises for individual patients. The occurrence of the crisis can be divided into acute and chronic; the acute ones progress silently without the patient's awareness. When the condition reaches a serious stage, the symptoms are discovered. The opportunity is often missed, resulting in difficulties in treatment, or even becoming an incurable disease. Now, let's briefly describe its outline to alert the Chinese people, hoping to prevent it before it happens, or treat it properly as soon as possible.

Acute Crisis

(1) Bleeding: Often peptic ulcers invade the deep part of the gastrointestinal wall, eroding blood vessels, the tube wall necroses, and bleeding occurs. If the bleeding is small, the patient may not feel any pain. Sensitive people may find that the stool is dark ocher, or even tar-like (black and shiny). At this time, the patient does not care at all and continues to work as usual. After a long time, a large amount of blood collapses, hematemesis, and melena occur at the same time, so that during work, fainting and falling to the ground, unconsciousness, cold hands and feet, cold sweat all over the body, frequent pulse, short breath, pale face, and decreased blood pressure. At this time, he began to panic and sent him to the hospital, and the patient had entered a critical condition. If he can escape the disaster, quick hemostasis can be saved, otherwise this will only be a last resort, and it is not something that can be rescued by hitting a stone.

(2) Perforation: Those suffering from gastric peptic ulcers may have this crisis of perforation at any time. After perforation, it enters peritonitis, resulting in death. Among those who die from peptic ulcers, about 65% or more are due to this serious perforation. Duodenal ulcer perforation is more common than gastrointestinal perforation. Patients with perforation often complain of sudden severe pain at the beginning, which continues, radiating from the upper abdomen to the back or shoulder. The degree and nature of the pain are different from the usual. The doctor often finds that the patient's expression is painful, his face is pale, his breathing is short, and the respiratory movement is limited to the chest. His limbs are cold, his body is stiff and cannot be moved slightly, and the abdominal wall is as hard as a board. Palpation often shows severe tenderness. One or two hours after the perforation, the face changes from white to red, the body temperature gradually rises, the limbs change from cold to warm, the abdomen gradually expands, the breathing becomes shorter, and the pulse becomes faster. At this time, he enters the reaction period and peritonitis occurs. If the patient delays the opportunity for several hours, is timid, and refuses to undergo repair surgery, most of them will die of peritonitis. Even the latest penicillin and plasma are useless. Those with simultaneous perforation and bleeding account for one-tenth, and their severity is naturally doubled.

Chronic Crisis

(1) Obstruction: Peptic ulcers mostly occur near the pylorus (that is, the main road from the stomach to the duodenum), or the pylorus is tightly closed due to muscle spasm, or obstruction occurs due to chronic inflammation, scarring, or tumor. Patients often complain of vomiting history. Pain in the upper stomach can only be relieved after vomiting. The vomitus is often large and contains food eaten several days ago. Moreover, diet is often reduced, nutrition is hindered, resulting in emaciation, haggardness, weakness, and anemia.

(2) Gastric Cancer: Duodenal ulcers mostly have no cancerous changes, but gastric ulcers are not the same. According to the autopsy results of pathologists, about 5% of gastric ulcers turn into gastric cancer. After getting gastric cancer, bleeding, pyloric obstruction, and metastatic cancer of the peritoneum and liver can occur, resulting in incurable. Moreover, the early symptoms are often not obvious, only indigestion, poor appetite, and sharp weight loss. When the patient finds out, it is often in a difficult-to-treat stage. The life of these patients is only one or two years. Even if early surgery can remove it, it usually cannot be extended to more than five years.

(3) Gourd-shaped Stomach: Chronic digestive gastric ulcers located in the middle of the upper green (lesser curvature) of the stomach can change the shape of the stomach into a gourd shape, which is called a gourd stomach. These patients often have a history of stomach disease for several years to decades. The upper abdomen is more swollen, and there is dull pain, followed by vomiting, indigestion, and loss of appetite. Bleeding, perforation, and obstruction can also occur.

(4) Gastroenteritis: Gastroenteritis can lead to peptic ulcers, and peptic ulcers can also be combined with chronic gastroenteritis. Patients often have poor appetite, digestion is suppressed, and there is a slight discomfort in the upper abdomen. In these patients, gastric acid is often lower and treatment is more difficult.

(5) Perigastritis: When a peptic ulcer progresses to ulceration and enters the muscle and peritoneal base layer before perforation, or its progress is extremely slow, it often stimulates the surrounding tissues of the stomach and intestines, causing chronic perigastritis. Therefore, the nature, degree, and location of the patient's stomach disease are different from the past. If it ulcerates into the outer layer of the pancreas, there is often dull pain in the lower right back. If the time is long, the consequences of inflammation are often adhesion, which makes surgical procedures more difficult.

(6) Gastrointestinal Fistula: If a peptic ulcer progresses to perigastritis, and then heals and adheres to the large intestine, and perforation occurs, a fistula is formed, and the large intestine directly communicates with the gastric cavity. If vomiting occurs, feces are often vomited out, and food, after swallowing, is not digested. It is discharged shallowly within a few hours. Therefore, the patient eats but does not digest, and cannot absorb anything, and feels a lack of nutrition. Anemia, edema, etc. follow, making surgical treatment difficult.

In summary, the scourge of peptic ulcers affects one person on a small scale and society on a large scale. Therefore, early diagnosis and reasonable treatment are essential. I hope ulcer patients seize the opportunity and do not delay themselves.

Spring and Autumn

### The Question of Authenticity in Ancient Calligraphy and Painting

— Pan Boying

Briefly Discussing the Exhibits at the Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting Through the Ages

This exhibition of calligraphy and painting through the ages, sponsored by the China Cultural Relics Company, provides an opportunity for the citizens of Shanghai to appreciate the art, and also presents a challenge for calligraphers and painters to test their knowledge.

In appreciating calligraphy and painting, the most difficult hurdle is distinguishing between genuine and fake. The difficulty in distinguishing between the two does not lie entirely in quality. Fake paintings are not necessarily bad paintings. Many fake paintings are made by famous masters. Genuine paintings are not necessarily good paintings. The careless and perfunctory work of a famous master is often mistaken for a fake by later generations. There are countless factors such as these. Therefore, connoisseurs must further examine the age of the paper and silk, and the color and size of the seals. For example, Weng Fanggang distinguished the authenticity of Zhao Ziang's works entirely based on a slight defect in the "zi" character at the top of the seal. But counterfeiters often make these details so convincing that one is completely convinced, so what can be done? Therefore, the qualifications of a connoisseur are: first, he is a scholar himself; second, he is a calligrapher and painter himself; third, he is particularly proficient in a certain school or era; fourth, he has suffered many losses in this field. His judgment relies not only on material evidence such as paper, silk, and seals, but also on his intuition and eyesight. This is what distinguishes a connoisseur from an antique dealer. However, even with good eyesight, it is still not entirely accurate, at most only seven or eight out of ten certain. Therefore, among all ancient artifacts, calligraphy and painting are the most difficult to identify. Even the most discerning connoisseur finds it difficult to make a definitive judgment. (Assuming he is truly sincere, humble, and capable) Generally speaking, good or bad is relatively easy to discern, but authenticity is more difficult to assert with certainty. Careful connoisseurs are mostly unwilling to lightly declare something as genuine or fake.

The above words are based on purely objective appreciation. In addition, the collection of ancient calligraphy and painting is always related to money. This involves extremely complex and subtle human relationships. Therefore, the issue of authenticity makes it even more difficult to speak openly. At a banquet, someone brought out a scroll of ancient painting. A certain elder, in a moment of pleasure, said it was fake. Later, the elder learned that the scroll was originally intended to be sold to raise travel expenses. Because of his words, the sale fell through. From then on, the elder regretted it and warned himself never to speak of truth and falsehood again.

There are many exhibits in this exhibition. I went to see it twice but didn't buy a catalog. I rushed through it and forgot everything when I got home. I remember some of the second time. Ouyang Wenzhong's letter is really good. There are not many calligraphy works in this exhibition. Wu Yuanbo's poem scroll is excellent. Zhou Tianqiu's running script is also wonderful, the turns and pauses showing the force of the brush. I remember it was on silk, which seemed to reveal the brushstrokes more easily. Wen Hengshan's vertical scroll is good, but not a masterpiece. Ma Xianglan's several love letters are truly a great treasure. The tenderness of her feelings is self-evident, and even her brushstrokes are elegant and flavorful. Some of the characters are not well-formed in structure (for example, the character "曾"), but they still have artistic appeal. The fine details of the strokes are very similar to those written with a "Parker 51" pen, but today's young ladies probably can't write such letters. That painting by Ju Ran, "Dense Forest and Layered Peaks," was recorded in the Bao Yu Ge collection. In my opinion, it is definitely an old painting. The four characters "Dense Forest and Layered Peaks" are said to be written by Mi Nan Gong, or Mi Hu Er. In any case, these four characters are not badly written. Dong Wenmin's small horizontal landscape scroll (small script with the inscription "Qichang," with a postscript by Yang Longyou) is truly a masterpiece! It makes people linger and not want to leave. Huang Heshan Qiao's "Summer Mountain Dwelling," a masterpiece! Two paintings by Ni Yunlin are excellent, and the paper is clean. Chen Laolian's large silk scroll "Teaching Scripture" is very wonderful. This shows that this master indeed put in effort into studying Tang paintings. The most strange thing is that large landscape scroll by Shi Tao. Why is it so highly valued? Let me boldly say it is fake. But if the principle of truth and falsehood being difficult to determine, as mentioned in the previous two paragraphs, can be established, then both sides who claim the painting is genuine or fake each bear half the responsibility.

Finally, there is one more thing I want to say. Although this exhibition has been a great effort and has achieved good results, it cannot be called a complete success. Perhaps the efforts of the organizers are not enough, and one of the reasons should be that collectors are reluctant to exhibit their treasures. Many collectors did not bring out their most cherished pieces. Even with my limited knowledge, I can easily give an example. For example, Huang Heshan Qiao's "Qing Bian Retreat Map," I heard is in the collection of Mr. Wei Tingrong, why couldn't it be felt? This painting is inscribed by Dong Wenmin as "The Best Painting by Wang Shuming in the World," and also has Dong Gong's writing of Ni Yunlin's poem to Wang Meng on it. Besides the "Dai Zong Dense Snow Map" by Huang Heshan Qiao that was burned in the house of Yao Gong Sui (a Ming Dynasty person), there are few pieces as magnificent and famous as this. If everyone is allowed to admire it, it would be a contribution to culture and art, and it would also benefit the collector. Now the security in Shanghai is absolutely safe, and the person in charge is the authorities in terms of position, and a gentleman in terms of identity, so there is absolutely no fear of being taken by force. Perhaps they cherish it so much that they are reluctant to exhibit it at will to avoid damage. But this difficulty can be easily solved as long as good hands are carefully employed to do it. I hope that at the next exhibition, we viewers will have this opportunity.

### Postscript to Tian Jiweng's Long Scroll Painting of Mount Duqiao Landscapes

— Xu Shaodi

Ji Weng's painting style derives from the methods of Song and Yuan masters. The landscapes and scenery he depicts possess the wonders of front and back, slant and side, gathering and scattering, near and far, inside and outside, solid and void, continuous and broken. Thus, they are endowed with complete spirit, having both form and momentum; they are unrestrained and expressive, free from the flaws of rigid and artificial carving. Ji once said: "Mountains and rivers are born from my mind, and I am born from mountains and rivers. Exhaustively search for strange peaks and use brushwork freely; mountains and rivers merge with me, leaving behind traces of transformation." You have mastered its essence. This painting is simple and ancient, with a majestic atmosphere. Within its vastness lies boldness, and its elegant beauty does not lose its strength. He brushes with ease, creating a realm of strange peaks and secluded paths. One can imagine that when he sees the form and captures the emotion, his brush possesses the power of a vajra. In the past, Zhang Dafeng viewed Mount Changping Tian'an Hall, and his painting skills improved. Qin Shunyou entered Datian, and his depictions of pine needles and stone veins were remarkably different. Ji Weng once roamed through Austria and Italy, extensively viewing the mountains and rivers of Guilin. I share the same sentiments in this painting.

### Zhang Daqian's Erotic Poetry

— Lao Dan

Zhang Daqian, a native of Aozhou, grew a beard in his twenties, a long beard that reached past his belly, much like the "Beautiful Beard Duke" Guan Yu; he is now forty-four years old. He is romantic and uninhibited, and enjoys making humorous remarks when chatting with friends. Before the War of Resistance, he traveled to Korea and fell in love with a Korean woman named Chun Hong. Although they did not understand each other's language, they laughed together when they understood each other's feelings, which can be said to be a temporary romance in a foreign land. Daqian made a painting album as a souvenir. On the back of one painting, he drew a clothes rack with two newly washed red and white women's shirts hanging on it, and a woman squatting beside a chopping block, pausing her pestle and gazing intently, fully expressing her longing for someone far away. Daqian wrote a short poem:

"Joyful like washing red skirts,
Washing red becomes shallow day by day;
My heart is like washing plain silk,
Washing plain silk does not fade."

He also wrote a poem to Chun Hong:

"Iyi Cai's barbaric language is not yet mastered,
How can I express my lonely heart in a foreign land;
The most difficult thing is to guess the ordinary words,
But the meaning is conveyed through light brushstrokes."

Another poem for Chun Hong:

"Newly arrived, the language of the Upper Kingdom is still awkward,
Wanting to laugh and pretending to be shy is too simple;
A frown gathers between the corners of the eyebrows,
Suppressing the vulgar guests from disrupting the pure conversation."

Their affection was lingering and their hearts were full of emotion, vividly appearing before my eyes. I once asked him if Madam Ning Su knew about this affair. Daqian immediately took out a double portrait of himself and Chun Hong from the drawer, a painter and a beauty, complementing each other. Beside the photo, he wrote two poems for Madam Ning Su:

"Hesitating and afraid to send a letter, a picture of joy with foreign flowers and grass;
If not met with slight anger, you should laugh, I pity her even more, let alone an old servant.
Reluctantly bidding farewell to foolish children, written into the picture is not madness.
Wanting to ask Tian Sun for news, can the Milky Way allow a small star to be hidden?"

Ambition leaped between the lines, revealing the artist's humor.

### Preface to the Portrait of Lay Buddhist Anding

— Xia Jinguan

Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, portrait painting has been roughly divided into two schools. Those who followed Zeng Bochun include Xie Wenhou, Shen Erdiao, Xu Xiangjiu, Zhang Yu Yuan, Zi Yuan Zi De Si, Yuan Zhonghui, Guo Wujiang, Xu Yaopu, Gu Lingcheng, and others. This school used the ancient to serve the present, forming its own style. They and Wan Shenzhai's line drawings, two styles of subtle halo and rouge, although not teachers, come from the same source. Those who followed Jiao Bingzhen include Leng Jichen, Cui Xiangzhou, Mang Zhuoran, Jin Jieyu, and others. Since the introduction of photography, most portrait painters have followed the Jiao school, and the ancient methods have disappeared.

Lay Buddhist Anding, Mr. Hu Yaguang, inherited the traditions of his maternal family, the Dai Wenjie. He loved collecting paintings and calligraphy, and then learned Western painting to study portraiture, taking the strengths and discarding the weaknesses of the Zeng and Jiao schools, attempting to establish a new style. In the past, Zhu Zhuzha described the words of Zeng's disciples, saying: "Before obtaining it, it seems as if something is stuck in the heart and cannot be released; after obtaining it in the heart, it is like a flying bird passing the sun, its form leaving me faster and faster, and its spirit is more complete." Mr. Hu has probably understood this saying.

### Talking About Couplets

— Shan Ding

Chinese art considers calligraphy to be the most beautiful, and couplets are the most beautiful form of calligraphy. Taking one or two lines from ancient poems, either describing scenery or expressing emotions, written in fine calligraphy, and hung in a room, speaking face to face, as if hearing their voices, as if meeting with ancient people, this is the most elegant way.

When writing couplets, you must not fold the paper into grids, otherwise it will be like setting type, and the spirit will be lost. But you also cannot not fold it, especially for seven-character couplets, which are often written with the first four characters being spacious, and the last three characters having almost no space. But you can fold the paper in the middle, and carefully consider it when you start writing. After writing the first four characters, fold it a little, then the next three characters will have enough space. If it is a five-character or eight-character couplet, it is easy to position, and there is no need to plan it.

When writing couplets, you must grind the ink thick and dip the brush fully. Hold a seven-inch brush three inches from the tip, loosen your clothes, suspend your wrist, and write freely. Fan Fanshan and Feng Menghua both wrote couplets while sitting, so their energy flowed.

When writing couplets, you need a long-tipped brush. Huang Shangu said that the brush tip should be three inches long, with two-thirds exposed and one inch inserted into the tube. I have tried to do this carefully, and it is easy to expose two inches, but difficult to insert one inch into the tube. Nowadays, a brush maker who can insert three-tenths of an inch is already a master. If the base of the brush is not strong, the strokes will not be strong. The next best thing is to use a large brush, which has plenty of reserve, which is more than half the battle.

When writing couplets, you must understand the method of storing ink, and the person who can write the entire couplet in one stroke is a master. The person who stops after four characters and fills in the remaining three is a skilled hand. The person who dips the brush after one or two characters is of inferior quality.

When writing couplets, you cannot use silkworm cocoon paper, which will lose its wax and be eroded by ink after a long time, becoming a blurry mess. You cannot use Sutra paper, which will become moldy and rotten after a long time, which is also unsightly. For gold paper and coral paper, you should first wipe it with a fine cloth, and you cannot wipe it with powder, which will make the ink color dull. Jade paper and tribute paper both cause the brush to stick, and raw Xuan paper is too absorbent. It seems that paper boiled in clean water is the most suitable. If it is old paper, then anything is suitable, so there is no need to choose.

It is most difficult to add an inscription to a couplet. The upper inscription should start between the second character, and the lower inscription is usually under the fourth character. It is best to inscribe with the original brush, without waiting for it to dry and using a different brush; otherwise, the spirit will be lost.

### Wu Changshuo and Qi Baishi

— Da Mu

In modern times, the two major painters in China are Wu Changshuo in the south and Qi Baishi in the north.

Wu Changshuo has been dead for more than ten years. The Japanese valued his paintings the most. His name was Ku Tie, and his alias was Canlu. He first sold paintings in Suzhou, and only came to Shanghai in the early years of the Republic of China, living in a Tijingguan. At that time, not many people knew him. Later, he was introduced by Huang Binhong and signed a contract with the Japanese Mr. Luoshan to paint in Luoshan Garden. At the same time, Mr. Luoshan promoted him in the newspapers. From then on, his reputation grew. However, Wu had to give half of his earnings to Mr. Luoshan. Later, more and more people asked Wu to paint, and he ran out of sketches and couldn't cope. So he dipped paper in ink and modified it according to the shape of the ink, saying that it was a method that existed in ancient China, called "transformation." In addition to painting, Wu was also good at epigraphy, and the poems he inscribed on his paintings were especially vigorous and pleasing! For example, he wrote on narcissus flowers: "A flower blooms in the bitter cold weather, I read Li Sao and guess carefully, it seems like the strange and poor Meng Dongye, bowing his head, who will come to worship?" And for example, he wrote on maple trees: "Under a tree in the setting sun, I recite poetry and tie a boat, I haven't been to Wujiang for a long time, I recall past travels through paintings."

Qi Baishi is still alive and well, aged eighty-six, living in Beijing, still painting for people. He came from a very poor background, and was a carpenter in his childhood. Later, through his own efforts, he buried himself in learning to paint. In less than ten years, his painting fame shook the world, and high-ranking officials and nobles also sought his paintings. However, his temper was very strange. If he looked down on someone, he would not paint for him even if they offered a high price. Because of his noble character, more and more people sought his paintings, so his income from selling paintings over the decades is said to have made him wealthy. When the Japanese occupied Beiping a few years ago, they wanted him to paint, but he closed his door and would rather starve to death. The Japanese could do nothing about him, so they just smiled and left. He named his residence Jiping Tang. The year before last, I saw one of his poems: "A bleak wind blows on my sleeves, different from the human world, living here for so long, I have forgotten the cold in my heart and gallbladder, I am used to seeing horse-faced and bull-headed ghosts, Jiping Tang is outside the gates of hell." A feeling of resentment leaped onto the paper.

### One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of River, One Inch of Blood 66

— Ye Jingfeng

While we were talking, we had already walked to the station exit. Looking back, we saw that those guys hadn't followed us, but were standing there whispering and starting a round table meeting. At this time, the car had already made the sound of starting the steam cylinder, and the green flag had already been waved. At this moment, I only saw the guy dressed as a businessman, saying what seemed to be the last sentence, waving his hand, and getting on the car.

"We've been tricked!" Brother Hu said urgently, "There's still time to get on the car, what do you think, Aunt?" His big round eyeballs were rolling around, flashing light, looking at the departing car, and then looking at the three police dogs staying at the edge of the car battle.

"Hey!" Brother Hu shouted at the police dogs, "What's up?"

The three police dogs, the one who got spit on, and the other two, carrying our things, pretended to walk over; but this momentum, compared with the fierce arrogance in the car, had already become a spent force. When they reached us, they didn't make a sound, and went straight out of the exit.

The station was just outside the station, a police station. The young stationmaster, seeing this group of us, widened his eyes, somewhat at a loss, and instead invited me and Brother Hu to sit down in the office like VIPs. This made me want to laugh.

The young stationmaster settled us down, and then asked the three guys what was going on. The one who got beaten pulled the stationmaster and walked outside, because there was only one room here. The four of them went out. Brother Hu wanted to hear what they were saying, but I advised him not to bother, because I knew what was going on.

Sure enough, in less than a few minutes, the young stationmaster had already turned around and came in, with a face of trepidation, and wearing a kind of awkward smile, as if he had a toothache. The two who robbed the package and briefcase followed behind like thieves, softly and lightly putting the things on the only long table, turning around and wanting to "be clear."

"Stop!" Brother Hu suddenly shouted, his voice was sharp and tender, but still had some dignity; because inside the sharp and tender voice, there was a force.

"Go, go," the young stationmaster turned cold and waved his hands repeatedly, "I'm here."

I also patted Hu's hand, meaning for him not to scare them. The two guys really looked like dogs with their tails between their legs, dragging their thoughts, and walked out.

"You two are going to the city?" the young stationmaster seemed to be talking to a superior, "This is really a big misunderstanding, ... but it delayed you two's car ... I have to do my best to find a way for you two, even if I call a car?"

"That's okay," I made up my mind to find out what was going on, "But there's one condition, otherwise, don't talk about a car, even if you send a float, send a plane, we still have to be willing to go!"

"I'll listen to you," the stationmaster showed that toothache smile again, "You are reasonable, I am an outsider, you know, I didn't participate in this situation ... Miss, what conditions do you have, just open it up, I will do my best to handle it..."

"What?" Brother Hu glared, "These bastards, didn't you let them go? What do you mean?"

### Jiang Gongmei

— Shao Fu

Jiang Gongmei's two bullets ended his life at Song Gongyi. Jiang Gong's ending was really not beautiful.

Those who remember the grand occasion of Shanghai's recovery last year will not forget this great gendarmerie captain who dominated the world at that time. His majestic proclamation, his imposing manner when entering and leaving, his subordinates who managed everything, after only a year, the scene is completely different. Many people who were lucky enough to escape the net may still be at large, but their spirits are probably also filled with fear!

What people don't quite understand is that this case was only judged almost a year later. It was initially judged as not guilty, then changed to five and a half years in prison, and finally changed to the death penalty. The distance between the death penalty and not guilty is too great. Was it that more evidence of his crime was discovered during the trial that moved back and forth between Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing? Or was the initial investigation insufficient?

Jiang Gongmei deserved to die. If he had known today that a sports shirt and a pair of suit pants would lie in the wilderness, bleeding profusely, what use would those gold bars and cars and Western-style houses have been to him?

### "Public Opinion"

— Xi Nu

Not long ago, a certain place held a public opinion survey to speak up for a major traitor, publishing the number of votes in favor of a suspended sentence, appearing as if it was the will of the people. In this age of great democracy, this masterpiece is like a Jewish-made American glass belt, temporarily able to confuse the real thing; but unfortunately, it was ultimately rejected, leaving behind only the appearance of a sheep's head with dog meat inside. Now it has been discovered that a certain place is holding a survey, asking people to choose one of the following three pre-determined answers: (1) I support American troops being stationed in China, the more the better; (2) I demand that American troops immediately withdraw from China; (3) I don't care, whether American troops are stationed in China or not, it is not related to me. As long as you are a Chinese national, regardless of gender, age, or occupation, you can participate and speak, hoping it will be as widespread as possible, readers can circulate it and solicit submissions, those who are illiterate can ask someone to write it for them, and so on. Let's think about it: I am a "Chinese national," so naturally I cannot ignore national affairs. However, this question is too clever. The first item may have a limited, time-sensitive approval, but the added tail "the more the better" is not what the people really think, so the first item can only be rejected. As for the third item, of course no one is willing to fill it in. So, with two roads blocked, only the second item is left, which is "I demand that American troops immediately withdraw from China." In this way, without waiting for the announcement, the second item will undoubtedly be the absolute winner, and it will completely match the secret documents of the × Party, which emphasize the bad deeds of American troops in China (such as military vehicle accidents, etc.) to arouse the people's resentment towards American troops and achieve the goal of withdrawing American troops from China. Once it is presented as "public opinion" (with votes as evidence), it will naturally be in accordance with the will of Heaven and the people, and legitimate.

We must shout to respect public opinion, because public opinion is the sacred call of the masses; but we cannot bear to see "public opinion" being borrowed, fooled, betrayed, desecrated, and utilized! The common people cannot follow other people's smelly tails and act as echo worms. We do not like to watch this clumsy trick.

If you must require it to be widespread, and you can circulate it and solicit submissions, although the writer is among the illiterate, this national grand strategy, is more than a blind person. Just as with electing senators, please ask the proctor of the current situation issue to take on the task of “writing” it all at once.

### Ji · Pu · Ming

— Zhong Yi

The car doesn't have to be big, as long as it can drive. The loss doesn't have to be crude, as long as it's quick. This is a "Jeep," and only I can enter. Driving without fear of obstruction, hitting people can lead to the underworld. Talking and laughing with women, no ignorant people come and go. It can show off, and be neurotic. Without the noise of military police, without the annoyance of police officers. Ghost tanks, Nazi submarines. Passers-by say: What "Ji" is there?

### Word Prediction

— Yang Ren

A friend of mine, Mr. So-and-So, is thirty-five years old this year, born on October 10th. Every year on this day, relatives and friends always want to celebrate for him. Although he accepts their good intentions on the surface, he cannot help but feel depressed because he sees his family business declining day by day and everything going wrong. So after his birthday this year, he went to consult a word prediction master to predict his fortune for the year and ask about good and bad luck.

The word prediction master used the "double prediction method," which requires you to write two words in a row and then split them apart together. My friend, moved by the scene, wrote two "ten" characters on the water board. The word prediction master asked about his intentions, pondered for a moment, and said: "Don't be offended by my straightforward words, judging from the meaning of the characters, 'ten' is the total number, which is also the meaning of full; in other words, fullness leads to loss. Now that two fullness are added together, there is bound to be loss. Perhaps in the past or in a previous life, you may have been in the limelight, but now it may be difficult to be satisfied!"

"In terms of form, 'ten' is a cross, which is a symbol used by Christians to express mourning; it is also the symbol of a hospital; it is also the badge of the Crusaders; all of these are unlucky things. According to this reasoning, the big issue is that frequent casualties, or lingering diseases, or unresolved lawsuits year after year, which will lead to the danger of losing everything!"

"If the position of the cross is skewed, it becomes an '×'. × is a symbol of incorrectness, and there are two ×s in a row, which clearly shows that there are many incorrect things in your way of life, and you still need to improve a lot!"

The word prediction master saw that my friend was silent, and determined that his words had hit the mark; the rest was just him talking off the top of his head, pouring out a thousand miles, but he also earnestly encouraged and advised him:

"This × character, in the commercial field, is also the representative of four, ×× is forty-four, then you must wait until 443 years before you have the hope of turning bad luck into good luck; but now from thirty-five to forty-four, it will take ten years. In these ten years, you must bury your head and work hard, and strive to produce; this is the meaning of ten years of gathering, which is to cultivate vitality and restore vitality, as a basis for future development, then the future is unlimited. That's all I have to say, please forgive my straightforwardness."

### If I Were a City Councilor

— Luo Bao

If I were a city councilor, I would definitely come up with a win-win solution to the Shanghai Municipal Government's financial difficulties, so that the Municipal Government would not be unable to make ends meet, and at the same time, the city's prosperity would not be affected.

Some people have suggested restoring lotteries, but more people oppose it, so this method cannot be implemented.

In the past, when the "Public Works Bureau" was in deficit, someone suggested issuing municipal lottery tickets - imitating the previous "Aviation Lottery" and "Charity Lottery" methods, and using the surplus funds as expenses for the Public Works Bureau. However, it was not implemented later. I think that this proposal will probably not be approved at present.

Then, in order to balance municipal revenue and expenditure, is there only one way to increase the burden on the people - increase various taxes? (Cutting redundant staff has little effect, and is not a fundamental solution)

Standing in the position of a citizen, do you support the entertainment tax being increased again and again? Do you agree that property tax, police tax, business tax... are rising step by step?

If I were a councilor, I would definitely advocate hiring the city's soccer and basketball masters as staff members of the Municipal Government and its affiliated institutions. In their spare time, they would hold matches once or several times a week, sell tickets to the public, and use the income as much as possible to supplement municipal expenses.

This is promoting sports, not gambling. Who would dare to object? Whoever objects is "undermining sports." What do you think of this method?

### Changeability

— Paul

The Jiang Gongmei embezzlement case went from being acquitted to being sentenced to five and a half years in prison, and then suddenly sentenced to death, which was carried out on the 14th of this month.

No one feels sorry for Jiang Gongmei's death. However, the repeated changes in the judgment of this case are perplexing. Is it possible to arbitrarily sentence someone before the entire case is fully understood?

Not long ago, I read in the newspaper that the investigation team in Guangzhou discovered a shocking "concealed gold case." After taking it out on September 23rd and counting the quantity, there were twenty-three gold bricks, each weighing about fifty catties. After testing, it was proved that it contained 61% gold. The location where the gold was hidden was the property of the traitor Zhang Rongsun, which had already been sealed and taken over.

On the 8th of this month, the above-mentioned gold bricks were publicly tested at the Central Bank of Guangzhou. Professor Zheng Shumin of Zhongshan University used scientific methods for the testing. The result was that it only contained copper and zinc. The gold bricks became scrap copper, and the investigation team came up empty.

Regarding the above two cases, it is not appropriate to make reckless comments before obtaining the full truth. It seems we can only sigh, "Changeability!" That's all.

### Advocating Eating Grass

— Xu Rong

In the past, the Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar, abandoned his palace and ran to the pasture to eat grass with the cattle and horses. Therefore, many people pitied him, thinking he was a madman with a nervous breakdown. But he was not a madman after all. If he were eating grass in the spring, when the grass was sprouting, very tender and fresh, then the grass he ate would contain 40% protein, its nutritional value would be comparable to steak, and soybeans would obviously be far less nutritious than grass. Moreover, he could absorb a large amount of various vitamins from the grass.

Mr. Snabel, a representative of a food research company in Kansas, USA, recently participated in a meeting of the American Chemical Society and strongly praised the high nutritional value of grass. According to this gentleman's research, young and fresh grass contains more protein when it is first cut than when it is harvested later when it is mature. Its nutritional value is no less than that of meat and milk; however, the protein contained in grass is of better quality. The protein contained in good quality grass is much stronger than milk in terms of nutritional value.

This gentleman also wonders why farmers wait so long to cut the grass. If the grass is cut in the usual way, it will have lost most of its nutritional value. After being slowly dried, it will lose even more vitamins. His conclusion is: cutting the grass early and quickly drying it is the only way to preserve the high nutritional value in the grass.

Friends who study vitamins and refugees who are accustomed to eating Guanyin clay may wish to change their tastes and advocate eating grass, which can fill their stomachs, prolong life, and increase longevity!

### Odds and Ends

— Wang Wu

Chinese people love old things: aged Taidiao wine, Shaoxing thirty-year-old wine, old mountain ginseng, old brands... and so on. Literati use names such as "studio owner," "mountain man," and "lay Buddhist"... which is very much like relying on age to support oneself. In name, we can ignore it; in the present world, we should pursue the essence. If it is truly "old but vigorous," we should respect the elderly. But it is unnecessary to be precocious. If there are still "masters" in a democratic era, that is truly "old but not dead!"

I once observed a child's sleeping posture: mouth and eyes closed, with a slight smile, truly the most beautiful! But an adult over forty, still sleeps with his mouth open, or with his eyes half-open, his face frightening, which is another feeling.

Unaware that old age is approaching, we should work hard as soon as possible!

"If it fades, guaranteed refund and exchange,"

"Replace ten for every one broken,"

"Regardless of sacrificing capital, completely pleasing customers,"

This is the way of business. Shanghai merchants can recite them fluently. But their value is not as good as "try it on the spot to see if it works," which is relatively more decent.

### Accusation of Soviet Communist Party Member "Kravchenko"—A Brief History

— Gan Lai

(Editor: Mr. K's recent remarks accusing Stalin have been widely reported in domestic and foreign newspapers.)

In terms of his experience and behavior, Victor Kravchenko is indeed a noteworthy figure: he is a Soviet citizen, a Communist Party member, and a former senior official in the Soviet government. He is forty-one years old this year, and has been living in his country. In 1944, he was sent to the United States on official business, and suddenly announced in the United States that he was leaving the Soviet Communist Party. Recently, he went to the United Kingdom and wrote articles in the London newspaper "World News," accusing Stalin of actively preparing for war, and presented the Soviet Union's diplomatic and domestic policies as evidence. Kravchenko's words and actions have undoubtedly attracted international attention.

Joined the Communist Party Early

Victor Kravchenko was born in 1905 in Yekaterinoslav, Ukraine, Russia. His father was a revolutionary at the time, so he was influenced by revolutionary ideas from an early age. At that time, during the Tsarist regime, the royalists and revolutionaries formed two factions in armed and ideological opposition. Soon, the Russian Revolution of 1917 came, and he witnessed the chaotic civil war between the White Russians and the Red Russians. When Stalin announced the complete elimination of domestic rebel forces in 1929, Kravchenko tried every means to be allowed to join the Communist Party.

Mr. K was originally an industrial arts scholar. He was good at metallurgy, and at the same time, he was very enthusiastic in promoting party affairs. Therefore, he was once regarded by the people of the country as a rising star in the Soviet industrial arts field, and was loved and respected.

Doubts about Soviet Policy

However, after the October Revolution, the Soviet Union promulgated the decrees of "abolishing private land ownership" and "nationalizing industry," which caused serious agricultural production problems and resulted in famine. Mr. K began to have doubts about the Soviet Union's political policies, but like other tens of thousands of Soviet people (according to Mr. K himself), he could only keep all his doubts in his heart. When World War II broke out, he was assigned to be the captain of the engineering team of the Red Army, and later transferred to serve in the People's Committee. On April 4, 1944, he was dispatched to the United States by the Soviet Purchasing Committee to negotiate the purchase of goods. He took this opportunity to escape from the tiger's mouth and issued a statement in the United States announcing his departure from the Soviet Communist Party. This shocking behavior immediately made Kravchenko a figure valued by the American press. His every move, even half a word, was published on the front pages of American newspapers.

I Chose Freedom

After staying in the United States, Mr. K devoted himself to writing. At the beginning of this year, he completed his first book, "I Chose Freedom," which faithfully narrates his personal political career and private life, and reveals a lot about the true situation of rural life in the Soviet Union. It is a valuable source of information. If you want to understand Kravchenko's character and political views, you may wish to read it, and it can also help you understand the actual situation in the Soviet Union, because this book is a faithful report from a Soviet Communist Party member who grew up in the Soviet Union for thirty-nine years and witnessed it firsthand.
