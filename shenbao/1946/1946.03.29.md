[United Press, Peiping, 28th] As Executive Group Four of the Mediation Executive Department prepares to depart for the Northeast on the 29th, conflicts between the Nationalist and Communist armies have intensified in at least three areas. The situation in Changchun is also increasingly tense, with rumors circulating that Communist troops are infiltrating the city in large numbers, closely following the withdrawal of Soviet troops. According to the latest weather report, Executive Group Four is scheduled to depart on the morning of the 29th, each team including a U.S. Army Colonel. As of this evening, the destinations of the Executive Groups remain shrouded in secrecy, but it is expected that a special announcement will be made by the Mediation Executive Department upon their arrival.

Since arriving in Washington two weeks ago, Marshall has emphasized the need for immediate economic and material assistance to China.

[United Press, Chongqing, 28th] General Marshall's representative, Lieutenant General Gillem, has held several discussions with Chairman Chiang on military matters. It is generally expected that General Zhang Zhizhong, due to other work commitments, may be replaced in his role within the military subgroup. Reliable sources state that both Gillem and Zhou Enlai are trying to persuade Zhang Zhizhong to stay on so that he can jointly visit the Northeast according to the planned schedule, but the government generally believes that even though the Northeast issue is more important, Zhang should focus on dealing with the Xinjiang autonomy issue, which he is familiar with.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 28th] Zhang Zhizhong is scheduled to depart for Dihua on the 29th to negotiate the final agreement with the Ili representatives. People in the wartime capital expect that Zhang's trip will result in the signing of an agreement granting a high degree of autonomy to the people of Xinjiang and abolishing the so-called "East Turkestan Republic."

### Chairman Chiang's Address: A Letter to the Nation's Youth: Understand the Reality of the Nation, Transform the Environment, Promote the Revolutionary Spirit, and Fulfill the Mission of National Construction

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] On March 29th, the third Youth Day, Chairman Chiang issued a letter to the nation's youth, the full text of which is as follows:

Today is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, and also the first Youth Day after the end of the War of Resistance. In the 50-year process of the National Revolution, the youth were the most courageous in action and the most heroic in sacrifice. During the War of Resistance, the youth bore the heaviest responsibilities and performed the most arduous tasks. Now that the War of Resistance against Japan has come to a final victory and the foundation of the National Revolution has been initially established, coinciding with the auspicious occasion of Youth Day, the most excited in spirit and the most fervent in patriotism are naturally our vast youth. I deeply know that the youth of the whole country are celebrating the victory of the War of Resistance, and at the same time feeling the hardships after the war. In some places, the youth are facing situations where transportation is cut off, there is no way to return home, they lack the means to study, it is difficult to find employment, so that food and clothing are insufficient, and illness goes unreported, which is even more depressing than during the War of Resistance. The country will certainly strive to support and rescue you. I, personally, will do my best to find ways to alleviate your suffering. At the same time, I also hope that our youth will understand the reality of the nation, transform their own environment. As long as the youth of the whole country cherish the fruits of the War of Resistance, recognize the path of national construction, hold firm beliefs, strengthen their bodies and minds, and strive forward, they will surely be able to overcome the inevitable difficulties and the necessary stages after this war, and promote the revival of our nation.

Youth of the whole country, the War of Resistance is over, our country has entered a new era, and our revolution has also reached a new stage. The country makes strong demands on the youth, and the revolution also gives the youth a major mission. This demand is to maintain the independent and equal status of the country. This mission is to build a unified, democratic, prosperous, strong, and happy modern country. If we think that the unequal treaties have been abolished, and the independent and equal status of the country can be obtained, the aggressive power of Japan has collapsed, and the prosperous, strong, and happy situation of the country can be achieved without effort, and therefore we become negligent and slack, or even scattered and chaotic, that would be a huge mistake. This mistake will not only delay the life and career of our youth, but also plunge our nation into an irrecoverable abyss. You must know that the fruits of the revolutionary War of Resistance are hard-won and easily lost. The Father of the Nation said: "After the revolution destroys, it must be followed by revolutionary construction," and also said: "Building a house cannot be done suddenly, and so it is with building a country." Our country has undergone the destruction of a long War of Resistance, and must be followed by revolutionary extraordinary construction, in order to maintain its independent and equal status and stand on its own in the community of international societies. The fruits of victory that we have obtained through risking danger, facing difficulties, shedding blood, and sacrificing ourselves must not be lost through any negligence. The great cause of national construction that we have been pursuing day and night must not be frustrated through any carelessness. And being scattered and chaotic is even more of a dead end to self-destruction. The youth of the whole country must promote the spirit of the revolutionary War of Resistance, understand the needs of the nation, endure hardship and hard work, bear humiliation and heavy burdens, concentrate our strength, take unified steps, cultivate our great revolutionary personalities, promote the inherent spirit of our nation, ensure the independent and equal status of our country, and assume the mission of building a unified, powerful, and Three Principles of the People new China.

Our construction enterprise needs a peaceful environment, and the foundation of peace lies in the unity of the country. Without national unity, there can be no stability, and without national unity, there can be no independence. The Second World War made people all over the world feel the preciousness of peace, and China's long-term War of Resistance made our people all over the country recognize the preciousness of national unity, because unity is a prerequisite for national construction, so we must make the greatest and best efforts to promote its rapid realization. China has fought for the longest time and suffered the deepest war disasters. At this time when the war has ended, it is urgently necessary to recuperate and recuperate, to alleviate the people's suffering and restore national strength. Therefore, since the Japanese surrender, for six months, unity, unification, peace, and construction have become the unanimous demands of the whole country, and the common direction of the government and the people. The youth of the whole country must understand that reason is the starting point of peace, and patience is the foundation of unity, and must work together to fight for peace and unity.

Our revolution takes democratic constitutionalism as its final goal. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, we expected that the completion of constitutionalism and the victory of the War of Resistance would be achieved with all our strength in one battle. Now the National Government is expanding its foundation, requesting the participation of people from all aspects, and the National Assembly is about to be convened, and the Five-Power Constitution will be formulated. The youth of the whole country must cultivate the demeanor of democracy, cultivate the spirit of the rule of law, assist the country, serve the society, popularize national common sense, and improve academic standards, so as to establish a model of national politics. Three years ago, I told the youth of the whole country: "This war can also be said to be a cultural war. The success, failure, rise, and fall of nationalism, people's livelihoodism, and socialism in Europe in the past three hundred and fifty years are all in this battle. The rise and fall of China's five thousand years of long-standing culture and its moral spirit are also used as a touchstone in this battle. If this battle is not defeated by the hands of the aggressors, then human culture will be scrubbed clean, and Chinese culture will surely flourish." Now that the world's aggressors have been destroyed, it is the time for Chinese culture to flourish. Our democratic rule of law will have a more solid foundation as a result, and the Three Principles of the People will eventually achieve final success. And the excellent youth of the whole country must be clear about propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, so as to improve the personality and cultural level of our people.

Youth of the whole country, your situation is difficult, but your future is bright, your tasks are arduous, but your achievements are assured. The most brutal enemy of the Chinese nation has been defeated, and the most dangerous juncture of the National Revolution has been overcome. As long as the youth of the whole country cherish the fruits of the victory of the War of Resistance, cherish the independent and equal status of the country, love and respect themselves, be self-reliant and self-improving, love the country, love the nation, take responsibility, abide by discipline, and first devote themselves to ensuring peace and unity, develop the habit of democratic rule of law, improve academic and cultural standards, lay the foundation for the long-term stability of the country and the nation, unite and work together, then we will surely be able to build a modern country of the Three Principles of the People, prosperous, strong, and happy, to share the responsibility of world peace and security, and to complete the mission of our National Revolution.

### Soviet Representative Walks Out After Proposal Vetoed by Security Council; Representatives of the Four Powers Hold Secret Meeting

[This newspaper's dispatch] San Francisco, 28th (Radio): Soviet representative Gromyko has left the meeting after his request for the Security Council to postpone discussion of the Iranian issue was rejected. The Security Council has thus encountered an unprecedented crisis. Today, representatives of China, Britain, the United States, and France held a secret meeting to discuss ways to overcome the difficulties. It is heard that the Soviet representative has made it clear that the Soviet side can resume attending the meeting after the Security Council decides to postpone discussion of the Iranian issue.

[Central News Agency, New York, 27th Special Dispatch] Today, the Soviet proposal to postpone the discussion of the Iranian case until April 10 was rejected by a vote of nine to two in the United Nations Security Council. Soviet representative Gromyko and his three advisors then left the Security Council meeting hall at 5:25 p.m. When some reporters approached to inquire, Gromyko refused to comment.

[Central News Agency, New York, 27th United Press] In the Security Council, French representative Bonnet, American representative Byrnes, Soviet representative Gromyko, and some legal advisors and military officials from France and the Soviet Union, met this morning at the residence of French representative Bonnet, seeking to reach an agreement so that a report could be made and submitted to the Security Council. The meeting lasted for ninety minutes, and the result was that the United States and the Soviet Union each insisted on their completely opposite positions.

[Another dispatch] Security Council President Quo Tai-chi stated when the meeting began today: The group meeting has failed, and said sadly, "Therefore, we can only continue the discussion from where the committee appointed yesterday left off."

A Dramatic Rupture

[United Press, New York, 27th] The dramatic rupture of Soviet representative Gromyko leading his entourage out of the Security Council meeting hall can be said to have come suddenly. First, Gromyko directly informed the Council that the Soviet Union was unwilling to discuss the matter before April 10. Negotiations between the Soviet Union and Iran are in progress, and they do not want to interfere, and they firmly stated that at least an understanding has been reached between Moscow and Tehran on the issue of troop withdrawal. US Secretary of State Byrnes stated that the United States had received a formal report from Tehran stating that no agreement had been reached between Iran and the Soviet Union, and that the Security Council should immediately hear Iran's complaint and not delay it any longer. If the Council does not accept this case, the United Nations organization will die young due to its ineffectiveness and incompetence. The United States believes that the immediate acceptance of the Iranian case is extremely important for the future of the United Nations organization. Gromyko is the youngest diplomat among the eleven Council members, while French representative Bonnet is an old diplomat of the League of Nations. When Bonnet announced his support for Egypt's proposal to allow Iran to make an oral statement, Gromyko stood up and declared that he could no longer participate in the meeting and would leave immediately. After saying this, he left the seat with his entourage, walked out in great strides, and climbed into the car outside the door. Gromyko's expressionless attitude has long been known among his colleagues in the diplomatic world.

Iranian Ambassador Describes Soviet Demands

[United Press, New York, 28th] When Iranian Ambassador to the United Kingdom Arasteh was invited to make an oral statement in the United Nations Security Council, he stated that there was no secret agreement between Iran and the Soviet Union. He then described the experience of Iranian Prime Minister Sadr al-Din Sadr being ordered to go to Moscow in mid-February to hold talks with the Soviet side, saying that Sadr had requested the Soviet Union to withdraw troops as soon as possible without further delay, but the Soviet Union refused and made the following two suggestions: (1) Soviet troops will continue to be stationed indefinitely in some parts of Iran; (2) The Iranian government recognizes the international autonomy of the Azerbaijan province. If the Iranian government agrees to this, the Soviet Union is willing to take the following steps: (A) The Prime Minister of Azerbaijan uses the title of Governor-General to the Iranian central government; (B) The Azerbaijan government does not set up a Ministry of the Army or a Ministry of Foreign Affairs; (C) 30% of the financial revenue of Azerbaijan is returned to the Iranian central government; (D) All documents exchanged with the central government are in Persian; (E) The Soviet government abandons its demand for oil rights, but suggests forming an Iran-Soviet joint-stock company, with the Soviet Union accounting for 51% of the shares and Iran accounting for 49%. Sadr had no choice but to reject this request.

Editorial

### Inspiring Revolutionary Spirit: A Humble Admonition to the Chinese Nationalist Party

Today marks the anniversary of the heroic and mournful Huanghuagang Uprising martyrs! On this day thirty-five years ago, the Guangzhou Uprising, as described by the Father of the Nation, was "a final stand gathering elites of revolutionary parties from various provinces against the Manchus. Though the event failed, the heroic spirit of the seventy-two martyrs shook the world, truly creating the momentum for revolution in the country." Mention Huanghuagang, and everyone acknowledges it as the most magnificent and tragic scene in the revolutionary founding history of the Republic of China. The Father of the Nation also said, "The reward for the seventy-two martyrs after their death is not merely a memorial stele. The success of the revolution, China's prosperity and strength, and the happiness enjoyed by the entire nation, that is their great reward." Today, as we commemorate the revolutionary martyrs for the first time after the victory of the War of Resistance, the first thing we should do is ask ourselves: Have we made China prosperous and strong? Have we made all the people happy? If we, the survivors, with a clear conscience, cannot yet answer that we have, then the great reward that the revolutionary martyrs deserve after their sacrifice has not truly been received. This is the shame of the revolutionary party members, and also the shame of the Chinese people! And the reason this shame exists, to put it bluntly, stems from the decline of the revolutionary spirit. Today, if we do not commemorate the revolutionary martyrs, so be it; if we are to commemorate them, we must earnestly begin by inspiring the revolutionary spirit. We wish to take advantage of this precious memorial day to humbly say a few words to the Nationalist Party of China.

The Chinese Nationalist Party has indeed made indelible contributions to the history of transforming China. The history of China in the last hundred years is a history filled with bitterness and shame. Anyone who has briefly read Chapter 2 of "China's Destiny" understands the origin of national humiliation and the origin of the revolution. From the Revive China Society to the Tongmenghui and beyond, members of the Chinese Nationalist Party, united under the revolutionary banner of the Father of the Nation, stood at the forefront of the oppressed people of the entire country, engaging in more than fifty years of arduous and virtuous struggle to build China. They overthrew the Qing Dynasty and created the Republic; they overthrew Yuan Shikai and recreated the Republic; they eliminated the warlords and completed unification, and until the invasion of the brutal Japanese, they led the War of Resistance, fought hard for eight years, and finally achieved a glorious victory, and the unequal treaties that were the crystallization of a century of humiliation were finally wiped out. All of this is the immortal achievement of the revolutionary party members, especially the price of sacrifice of the revolutionary martyrs. We should feel very glorious and excited when we commemorate the martyrs after the victory, but today everyone seems to feel worried, anxious, and depressed, as if we have not yet seen the light. What is the reason for this? We believe that the root cause lies in the decline of the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary party members!

Only those with a vigorous and full revolutionary spirit have the courage to be fearless. And only with fearlessness can we move forward optimistically and overcome all current difficulties. The revolutionary spirit is none other than wisdom, benevolence, and courage, and consistently upheld with sincerity. The Chinese Nationalist Party was originally a revolutionary political party with the longest history and the largest number of members in modern Chinese history. Although many parties may stand side-by-side in the future, the Nationalist Party will still be the largest party responsible for leading peaceful nation-building. As long as each member of the Nationalist Party strengthens themselves, trusts each other, unites sincerely, and strives forward, then no resistance can prevent the success of the construction of a new China. The Nationalist Party will continue to have a bright future, and China will surely become an independent, self-reliant, strong, and prosperous new China. China and the Chinese Nationalist Party have become inseparable in modern history. We, the common people, hope that China will truly become a democratic new China, and we can only hope that the Nationalist Party members will revive their consistent revolutionary spirit of the past, first making the Nationalist Party a truly democratic and centralized political party, and then leading China onto the great road of true democracy. Only a democratic, united, and innovative Nationalist Party is the most powerful guarantee of a democratic and unified new China.

The revolution advocated by the Chinese Nationalist Party is a national revolution, not a class revolution. Since the national revolution is a revolution of the entire people, the political essence of the Nationalist Party should be to represent the entire people, and its political purpose is to unite the strength of the entire nation to build an independent, unified, and democratic new China. In the process of revolution, the Nationalist Party may have to consider reality, cope with the environment, and may slightly change its nation-building procedures, but in terms of the ideal of revolution, the Nationalist Party must not change its ultimate goal of implementing the Three Principles of the People. In order to realize the ideal of nationalism, the Nationalist Party should be willing to make China live in equality with all the nations of the world, and should never want to see China become a vassal of any foreign race. In order to realize the ideal of democracy, the Nationalist Party should adhere to its position of "separation of powers and functions" and "independence of the five powers" in the five-power constitution, and formulate systems, and the law should not be casually accommodated or fall into stereotypes, using parliamentary politics or class dictatorship to gloss over things with false democracy. In order to realize the ideal of people's livelihood, the Nationalist Party should, based on the principle of labor-capital coordination and social mutual assistance, quickly implement concrete measures to equalize land ownership and control capital, and must not let things drift, be timid, sit idly by and watch prices soar, labor unrest arise, leading to social unrest and the people living in misery, giving the international fifth column the opportunity to conspire to destroy China! Nationalist Party members can strengthen themselves, can trust each other, can adhere to the precious principles of the Three Principles of the People, think about the people everywhere, always plan for the country, do everything that is beneficial to the country and the people, no matter how difficult it is, and do everything that harms the country and the people, no matter where it comes from or who it comes from, must be eliminated with all efforts, then the people of the whole country will follow the Nationalist Party to devote themselves to the construction of the country. Otherwise, if we only sing good tunes and do not do good deeds, and are weak and incompetent ourselves, and only focus on compromise and accommodation, then the revolutionary spirit will be completely exhausted, what hope is there?

Today, as we commemorate the revolutionary martyrs, and think of the difficulty of creating the Republic, we cannot but express our most sincere and deepest expectations for the Nationalist Party. If the Nationalist Party revives its revolutionary spirit, the government will definitely be strong; if the government is strong, the many major problems facing the country, both internal and external, can be solved easily. The National Government will soon expand its organization, and the National Assembly for Constitution-making will also be convened soon. China is now facing the eve of its second nation-building, and we truly need the spirit of the Huanghuagang Uprising martyrs to be popularized among all Nationalist Party members, and from Nationalist Party members to be popularized among the youth across the country. The blood of the martyrs, the flower of the revolution, the result of careful irrigation and extension, all corrupt and evil forces will be swept away by this revolutionary spirit. And the Father of the Nation's saying, "China is prosperous and strong, and the people of the whole country enjoy happiness," the great reward of the martyrs will one day be fully realized!

### A Commoner President: Truman Takes Morning Walks, Top Reporters and Democratic Party Members Miss Him

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th Dispatch] Reporters who are accustomed to rising late and specializing in covering news from the White House were quite disoriented today by the President's unscheduled movements. These distinguished reporters arrived at the White House press room at 9 a.m. this morning to conduct their usual interviews and discovered that President Truman had already gone out for a walk alone, accompanied by several secret service agents. What made it even more embarrassing for them was that President Truman had already taken such walks several times without them noticing. It was not until someone phoned the White House this morning to inquire that they discovered the matter. This commoner President of the United States really does not want to be confined within the iron gates of the White House, and has therefore appeared in public places many times on a regular or ad hoc basis, shocking the secret service agents responsible for his safety. It seems that after being in the White House for nearly a year, President Truman has finally realized that his personal actions are being watched by the public.

[US Information Agency, Washington, 28th Dispatch] President Truman presented Congressional Medals of Honor to two American heroes yesterday.

We have won the war and are now working to win the peace. We now have well-trained citizens to help us achieve peace."

This provisional council in the transition period has been expanded from the original 25 members to 50, which is a significant expansion and progress compared to the pre-war provisional council. However, regrets are still unavoidable. In the upcoming elections, the number of seats will be further expanded, and more civic leaders will emerge to participate. After the war, the people are eager for governance. The government needs a large amount of economic support during the recovery period. Only when the government and the people blend together can we overcome these difficulties."

Inspector Cheng's Words Predict Success

Inspector Cheng Cangbo also delivered a speech: "Today, your council is established. Your council can truly share responsibility with me, and I also feel that I have gained a lot of courage. From now on, I will follow the councilors, work together, speak for the people, and do things for the people. I wish the council success."

Deputy Speaker Xi Expresses Hopes

Finally, Deputy Speaker Xi Yushu delivered a speech, saying: "If Shanghai's economy and finance are stable, then the whole of China will also have a solution. Shanghai's development and important position in the world is also the glory of the whole country. In this short period of time, we must all do our best to lay a solid foundation for Shanghai's security. This is not just my personal wish, but also the intention of all the attendees. Our abilities are limited. I hope that local people will provide guidance from time to time."

Councilors Expressed Opinions

The councilors then freely expressed their opinions, advocating for the establishment of an agenda first and inquiring whether questions could be raised regarding municipal reports. Wang Genzhong proposed that council meetings should not follow the old-fashioned style, but should truly cooperate with the public. It would be better for the bureaus to report in writing to avoid wasting time, and he also advocated dividing into fourteen groups to go to various public places on Sundays to gather public opinion and advise the government. The chairman said that all bureaus should use written reports to minimize oral reports. The councilors had various suggestions for collecting public opinion, with some advocating for the establishment of suggestion boxes by district, and others agreeing to sending by registered mail. In the end, Councilor Feng Youzhen said that both methods could be used, and that news about this matter should be disclosed in the newspapers so that citizens could use whichever procedure they chose. The deputy speaker reported that the reports of each bureau during the meeting were limited to one hour, and councilors could ask questions during the remaining time. More seats for observers would be added as much as possible in the future, and each councilor could be issued two observer passes. The meeting schedule would be slightly changed by the secretary-general. Councilor Feng Youzhen suggested that meetings should start on time in the future. If the meeting did not start on time at 8:00 AM, it would be better to move it back one hour. After a vote, it was decided to start at 9:00 AM. The Secretary-General read four telegrams from the Municipal Councilors: (1) To Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen and Vice President Weng Wenhao; (2) To the Councils of all Provinces and Cities in the Country; (3) Paying Respects to Chairman Chiang; (4) To the Elders of this City.

Paying Respects to the Chairman in a Telegram

The full text of the telegram paying respects to the Chairman is as follows: "To Chairman Chiang of the Chongqing National Government: With the sea corner newly pacified and the founding of the nation beginning, the people eagerly desire governance and seek to live and work in peace. We admire your Excellency's ability to turn the tide and overcome great difficulties. With compassion in your heart and benevolence covering all, your achievements since the beginning of the people are most remarkable. We, the members of this council, have been ordered to participate in deliberations, and we will all consider the difficulties of the times, concentrate our thoughts, carefully consider the hardships, and investigate public sentiment, in order to live up to your Excellency's power to protect the great achievements and assist the world in lasting peace. We respectfully send this telegram to express our sincerity and pay our respects. Xu Jiguang, Speaker of the Shanghai Provisional Council, Xi Yushu, Deputy Speaker, and all Councilors."

Opinions on the Problem of Commodity Prices

Finally, regarding the problems of commodity prices, labor, and factory resumption in this city, which are closely related to the citizens of the city, the councilors have put forward opinions, requesting the government to abolish the special commissioner's office, and also proposed that the Japanese Military Administration Office, the German Overseas Chinese Management Committee, the Enemy Property Administration Bureau, and the special representatives of the Ministry of Economic Affairs should make public reports to the Municipal Council. Although the principle was passed, the procedure for deciding whether the report should be written or oral and whether it was based on legal principles caused the councilors to argue for about an hour. The Deputy Speaker used the four words "deeply felt pain" to express the spirit of the councilors speaking out for the people. In the end, it was tentatively decided to telegram the Executive Yuan first and ask the central agencies to inform the special commissioners to issue reports. The meeting adjourned at 6:20 PM.

Recently, factories in the city have resumed operations one after another, and the demand for electricity has reached 118,000 kilowatts. The company feels that the load is too heavy and cannot supply it. Therefore, it put forward three suggestions to the Public Utilities Bureau: (1) Quickly negotiate emergency load reduction measures; (2) Use nighttime to supply electricity to factories to reduce the daytime electricity load; (3) Directly transmit electricity to Pudong and Nanshi to reduce the loss through the Zhabei line. Yesterday afternoon at 10:00 AM, the Public Utilities Bureau convened representatives of the four companies in the conference room of the bureau to discuss electricity supply relief measures.

It was also reported that the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company has an original generator that can generate 30,000 kilowatts of electricity. It is currently actively repairing it, and it will be able to generate electricity soon. The government has also ordered a 24,000-kilowatt diesel engine from the United States, which will be allocated to the city's electricity company for use as soon as it arrives.

After Wu's wife, Tian, pleaded, they agreed to meet at the Da Zhonghua Cafe on Xizang Road at 2 PM that afternoon. At the meeting, Xu was accompanied by Li Gongzhi and He Guangzhong. After repeated requests from Wu's wife, the amount was reduced to five gold bars, to be delivered at the Hongmian Restaurant at 2 PM the following day. At the appointed time, Wu's wife only delivered one gold bar and 300,000 Legal Tender, stating that the remaining amount would be delivered after she found a way to obtain it.

At this point, Captain Yan stepped forward and apprehended him, recovering the stolen goods, and instructed his men to take him back to the team headquarters for detention. Meanwhile, they continued to wait. Soon after, Li Gongzhi and the mastermind, Xu Zengxun, arrived. Wu's wife identified them without error, and they were all arrested.

### 400,000 Yuan Lost at Tram Station: Yan Xixian Returns Money Found, Hoping the Owner Claims It Within Ten Days

Our reader, Mr. Xi Xian, came to our office yesterday morning and stated: "I recently came to Shanghai from Haimen. At around 7 PM on the 27th, while passing by the tram station near the Lin Sen East Road Taishan Branch, there was heavy rain. I noticed a cloth package left beside the station. I opened it and found 400,000 yuan inside. I shouted loudly to find the owner, but no one claimed it for a long time. Thinking that the owner must be very anxious about losing such a large sum of money, I have specially sent it to your newspaper for public notice. The claim period is ten days. If no one claims it after that period, it should be used for charitable purposes to bring blessings to the owner." (Editor's Note) This money is currently being held temporarily by this column. We hope the owner will come to our office with a guarantor to claim it. We express our sincere admiration for Mr. Yan's honesty and warm-heartedness.

### Dumping Three Million in Unified Bonds, Only to Run Away: See the Fate of Speculators!

After government bonds hit a new high the day before yesterday, a major player dumped three million unified Class C bonds. Due to squeezing and resentment, he ran away, dragging down multiple operators. Yesterday, the market stopped trading and convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures. As a result, there were no large transactions, only some black market trades in the corridors. Generally, miscellaneous brands slightly declined, and Class C bonds still rose slightly, but with less reliability. Yesterday, Chinese stocks were extremely erratic because banks are closed today and it's Saturday tomorrow. To avoid risks, operators ended part of this week's transactions yesterday, and will resume next week. As a result, many parties were eager to sell, and signs of exhaustion occurred frequently in the middle of the day. However, they were pulled up again at noon. By the afternoon close, familiar large stocks had fallen slightly, while small stocks rose another half a percent. Lesser-known stocks, due to their low prices, attracted many buyers and rose again, especially small ones, which rose by about 20%. Due to the market closure in the afternoon, futures trading was not opened. Foreign stocks were similar to Chinese stocks, with small stocks slightly better and large stocks slightly lower except for Wheelock Marden.

### Gold Prices Continue to Fall, Market Will Likely Become Quiet

Yesterday, raw gold remained flat and weak, with narrow fluctuations and few transactions. The market was extremely sluggish. It opened flat in the morning, and after opening, supply exceeded demand, resulting in a slight decline. The Bank of China's allocation price did not change, so there was no reason for dealers to register. Later, a low price of 1.52 million was seen, and then stabilized slightly. At noon, it was around 1.53 million. The afternoon was even quieter. As a result, it closed 15,000 lower than the previous close. Gold ornaments were listed at 168,000, refined silver at 1,600, and silver dollars were being sold at 1,150 yuan. Due to speculators closing out their positions, the underground lending market was very loose, and interest rates fell to 15-18%.

### Hong Kong Dollar Falls, US Dollar Stable

Foreign currency, US dollars, remained stable and were not affected by the fall in the gold market. This is because the US Senate is maintaining the original price of silver, so raising the price of gold is unlikely. In addition, some cotton settlements have not been approved, so importers still rely on US dollars. Gold remained at 780 yuan per ten taels, with a trend towards further increases, reaching a high of around 1,970 yuan and a low of no more than 1,960 yuan. The market was very stable at noon and in the afternoon, slightly lower by 10 yuan compared to the previous close. Old Hong Kong dollars initially fell below 420 yuan, but were then slightly pulled up by telegraphic transfers. As a result, it still fell by 5 yuan. New Hong Kong dollars were flat and weak. (One) series dollars for 1936 closed unchanged from the previous close. However, (Two) series dollars and 1937 dollars fell by 10 yuan due to low demand, widening the price difference. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were 440 yuan, and rupees were 540 yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Brokers Apply for Adjustment of Commission

[Our Correspondent] The sixteen foreign exchange brokers have felt that the commission rate set by the Central Bank has been too low since they began operating. The Central Bank has stated that this commission rate will be tried for one month, and then adjustments can be applied for as appropriate. As the one-month period is about to expire, the foreign exchange brokers are preparing to apply for adjustments. It is reported that the new commission rate has been approved by the designated banks after consultation and will be submitted to the Central Bank for approval.

Also, according to the responsible authorities of the Bank of China, all foreign exchange settlement matters across the country can now be handled in Shanghai. Therefore, there is no need for individual opening of foreign exchange markets in various places at present. Once settlement is numerous and there is a business necessity, they will consider further liberalization.

### Jianye Textile Prices Reduced, Yarn and Cotton Transactions Sluggish

Yesterday, the yarn market stabilized. Guangdong dealers still have an appetite for high-grade 20-count yarn, with Shuang Ma brand standing firm between 1.13 million and 1.14 million. Guangming brand 16-count yarn also rose slightly by 10,000 yuan or so. Fine yarn was still ordinary. At noon, Jianye Textile Company issued its usual prices. 42-count Qing brand yarn was again listed at just under 70,000, while 40-count Maiden brand was priced at 1.88 million, actually 360,000 lower than the market price on the 25th. Other counts of yarn were all priced down by several tens of thousands. Dealers, seeing that the company was selling at a discount again and again, seemed unwilling to bid. It is said that Jianye will be closed today for the weekend and will sell cotton cloth and woolen products on Saturday.

Yesterday, New York cotton prices fluctuated, with near-term prices firm and far-term prices weak, up or down 11-16 points. Recent-term cotton was priced at US$27.13, and far-term cotton at US$27.02. Spot Mitrelin cotton had no market. Local spot cotton transactions remained sluggish. Only the privately-owned Zhongxin No. 5 Factory purchased 400 bales of fine velvet cotton raw materials, priced at 94,000 yuan per bale by Zhongji, and 86,000 yuan per bale by Mitrelin, both factory-delivered prices. In addition, Jianye Textile Company, private yarn mills, and cotton brokers are all taking a wait-and-see approach and have taken no action. (The yarn and cloth markets will be closed as usual on the 29th for the Huanghuagang Memorial Day.) Most will wait until after the market reopens before making purchases.

### Cloth Market Gradually Shows Signs of Life

Standard cloth is showing a trend towards activity as dealers from Sichuan, Changsha, Hankou, and other places are roughly ready to purchase. As the weather improves, the prospects should improve.

Dyeing and weaving factories are frequently dyeing printed yarn and plain yarn, and have prepared a considerable stock. Once the weather warms up, they will launch a large-scale offensive.

### Scarcity of Waterproof Cloth in Stock

In the woolen fabric market, transactions in Zhongfang 500 brand Serge were still active, but the rest showed no improvement. However, there was strong sales of waterproof cloth for raincoats. Western-style clothing dealers and raincoat factories were all actively purchasing, but unfortunately, the market supply was very scarce and difficult to find. Prices have risen another 300-500 yuan per yard compared to before.

### Java's Tea and Sugar: Tea Production Has Decreased, Sugar Reserves About 1.4 Million Tons

[Reuter, Batavia, 28th] It is estimated that 22% of the 2.6 million acres of tea plantations in Java were taken over by the Japanese in 1942 and uprooted. In mid-1945, the area of tea plantations not destroyed totaled 134,000 acres. Total Javanese tea production in 1944 was 3.4 million kilograms, a decrease of 900,000 kilograms compared to 1943. Of the 220 tea factories existing in 1941, 50 continued to operate, while the rest were destroyed or converted to making textiles and explosives. On the east coast of Sumatra, the total area of tea plantations was 54,000 acres, of which 15,000 acres were uprooted and 3,000 acres had their small branches cut off. Sumatran tea production in 1944 was estimated at 6 million kilograms, only 10% of 1941 production.

[Associated Press, London, 28th] According to investigations, Java currently has 1.4 million tons of sugar reserves, and there may be more inland. They have not yet been shipped out in large quantities, but this amount is obviously not much compared to the global sugar shortage. According to estimates at the beginning of this year, sugar production for 1945-46 was approximately 24.6 million tons, while pre-war consumption was 30 million tons. The global sugar stock is currently unknown, but it must be significantly different from the pre-war figures. Authorities believe that the full restoration of free trade in sugar will take some time.

### Silk Continues to Weaken

Yesterday, the transaction price for 80% average grade silk was 2.45 million yuan for five bales. Asking prices for ordinary factory silk were short, with dry warp slightly better selling, with prices similar to the previous day. No. 120 Tianqiao brand rayon opened at 1.58 million yuan and closed at 1.61 million yuan, with very little price fluctuation compared to the previous day. No. 75 bright rayon traded at 2.5 million yuan. The silk market was uniformly weak, with American Asian quilt covers at 1.06 million yuan per 100 pieces, down 80,000-90,000 yuan from the previous day, and transactions were still scarce. The price of Dacheng check crepe was reduced by another 30 yuan per yard, and goods from Shengze were also weak.

### Rice Prices Gradually Decrease, Oil and Soybean Cakes Are Generally Weak

The rice market is experiencing sluggish sales and entering a weak phase. Both japonica rice and glutinous rice have seen price drops of 500 to 600 yuan. White rice is moving slowly, with prices down 1,000 yuan. Indica rice is flooding the market, but there are few buyers, causing a price drop of 1,000 yuan. Both supply and demand for flour are low. The Ningbo traders are active, but sales are not strong, and prices are temporarily stable. Bran is not selling well, with prices down 200 to 300 yuan. Soybean cake sales are stagnant. Changzhou and Wuxi oil factories continue to sell, but buyers are taking a wait-and-see approach, resulting in a further price decrease of 300 to 400 yuan. There are few small-scale transactions of yellow soybeans on the local market, and few inquiries from other regions. Prices have fallen by 600 to 700 yuan. High-quality soybeans are holding steady. The oil market continues to receive supplies from various sources. There is still optimism about the scarcity of raw oil. Soybean oil remains firm. If the weather clears, there is hope that rice prices will continue to decrease.

### Explosions in Northern Anhui, Goods Arrive in Shanghai

The Longda freighter, operated by the Dada Datong joint venture, returned to Shanghai yesterday from Hankou. It transported over 2,280 bags of rapeseed and 1,010 bags of soybeans from Yanhu, as well as 380 bags of wheat. It is docked at the Dada wharf in Nanshi for unloading.

### Soft Competition in the White Coal Market, Slight Increase in the Bituminous Coal Market

The white coal market is weak. The price of screened lump coal is fluctuating at a soft level, with further slight declines. It is rumored that coal briquette manufacturers will receive a preferential allocation of coal dust. Transactions are quiet, and market prices are soft. The supply and demand of bituminous coal screened lump are balanced, and market prices rarely change. Bituminous coal traders do not have abundant inventory. However, since factories have been allocated coal, sales have significantly decreased, and market prices have sharply declined. Prices are now close to allocation prices, and traders are reluctant to sell at such low prices. Therefore, with slight purchases, prices rise again, and the market is fluctuating. In the end, various goods see a slight increase. Due to the rainy weather, charcoal is arriving wet and unsalable. Traders are unwilling to purchase it, resulting in sluggish sales and weak market prices. River and stream charcoal is selling for 17,000 yuan per load, and pine firewood is selling for 4,300 yuan per load.

### Imported Electrical Materials Are Dumped, Domestic Products Are Difficult to Maintain

With full-scale reconstruction, the domestic demand for common industrial materials is increasing. However, the larger electrical equipment manufacturers in Shanghai are still struggling. According to the person in charge of the Shanghai factory of the Central Electrical Equipment Factory of the Resources Committee, the factory took over six enemy and puppet electrical factories in Shanghai. They were all small in scale and have already started production. The manufactured products include copper wire, rubber wire, decorative wire, transformers, motors, electric copper, and copper sheets. Except for copper and yarn, which can be purchased locally, many imported raw materials are also required. Combined with high labor costs, the selling price of the manufactured products only covers the cost. Recently, British merchants in Shanghai have been dumping various pre-ordered electrical materials and equipment, with selling prices 60% to 75% lower than current market prices in Shanghai. If the pre-ordered goods arrive in port in the future, the market will be flooded with goods, and market prices will be significantly affected. At that time, Shanghai's electrical factories will be unable to compete. Therefore, factories such as Huacheng, Huasheng, and Huatong have not yet started production, and only Huade Factory is manufacturing light bulbs.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Today (the 29th) is Memorial Day for revolutionary martyrs. Banks, money shops, and markets in the city are closed for the day. A summary of yesterday's market conditions is as follows:

Tea: Wenzhou Pre-Ming Dragon Well tea may be available by the end of the month. Traders have no interest in old stock, resulting in a sharp decline in transactions and further price declines.

Sugar: The sugar market tightened slightly yesterday. Medium-grade sugar sold for 48,750 yuan to 49,000 yuan at the Public Association, and North Market sold for 51,000 yuan, while snow-white sugar sold for 53,500 yuan to 54,000 yuan.

### To Reduce People's Losses, Uniform Bonds Should Be Appropriately Handled

— Jing Zhi

Since the black market for Uniform Bonds moved to the Overseas Chinese Building after the destruction of its old nest in Zheng Huo Lou, it has become increasingly prosperous. Despite Minister Yu's written statement, it has continued to reach new highs in recent days. Various problems with settlements have been reported in this newspaper. Over the years, there have been frequent reports of account defaults and settlement problems. General customers have repeatedly suffered losses and have no legal protection. After reaching a new high price the other day, a major player sold more than 3 million yuan of Class C bonds and did not fulfill the settlement procedures. The relevant firms waited until late at night without being able to resolve the issue. We strongly agree with enhancing the credibility of national bonds. However, on the other hand, the status of legal tender should be taken into account (the face value of Uniform Bonds is denominated in national currency, but the legal tender issued before the war also stated that it was payable in national currency upon presentation). Regarding Uniform Bonds, mixed bonds are falling by half. Bonds without coupons for the 31st year, bonds with slight stains, or bonds below 1,000 yuan that do not form a whole of 10,000 are not accepted. The speculation and manipulation of Uniform Bonds are obvious. Since Minister Yu has made a statement, we hope that the authorities will quickly take appropriate measures because those currently engaged in government bond speculation are mostly speculators and idle funds. The higher the ball is kicked, the greater the damage suffered by the final holders. Since the government cannot prevent bond market activities, it is obliged to reduce unexpected losses for the people.

### Hubei Education Department Stipulates: Student Meal Fees Should Be Collected Monthly

It Is Forbidden to Order Payment in One Lump Sum

[Our Newspaper, Hankou] In order to make it easier for students to raise funds for meals, the Hubei Provincial Education Department has recently stipulated that all provincial, municipal, county, and private secondary schools should collect student meal fees on a monthly basis for this semester and may not order payment in one lump sum. All student meal fees collected should be deposited in public banks in full and may not be misappropriated arbitrarily. (Jian)

### Guangxi University Still Moves to Guilin

Classes Will Resume Next Month

Recruit Some Students to Go to Wuzhou

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing] According to the Central News Agency: Guangxi University previously experienced student unrest due to the school relocation issue. The Ministry of Education sent Inspector Tong Da-xun to Liuzhou last month to handle the matter. After investigation, it was found that the temporary school site borrowed from the Women and Children's Work-Study School of the 16th Army Corps in the Liujiang Zhugujiang River was indeed insufficient. Chairman Huang Xu-chu agreed to allocate all the houses of the Guilin Central Wireless Equipment Factory and all the remaining houses of the Liangfeng original school as the permanent school site for the university. The school authorities have been ordered to start repairs and preparations for relocation, with the aim of resuming classes in mid-April. Efforts are also being made to recruit some students who went to Wuzhou to report to Guilin in time.

### Private Schools in This City Petition, Requesting Subsidies from the Municipal Government

[This City News] Jiang Jizhou and other directors of the Private Primary and Secondary School Federation went to the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday morning to meet with Deputy Director Li Ximou and stated the economic difficulties of private schools, saying: The tuition fees of private schools are collected in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Education Bureau, referring to the treatment of teachers and staff in municipal schools, with a monthly salary of 30,000 yuan for primary school teachers and 40,000 yuan for secondary school teachers as the standard. Recently, prices in the city have soared. When the Education Bureau stipulated the amount of tuition fees in January, the cost of living index was 520 times that of the 25th year, and when the school started charging fees this semester, the cost of living index had risen to more than 1,800 times, and now it has exceeded 2,000 times. The salaries of teachers and staff in private schools are less than half of those of ordinary workers. They are not well-fed or warm. They requested the municipal government to subsidize private schools and allow them to continue collecting the second tuition fee. Deputy Director Li expressed great concern for the difficult situation of private schools and expressed his opinion that the municipal government has approved 54 million yuan for the government's subsidy to private schools, and the bureau intends to request additional allocations. As for private schools collecting the second tuition fee, it is also under consideration to alleviate the current difficulties of private schools.

### Qingdao City Starts Work on Adding Desks and Chairs

Two Thousand Yuan From the Branch of the Executive Yuan

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 28th] During the enemy and puppet occupation of Qingdao, half of the desks and chairs used in primary and secondary schools in Qingdao were damaged, totaling more than 20,000 sets. After the victory, students from various counties in eastern Shandong fled to Qingdao, and the population gathered in Qingdao. Schools temporarily adopted a two-shift system, dividing students into morning and afternoon classes, taking in as many students as possible, or even four people sharing a desk, and some even standing in the classroom to listen to lectures. At the request of the Education Bureau, the Shandong Qingdao Branch of the Executive Yuan sent personnel to investigate and subsidized the Education Bureau with 20 million yuan to start work on adding desks and chairs within a limited time through work relief methods.

### Symposium on Living Problems

Hosted by the Shanghai Secondary Education Research Association

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Secondary Education Research Association held a symposium on living problems for colleagues from various private schools at 7:00 p.m. on the 27th at Minli Middle School. Despite the heavy rain, more than 100 representatives from various schools still arrived and spoke enthusiastically. They did not disperse until 11:00 p.m. The following conclusions were obtained at that time: (1) The treatment of each school is an average of 450 yuan per hour for junior high school and 550 yuan per hour for senior high school, earning 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per month. (2) According to the current minimum standard of living, at least 200,000 yuan per month is sufficient to support a family of several people. (3) The solution is that, in addition to the fact that some schools' finances are not public, the bureau should be ordered to make them public, and the bureau should provide universal relief. Because the fees collected by each school are limited and cannot be improved, and education is a national undertaking, the purpose and spirit of colleagues' service are not divided between public and private, and the authorities should not discriminate. It was also decided that the association would first unite with various colleagues' organizations in the education sector to request the bureau. If they do not get the point, they will carry out a general petition.

### Our Ministry of Education Establishes Scholarships in the United States

Encouraging American Soldiers to Study Chinese Science

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th Special Dispatch] The U.S. Department of State announced today that the Chinese Ministry of Education has established ten scholarships in the United States to encourage U.S. military personnel who served in the China theater during World War II to study Chinese science.

### American Education Group Arrives in Japan to Reform Japanese Education

[French News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] An American education delegation, at the request of General MacArthur, came here to reform Japanese education and was received by Emperor Hirohito of Japan today.

### Youth Day Celebrated Today, Grand Sports Performance, Health Competition for Middle School Students Held Today and Tomorrow

Today is the 3rd Youth Day. In order to show its celebration, the sports authorities have organized various sports performances.

The former had two new players, Wen Tuoer and Shi Laituo, who were not registered, but they were still on the field and their momentum was strong. However, at the beginning of the game, Liangxi also posed a threat. After 8 to 6, Jiangwan was at ease and advanced steadily. Liangxi had no choice. The first half was 37 to 23, and Liangxi resisted once in the second half. Zhang Shaoqing and Zhuo Guorong worked hard again, but the strength difference was still far away. Only the American soldiers were active. In the end, Jiangwan won 77 to 44.

### Concerning the Discussions at the Political Consultative Conference and the Current Situation in Various Regions: Councilors Offer Candid Remarks

— Special Dispatch from Chongqing by Zhao Hongsheng, Our Correspondent (Dated the 24th by Airmail)

Regarding the issue of the Political Consultative Conference, a tense atmosphere had long been brewing within the Council. Councilors, coming from all parts of the country, measured the various aspects of the Political Consultative Conference against the realities of their localities, and it was no wonder that they were filled with grief and indignation. Ms. Wu Yifang presided over the assembly, and perhaps only her talent and strength could control the emotions of the crowd so that they would not descend into chaos.

Determined to Implement Resolutions

Mr. Shao Lizi held a newspaper carrying the full text of the Political Consultative Conference's closing ceremony and resolutions as his "battle report." He constantly quoted Chairman Chiang's words to illustrate the importance of the various issues discussed at the Political Consultative Conference. His glasses flashed as he adjusted them, and his tone grew increasingly elevated. Finally, he said that he would like to state on behalf of the government that the government was absolutely determined to earnestly implement all the resolutions. All rumors spread by various parties from outside were not credible.

Next, Zhang Xingzuo gave a report related to the Political Consultative Conference on the cessation of military conflict, the restoration of transportation, the streamlining of the military, and the plan for unifying the Communist forces. A large stack of inquiries began to be read out. The first person to read them had excellent vocal expression, and was able to convey the emotions expressed in the words very vividly.

Zhang Legu recounted that after the cessation of conflict, the 15th Regiment of the 5th Brigade of the Communist forces outside Qingdao City advanced more than one hundred li and entered Qingdao City on February 26. He asked whether the resolutions of the Consultative Conference could be truly implemented. Sa Mengwu inquired whether, in addition to the various parties, there were also non-partisan representatives participating in the conference. Now that there were more than 400 million people in the country who were non-partisan, he asked which segment of the non-partisan population these representatives represented. The entire hall erupted in laughter.

"Pocket Squad" Activities

Zhang Liangxiu questioned the increase in the number of National Assembly representatives, while the People's Political Council, representing the will of the people, had vanished without a trace. He felt that it was too disadvantageous not to have a party affiliation. Wang Guoyuan asked on what legal basis the conference was established. How could a small number of ambitious politicians from a single party or faction represent the people of the entire country? He argued that the addition of new National Assembly representatives should be based on fair elections, allocating seats according to the strength of the parties, which was truly absurd. He thoroughly opposed all of this, advocating for the cancellation of all these illegal decisions. Councilor Zhang Zhiguang said that since the "successful" conclusion of the conference, it had not brought peace and stability. The Communist Party was taking the opportunity to run wild, implementing many strange and bizarre policies in the "Liberated Areas," such as the "Alarm Squads" that went around grabbing food, the "Eavesdropping Squads" that specialized in espionage, and the "Pocket Squads" that plundered the people's food. If a couple had a quarrel, they would encourage them to divorce, causing all kinds of disturbances, which were even worse than the enemy puppets in the past.

Weeping and Paying Respects

Ma Yifeng stated that after listening to the report, standing from the position of the people and his conscience, he could not help but say a few words. He inquired whether transportation had been restored since the Consultative Conference closed, whether the Communist Party had opened the areas they had locked down, and whether the military, government, and political affairs had been unified… He stated affirmatively: absolutely not! In fact, things were getting worse and worse! He said that all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference were merely a blank sheet of paper, a "heavenly book" written in black ink. Finally, in the name of the people, he paid "weeping and respectful homage" to all these resolutions! Tan Pingyou wrote with his trembling hand whether all these resolutions would be jointly observed.

This is Negotiating without Cooperation

Zhang Shouyue said that since the Political Consultative Conference, disputes had been increasing. "You tolerate, but I do not tolerate; you concede, but I do not concede." He asked how many copies of major national newspapers could be sold in the "Liberated Areas." Was there freedom of the press there? Could the various parties operate there? A certain councilor proposed that the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference be subjected to a general public judgment based on national conscience! Was such a conference becoming a shortcut for ordinary people to organize political parties and seek official positions? If in the future two or three people formed a political party and demanded official positions from the government, how would the government cope? What was the standard for so-called "social elites," and how many "elites" were there in society? Zhao Gonglu also asked what criteria were used to judge "elites," and whether the people were at ease with them. He also mentioned that within nine days of the close of the Consultative Conference, the Communist Party had captured nineteen counties. Where was the "success" that Mr. Shao Lizi had just spoken of? Wu Yunchu asked, with the various parties occupying ninety percent of the new National Assembly seats, where were the people placed? Tan Pingshan said that this was "negotiating without cooperation." He Baozhen said that this was truly "strange and bizarre" democracy, and that the number of National Assembly representatives from the Democratic League was even greater than the number of people they could represent! Chen Jidian asked whether the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference had to be approved by the highest authority of the various parties, and whether they also had to be approved by a body representing the will of the people? He also mentioned when the Communist forces in the Northeast would be downsized. Li Yu said that drafting and implementing a constitution was the proper function of the National Assembly, and that the Consultative Conference was engaged in constitution-making work. What legal basis did it have? Li Jianzhi said that the so-called nationalization of the military was actually the fragmentation of the military and the nation.

There Are Too Few Elites

Liao Xuefeng wrote: only seventy seats in the National Assembly representatives were allocated to social elites. In Confucius's time, among his three thousand disciples, there were seventy-two worthy ones. Now, China's population is hundreds of millions, and the descendants of the seventy-two worthy ones have multiplied repeatedly, so their number must be considerable. Yet, the National Assembly representatives only have seventy-two social elites, which is two fewer than the worthy ones in Confucius's time, which is far too few. Another councilor asked whether the representatives of the Political Consultative Conference had seen today's news from the New China Daily. Was the Consultative Conference able to allow the people of the whole country to live and work in peace? There were indeed problems.

Passing a Special Review Committee

Most of the thirty-four written inquiries were from councilors from various regions, and the unified voice was one of dissatisfaction. After the inquiries were read out, the chairman stood up to report that Yin Shuxian and over sixty others had proposed a temporary motion requesting the assembly to organize a special review committee to review the issues of the Political Consultative Conference. Of the 158 councilors present that day, the motion passed with 148 votes.

The first oral inquiry was from Kong Lingcan. He recounted that the Communist Party was forcing people to move in various regions to sever their social ties. During the war of resistance, people "had a home but could not return." Now, they "had no home to call their own." They were also forcing men and women to pair up indiscriminately in various regions, disrupting the entire social order. Everyone should pay attention to all of this. Wang Puhan said that in the Consultative Conference, only parties were seen, not the people. The method of producing National Assembly representatives was unclear. Although he himself was an old National Assembly representative, he was also dissatisfied with the great concessions made by the old representatives to preserve their seats. Wu Chunwu said that in the Consultative Conference, he only heard about competing for National Assembly seats, National Government Committee seats, and so on… very little was mentioned about transportation, reconstruction, prices, and other things that would truly solve the people's suffering.

The Uproar Returns to Quiet

Tao Xiangchuan stated in his speech that the convening of the Political Consultative Conference was the only way to solve the special political problems after victory, and should be considered a success. His words caused a great disturbance, so much so that he was drowned out by a cacophony of sounds before he could finish speaking. The chairman stood up to maintain order, and Ma Chongfeng shouted: "The chairman himself is breaking the law. Why is your watch sometimes fast and sometimes slow?" The chairman calmly replied, "Extending the session by one hour is following yesterday's precedent. Please, everyone, observe the order of the meeting." The uproar finally subsided. It was already eleven o'clock, but there were still many people who wanted to speak. What to do? The result was another one-hour extension, following the precedent.

Wang Lizai asked what was meant by "Liberated Areas." Su Qun said: America is an old democratic country. MacArthur is a Republican. Why does the Consultative Conference deprive soldiers of the right to join a party? There were even more people speaking out on the issue of the draft constitution.

The Five-Minute Request

Finally, Shao Lizi requested five minutes to reply. Someone suggested that it was too late and asked him to speak at the review committee. He said: Now that the journalists are here, it would be good to let everyone hear it. His reply was divided into six points: (1) The convening of the Political Consultative Conference was based on the resolution of the first session of the People's Political Council regarding the National Assembly, convened by the chairman and approved by the Standing Committee of the Supreme National Defense Council. (2) Among the representatives, excluding the government side, only six out of thirty were not councilors. (3) The current difficulties are truly heartbreaking, but everyone must overcome them. (4) Local governments are only temporary. Of course, they will be improved in the future. (5) The matter of passing the draft constitution in the National Assembly is a way for the various parties to restrain their own members. (6) The fact that this National Assembly is drafting a constitution but not implementing one was a decree promulgated by the National Government in the twenty-sixth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937].

The heated debate ended there. The chairman stood up as if relieved of a heavy burden and announced the adjournment of the meeting.

### The Great Artery of National Reconstruction: The Northwest Highway

— Dispatch by Airmail from Lanzhou by Chen Qian, Our Correspondent (Dated the 17th)

Now that we are in a period of active reconstruction, people in the country seem to have a tendency to forget about the Northwest. In fact, everyone knows the importance of the Northwest. There is no need for reporters to repeat stale phrases, but if one does not fully understand the entire Northwest, one cannot have a deep understanding. However, being here, I will talk about what I have heard and seen for the time being. This article is specifically written about the Northwest Highway, and it will inevitably be rambling. Of course, it will not be as accurate as "official statistics," so this article can also be said to be a humble attempt to elicit expert opinion. I hope that those who know more and write better will point out my mistakes. The transportation routes of the Northwest Highway, because the bureau is located in Lanzhou, of course include roads open to traffic in Gansu and Qinghai. In addition, it connects Xinjiang to the west, Shaanxi, Henan, and Hubei to the east, Sichuan to the south, and Suiyuan and Ningxia to the north. Cars can now travel to all of these provinces. To go a step further, the newly constructed Southern Xinjiang Highway and Qinghai-Tibet Highway are also included. Once they are successfully opened to traffic, international routes can also be opened in these two places.

The Highway Management Organization

Has a Confusing History

The Northwest Highway Management Organization was first established in April of the twenty-third year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934] as the Preparatory Office of the Northwest Highway Administration Bureau. At that time, the area under its jurisdiction was only the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway. It was subordinate to the National Economic Council. Later, it was changed to the Northwest National Highway Administration Bureau. In addition to Xi'an-Lanzhou, its jurisdiction also included the Feng-Han-Ning Line. At that time, the director of the bureau was Mr. Zhao Zukang, the current director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works. The bureau was located in Xi'an. After the twenty-sixth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], it was moved to Lanzhou to specialize in international military transportation. At the same time, it expanded its jurisdiction, adding the Gansu-Qinghai Line. Subsequently, it was renamed the Northwest Highway Transportation Office and the Shaanxi-Gansu Transportation Administration Bureau. The above-mentioned offices and bureaus were all directly subordinate to the National Economic Council or the Northwest Commissioner's Office of the Council. It was not until January of the twenty-seventh year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938] that it was changed to be subordinate to the Ministry of Communications and renamed the Northwest Transportation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. At this time, the lines under its jurisdiction were the Lanzhou-Xinjiang, Lanzhou-Qinghai, Gansu-Qinghai, Hua-Shuang, Feng-Han-Ning, and Han-Bai lines, with a total length of over three thousand kilometers. The development of business and the busy traffic were the golden age of the road. Later, in the thirty-first year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], it was changed to be subordinate to the Transportation Control Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission. In the thirty-third year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944], it was again subordinate to the Highway Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. In the spring of the thirty-fourth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], the group was changed to the Northwest Highway Administration Bureau of the Wartime Transportation Administration Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission. In addition to continuing to handle the original transportation business, it also handled the supervision of engineering and post transportation. In the spring of this year, it was once again placed under the jurisdiction of the Highway Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. In summary, the various bureaus and offices were changed eleven or twelve times in ten years. Every year, they were handling transfer procedures, not only exhausting the administrative personnel, but also constantly preparing inventories and preparing for the arrival of new directors. Because Chinese affairs are often "a new emperor, a new court," lower-level staff members are also endlessly bothered by welcoming the new and sending off the old. Such complicated changes are truly a strange thing. The lines currently under the jurisdiction of the road are the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Road from Lanzhou to Hami, the Gansu-Qinghai Road from Lanzhou to Xining, the Lanzhou-Xi'an Road from Lanzhou to Xi'an, the Hua-Shuang Road from Huajialing to Shuangshipu, the Ningxia-Suiyuan Road from Pingliang to Shanba, the Han-Bai Road from Hanzhong to Baihe, the Bao-Guang Road from Shiji to Guangyuan (formerly the Feng-Han-Xian), the Ping-Shi Road from Pingliang to Shiji, and the Lanzhou-Lintao Road from Lanzhou to Lintao (this line has now been expanded to the Lanzhou-Minxian Road). The mileage from Lanzhou to various places is approximately as follows: to Xi'an is 719 kilometers, to Guangyuan is 943 kilometers, to Hami is 1390 kilometers, to Dunhuang is 1161 kilometers, to Ningxia is 879 kilometers, to Shanba is 246 kilometers, to Xining is 236 kilometers, to Baihe is 1284 kilometers, to Chongqing is 1565 kilometers, to Dihua is 1102 kilometers, and to Laohekou is 1521 kilometers. It is now also said that there are plans to operate on the Southern Xinjiang Highway. This time, in order to facilitate the completion of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, there are many cars transporting military and government goods to Tianshui. If the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway is repaired to here in the future, it is feared that transportation west of Lanzhou will become even tighter.

Visiting the Outskirts of the Road Bureau

Takes Three Days

The bureau is located to the left of the busiest Lanzhou Highway, with poplar trees planted along the roadside. To the northwest is an international road. The bureau is built on the site of the City God's palace. Surrounding it are the affiliated Lanzhou Hospital, Lanzhou Sub-Station, Lanzhou Machine Factory Supply Cooperative, Service Center, Nursery, Barber Shop, New Dormitory, Sibei New Village, as well as the Ministry of Communications' Rotary Elementary School, Northwest Highway Special Party Headquarters, Northwest Highway Trade Union, and Northwest Building, occupying a large area. If you want to visit the outskirts of the Road Bureau, it will take you three days. Inside? Under the director and deputy director, work is divided into groups. Currently, there are groups for transportation, engineering, mechanical affairs, materials, accounting, general affairs, and auditing, as well as a post transportation office, which specializes in managing the use of mules, horses, camels, and rubber-wheeled carts for animal-powered transportation. The bureau is built against the mountains. "Sidunping" on the mountain is a well-known military building, extremely majestic and solemn. Colleagues often hold mountain climbing competitions in their spare time to exercise. Now that spring has arrived, the employees' children also climb to the top to fly kites, competing in their creativity and skill, which is very lively.

When we were engaged in a life-or-death struggle with the Japanese devils, the position of the Northwest Highway became increasingly important. We are not "discussing merits and awarding prizes" now. Just speaking of the spirit of dedication of the road's employees is already highly admirable. Whether in Guannei [within the pass, i.e., central China] or Guanwai [outside the pass, i.e., Manchuria], in the boundless sand sea, in remote villages, or in icy and snowy lands, there are their traces. Why? Because they are all "transportation warriors" who have endured hardship and difficulty, truly serving the country. I remember that Mr. Song Xishang once described the major events encountered by the bureau during the war of resistance, which can be recorded in six items: (1) international transportation, (2) Sichuan-Shaanxi military transportation, (3) military transportation for various theaters of war, (4) evacuating materials and refugees, (5) moving the spirits of fallen soldiers, and (6) expanding route planning. Following Mr. Song, Mr. He Jingwu was the director. During Mr. He's tenure, I would like to supplement the following points: (1) transporting immigrants to Xinjiang, (2) Tianshui-Chengdu transportation, (3) repairing old cars and organizing old departments, (4) expanding Hua-Ying military affairs, (5) building the Northwest Building and Northwest New Village, and (6) implementing military management of employees.

Like an Old Ox Pulling a Broken Cart

The Directors Work Hard

Mr. He's tenure was also a prosperous and vibrant period for the bureau. When Mr. He was about to leave, it coincided with the reorganization of the Longhai Railway. Originally, people working on the railway said they were doing "mechanical" work and had a "iron rice bowl." Who looked up to the highway? Moreover, people working on the railway often said that pulling a train was enough for your cars to transport for a year. However, Mr. He especially valued the five directors of the Longhai Railway. These five also worked hard like old oxen pulling broken carts. The five directors of the Longhai Railway were: Huang Zhaotong, director of the Transportation Department; Sun Jiding, director of the Mechanical Affairs Department; Huang Rixin, director of the Accounting Department; Yan, director of the Engineering Department; and Yu Shixia, director of the General Affairs Team. These five old men have served in the transportation industry for thirty or forty years and are all white-haired old men around sixty years old. They are all old friends of Ling Hongxun, the current vice minister of the Ministry of Communications. They were all invited to Lanzhou one after another and had a spirit of hard work. During the war of resistance, of course, every employee did their best to work hard day and night to complete this great transportation mission. I hope that the Northwest Highway will make more contributions during national reconstruction.

Although the road is located on the border, the places where the vehicles go are all places that were developed and opened up the earliest by the Qin and Han dynasties. If we travel the entire road and see the scenic spots, the feelings of admiring the ancients will arise spontaneously and will surely make us happy and excited.

This place is not only beautiful, but also a major artery of national defense. If you don't believe it, please come and visit.

Don't Forget the Northwest

We Cannot Shirk Our Responsibility

During the national struggle around the thirty-first year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], the Southwest was also threatened, so the slogan "Develop the Northwest" was particularly loud. Every day, one could hear the roar of airplanes in the sky, going up and down. Small cars in the city were also speeding by like the wind, carrying people who were "leaving the Jialing River in the morning and staying on the banks of the Yellow River at night," either on inspections or looking for a place to escape. Now, it is silent and still. Has the Northwest been forgotten? Moreover, many civil servants, in order to "return home," have resigned and "returned to their fields." Has "developing the Northwest" really been completed? I still want to tell you: although you have not seen the thousands of minerals hidden underground in the Northwest waiting to be developed, you can see the XX oil mines, XX coal mines, Longxi medicinal materials, and grassland cattle and sheep, which are all resources for national reconstruction. There is also the golden roof of the Ta'er Monastery in Xining, which is said to be worth twice the amount of the Boxer Indemnity, and the Dunhuang national treasures that were stolen by foreigners… Think: who should bear the responsibility of "developing the Northwest"? Who should bear the responsibility of preserving the legacy of our ancestors?

### The Soldiers' Voices Amidst the Call for Military Reorganization and National Reconstruction

Mr. Editor: As our unit is about to be transferred to the Northeast, I have a few points I would like to present to the relevant authorities and the people of the nation through a corner of your esteemed newspaper.

Because we are soldiers, we cannot speak for ourselves. No matter how difficult or dangerous the situation, we can only grit our teeth and endure. Especially during the eight years of the War of Resistance, we suffered hardships unknown to ordinary people, experienced the most horrific scenes in the world, spent the whole year in desolate battlefields, unable to eat when hungry, unable to clothe ourselves when cold, even as our normal life (only eating two bowls of coarse rice per meal and drinking a few mouthfuls of salted vegetable soup). As a result, we were physically weak and lacked strength, yet we still had to travel tirelessly, everywhere meeting the enemy's frantic attacks, constantly fighting for the country. Bleeding, year after year, as if it were a daily occurrence because this was the mission given to us by the era, which we could not shirk.

Looking at the current situation, it has already been seven months since the victory. Under the principle of military reorganization, many units have already begun to adjust. In the past few days, in many places, weren't there many groups of three or five tattered, discarded soldiers wandering around? They fought for the country for eight years. Now they are old and disabled, useless. Each person is given 1,000 yuan in legal tender and told to seek other employment. The other day, I passed by the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Station on business and saw a disabled soldier in a gray military uniform sitting on one side, his face haggard, begging along the road. According to him, he was wounded in the Battle of Wuhan. Although the wound has healed, he does not know where his original unit has gone due to repeated battles. He is disabled and cannot work, but who sympathizes with him? Who will say a word from the heart: "He sacrificed himself for the country, for his compatriots." What he receives is no different from the cold eyes of ordinary beggars. At that time, I was filled with mixed emotions. A soldier wounded in the War of Resistance ends up in such a state!

In today's world of expensive goods, prices are soaring daily. The government is unable to curb rising prices and does not raise salaries. May I ask, how can a private or a second-class soldier survive on a monthly salary of 1,000 yuan (only enough to buy a few packs of cigarettes, not even enough for a haircut, a bath, or any pocket money)? The daily food allowance for officers and soldiers is 100 yuan, including (oil, salt, vegetables). In the past, regardless of whether the month was long or short, it was paid according to 30 days. It was said to be easier for accounting. This year is different. Long months are still paid for 30 days, but February only has 28 days, so the extra two days are deducted. I don't know who invented this unreasonable phenomenon.

Let's talk about the current situation: We won't even talk about the places where the central government's orders are not implemented. Even in the Shanghai-Nanjing area near the capital, who is actually concerned about the families of soldiers on active duty or providing assistance? Wandering in the streets and alleys, aren't they the pitiful, helpless orphans and widowed mothers who have lost their fathers? In the past, when we were trapped on the battlefield, we could not see their pain or inquire about them. Now, in this post-victory world where all the people are rejoicing, some who made fortunes during the national crisis spend thousands of gold coins lavishly, enjoying delicacies of all kinds. Even ordinary laborers can eat their fill and keep warm, but our families, who risked their lives for the country, are struggling on the brink of starvation every day, and no one cares. Thinking of this, I am filled with emotion. Although "if the territory is not recovered, the responsibility lies with the soldiers," still, "the rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every citizen." We were not born with the words "soldier" engraved on our foreheads. We are all soldiers who grew up during the War of Resistance, soldiers who volunteered out of patriotic fervor. In short, the survival of the Northeast is the survival of China. The morale of the national army, the elite quality, can affect the smooth reception of the Northeast. This is an undeniable fact. Recently, the increase in desertions from units transferred to the Northeast is not because the soldiers are afraid of death or hardship. If they were afraid of death, they would not have followed the troops to fight in various places, and they would not have defeated the Japanese warlords, who had the second-strongest army in the world. Therefore, I deeply hope that the authorities, the most urgent thing is to provide assistance to the families of soldiers, at the very least, not to let them be displaced, so as to reassure the soldiers. The suffering of the soldiers themselves is not worth mentioning, precisely because our soldiers all come from poor families.

Finally, we know that the current era is an era of survival of the fittest. Whoever can run ahead of the times is an advanced person. Conservative, fraudulent, selfish, and profiteering behavior can affect the future of the country. We should point out our own shortcomings without hesitation because we are also members of the country! (Qi Yi)

### Written Before the Closing of the Industrial Exhibition

— Shi Wen

The formation of a group or the achievement of a cause is mostly the combination of talents from various fields; and the power generated by this combination often exceeds the sum of each individual talent. The achievements of the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition are promoted under this consistent belief. For eight years, China's national industry, whether in the rear or in the occupied areas, has not made significant progress; the occupied areas certainly need not be mentioned, and the rear has also been subject to various restrictions. By the time the War of Resistance was won, a desolate scene was presented before us. It was at this time that the China Technical Association held the first "Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition" in Shanghai, a place that can represent Chinese industry, hoping to "call for rapid national industrialization from here."

Today, the exhibition is approaching its closing. In the past five days, more than 40,000 visitors have participated in the exhibition, which is indeed beyond initial expectations. Because like many people, now is not the time for an industrial exhibition, but what is causing today's hustle and bustle and prosperity?

We believe that it is only because it originates from the people that it can be so lively and prosperous. After the baptism of the War of Resistance, the people have stood up. They want to find a truly great way to strengthen the country and enrich the people, so national industrialization has become a consistent slogan and a consistent goal. Therefore, an exhibition that promotes industrial products is already attractive enough, even though China is so lacking in industry, and even though Shanghai is so depressed, everyone who cares about the future of the motherland wants to explore the prospects of the new China from here.

But behind the "hustle and bustle" and "prosperity," we see:

The manufacturers participating in the exhibition, because they are in a state of extreme economic instability, all feel unable to continue production. Even the Daming Speedy Printing Machine, whose technical improvements have been very successful, although attracting a large audience at the venue, cannot be produced in large quantities because the production cost exceeds the market price. Therefore, before the closing of this industrial products exhibition, we deeply feel that technical improvement is indeed an essential element in promoting industrial construction, but if the minimum guarantee is not given to this group of warriors in the industrial sector, it is impossible to continue to improve.

Through this exhibition, the colleagues of this association have the opportunity to directly contact industrialists, admire their spirit of hard struggle. This group of people who are loyal to the country and interested in industry are not easy to cultivate. Don't discourage them, don't let them down!

### Our Inspiration and Apology

— Wang Tianyi

Whether they are members of the Technical Association or not, no one is not excited about the grand occasion of this Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition. We colleagues responsible for the preparatory work are particularly excited, so excited that we have forgotten all the fatigue and bitterness of the past four months. Isn't that right? After the victory of the War of Resistance, we had a moment of excitement, but after testing, this excitement proved to be empty. From emptiness to dimness, we have not yet escaped these dim days. But today, for everyone who is willing to tightly embrace himself and the motherland, the exhibition undoubtedly reveals a glimmer of hope to him. Remember, this is seven months after the victory, the first constructive, positive, and optimistic symbol. From here, we see the vitality of the great new China.

Don't think that this little achievement is meager. This is the blood and sweat forging of the Shanghai industrial community under the suppression of puppets and traitors and the turbulence of prices. As long as the gentlemen who are familiar with Shanghai's industry before the war can admit that Shanghai's industry, especially in the technical aspect, has only progressed and not declined after these eight years. There are many machines and products that are unprecedented. Therefore, a very obvious revelation is that the development of Chinese industry is not concerned about the technical aspect. The intelligence of the Chinese people is fundamentally not inferior to anyone!

Please also pay attention to the audience of this exhibition. In addition to young intellectuals, there are haggard old people, as well as energetic children, soldier comrades, civil servants, professional and family women. They have all come to the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition. There is no magic here, no entertainment. What is displayed here are all real objects. What is explained is not theoretical examples, but actual experience. Why is it so sensational? A very simple reason is that they also want industrialization. Science and engineering have shortened the world's space. The Chinese people can easily hear the breath and pulse of other countries. Seeing them living healthily and happily in a modernized environment, the restoration is largely completed, and new construction plans are gradually starting, but we are slow to move. Who doesn't want to improve their lives? Who doesn't want the country to be stronger? Industrialization is already the people's demand. No one can put stumbling blocks in front of the work of national construction anymore. Wake up, especially those great gentlemen whose responsibilities seem even more important.

Therefore, seeing the situation of this industrial products exhibition, we have no reason not to be inspired. We are deeply fortunate that a small motive has aroused the sympathy and resonance of a wide range of people from all walks of life. It seems that every visiting gentleman is tolerating the shortcomings of this exhibition and the current industry without saying anything. The exhibition and Shanghai's industry are not without shortcomings. On the contrary, there are many, but the atmosphere of tolerating each other for the sake of the country seems to be very common. Everyone knows that China's industry can only be cultivated and not destroyed, only rewarded and not suppressed.

However, because of this, we also have endless apologies. The preparation time and work are certainly not sufficient, so many manufacturers could not participate, and the exhibition site and period both seemed small, causing us to have many shortcomings in reception. We didn't even have time to set aside a day or two specifically to entertain students from various schools. Here we respectfully record our deep apologies and guilt. What can be told to our compatriots is that the purpose of this industrial exhibition has been partially achieved. We feel a kind of ardent atmosphere in the venue every day and believe that this atmosphere will spread out and reach every corner of the country. In this atmosphere, the cultivation of vitality is easier. Moreover, because of the inspiration of this exhibition, we have already prepared to conduct the Industrial Exhibition of the 36th Year of the Republic of China. In that exhibition, we believe that the scale will be even larger, the period and venue will be more spacious, the educational and construction significance will be more profound, and there will be more places to be proud of. We have this belief, and we can also determine its success.

Now, this exhibition has come to an end. May we start from here, and we will work hard separately. Let's take a year as a period. At that time, we will have a pleasant and healthy meeting again.

### At the Venue

— Bai Ding

1. Is starch sweet?

The instructor of the Lianhua Chemical Factory on the fourth floor is explaining the manufacturing process of corn flour. One listener suddenly realized: Corn is made into sweet after being chemically processed, so this bag is "sweet powder"?

2. Bombing Taiyi

The fifth floor can be said to be the most academic and interesting floor. Since the China Aviation Model Research Association participated in the exhibition, it has added a lot of color and sound. They explained to the audience without bothering about the details and performed on-site. However, when the plane was flying indoors, boom! The hydrochloric acid of the Taiyi Malt Essence Factory on the opposite side was knocked down!

3. Underground Heroes

Underground heroes were very popular in the past, although they have recently been gradually replaced by flying ones, but they are very active at the exhibition. In the charity sale department and in the accounting department, they kept accounting and calculating every day until late at night. Who knows their hard work?

### Q&A

— Yi

Q: Where is the address of the China Technical Association?

A: Currently, the China Technical Association is temporarily borrowing the address of the China Science Society as a communication address with the assistance of the China Science Society. Therefore, if you have a letter for us, please send it to: "China Science Society Forwarding, No. 533 South Shaanxi Road, Shanghai"

Q: After joining the China Technical Association, what rights can you enjoy?

A: Regarding this, we cannot make any promises. In the past, members of the Technical Association have always fulfilled more obligations and enjoyed fewer rights. I think you also agree that for a group, it is not very good to only enjoy rights without fulfilling obligations. The Technical Association hopes to create the cause of the association together with its members and strive for the rights of the association. Doesn't this all depend on your own efforts to determine the amount of rights?

Q: Who are the leaders of the China Technical Association?

A: We want to ask you to realize that the progress of the Technical Association to the current stage is by no means the merit of one or two people, that is impossible. For the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition, the Technical Association mobilized nearly a hundred members to be responsible for the preparations, and during the exhibition period, it received the help of more than three hundred non-members. For two years, the Technical Association has regularly had forty or fifty people focusing their minds on promoting the affairs of the association. So if you sympathize with the Technical Association and love the Technical Association, please do not worry about its members, because if you join, you may also become an important member of the Technical Association.

### Workers' Words

I am in charge of managing the part of the Shanghai Power Company displayed on the fifth floor of this industrial products exhibition. This was after several key people inside the "Technical Association" repeatedly encouraged me to negotiate with the authorities of the power company one or two days before the opening. Therefore, there are many imperfections in the things displayed this time. For example, the explanatory text, or English, was not translated into Chinese in time; or in places where there is Chinese, the explanation is not sufficient.

The enthusiastic attitude of the people in charge of the "Technical Association" aroused my interest in work. During the days of the exhibition, I spent four or five hours every day standing at a case of exhibits, gesticulating and explaining to the inquiring visitors. I didn't feel tired at all. It can also be said that it was inspired by the sincerity of the "Technical Association" staff. — Chen Hongnian

These days, I have seen the true "national demeanor" at the "Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition." Every day, tens of thousands of people brave the rain and rush from all over to the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association to visit. They study, discuss, excerpt... In such occasions, everyone will believe that China's industrialization is not difficult. — Liu Wenguang

So many people come to visit! Regardless of whether there is a strong wind or heavy rain, we can't stop our enthusiastic visitors. I just feel excited in my heart. The more people there are, the busier the work is, the happier and more excited I feel. — Zhao Zhongmei

Today you are a chick that is not fully developed, I hope that tomorrow you will be able to stretch your neck and crow! — Liu Chenzhong

This Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition is not only a review of the current stage of China's industrial achievements, but also a review of the strength of unity and cooperation of our China Technical Association.

If the "Technical Association" did not have so many enthusiastic members, we would not have the confidence to hold this exhibition. If there was no concerted cooperation among all members during the preparation and exhibition, the "Industrial Exhibition" would not have achieved such a good result as it has today.

This industrial products exhibition teaches us that only by continuously absorbing outstanding members from all industrial sectors and all levels to participate in the "Technical Association" can we expand our influence. Only by striving to strengthen the relationship between members and promoting the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation among members can we guarantee the success of the "Technical Association's" cause. — Song Mingshi

In this exhibition, we deeply realized that only cooperation and unity can bring strength! This performance is just the beginning. We maintain this working spirit and carry it forward. — Lin Dingyi

Whether it is voluntary or staff work, I have held several positions, but none is more interesting or meaningful than serving at the "Industrial Exhibition." I hope that our Technical Association will continue to strive for "revitalizing industry" with the spirit of the past; at the same time, do not forget our mission "to unite technical personnel from all over the country!" — Que Defang
