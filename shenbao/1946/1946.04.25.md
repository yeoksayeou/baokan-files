### The Government Yesterday Issued an Order Postponing the National Assembly; Chairman Hosts Tea Party for Various Parties

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 24th Dispatch] The National Assembly representatives have decided to begin registration on the 25th. According to unofficial statistics, more than 500 representatives from various places in Beijing and Shanghai have already gathered. It is heard that the assembly may be postponed to the 20th of this month due to the urgency of the time and the inability to complete some pre-assembly preparations.

[Central News Agency Chongqing 24th Dispatch] Order of the National Government: The National Assembly originally scheduled to be convened on May 5th of this year is hereby postponed. The postponed date will be determined separately. This order.

[United Press Chongqing 24th Dispatch] Government spokesman Wu Guozhen revealed: Chairman Chiang announced on the 24th that the National Assembly, scheduled to be convened on May 5th, has been indefinitely postponed because the Communist Party and the Democratic League have not yet disclosed their list of representatives. Chairman Chiang convened a tea party for representatives of minority parties and non-party members at 4 pm on the 24th, requesting them to submit their lists of representatives. When they declared that they were not yet ready, the Chairman stated that the central government originally intended to convene the National Assembly on May 5th in accordance with the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) agreement, but it must now be postponed, and the date of future convening will be decided later. At the same time, the PCC Comprehensive Group is scheduled to convene a meeting to seek a political solution acceptable to all parties. The main reason for postponing the National Assembly seems to be the explosive situation in the Northeast, where the Communist Party's position has been strengthened due to its occupation of Changchun and its anticipated occupation when the Soviet Union withdraws from Harbin. Propaganda Minister Wu told reporters yesterday: He believes that the Communist Party hopes to postpone the National Assembly until the Northeast issue is resolved to their satisfaction. He stated: The Communist Party is unwilling to normalize various parts of China in accordance with the PCC resolutions, and this is the reason for their fault-finding.

[Central News Agency Chongqing 24th Dispatch] Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, sent another letter to government representatives Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, and Zhang Lisheng regarding the issue of convening the National Assembly, making some clarifications. The three responded as follows: Respected Mr. Enlai: We have just received your letter of April 24th. We originally intended to clarify the facts you mentioned, but Chairman Chiang convened representatives from all parties for discussions this afternoon. To show the overall situation, the government has adopted the opinions of all parties and postponed the National Assembly to facilitate consultations. As for the issues of expanding the government organization and the draft constitution mentioned in your letter, we have already discussed them repeatedly and there are ways to resolve them. There is no need to engage in further written arguments about who is right and wrong. We only hope that your party will prioritize the interests of the country, consider the suffering of the people, and sincerely and openly cooperate to promote the early realization of all agreements of the Political Consultative Conference, to comfort the longings of the people across the country. We wish you peace.

[Our Newspaper Beiping 24th Dispatch] It is learned that after detailed study of various reports, Marshall will propose a proposal. He may suggest a comprehensive ceasefire in the Northeast. At the same time, US President Truman or the State Department may issue a statement on China policy.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 24th Dispatch] A certain important official who came to Nanjing from Chongqing yesterday vaguely revealed that the government has accepted Marshal Marshall's suggestion and will make every effort to continue to make concessions to the Communist Party, adhering to the "forbearance for the country" and "forbearance for the people" compassionate spirit, and will reopen the door to negotiations within the next three days to seek a solution to the Northeast stalemate.

[United Press Chongqing 24th Dispatch] It was learned today that General Xu Yongchang, Minister of Military Affairs, has succeeded General Chen Cheng, Minister of Military Administration, as the government representative in the military three-person group. Xu has held consultations with General Marshall, and it is widely believed that the three-person group may meet soon. At the same time, Marshall, Chairman Chiang, and Zhou Enlai are discussing the issue at length to seek a solution to the Northeast problem. Although Marshall has not issued any statement, it is widely believed that he has made some progress. The "Xinmin Daily" reported that after listening to Zhou Enlai's report, Marshall has proposed a new peace plan, but there is still a considerable distance between his plan and Zhou's plan.

[Our Newspaper Beiping 24th Dispatch] The dispatch of the 31st team of the Military Mediation Department to Changchun was shelved because the CCP stated that there was no war in Changchun and refused to send people. However, the government representative of the team has been dispatched and will still fly to Shenyang with Deputy Chief of Staff Niu Xianming on the morning of the 25th. Although the US representative has also been dispatched, it has been postponed due to the CCP's refusal.

In addition, Fei Yuhong, the government director of the Military Mediation Department's news office, and Keith, the US director, have arrived in Beiping in the past two days. The number of US personnel in the executive department has greatly increased recently, all coming from the reduced US military headquarters, totaling more than 500 people. The government is about to launch a large-scale offensive to liberate Changchun and establish the sovereignty of the National Government from Dalian to Harbin. The CCP representatives stated that the "United Democratic Army" will continue to fight and will do its best to oppose the government forces' incursion. It is heard that the CCP army has blown up several railway bridges south of Changchun and has built defensive works around the city. However, all observers believe that the CCP army's weapons are inferior and cannot engage in large-scale positional warfare, only engaging in mobile warfare. At the same time, the CCP army in Changchun has entered the city for eight days, and its administrative power was established two days after the Soviet army withdrew. The current situation is calm, and the street fighting is of a local nature. The CCP army commander in Changchun has guaranteed the safety of some government officials who did not have time to evacuate.

They sang patriotic slogans along the way with great enthusiasm. The picture shows students participating in the parade.

### Remembering Changchun (Part 2)

— Written by Fang Ren in Shenyang

The scene in Siping had already been rumored to the ears of people living in Changchun. On March 16th, the person in charge of Mantan Daqi (South Manchuria Railway) announced that all "unnecessary personnel" should leave Changchun. On the 17th, all telephone calls from Changchun to Siping were cut off, and there was no communication to Shenyang south of Siping, or Jinzhou south of Shenyang. Changchun was in a state of isolation in terms of the situation. On the same day, the receiving personnel of the provincial governments of Heilongjiang and Hejiang all returned to Changchun from Harbin by express train. The Mantan Building, which was already housing many people, suddenly added hundreds of people. The rumors from the outside were confusing and tense, and the anxiety of the people was naturally imaginable.

In fact, Changchun's move towards instability, before the 24th, belonged to the air, and there was such an incident. At that time, it was rumored in the city that the Soviet army would withdraw at 9 pm on the 24th, and a certain team would enter the city that night. Every family prepared to buy candles, buy prepared food, and store water, as if they were actively preparing to "cope with the changes." The actual performance was indeed the opposite, but the people's hearts were calmed by it, because the rumor was shattered by the facts, and it finally made people feel: a rumor is just a rumor after all. However, the ardent hope of the common people for the arrival of the National Army did not diminish because of this. Many people prayed devoutly, hoping to arrive as soon as possible. They knew: with the lesson of fourteen years of painful life, a deep brand had been imprinted on their minds and bodies. Only the National Army could symbolize the complete removal of that hateful fourteen-year history from the history of life. They would ask people: Where exactly has the National Army arrived? Has it passed Siping and reached Gongzhuling? However, no one could give them a satisfactory answer.

In the sound of the Soviet army's withdrawal, among the several agencies that Changchun had already taken over, many local young staff members, mostly around the age of 20, were "transmitted" to a certain barracks by "compatriots" wearing police uniforms as intermediaries. At this time, a military officer who spoke our northern Mandarin would persuade these young people to leave their hometowns and go to foreign lands to study military affairs. If not, they were willing to pay a high price, as long as they could give them some news on time. For example, "Where did someone come from?" "Does he have anti-[blank] ideas?" If an answer was obtained to this type of simple question, the person asking the question would be satisfied, and they would also focus on the material life, saying: "Your treatment is too hard, the money we give you is just a token of our appreciation." Of course, in the past fourteen years, most Chinese people were forced by Japan to only say: "I am a person of "Manchukuo"." And in fact, they had really worked as cattle and horses, shed blood and sweat for "Manchukuo," but even people around the age of 20 could understand the taste of master and slave, and the difference between foreign races and compatriots.

The Soviet army in Changchun began to withdraw on March 19th. The large buildings in the western part of the city used by the Soviet army as barracks were emptied on that day, and the buildings that were empty and only had shells were increasing day by day, and huge tanks were climbing towards the station one after another and leaving Changchun. At this time, the receiving personnel gathered in the Mantan Building also left a lot. In such a large building, it was necessary to eat four times a meal in the large dining hall to ensure that everyone could eat, and as a result, it was changed to two times, and finally only once. Fewer and fewer people, the prosperity of the building was obviously a thing of the past, and loneliness, monotony, and anxiety were doing evil in everyone's heart. The opposite of this mood, the people living in the Mantan Building, and the demands of the citizens were consistent, hoping that the National Army would arrive in Changchun as soon as possible.

The situation became more serious day by day. The second security general team, which was airlifted to Changchun from Beiping on January 5th, and the fourth security general team compiled by Chen Jiazhen, plus the local police, were stationed in the vacated large buildings and built fortifications to prevent accidents. On the roads entering the city and in the important places within the city, security teams and the police began to inspect pedestrians. A submachine gun was found on a firewood cart entering the city. On the 27th, it was the first day it rained in Changchun since last winter. That night, in the drizzling rain, three trucks and a small sedan car were seized in the suburbs. The license plate was of the Northeast Headquarters, but the drivers wore the symbols of the Northeast Security Commander-in-Chief's Department. That night, not only gunshots were heard in the suburbs, but also artillery fire, and the lights were also lively, suddenly going out several times at night, which was not common in the past, so all this made the instability of Changchun even more obvious.

Chairman's Speech at the Farewell Ceremony

[Central News Agency Chongqing 24th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang delivered a speech at the farewell meeting of all circles in the accompanying capital on the 24th. The full text is as follows: Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades, I feel that today is the most glorious, happiest, and most memorable day since the government moved to Chongqing eight years ago. Our government moved to Chongqing during the difficult and critical period of the War of Resistance. After a long and arduous struggle, we finally achieved the final victory. This is of course the result of the concerted efforts of the military and civilians across the country. However, the relationship between our Chongqing compatriots and the government, sharing joys and sorrows, sharing weal and woe, and being consistent in life and death, is closer than in other places. Recalling the period when the enemy's forces were rampant, Chongqing suffered cruel bombing by the enemy every day, and the lives and property of the citizens suffered unexpected losses. However, in order to express their loyalty to the War of Resistance and their support for the government, everyone followed one another and died without hesitation. This loyal and unswerving, arduous and outstanding spirit is what I will never forget. As for the amount of money and effort contributed by Chongqing citizens during the War of Resistance, it is the crown of all other places in the country. This great contribution will be written in the history of the War of Resistance and will be a good model for the people to be loyal to the country forever. I grew up in Zhejiang and started my revolution in Guangdong, but since leaving my hometown at the age of thirteen, I have never stayed in one place for as long as eight years as in Chongqing, so Chongqing is actually my second hometown. After returning to the capital, my wife and I will never forget the compatriots in Chongqing, and we will do our best to advocate the construction of Chongqing. I also hope that the personal feelings between my Chongqing compatriots and myself will increase due to the separation and become more profound with time. As for the widows and orphans of the compatriots who died in the War of Resistance, it will be difficult for my wife and I to take care of them after leaving Chongqing. I especially hope that all gentlemen and comrades will promote the spirit of respecting the elderly and caring for the young, and assist our municipal government in properly educating and raising them, so as to comfort the spirits of the martyrs in heaven and reward the society's loyalty and integrity. Finally, I sincerely wish that Chongqing will develop day by day, and that the lives of Chongqing compatriots will become more and more prosperous and become a model city for the country.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] Xuzhou News: The Communist army in the Jiangsu-Shandong border region, with a force of more than six regiments, launched an offensive towards Tongshan County near Xuzhou, beginning on the 20th of this month. A portion of the army invaded a village about two li away from Caolou, the location of the Feng County government, on the morning of the 23rd and is fiercely attacking Caolou. At the same time, the Communist army in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and the Communist army gathering in the Lincheng-Zaozhuang area of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway are also showing signs of activity. According to people from Feng County, the Communist army has vowed to "liberate" Xuzhou before the National Government returns to the capital, so refugees from Xuzhou are pouring south along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway.

[Our Jinan Correspondent, 23rd] The Shandong Communist army is active again, but there have been no major conflicts in the province. More than 1,000 troops from Zhang Jixiang's unit of the Communist army stationed in Tai'an were transferred to Dezhou and are constructing fortifications. West of Qingzhou on the Jiaoji Railway, the main force of the Communist army has been transferred to the vicinity of Zhangdian.

[Our Beijing Correspondent, 24th] The Tianjin-Pukou Railway Northern Section Botou Transportation Group, consisting of government representative Zhong Luohan, Communist representative Xu Deping, and U.S. representative Warner, left for Tianjin this afternoon and will return to Botou. The road repair work there has been suspended due to the issue of removing fortifications. This return to Beijing shows that the Executive Headquarters is still instructing them to follow the past instructions of Ma, Zhang, and Zhou to prioritize road repair.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 23rd] The Xinxiang Executive Group has returned from an inspection in Xiuwu. The group is compiling materials regarding the issues of separating the troops of both sides and will then formulate specific measures to report to the Military Mediation Department for adoption and implementation.

### Military Mediation Department Decides to Organize Yongnian Relief Committee

Communist Army Shoots at Relief Plane

[Our Beijing Correspondent, 24th] Today, the Chief of Staff meeting of the Military Mediation Department resolved that the three parties will organize a Yongnian Relief Committee to raise food and medicine to relieve the people in Yongnian City who are awaiting death. Other issues will be resolved later. This committee will be instructed to be executed by the Anyang Group after the three-person group approves it.

[Our Beijing Correspondent, 24th] Government representative Bi Yongli of the Anyang Group of the Executive Headquarters, after completing his public duties in Beijing, flew back to Anyang today. The Executive Headquarters instructed Bi on the principles of relieving Yongnian and allowing military rations to enter the city.

[Central News Agency, Beijing, 24th] The government previously sent a plane to drop food to Yongnian. When the plane was in the air, it was suddenly shot at by the Communist army and was hit in two places. Fortunately, it did not crash.

### Supreme Court Establishes Civil and Criminal Divisions in Beijing

[Central News Agency, Beijing, 24th] The Supreme Court decided to establish the Beijing Civil and Criminal Division of the Supreme Court in Beijing to try the more than one thousand unsettled cases of the former North China Supreme Court of the Puppet Regime, which need to be tried urgently. The Supreme Court has dispatched Supreme Court Judge Wang Zhenyuan, Zhou Wugang, and clerks to Beijing to prepare for the organization. The Procuratorate of the Supreme Court will also dispatch prosecutors to Beijing to perform their duties. The high courts of various provinces in North China are trying cases of Chinese traitors, but current transportation is difficult, and it takes time to send and receive files. It is reported that Xia Qin, President of the Supreme Court, has signed a request to the Supreme Court to allow the Beijing Division of the Supreme Court to try the retrials of Chinese traitor cases in various parts of North China nearby.

[United Press, Beijing, 24th] More than one thousand Japanese military police detained in the Xiyuan barracks and one thousand in Tianjin will soon be tried. After strict investigation by the Chinese authorities, one hundred and eighty Japanese war suspects have been released.

### United States Also Has a Housing Shortage; Needs 3 Million Homes

[United Press, New York, 23rd] Fortune magazine's April issue is a special issue on housing problems. It is said that the United States needs at least 3 million new homes to solve the current housing shortage. The housing shortage in the United States will reach its most serious stage this fall and will not improve until next spring. The American people are now using pressure on the Congressional side to urge the government to adopt proactive policies to solve the housing problem. "Where did so many people come from?" This is a question many people want to ask. According to the magazine's investigation, the biggest reason is due to marriages and relocations in towns. The government plans to build 1.2 million homes this year and expects to complete 1.5 million homes.

### Shandong Province to Complete the Repatriation of Japanese and Korean Residents Soon

### U.S. Marine Corps Sentries in Tianjin Attacked Four Times in One Night; Some Attackers Were Wearing Japanese Clothing

[United Press, Tianjin, 24th] Today, according to unofficial sources: Due to the fact that civil tension has reached a disturbing state, the task of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in North China is currently becoming increasingly difficult. It is known that in six days, there have been as many as four Chinese citizens killed after attempting to forcibly cross the U.S. Marine Corps guard post at the former French arsenal area. On one night, Marine Corps sentries were attacked four times, and one Chinese was killed on the spot. After this case occurred, it was also reported that another unidentified group of Chinese approached a Marine Corps sentry and fired a shot. In another case, a Chinese intended to repel a sentry, but the attacker was ultimately shot and killed. It is claimed that some of the Chinese carrying out the attacks were wearing Japanese clothing, but it is not known whether this is an organized attack or merely a bandit robbery.

Editorial

### The Question of Maintaining the Secrecy of Atomic Energy

Since the Allied forces dropped the first atomic bomb over Hiroshima on August 5, 1945, followed by the second atomic bomb over Nagasaki on August 8, Japan called for surrender within two days, and World War II ended, entering a new era of atomic energy for mankind. Discussions ensued regarding the use of atomic energy and whether its secrets should be kept or managed by international organizations. Although the United Nations has always had an Atomic Energy Commission, attempting to use the United Nations as an organization to take responsibility for controlling the use of atomic energy, a large-scale secret organization was discovered in Canada attempting to obtain the secrets of atomic energy use and export them abroad. From this point, it can be seen how concerned all parties are about the use of atomic energy. Recently, Professor Harold Laski, Chairman of the British Labour Party, traveled from the United States back to England and stated at a meeting, "The new atomic bombs made in the United States are more powerful than those dropped in Japan. One bomb can destroy the two major states of Indiana and Illinois, and five bombs can destroy all of the United States south of the Mason-Dixon Line." Professor Laski strongly criticized the policy of keeping the development of atomic energy secret, calling it an "attack on human security," and said, "I hope that we will mobilize all our strength to end the illegal application of this secret policy; this policy threatens to poison every channel of our international relations."

After Professor Laski's statement, it aroused repercussions in Washington. According to a United Press Washington dispatch on the 21st, atomic bomb experts here expressed displeasure with the statements made by Professor Laski. Professor Laski's opposition to keeping the development of atomic energy secret did not gain much official sympathy. People familiar with the atomic bomb expressed surprise at Laski's description of the atomic bomb's destructive power. As far as is known, the atomic bombs made according to the "Manhattan Project" design have not changed much in style from those used to bomb Nagasaki. Some scientists estimate that the effectiveness of these bombs has increased by about 25% compared to those that bombed Hiroshima. Officials have announced that the power of these bombs is equivalent to 20,000 tons of explosives. At the same time, Senator Hart, a member of the Senate Special Committee on Atomic Energy, also criticized, saying, "I deeply feel that Mr. Laski actually knows nothing about what he said, and even if he does, I cannot agree to disclose it."

If Professor Laski had only issued the above remarks in his capacity as a professor of political science at the London School of Economics, then a scholar's discussion of politics, or being relatively far from reality, would not have been surprising. However, he is the chairman of the British Labour Party, and the British Labour Party is the party currently in power in Britain. Although he himself does not directly participate in Attlee's government, since he is the chairman of the Labour Party, his words and actions should reflect the intentions of the government to some extent and also affect government policies. Therefore, the above remarks have attracted the attention of the world. The above remarks can be divided into two parts: (1) the question of the power of the newly built atomic bomb, and (2) the question of the policy of keeping the development of atomic energy secret. Regarding the first part, Senator Hart of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Atomic Energy and Captain Chichester, the official observer present when the U.S. military bombed Nagasaki with the atomic bomb, have refuted it, saying that it is completely inaccurate, and we do not need to make any further statements. However, regarding the question of whether the development of atomic energy should be kept secret, we would like to express our views.

From the history of scientific development, the secrets of any kind of novel scientific invention cannot be kept for long. Originally, the so-called new invention in science is by no means accidental, but is based on the accumulation of repeated inventions. For example, without the invention of radio, there would be no invention of radar. The invention of the use of atomic energy is not a matter of one day and one night, but the result of many accumulations of research on atomic energy. Using these results of atomic research, atomic bombs were then manufactured. Scientists can explain the theory of the atomic bomb, and there is no secret to be kept. The technology for manufacturing atomic bombs, under the joint efforts of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, was completed in the United States. Therefore, the secret of atomic energy is not in its theory, but in its manufacturing technology; this is a technical secret. Since it is a technical secret, it is the same as other industrial and commercial secrets and does not seem to be taken too seriously. An industrialist has the freedom to keep his industrial technology secret, and it should not be clamored too much that the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada must announce the secrets of their atomic bomb manufacturing. Churchill believed that the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada have a kind of "sacred trust" endowed by heaven to have the secret of atomic bomb manufacturing. This seems to be a bit too "affected" and inevitably adorns the façade in the same way that Westerners used to go to various colonies and promote themselves as having a sacred mission. However, because the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada have no aggressive ambitions at this time and will not launch aggressive wars to use atomic bombs to destroy human civilization, this is more recognized by everyone. Therefore, although we may not fully agree with Churchill's words and deeds, we can still trust that keeping this secret in the hands of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada is safer for mankind than letting it fall into other places. Therefore, we also find it difficult to understand Professor Laski's statement that keeping the development of atomic energy secret is an "attack on human security." We would rather say that keeping the secret of atomic energy development from falling into the hands of countries that are fond of aggression is a necessary step to safeguard human security.

China, like the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, has no aggressive ambitions. We see the current turbulence in the international situation, and ambitious people are still trying to rule the world with hegemonic tactics. Therefore, we feel that announcing the technical secrets of atomic bomb manufacturing at this time would be enough to threaten human security. If this force capable of destroying human civilization falls into the hands of a country that attempts to dominate the world, what a serious threat it will be to human security. Mankind will no longer have freedom, and most people will be reduced to slavery. This is truly a critical juncture in human history!

Tobacco Seller Commits Suicide by Poisoning Out of Fear of Punishment

In front of the government office in Hexia Town in this county, a passerby suddenly collapsed and died at 7:30 PM on the 22nd. Town Head Mao Dichen discovered this and immediately notified the judicial department. The department then dispatched inspector Fu Zhongshu to conduct an examination. It has been determined that the deceased was named Wang Hanyin, approximately 40 years old, and was a guarantor at the Jiashan train station. He usually made a living by running an opium den. Because his wife was arrested yesterday, he was terrified and committed suicide by poisoning. It was determined that he had ingested opium paste before his death, as evidenced by the bluish color of his lips and fingernails. Twenty-eight opium "soft strips" and approximately one qian of opium paste, stored in an iron box, were found on his body, along with 1,480 yuan in legal tender. Inspector Fu has taken custody of these items and handed them over to the town office for safekeeping, instructing the deceased's family to claim them.

### Security Council Heated Debate for Two Hours; Soviet Request Rejected; Gromyko Declares on the Spot He Will No Longer Participate in the Debate; Next Meeting to Discuss Spanish Question

[Reported by this newspaper] San Francisco, 24th (broadcast): The Security Council will reconvene on the 25th to discuss the Franco Spain issue. The Australian representative's suggestion to appoint a subcommittee to review whether Franco poses a threat to world peace is expected to be passed.

[Reported by this newspaper] San Francisco, 24th (broadcast): After a heated debate of two hours, the Security Council yesterday rejected the Soviet representative Gromyko's renewed request to remove the Iranian issue from the agenda. Gromyko immediately declared that he would no longer participate in the debate on this issue. Before the meeting, Gromyko issued a warning, saying that if the Security Council forcibly proceeded with the discussion of the Iranian issue, it might cause extremely regrettable consequences. After the meeting began, Gromyko stated that the previous Security Council resolution to postpone the discussion of the Iranian issue to May 6 should be revoked immediately. The US representative, Stettinius, immediately stood up to oppose, and cited the review opinion of the United Nations Secretary-General Lie (Lie had stated that the Security Council had the right to keep the Iran-Soviet issue on the agenda). Representatives from the UK and Australia expressed their support for Stettinius's opinion, and representatives from the Netherlands, China, Brazil, and Mexico also expressed their opposition to the Soviet representative's views. The French representative suggested that the Soviet-Iranian issue be postponed for nine days for discussion by the United Nations General Assembly, but this was also rejected. At this point, Gromyko stated that the Soviet delegation believed that keeping the Iranian issue on the Security Council's agenda was contrary to the Charter and would no longer participate in the discussion of this issue. The President of the Security Council, Aranha, declared the discussion of another issue (the Spanish issue) in a swift and decisive manner before Gromyko could finish his statement, thus preventing the Soviet representative from leaving the meeting. At that time, all the Soviet representatives looked at Gromyko to determine whether to stay or leave. Seeing that Gromyko remained seated, they also remained in their seats until the Security Council adjourned.

[United Press, New York, 24th] The United Nations Security Council today rejected the withdrawal of the Iranian issue, causing a new crushing defeat for the Soviet Union. Initially, after two hours of heated debate, the French representative proposed a resolution to remove the Iranian issue from the agenda, believing that it had been resolved, and that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Lie, should make a report on the developments. Gromyko seconded the proposal, advocating for a vote. The result was overturned by a vote of eight to three. At that time, only the Soviet Union, France, and Poland voted in favor of the French proposal. In the eleven votes of the Security Council, seven votes were required for a majority, so a negative vote was not necessary. From this, it can be seen that the representatives of seven countries believed that the Iranian issue must be kept on the agenda until the Soviet Union and Iran submit a report on May 6, explaining whether the Red Army has withdrawn as promised. The Security Council adjourned at 10:05 PM (Shanghai time was 11:05 AM on Wednesday) and will reconvene at 3:00 PM on Thursday (Shanghai time was 4:00 AM on Friday). At that time, it will consider the suggestion to investigate Franco's Spain.

### Interesting Anecdote in the Security Council: Chinese and Soviet Representatives Exchange Proverbs

[United Press, New York, 24th] The Chinese representative to the United Nations Security Council, Quo Tai-chi, stated in the Security Council today that when the Soviet Union requested the removal of the Iranian issue from the agenda of the Security Council earlier this month, he and the Soviet representative, Gromyko, exchanged proverbs, saying, "Why fret if the dog is lying on the ground?" Gromyko replied, "The Security Council is shooting a sparrow." He did not understand the meaning, and Gromyko explained that this meant "The Security Council is concerned about a trivial matter that is not worth paying attention to."

### Competition for Power is Complex; Japanese Three Parties Fail to Reach Agreement; Socialist Party Insists on the Position of Prime Minister and Refuses to Concede; Japanese Communist Party Announces the Suspension of the Anti-Emperor System

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] Negotiations on the issue of forming a coalition government in Japan became increasingly complex today, but it cannot yet be said to have reached a dead end. The executive committee of the Socialist Party publicly announced that it would only cooperate if it obtained the position of Prime Minister. Otherwise, it would allow the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party to govern, and the party would rather be in the opposition. There is a rumor in political circles that in the complex situation of the power struggle, if J Hatoyama, the president of the Liberal Party, is expelled from the political arena due to his past extreme nationalism, then former Foreign Minister Yoshida may emerge and succeed him as the president of the Liberal Party.

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] Japanese political leaders intend to form a coalition government based on the results of the general election and continued discussions today, but with little success. Emperor Hirohito has ordered his men to submit reports on the discussions between the three major parties, the Liberal, Progressive, and Socialist parties, at any time. Currently, the Socialist Party is firmly demanding important positions in the cabinet, such as Prime Minister. The party's secretary-general, Katayama, reiterated his position tonight, saying that he would not give in. Kawano, a leader of the Liberal Party, said after meeting with Katayama again that he still firmly believed that the Liberal Party could cooperate with the Socialist Party. He also visited Shidehara, who encouraged him to do his best. Shidehara took office as the president of the Progressive Party yesterday, and the party now seems to be watching the situation develop from the sidelines. However, the position of J Hatoyama, the president of the Liberal Party, is still a major problem. His party has the most seats in the new parliament, so Hatoyama is the most likely to succeed as Prime Minister. It is rumored that MacArthur's headquarters has made some statements to the Japanese government regarding Hatoyama's qualifications, but MacArthur's headquarters has denied this.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] It is rumored that Tokuda, the secretary-general of the Japanese Communist Party, has stated that he is willing to temporarily suspend the policy of abolishing the Emperor system in order to participate in the coalition government of the four parties. The Communist Party's past demands to abolish the Emperor system have alienated the party from other parties. Although the Japanese Communist Party's temporary suspension of the anti-Emperor system is important, its number of members is too small to change the Japanese political situation.

### Allied Occupation Forces in Japan Conduct a Grand Parade Today, Another Batch Arrives in Kure Port

[Reuters, Kure Port, 24th] British occupation forces in Japan, including the British Army, Navy, Air Force, Australian, New Zealand and Indian troops, will parade here tomorrow. Another report says that 1,300 Indian soldiers and 700 British soldiers arrived in Kure Port today. The total number of British occupation forces that have arrived in Japan has now reached 22,500, and the total number after all have arrived will be 45,000.

### India and the Philippines Dispatch Judges to Jointly Try Japanese War Criminals

[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] India and the Philippines have been invited to dispatch judges to participate in the Far East International Tribunal. After the judges from these countries participate, the Far East Tribunal will have eleven judges.

### Britain Asks MacArthur to Return Radium to Its Original Owner

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] The British Liaison Mission to Japan will ask MacArthur's headquarters to return the radium found by the Civil Assets Disposal Committee, which is worth 500,000 US dollars. According to the regular bureau of MacArthur's headquarters, it weighs a total of 83.3 grams, was airlifted here from Guangzhou in August of last year, and is now stored in the cellar of the Bank of Japan.

### After Meeting Gandhi, Hoover Arrives in Bombay

[United Press, Bombay, 24th] Hoover arrived here today. According to the Exchange Telegraph Company, he met with Gandhi and Nehru in New Delhi. Hoover will also travel to Japan to meet with MacArthur, and will also issue a statement on the food situation in China.

### Soviet Aircraft Shoot at US Aircraft; US Lodges Strong Protest

[Reuters, Vienna, 24th] General Clark, the commander of the US occupation forces in Austria, yesterday lodged a strong protest with the Soviet authorities regarding the attack on a US transport plane by four Soviet fighter planes over the Tulln US airfield in Vienna.

### It is rumored that President Truman has invited Stalin to visit the United States; Truman will soon return to Washington

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] It is rumored that President Truman may invite Marshal Stalin to visit the United States. The President's Secretary, Ayers, declined to comment, only saying that President Truman will immediately return to Washington after reviewing the naval exercises. The original plan to take a cruise on the yacht Williamsburg in Shakespeare Bay has been cancelled.

### Report on Japanese General Election Released; MacArthur Believes Japanese Democracy Has Made Progress, Clearing Up External Criticism

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] MacArthur received a report on the Japanese general election today and issued a statement saying: "In this election, the Japanese people opposed the extremists and chose the centrists, believing that they are the most capable of serving the people. This trend is very obvious. The Japanese people have also abandoned their inherent philosophical theories, believing that what they have experienced before is nothing but 'controlling the masses and prohibiting human freedom.' From this, it can be seen that democracy in Japan has shown its healthy progress. The Japanese people have been given the opportunity to break free from the shackles of the warlords for decades, and they willingly and sincerely responded to the change in freedom. President Lincoln once said, 'The people are wiser than the rulers,' and the Japanese people are no exception." The report acknowledged the Communist Party's criticism of the omission of many names from the election list and the prohibition of voting, but stated that those deprived of the right to vote were less than four per thousand of the total number of voters. Most of them moved since November of last year and did not report their names to their new residences, but even in this case, they could have voted by mail, but they did not do so. The Ministry of Home Affairs is thoroughly investigating this matter, but in any case, even if these omitted people participated in the vote, it would not change the election results. At the same time, the enthusiasm of women to participate in the election was unexpected, and their results were no less than those of men. Women candidates have no political party organization to support them, and their election is probably due to the fact that they are female and have won the support of women. MacArthur's statement also said, "Pure democracy is an innate spiritual quality that must arise spontaneously from the will of the people and then become a deeply rooted system. It cannot be forcibly instilled. The Japanese people have gained the freedom to express their public opinion and sincerely yearn for it, opposing both the left and right extremes. Based on their experience, these two extremes inevitably lead to the same path, and the result is nothing more than controlling the masses and prohibiting human freedom. What they have adopted is a broad central faction, so that their government can implement a balanced policy and serve the interests of the people to the best of its ability. Democracy has shown its healthy progress from this. It is hoped that the elected members of parliament will live up to the trust of the voters and play a healthy and constructive role in legislation, so that democracy can advance steadily."

Number of Seats by Party

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] MacArthur announced today that more than 27 million people voted in Japan's first democratic election, accounting for 73 percent of the total number of voters. The previous highest record was only 11.25 million people. Thirty-eight female members were elected. The final election results for each party are as follows: Liberal Party 139 seats, Progressive Party 93 seats, Social Democratic Party 92 seats, Independents 83 seats, Small Parties 38 seats, Cooperative Party 14 seats, Communist Party 5 seats, Vacancies 2 (the candidates for these two seats did not receive the minimum number of votes).

Campaign Expenses

### The Terrifying Future War: Atomic Bombs Launched by Rockets Turn Thousands of Square Miles into Barren Land - Humanity Can Only Hide Underwater or Underground

[Reuters, Calcutta, 24th] Lieutenant General Thorat, Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Command of India, has had his book "The Evolution of Land Warfare and Its Future," written last year, handed over to publishers for printing. After providing a historical narrative of wars over the past twenty years, the book discusses the current atomic bomb era, stating that people worldwide will enter an era of "underground" living, hiding underwater or in mountain caves to survive atomic bombings. Furthermore, after atomic bombs are controlled remotely and launched by rockets, areas up to two thousand miles away will be ravaged, with effects dozens of times greater than the bombing of Japan. These rocket-propelled atomic bombs could instantly turn thousands of square miles of land into barren deserts, and people can only escape the danger to their lives by living underwater and underground. The next problem becomes how to preserve the food needed for cave-dwelling life during such a war. Countries with vast lands will naturally have greater security in the atomic bomb warfare era, but it will still be difficult to provide comprehensive defenses.

### The Situation of the Philippine Election: Roxas

### A Few Mistakes of the United Nations Organization

— Our London Special Correspondent, Xu Zhongpei

As I write this, the twenty-first General Assembly of the League of Nations is being held in Geneva. In the assembly hall, the flags of the thirty-four member states are not flying, and the spectator seats are empty. -- All the elaborate arrangements are no longer necessary; these representatives have come to hold a funeral.

In this desolate environment, the chairman, Hébert, gave a speech: What the League of Nations is handing over to the United Nations General Assembly is not only a large fortune, but also "twenty-five years of accumulated valuable experience."

In fact, rather than experience, it is more accurate to say it is a series of bittersweet memories. Within these memories: there are lofty ideals that have disappeared, beautiful hopes that have faded away, the Hoare-Laval Pact that condoned Mussolini (former British Foreign Secretary), the Munich Conference that sacrificed Czechoslovakia, and China's accusation against Japan's actions in the three northeastern provinces.

Thinking back to those years, Geneva was bustling with activity. Wilson, for the sake of an ideal, did not hesitate to advocate and appeal until his death. If he were aware of the end of the League of Nations and the birth of the United Nations, should he be sad or happy? Watching the rise and fall of this great institution for realizing ideals, how could he not feel moved and heartbroken!

Hébert said: "Although the League of Nations is dead, its torch has been passed to a younger and more powerful hand."

Will the United Nations General Assembly be more powerful? Will the United Nations General Assembly be willing to apply the League of Nations' twenty-five years of experience? -- The future of all mankind depends on the answers to these two questions.

The United Nations organization has its own soaring ambitions, but in action, it also lingers in the reality of power politics, just like the League of Nations.

First, in this charter based on equality, the color of power politics is fully expressed. Although each of the five countries, China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, has only one vote, in the Security Council, the five powers can appoint themselves as permanent members without public election (as stipulated in Article 23 of the Charter). The terms of non-permanent members are limited and can be changed, while permanent members, once appointed, only change personnel, not nationality. Moreover, Article 27, paragraph 3, stipulates: "Decisions of the Security Council on all other matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of seven members including the concurring votes of the permanent members". This means that any resolution will not pass as long as one of the so-called five powers does not agree. Article 108 further stipulates: "Amendments to the present Charter shall come into force for all Members of the United Nations when they have been adopted by a vote of two thirds of the members of the General Assembly and ratified in accordance with their respective constitutional processes by two thirds of the Members of the United Nations, including all the permanent members of the Security Council". This means that if one of the five powers disagrees, the Charter cannot be amended.

Thus, if one of the five powers shakes its head, the United Nations General Assembly, which executes the world peace organization, will be at a loss. The Security Council can use force, but the Military Staff Committee directly under it only allows the chiefs of staff of the five powers to participate.

In this way, the spirit of the five powers dominates the United Nations General Assembly. There is a cartoon in the London Daily Mail depicting the Soviet representative Gromyko going to the United Nations General Assembly wearing a hat of "Power Politics". Bevin stood aside frowning, and Bevin spread his hands and said, "Sorry, sir, please put your hat in the cloakroom". Of course, the Soviet Union wore the wrong hat. But who is to blame? The Charter of the United Nations General Assembly does not prohibit him (or even encourage him) from wearing this hat into the hall.

The second mistake of the United Nations General Assembly is that it assumes that the victorious countries are all peace-loving countries. This assumption is a fatal wound. We can only hope, foolishly hope, that all the victorious countries love peace, but we can never dogmatically make this assumption. Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese militarists naturally caused trouble, but since war is inevitable and the outcome is determined on the battlefield, the factors of victory are weapons, industry, and technology, not ideals, not doctrines, and certainly not a sincere love of peace. Common sense tells us that the victorious countries are by no means equal to peace-loving countries, let alone history can help us explain. The hats of "great powers" and "imperialism" have appeared on the heads of "victorious countries." If memories are still fresh, in 1939, the Soviet Union was expelled from the League of Nations for invading Finland.

Similarly, we shout for re-education, shout for eliminating wars, and say that the next generation is innocent, but why should we bitterly stipulate the "enemy country" in the articles of the Charter, which is a treasure trove of peace for millions of years? Article 53 stipulates that "the enemy state means any state which during the Second World War has been an enemy of any signatory to the present Charter". In our ultimate ideal, the world is one family, so why create such a huge feud now?

The third mistake of the United Nations General Assembly is that it is not universal. Enemy countries are of course unable to participate, and even permanently neutral countries like Switzerland and Sweden, which have never had aggressive thoughts, are excluded from the design circle of peace. Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Austria, Portugal, and other European countries also have no part. Since peace is indivisible, why haven't invitations been sent to these countries? The Portuguese representative has already complained, believing that the International Court of Justice cannot be regarded as a perfect court because many countries have not been able to participate in the selection of international judges.

At the first session of the United Nations General Assembly, the French representative also spoke about the scarcity of representatives from European countries. Gathering ideas and benefiting from each other, countries like those permanently neutral countries can be regarded as the most peace-loving countries.

When the League of Nations was handed over to the United Nations, many problems also arose. All expenses of the League of Nations were shared by the member states of the League of Nations. In this way, is the unconditional transfer of all the assets of the League of Nations to the United Nations equal to the illegal robbery of those member states of the League of Nations that are not members of the United Nations? In spirit, does this equal depriving them of their pursuit of the ideal of peace?

The torch has been transferred from the League of Nations to the United Nations General Assembly, but what is worrying is not the external storms, but the fear that the torchbearer will extinguish it nearby. April 10th night in London

### Worldwide Food Shortage: UNRRA's Requests to Our Country Cannot Be Fully Met: Jiang Tingfu Reports to the Press on Attending the UNRRA General Assembly

[Our Dispatch] Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, who represented our country at the Fourth UNRRA General Assembly, just returned to this city on the 22nd. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., he specially hosted the press of this city at the Duchen Hotel, with more than 40 Chinese and foreign reporters present. First, Shen Weitai, Director of the Compilation and Translation Department of the Administration, gave a brief introduction. Then, Jiang Tingfu stood up and said that the Fourth UNRRA General Assembly could be said to be a food conference. According to my estimate last autumn, our country will need one million tons of rice and wheat each this year. After review by UNRRA, the rice and wheat were reduced to 720,000 tons of grain. In the first quarter of this year, UNRRA has shipped 180,000 tons of wheat to our country, but not a single grain of rice has arrived. There are two problems here: one is that there is a general food shortage around the world, and the other is that food distribution is managed by the United Food Distribution Committee, which is jointly formed by the United States, Britain, and Canada. The allocation of food to our country by this committee is very small. For example, the United States exports 300,000 tons of rice, and the amount allocated to our country accounts for only one-tenth of this amount. Siam exports 160,000 tons of rice, and the amount allocated to our country is only 18,000 tons. The reasons for this are: (1) The committee believes that our country is an agricultural country and there is no need to worry about food shortages. (2) It has not yet understood the current special difficulties in our country, such as: (1) Taiwan, a rice-producing area, not only has no food surplus, but also needs to be supplied by the Asian continent. (2) The drought in Hunan last year resulted in only 40% of the harvest, and Hunan has become a famine area. (3) During the war, farmland and livestock in the areas reached by the enemy were mostly damaged, and the situation is serious. Therefore, production in Hebei, Shandong, and other places has generally decreased. After arriving in the United States this time, I discussed the issue of food distribution to our country with various countries. It is expected that 120,000 tons of rice will arrive in our country in the second quarter of this year. The amount of wheat to be shipped has not yet been determined. However, the nature of the food problem is multifaceted. On the one hand, it needs the assistance of UNRRA and various countries, and on the other hand, domestic efforts must be made to increase production. Currently, what can be done is: (1) Major cities (especially Shanghai) should strictly implement a food conservation campaign. Ordinary people do not waste food, but the wealthy class in cities waste even more. Therefore, after arriving in Shanghai, I immediately suggested that the government urgently implement compulsory food conservation measures. (2) The transportation and distribution of food depend on the cooperation of all parties. Priority must be given to food transportation so that food can be quickly transported from various seaports to disaster areas for distribution and relief. Jiang also answered questions raised by reporters: (1) The increase in food production in various places is being actively planned and promoted. UNRRA will successively ship various agricultural equipment and chemical raw materials. (2) The date of UNRRA's work in Asia was originally scheduled to end at the end of March next year, but it may be considered for extension due to actual needs. (3) The date of the UNRRA Far East Committee meeting has been set for June 7th of this year, and the location is in our country. (4) The relief work of the Administration extends to general disaster-stricken refugees within China, regardless of region, nationality, religion, or party affiliation. (5) The funding for UNRRA's relief and rehabilitation work in our country was originally hoped to be US$94.5 million, but after several consultations, it is now expected to be maintained at more than US$560 million. (6) It is estimated that it will take at least until the 37th year of the Republic of China (1948) before there are signs of our country's food production returning to pre-war levels.

### Vice Minister Pang Discusses Relief for the Food Shortage: A Food Conservation Campaign Should Be Promoted

Pang Songzhou, Vice Minister of Food, met with reporters yesterday afternoon and said that the first priority for relieving the food shortage should be to promote a food conservation campaign, hoping that all provinces and cities in the country will implement it according to local conditions. The pilot project on grain and currency problems is of a trial nature. If the local food situation can achieve good results such as price stability and abundant reserves after the first batch is completed, then a second batch will be held, which is planned to be promoted to the rice-producing areas of Anhui and Jiangxi. As for whether the seventeen grain merchants who received loans this time will have continued hope in the future, it will all depend on their performance. Pang himself has extreme hopes for the future of food prices in the city, hoping that they will soon fall back to the 30,000 yuan mark. In addition, Pang stated that in order to make up for the shortage of food, he has asked Jiang Tingfu, who has just returned from the United States, to suggest to the United Nations that our country be allowed to send personnel to freely purchase in the areas of Burma, Saigon, and Rangoon. If agreed, it will be implemented immediately.

### The First American Ship Specializing in Rice Transportation Will Arrive in Shanghai at the End of the Month

(Our Dispatch) After the victory, the United States has been continuously transporting military supplies, relief supplies, fuel, and other items. Because our country lacks food, the United States is very concerned. In addition to shipping a large amount of wheat and flour, it also plans to send more ships to sail in the South Seas to specialize in transporting rice. According to the American President Lines, the War Shipping Administration has entrusted four Ford ships to sail between Hong Kong, Sumatra, Singapore, Siam, and Shanghai. The first ship, Ford Whehmel (transliteration), has already departed from San Francisco and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month. It is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to the South Seas on the 3rd of next month and transport rice from Siam, Sumatra, and other places to Shanghai. The ship is about 3,000 tons and can carry 2,000 tons of cargo.

### The Office of the Ministry of Finance's Special Commissioner for Beijing and Shanghai Will Close at the End of the Month

[Our Dispatch] According to the person in charge of the Office of the Ministry of Finance's Special Commissioner for Beijing and Shanghai, the office will be closed at the end of this month. The office was dispatched in September last year to handle financial and monetary affairs in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, and it has been more than seven months since then. The work is difficult and complicated, but there are very few staff members. The expenses used in the seven months are only more than 40 million yuan. The major tasks include: (1) Taking over financial institutions. (2) Taking over and reorganizing enemy financial institutions. (3) Taking over and liquidating puppet financial institutions. (4) Assisting foreign banks in taking over looted assets. (5) Reorganizing commercial financial institutions. (6) Reorganizing insurance companies. (7) Exchanging counterfeit Central Reserve Certificates. (8) Assisting in eliminating strikes and providing loans for factory resumption. (9) Improving the bill exchange system. (10) Urging state-owned banks to establish branches. (11) Handling the settlement of foreign exchange for export goods in emergencies.

### Imported Candies and Biscuits Flood the Market - Our Manufacturers Will Fall into Despair

### Housing Allocation Committee Holds Third Meeting; Two Draft Contracts Approved with Amendments; Temporary Ban on Home Sales by Owners

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Executive Yuan's Housing Allocation Committee for various Shanghai agencies held its third meeting yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Attendees included Chairman Qian Dajun, Vice Chairmen Peng Xuepei and Huang Boqiao, and committee members Xu Jilong, Pan Gongzhan, Liu Gongyun, Li Jilan, Wang Guanghan, and Li Chongshi, among others. Four resolutions were passed: (1) The Central Trust Bureau's draft "Lease Contract" was approved with amendments. (2) The Central Trust Bureau's draft "Sublease Contract" was approved with amendments. (3) Regarding enemy alien small shops, which are managed by the Shanghai Municipal Government's Receiving and Managing Office for Materials, whether such storefronts and houses, if not enemy or puppet property, should be leased in a unified manner. It was resolved that the Shanghai Municipal Government's Receiving and Managing Office for Materials should continue to handle them, and unified leasing would not be implemented. (4) The English name of the committee was determined to be House Distribution Committee Shanghai Area Executive Yuan.

From its establishment until the day before yesterday, the committee received over 310 applications from various agencies and over 60 registrations from property owners.

Enemy properties, totaling over 1,000 buildings, will be handled by the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau through public auctions. Auction procedures are currently being drafted.

Furthermore, the city's Allied national housing totals over 3,000 buildings. These must also be registered with the Allocation Committee before April 30. After review by the committee, surplus housing, excluding those needed by owners for their own use, will be allocated for rent by the committee. Rental income will be returned to the owners, and private subletting by owners is not permitted. It is reported that foreign merchants held a special meeting yesterday morning to discuss this matter.

[Additional News] Recently, some property owners, due to their inability to freely rent out their properties, have decided to sell them. Fearing that this will cause more disputes, the committee has decided to prohibit owners from selling their properties until all housing disputes are fully resolved. The ban will be lifted after the processing is complete, it is said.

During the counting of these valuable treasures, Jiang and the person in charge of the Traitorous Property Group affixed seals together before they were stored at the Central Bank for safekeeping, in order to show caution.

### Colonel Fang Zhizhou Reports on the Situation of Overseas Chinese in the Philippines; At Least Over Ten Thousand Died Unnaturally; Hopes the Government Will Unite to Support Overseas Chinese

[Our Newspaper's Report] Colonel Fang Zhizhou, president of the Philippine New China Daily and chief of staff of the Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, recently came to Shanghai from Manila. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, he specially hosted the city's press at the Xin Ya Restaurant, giving a detailed report on the situation of overseas Chinese and general conditions in the Philippines. Fang first represented various overseas Chinese organizations in the Philippines to pay respect to all sectors of the motherland. He then stated the mission of his visit. According to him:

The New China Daily was founded by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in 1914 and is one of the two major party newspapers locally. During the Japanese occupation, the newspaper's machinery was completely removed, and many editorial staff were detained. The newspaper's chairman and three editors died as a result. After the liberation, it resumed publication on Double Tenth Day last year. The Philippine Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army was organized under the leadership of the Overseas Chinese Kuomintang branch. During the war, in addition to engaging in underground intelligence liaison work in Manila, it also launched guerrilla warfare against the Japanese bandits in the mountains. It had a radio station to contact Australia and was directly commanded by the U.S. Southwest Pacific Command, cooperating with the Philippine military guerrilla forces. Later, it assisted the

U.S. Sixth Army in clearing the remaining enemy forces. Regarding the affairs of the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society, the Philippine branch, Fang also reported in detail. It is said that there are currently over a thousand members, all of whom are outstanding figures locally. As for the situation of overseas Chinese in recent years, they have suffered deeply from the devastation of violent enemies. It is estimated that among the 150,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, at least over ten thousand have died unnatural deaths. Over half of the houses in Manila were destroyed. After the liberation, commerce gradually recovered, and the revival of overseas Chinese commerce is quite good, already ten times greater than before the war, which has aroused jealousy among the local Filipinos, so anti-Chinese incidents often occur. It is hoped that the motherland government can unite and become stronger to support overseas Chinese abroad. He then discussed the issue of judging the loyalty and treachery of overseas Chinese in the Philippines, educational issues, and many other matters, hoping that the government would pay attention to them. Currently, the urgent demands of overseas Chinese are

to allocate more ships so that overseas Chinese remaining in the Philippines can return to their home countries separately. It is also said that the Philippines began its election campaign on the 15th of this month, and the matter can be concluded at the end of this month. The election results will greatly affect overseas Chinese. Those participating in the election include the current Prime Minister Osmena and Roxas. The former has overseas Chinese blood and is quite sympathetic to overseas Chinese, while the latter is opposed to them. The election result is still uncertain. However, judging from the current situation, Osmena seems to have greater momentum, and the overseas Chinese are also unanimously supporting him, it is said.

### Reception Station Established in Shanghai to Receive National Assembly Delegates

The office has consulted with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Shanghai Railway Administration to establish a transportation reception station for National Assembly delegates and to set up delegate rest rooms at various stations and docks. Regarding the issues of transportation, food, and lodging for the delegates arriving in Shanghai, the office has sent letters to relevant parties requesting a consultation at the office at 10:00 AM today.

### Failure to Borrow Money from Cousin Leads to Arrest for Attempted Kidnapping

[Our Newspaper's Report] The rascal Lin Yinmu recently failed to borrow several hundred thousand yuan in legal tender from his cousin, Xin Lian, who lives at No. 7 Fengjing Road.

Xin Lian happened to be going to Lin Chenghua's house in Nanyang Bridge. After hearing this, Yinmu followed in a bus (license plate number 20017). When they drove to the intersection of Minguo Road and Fangbang Road, Feng Shiying, a patrol officer of the City God Temple Sub-bureau, plainclothes police chief Li Haosheng, and Ju Bin saw the car and found it suspicious, so they blocked the road. A U.S.-made pistol and four bullets were found in the car. They were taken to the bureau for interrogation. According to Yinmu's confession, he harbored resentment because he failed to borrow money and colluded with the soldier to kidnap and extort money. The two criminals were sent to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation and prosecution.

### Answering Readers - Medicine and Health

Hu Gang Asks I am eighteen years old and have suffered from asthma (chronic bronchitis) since childhood. It often occurs in the spring and autumn. Doctors are helpless. When it occurs, breathing is obstructed and extremely difficult. In the past, the episode lasted only one day, so it would heal in a week. In recent years, it has become malignant, with episodes lasting up to three days and nights, and the exhaustion is extreme. May I ask (1) Is asthma a terminal illness? (2) Please advise on symptomatic and curative treatments. (3) What can be done to reduce pain during an episode?

Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi Answers The root cause of the chronic bronchitis asthma you suffer from must be studied in detail. It is best to use X-ray photography to determine if there is bronchiectasis? On one hand, multiple vitamin pills can be taken internally, and glucose calcium iodide injections can be given to replenish the lungs and blood. You should also consult an internist for a detailed examination and treatment.

Xu Yuanmu Asks Around October 1944, I lived in the countryside. Because I did not get along well with the villagers, I felt quite lonely, so I had a relationship with an unmarried woman who was older than me, about six or seven times. During this time, I felt pain in the glans, difficulty urinating, redness and swelling of the left testicle, and swelling in the lower abdomen. After urination, a liquid similar to semen flowed out. At first, I thought it was because I was holding back sperm. Recently, after reading Dr. Yao Erchang's book on venereal diseases, I realized that it was gonorrhea and that it might even lead to infertility. I am now very regretful. I ask several questions and pray that you will not look at me as a "sinner" and "ignore" me. (1) Are the aforementioned symptoms gonorrhea? (2) Are the symptoms related and can they be cured? (3) Where is a good place to have a full body examination, and how much will it cost? Is there a free place? (4) How long will it take to be cured, and how much will it cost? (5) If I wait until graduation to work (in two years), will the symptoms worsen? (6) Will I become infertile? (7) I am now engaged. Should I cancel the engagement to avoid misfortune for the other party? (Not the aforementioned woman)

Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi Answers (1) It is probably gonorrhea. A scientific microbiological smear test is required for diagnosis. (2) The symptoms are related and there is hope for a complete cure. (3) You can go to the Civilian Clinic Department organized by the Yibang Road Physician Association for a full body examination and consultation on treatment options. (4) It will not cost much, as only the cost of medicine will be charged, or you can go to other municipal hospitals for free treatment. (5) It must be treated immediately. (6) It may still be possible to have children in the future. (7) It is not necessary to cancel the engagement. After curing the hidden disease, you can still marry.

Li Jurong Asks I am twenty-four years old, male. Seven years ago, when I was studying at junior high school, I suffered a heatstroke and fainted. After being rescued and waking up, I continued to study without rest. A few months later, I experienced palpitations, high internal pressure, dizziness, and weak legs. After treatment by a Chinese medicine doctor, I recovered, but it was never completely cured. Last August, I suffered another heatstroke and the old illness relapsed, with even more severe symptoms. Not only can I not study, but I also suffer from mental depression that is difficult to describe. Please advise on a good remedy and recuperation method.

Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi Answers The heart disease you suffer from is probably related to a lack of vitamin B. You should take more vitamins B and C, and at the same time consult a specialist for a detailed examination and diagnosis.

### Service Brief

A Planned Fraud: To the Editor: I used to work for a government agency. Three years ago, I was dismissed by the puppet government and returned to Suzhou with my family to live off savings, experiencing great hardship. After the victory, the authorities, mindful of my plight, reinstated me. I immediately came to Shanghai to work, but because it is not easy to find a house in Shanghai, I had to leave my family in Suzhou. The expenses in both places are already more than I can afford. Recently, a letter to my family was opened and a large sum of money was fraudulently taken. My family was unaware and fell into their trap. The thieves planned meticulously. I imagine that there are many single travelers in Shanghai who have left their families in the mainland. I fear that similar incidents may occur. Therefore, I hastily write this letter, earnestly requesting you to correct and publish it, so that travelers can take precautions. This humble opinion may be of some benefit to social stability. Wang Wen, respectfully.

At the same time, branches were established throughout the country. Now, there are also branches in Taiwan, with the aim of increasingly promoting the education of children, which is related to the fate of the country. This is my only wish. Therefore, since I founded the Children's Bookstore, I have always stood on my post, working hard. After the victory, I also served as the Standing Director of the Bookstore Association and the Education Editor of the Shen Bao, all with the spirit of hard work, serving the public. Now, the municipality is facing many tasks to be done.

### A Word on the Incense Season: "Borrowing Buddha to Enjoy Spring" in Hangzhou

— Communication on the 20th, Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Chu Yusheng

The incense season has arrived, and people "borrowing Buddha to enjoy spring" in Hangzhou are shoulder to shoulder.

The Shanghai-Hangzhou trains are full, packed like sardines. The railway authorities, to meet the needs, specially added one train and one gasoline train. However, train tickets are always sold out the day before the train departs. This includes all kinds of different people, the poorer ones who want to go to Hangzhou, so they take fourth-class or third-class cars, the richer ones who also want to go to Hangzhou, taking first-class or second-class cars, they have not seen Hangzhou - West Lake for eight years. Today, after the victory, they will naturally "have a good time."

(1) Profits Tripled

In Hangzhou at this time, the happiest are of course the hotels and restaurants. You run through all the hotels in Hangzhou, all hanging the sign of being full. Some tourists ask to share a bed, but the hotel owner replies "There is no place to share a bed." Therefore, hotel room rates have risen shockingly, 10,000, 5,000 a night are very ordinary prices. In the morning, noon, and night, the restaurants also announced that they are full. There are many customers standing waiting for the guests on the table to finish eating, so they can sit down and eat themselves. The voices of the waiters in the restaurants are hoarse, and the abacus of the cashier is constantly ringing. One Hangzhou friend roughly estimated that about 10,000 fish and 5,000 catties of local meat are eaten every day. Originally, Hangzhou's fish, broad beans, tofu, and local southern meat are very famous. Several important streets, such as Yanling Road near the lakeside, such as the bustling commercial streets of Sanyuanfang, Qingtai Road, Xinmin Road, Yingzi Road, etc., each store is competing to win, neon lights are ingenious, radio broadcasts Shaoxing opera, but there are few Shanghai songs. Several dance halls are noisy outside. Hangzhou native products such as sand peaches, incense myrtle, lotus root flour, and tea are sold out every day. Especially Yanling Road, the store is still open until 12:00 PM, broadcasting radio music.

Boats, rickshaws, taxis, and sedan chairs are all making triple profits. It is said that boats can earn 20,000 yuan a day, rickshaw drivers can earn 15,000 yuan a day, taxi rentals are 12,000 yuan per hour. Although public buses are cheaper, the body is a truck, and passengers are desperately squeezing up, becoming "sardines." The sedan chair business is also not bad, each sedan chair can earn 10,000 yuan a day.

(2) Two Types of Tourists

Tourists can be divided into two types, one is from the fields, the peasants, they wear blue cloth jackets, some women also wear red skirts, everyone carries a yellow cloth bag, holds rosary beads in their hands, holding long incense, passing through the road in a hurry, going to the mountains to burn incense. The other is from the city, men in suits and leather shoes, and women dressed in fancy clothes, some women also wear Chinese-style short jackets, but wear long Western-style pants, the peasants who go to the mountains to burn incense will always look at them a few times. These men and women from the city are not used to walking, but when they come to Hangzhou, they always have to climb mountains and ridges, and the leather shoes they wear on their feet are absolutely not suitable for climbing mountains. Smart merchants make a kind of openwork cloth shoes, and straw-woven cool hats, to sell to tourists, almost every man and woman from the city has bought cloth shoes and cool hats. They wear them on their heads and feet, showing an unusually proud look.

(3) Sending off and Welcoming

The monks, they welcome and send off incense visitors, take out yellow books, ask the guests to cultivate merits. People always want auspiciousness, and few people who go to the temple are stingy and do not give money. The Arhat Hall of Lingyin Temple was destroyed by fire, and now it is being rebuilt. In the One-Line Sky of Feilai Peak, a monk uses a long bamboo pole to point to the tourists, and after watching, he reaches out to the tourists and shouts "Amitabha." In the Five-Colored Fish of Yuquan Temple, the people in the temple hold out basins of sliced ​​yam, teasing the fish to compete for food, but the result is also to ask the tourists to give some rewards. Taoguang and Tianzhu also want the tourists to make wishes, so they can fly high in the future.

(4) The Monk "Understood"

The main hall of Jingci Temple is crooked, and many people are worried about this magnificent main hall. The monks hold out the alms book and ask you to write some great wishes. The Wood Transport Well has already been burned down, but now it is still the Wood Transport Well, people, even though they know it is fake, still tell the unknowing people in a serious manner: "This is the one that Jigong used to transport wood from the well to build the main hall of Jingci Temple."

The Liuhe Pagoda is about to repair the temple hall, and the Stone House Cave is also about to repair the hexagonal pavilion. A monk in the Stone House Cave said: "We have no temple property, only a barren mountain behind." Another monk said: "Being a monk to this day, we can no longer eat for free, we should do some labor, and exchange labor for the price of survival, this is the meaning of life." A set of theories, eloquent, the monk really "understood."

(5) West Lake Boat

In West Lake, the number of boats is less seen in the past eight years, but according to the boatmen, it is only half of what it was before the war. Three Pools Mirroring the Moon is a must-go place for every tourist, and the staff of the photo studio there are so busy that they are overwhelmed. The tourists in Huxin Pavilion are also crowded.

In the famous Louwailou and Taiheyuan restaurants in the Inner West Lake, their dishes are also famously expensive, but if tourists do not taste the Louwailou dishes and wine, it is equivalent to coming to Hangzhou for nothing.

On the streets of Hangzhou, seeing incense visitors from various foreign countries with different costumes, it also has a bit of competing for beauty.

In the past, the bulk of Hangzhou's revenue during peacetime was based on the spring and autumn incense seasons. Now, unfortunately, it is impossible to count how many people and how much money are invested in Hangzhou during this incense season.

People are forgetful, the trauma of the past eight years, and the responsibility for the future, when visiting Hangzhou, everything is left behind.

But in Hong Kong, we have begun to feel the heat of the summer sun. Summer clothes have already been put on the market, and women are wearing snow-white "sarcenet" long coats, swaggering through the city. On the big windows of department stores, British linen priced at 35 yuan per yard is hung up, and white buckskin shoes drive away their black-skinned and yellow-skinned companions, gaining the appreciation of the owner. Those who are accustomed to (enjoying themselves) are worrying about how to spend the summer. The government, because it is determined to fill in the beach in North Point according to the original plan and build piles, closed the former sea bathing area. If you go to the beaches far away from the city to swim, there are not enough cars to allocate, and there is also a lack of cross-sea ferries. It is said that those beaches still have some uncleared mines. Who would be willing to risk such unpredictable dangers with a golden body? Thinking about it, you still have to have at least an electric refrigerator, but most of the old ones have been destroyed, and the new ones have not yet been transported, which is really a headache.

Changing Seasons

Talk about Easy

However, what is really a headache is the general salaried class. A set of the worst white serge suit costs at least 120 Hong Kong dollars. A suit made of naval cloth costs 180 Hong Kong dollars. British Tootal linen is more valuable than inferior thin velvet, and it is impossible to think about it without 400 yuan. Wear "Hawaiian shirts", the cheapest one costs 40 or 50 yuan. Ties cost at least 5 yuan each, and fresh patterns cost more than 10 yuan. As for Chinese clothing, ordinary willow cloth, new goods produced by local restoration factories have been put on the market, costing 5 to 7 yuan per yard. A new dress, including labor and materials, cannot be done without 30 or 40 yuan. With a monthly income of about 100 yuan, it is really not easy for the salaried class to "change seasons"!

Hong Kong Island Ten Years

Price Comparison

As the seasons change, so do the things in society: electricity prices have increased, water prices have increased, publicly priced items have increased, cross-sea ferries have also increased, and it is said that trams are preparing to increase fares, so public buses will certainly not be willing to lag behind. Although food prices have not yet soared, they have risen to an alarming degree. According to semi-official statistics, food prices in Hong Kong have recently risen 14 and a half times higher than ten years ago. The general income of Hong Kong residents has at most increased four or five times compared to ten years ago. The suffering is self-evident. Ten years ago, that is, the beginning of Japan's invasion of China, at that time, the people of the mainland moved to Hong Kong to take refuge, and food prices began to rise with the supply relationship. The following is a breakdown of each item, to see a shift:

March this year 1937

Category Price (Hong Kong dollars) March price

Rice (per catty) 1.7 0.7

Pork 3.5 0.35

Beef 3.6 0.25

Fish 2.2 0.2

Sugar 2.8 0.7

Firewood 0.1 0.15

Salt 0.25 0.01

Vegetables 0.45 0.03

Salted Fish 3.0 0.115

Tea 4.8 0.4

Eggs (per piece) 0.2 0.015

Publicly Priced Food

Supply Westerners

Recently, the food cost in Hong Kong is at least 40 yuan per month per person, which is the most economical Chinese food, and it is also the figure budgeted by the Labor Bureau for general workers. Foreigners can still buy publicly priced food, fresh and canned, and have everything at home. The government is helping them to raise funds in various ways, and the supply is constant. Therefore, the food cost of a "big boss" at home is not much different from that of his servant or driver, but he eats fish and meat in the morning and evening, coffee and butter, and eats with a full stomach, while his subordinates eat light vegetables and light rice, just to satisfy their hunger. This ingenious calculation is really thanks to the "Far East Relief and Rehabilitation Subcommittee of the British Cabinet in London" for coming up with it.

Mosquitoes Fly Around

Rats Jump Beams

The weather is getting hotter day by day, mosquitoes are flying all over the sky (Hong Kong was known for having no mosquitoes before the war, and there was no need to hang a net in summer). Malaria is prevalent, and there are also many rats. A rat-catching expert was sent from London to carry out a rat-killing campaign, and the authorities have been advising residents to get vaccinations for days. Hong Kong compatriots are gasping for breath under the pressure of the summer heat.

### Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Jiangxi Branch: Promoting Rural Emergency Relief, Dispatching Work Teams to Expand Work Areas and Scope

— Nanchang Correspondence, 19th, by Li Guohua

Of Jiangxi's eighty-three counties, more than sixty were ravaged by the enemy, leaving only a dozen or so spared. In northern Jiangxi, counties such as Pengze, Hukou, Ruichang, and Xingzi successively fell in the summer of the 27th year [1938]. In the 28th year [1939], the enemy invaded each county along the Nanchang-Jiujiang railway, with Jiujiang, Yongxiu, Wuning, Dean, and Xiushui falling one after another. The provincial capital, Nanchang, was also occupied by the enemy that year. During the 28th and 29th years [1939-1940], fierce battles raged between our forces and the enemy in the border region of Jiangxi and Hunan, such as in Pingxiang, Gao'an, and Shanggao, causing extensive destruction. In the 31st year [1942], along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway, our forces and the enemy repeatedly advanced and retreated, gaining and losing ground in quick succession, leaving villages in ruins wherever the enemy cavalry went. Counties such as Shangrao, Yushan, Guangfeng, Guixi, Hengfeng, and Geyang suffered enormous losses. In the 33rd year [1944], the enemy infiltrated from Lianhua and Yongxin in the west into Taihe, Ji'an, Ganxian, and other counties in the south, engaging in arson, murder, and looting without restraint. In the 34th year [1945], the enemy in southern Jiangxi moved north again, and although the duration was short, the burning and killing were horrific.

Years of War, Enemy Cavalry Rampaging

Years of war, never ceasing, were compounded by the large-scale destruction inflicted by the enemy on the counties in northwestern Jiangxi, where they occupied territory for as long as seven years. The various losses are simply incalculable. In terms of housing, taking Nanchang City as an example, of the original 37,679 numbered houses, 26,958 have been destroyed. Only 10,721 remain, with losses exceeding 70 percent. In other words, the existing houses are less than one-third of what they were before the war. And even that remaining fraction is mostly dilapidated, peeling, and incomplete, having largely lost their original appearance. In other counties such as Jiujiang, Dean, Xingzi, Yongxiu, Ji'an, Ganxian, Shangrao, and Gao'an, housing losses were also above 78 percent. Losses in other dozens of counties were also above 60 percent. It is estimated that the total housing loss in the province is around 390,000 buildings. Approximately 1.6 million people are homeless. In terms of clothing, approximately 2.6 million people lack adequate clothing, and approximately 2.3 million people require partial relief. Due to the destruction of houses, the common people fled long ago. Over the past eight years, a considerable number of elderly people and adults have been killed, died of illness, or even starved to death. Children and infants, lacking food and clothing, naturally have a high mortality rate. Under these circumstances, the abandonment of farmland is inevitable, and it is difficult to obtain an accurate overall figure at this time. Based on what has already been investigated, more than 2 million mu of land in the counties of northern Jiangxi has been abandoned. In many areas of southwestern Jiangxi, there is no sign of human habitation for dozens of miles, and the desolation is simply alarming. Although eastern Jiangxi was occupied by the enemy for a shorter period, and recovered earlier, there is still plenty of land awaiting cultivation due to various reasons. As for the loss of draught cattle in the rural areas of various counties, although the reasons are not entirely the same, there are as many as eleven counties where the loss has reached more than half. The lack of cattle in other counties is no better. Jiangxi province was originally a rice-producing area, so the issue of seeds is not a problem. However, it is very difficult for impoverished farmers to find the money to buy them. All of these issues are being considered by the Jiangxi Branch.

Rural Emergency Relief: Overview of the Pilot Program Last Winter

When it was established at the end of October last year, the rural emergency relief was listed as one of the urgent tasks to be undertaken. Therefore, in early December last year, areas most severely affected and most seriously ravaged were selected for a pilot program. These were divided into: Nanchang area; Dean, Xingzi, Yongxiu area; Gao'an, Shanggao area. The purpose of the relief was to assist in the resumption of cultivation. The target of the relief was impoverished farmers and their families who had already returned to their hometowns (and whom the Branch had actually helped to return). The area of the relief was a desolate rural area. The relief supplies were: cash (to purchase building materials), winter clothing (distributed), salt, rice, flour (distributed or provided as payment for work), seeds, and farm tools (distributed). The relief methods were: distribution of food and payment for work. The ravaged rural areas needed such relief, and the Jiangxi Branch was proceeding with the principles of speed and certainty. Speed meant doing it immediately. Certainty meant that the assistance would truly reach the people, and truly provide them with tangible benefits.

The work teams in the above areas departed one after another in December last year. They began by conducting investigations and convening meetings with local gentry and Baojia heads to decide on all the procedures and methods. They then implemented the program, based on the results of the investigations and meetings, quickly and surely deploying the work. The Nanchang area (excluding the special project handled by Nanchang City) included several key locations in Nanchang County: Shabutan, Wanshe, and Xincun. These places used to be densely populated villages with houses lined up one after another. Now, they are desolate, boundless expanses. Within thirty li, there is not a single house or a single person to be seen. The emergency relief measures in this area were divided into four parts: (1) Constructing three types of farmhouses (bamboo frames and thatched roofs: (i) collective farmhouses; (ii) individual farmhouses; (iii) assisted farmhouses). (2) Distributing cotton clothes, flour, farm tools, and seeds. (3) Providing payment for work. (4) Collecting and burying corpses.

### Original Plan: Building 800 Thatched Cottages

The Branch's original plan was to build 800 thatched cottages, with 300 allocated to the Nanchang area, 250 to the Gao'an Shanggao area, and 250 to the Dean, Yongxiu, Xingzi area. In addition, 200 brick-tiled farmhouses were to be built, with 80 allocated to the Nanchang area, 60 to the Dean, Yongxiu, Xingzi area, and 60 to the Gao'an Shanggao area. Furthermore, 3,000 cotton clothes and 3,000 sets of farm tools (including plows, hoes, and harrows) were to be temporarily produced, and 500 dan of seeds were to be delivered to each area for distribution. As for draught cattle, the number needed was very large, and the cost was even greater, so a separate request was made for a special appropriation to handle it.

As of now, in the three key locations of Shabutan, Wanshe, and Xincun in the Nanchang area, 127 farmhouses have been built, 1,000 cotton clothes and 900 bags of flour have been distributed, and 2,700 corpses have been collected and buried. In addition, 36 convenient bridges have been repaired. Among the farmhouses, there are collective farmhouses for communal living, assisted farmhouses built with assistance, and individual farmhouses for individual living. Seeds are waiting to be distributed once draught cattle are available.

After detailed and thorough investigation, the disaster situation and disaster areas in the Gao'an and Shanggao area, the following nine key relief locations have been identified: (1) In Gao'an, Xiongjiaqiangxia and Zhangjia in Chongde Township, two key locations, will each have 20 farmhouses built. (2) Fengda and Ouling in Yifeng Township, two key locations, will each have 40 farmhouses built. (3) Angxi and Gongshan in Gaoyou Township, two key locations, will each have 50 farmhouses built. (4) Xiangfushan and Yanjia Mountain in Xiangfu Township, two key locations, will each have 70 farmhouses built. Construction has already begun and is progressing rapidly, and will be completed in the shortest possible time. Winter clothing, farm tools, and seeds are also being distributed according to the actual situation. However, draught cattle are lacking and still need to be purchased and distributed.

The investigation work in the Dean, Yongxiu, and Xingzi area has been completed, except for Xingzi, which is still in progress. The key relief locations in each county have also been determined. The key locations in Dean are Fucheng and Wushi in the first district. The key locations in Yongxiu are Zhanggongdu and Yangjialing. Winter clothing has already been distributed, and thatched cottages are being built according to the planned schedule.

The rural emergency relief in the above three areas has been carried out in sequence and will be completed one after another. Areas that were desolate and uninhabited three months ago now have houses and people. These people are preparing for the work of resuming cultivation. They receive relief in the form of clothing, food, and shelter upon their return, and they are deeply grateful for this. Therefore, when they are assigned to transport materials and build farmhouses, they know that this is for their own benefit, and they work very energetically. They receive salt, rice, or flour for each day of work. For carrying a bamboo pole or 100 bundles of straw, they receive four liang of salt. For collecting one jin of corpses, they receive one liang of salt. If they participate in the construction of collective farmhouses, they receive a total of one jin of salt or three jin of flour per day. This is the Branch's method of paying for work, and the benefits are truly felt by them. Therefore, they work very happily. Sometimes they are so happy that they even sing folk songs while working. They all say in unison: This is the first time they have felt happy in eight years. Speaking of collecting and burying corpses, it makes them sad. Because many of these heads and limbs belong to their fathers, brothers, and children. Having been brutally murdered, the corpses are blurred and can no longer be identified.

### Dividing into Fifteen Districts, Each District Establishing a Work Team

The Jiangxi Branch's pilot program for rural emergency relief has been effective, and it is deemed necessary to expand and generalize it. Moreover, the entire business development will begin with this great work. Therefore, in late February of this year, the sixty counties in the province affected by the disaster were divided into fifteen districts. Each district will have a work team, with each work team covering three to seven counties.

The selection of the team leaders for these fifteen work teams (except for the Nanchang area) has been decided after much searching and consideration. Because this kind of work is extremely difficult, it requires a spirit of service and intelligent qualities to be able to do it happily. Now that the selection of personnel has been finalized and the preparations are complete, they have set off one after another, advancing separately. As for the work guidelines, its organization and business items, rural emergency relief is the main item—there are other detailed and specific regulations, which are not within the scope of this article and will be reported in another article.

How to Campaign for Municipal Councilors?

Editor: The city will elect its first municipal councilors on April 28th. This is an important step in practicing democracy and the best test of public opinion. However, according to the newspaper's special report on the 20th, only a little over a thousand Class A candidates for public office have emerged among the 3.3 million citizens of the city. Why, at a time when democracy and autonomy are being loudly proclaimed, do citizens still lack interest in campaigning? I think that in addition to the two possible explanations of "not enough time" and "not enough publicity," the facts are not being presented genuinely enough. Now that the election date is approaching, candidates participating in the election should, in principle, be working hard in their respective electoral districts to promote their true talents and learning, and their political ideas, in order to win the trust and support of the dominant voters. However, as of this writing, very few are actually doing so. Those who are adopting the methods of "relying on personal connections" and "wooing with banquets" are very enthusiastic. If a portion of this municipal council is truly won by the latter methods, then it is still far from "democracy." Moreover, the amount of money wasted on these banquets is appalling, with no regard for the hardship of the masses or the cries of the disaster areas. I think that candidates with true insight and vision would never do this. My feelings are directed towards the meaning of criticizing the worthy in the style of the Spring and Autumn Annals. Please emulate the spirit of free elections in allied nations, and appeal to voters based on political views and knowledge, and save the money spent on banquets to support the Teacher Respect Movement or disaster relief work. Wouldn't that be better? Que Yifan, 21st.

The Issue of Private Schools Increasing Tuition Fees

Editor: I greatly admire the noble intentions of the Teacher Respect Movement reported in your newspaper, but it seems that poor students have not been considered or cared for. I would like to submit a few opinions and kindly request that they be published: (1) Public and private schools both cultivate youth. Since public school students can be exempted from tuition increases, why should private schools be the only ones to increase tuition by double? (2) Private school students' families have varying degrees of wealth. Poor families struggle to raise tuition fees for their children, and before they can catch their breath, they are suddenly asked to pay double. They simply do not have the strength to do so. (3) It is said that private schools claim that increasing tuition by double is not fundraising, but in reality, it amounts to coerced donations, which poor students cannot bear. (4) Which parents do not wish their children to succeed in their studies? If I am unable to continue paying due to lack of funds, should I then stop attending school? (5) If I stop attending school because of this, is there a risk that many idle children will go astray? Do schools have any remedial measures? (6) The enthusiasm and dedication of the private schools and the teachers' efforts to educate and cultivate talent are deeply admired. However, I can think of other good methods, such as voluntary fundraising. Wealthy people have surplus money and can donate more without any problem, while poor people cannot even afford food and firewood, so let them be. (7) Or, ask the government to understand this plight and provide appropriate subsidies, so that they know that schools and teachers are not simply a labor-capital relationship, and poor teachers are like coolies. The government must also show some compassion in order to popularize education and prevent the poor from being excluded. Ye Gong, submitted.

### Tongji University Moving to Shanghai

Students' Travel Expenses to Shanghai: 150,000 Per Person

[Our Newspaper, Lizhuang] The first group of teachers and students from Tongji University has departed in batches on the 21st, totaling 300 people. They are traveling via the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway, including three Germans of Chinese descent. The students' travel expenses to Shanghai are tentatively set at 150,000 yuan per person, with transportation arranged by the university.

Dean Jiang also said that many alumni in Shanghai advocate that Tongji University should switch to English to adapt to the times. Dean Jiang advocates that both English and German should be emphasized. In consideration of their own future and prospects, many students also hope to switch to English.

### Guangdong Women's Normal School Students: Suddenly Requesting Leave Pending Orders, Suddenly Resuming Classes Pending Orders

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou] During the war, students at the Guangdong Provincial Women's Normal School could receive 2.3 dou of public grain per month. After the victory, the public grain was converted into a cash payment of 4,000 yuan, but they only actually received 1,500 yuan per month. This is only enough to eat for three or four days a month, and they are hungry for most of the time. Recently, the students of the Women's Normal School held a meeting to discuss and decided to submit five demands to the Education Department: (1) Provide full meals or issue a loan of 15,000 yuan. (2) Thoroughly improve the school's sanitary facilities. (3) Improve the curriculum for normal school students. (4) Please approve the extension of service for normal school students. (5) Guarantee employment for normal school graduates and improve teachers' salaries. Director Yao of the Education Department came to the school to give a speech, and student representatives presented the above five demands. Director Yao promised to forward them to the Ministry of Education for review. All students of the Women's Normal School requested "leave pending orders." However, after continuous efforts for several days, they were unable to obtain satisfactory results. However, considering that their studies could not be abandoned for long, they resumed classes on the 18th, continuing their requests and resolving to "resume classes pending orders" in order to strive for satisfactory results.

### Teachers and Students Have Their Own Land: School Land Allocated as School Property to Encourage Teachers and Students to Cultivate It

[Special Report from our Chongqing Office] The Ministry of Education recently announced 14 articles of implementation measures for allocating school land in various provinces, cities, and counties as school property. The original text is as follows: (1) The school land of each province, city (including cities directly under the Executive Yuan), and county should be allocated to local schools as school property in accordance with the provisions of these measures, and teachers and students of each school should be encouraged to cultivate it themselves. (2) Provincial school land in each province, such as the academies of prefectures and counties during the imperial examination era, school properties, and academy properties of prefectures, circuits, and provinces, should be allocated to provincial secondary schools nearby as school property. (3) Public school land of counties and cities should be allocated to public primary schools and central schools and secondary schools in the city or county as school property. (4) The allocation of school land should be based on the number of classes. In principle, each class in secondary schools should be allocated 5 to 10 mu, and each class in central schools should be allocated 2 to 5 mu. The allocation should be determined based on the amount of school land available locally. (5) The land allocated to schools for cultivation should be within 5 li from rural schools and within 10 li from urban schools. If there is a surplus after allocation, it should be allocated to nearby schools. (6) The allocation of provincial and municipal school land will be handled by the provincial and municipal education departments, and the allocation of county and city school land will be handled by the county and city governments. Both will be reported by the provincial and municipal education departments to the Ministry of Education for review and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. (7) The school land allocated as school property will be cultivated by the teachers and students of each school. However, if students' physical strength and skills are insufficient for the work, temporary laborers may be hired to assist. The land may also be leased to people for cultivation. Forestation should also be actively carried out on mountain land. (8) School land in each school should be mainly used for planting rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, and nutritious vegetables. (9) The cultivation of school land in primary schools and central schools should be linked to the learning of general knowledge and natural science materials. In secondary schools, it should be linked to subjects such as biology, natural history, hygiene, manual labor, agricultural and industrial arts, and practical training, as well as productive labor training. (10) After the allocation of school land to provinces, cities, and counties to schools, the schools should organize a committee to manage it. All receipts and expenditures should be formally included in the school budget. Before the educational funds of the provinces and cities are raised to compensate, one-third of the original rent should still be paid, and the rent should be reduced annually until the end of the 35th year of the Republic of China, when the compensation is raised and the rent is completely waived. (11) After the school land of provinces, cities, and counties is allocated as school property, the amount of revenue and expenditure should be investigated and listed in the national and autonomous budgets by the provincial education departments and the municipal and county education bureaus before the beginning of each fiscal year. (12) When the acreage of school land allocated to central schools exceeds the prescribed standard, its cultivation should be carried out jointly with nearby national schools. (13) The income from the self-cultivated school land of schools, in addition to paying taxes and meeting the needs of food and nutrition, should be used to enrich equipment fees. The income from other school land, in addition to paying rent, should be used to expand school facilities or supplement current expenses. (14) This law will be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Post-War Normal School Students Extend Service Period

[Special Report from our Nanjing Office] Normal school students are required to serve in primary schools after graduation because they have received public funding. Before the war, it was stipulated that they could continue their studies or transfer to other fields of service only after completing two years. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to promote national education and cultivate teachers for the country, the Ministry of Education agreed that teachers should be used for the benefit of the country. On the one hand, it formulated active measures to enable normal school students to have opportunities for further studies and improve teachers' treatment. On the other hand, it specially stipulated an extension of the service period for normal school graduates by one year. In the past, the service period for normal school graduates from senior high school was two years, but it has now been changed to three years. As for simplified normal schools (divided into four-year and three-year national programs, all of which are for those who have graduated from higher primary schools and received four or three years of normal school education), graduates who have served for one year with excellent results may, after assessment and approval, be promoted to senior high school normal departments for further studies. The one-year simplified normal school (for those who have graduated from junior high school and received one year of normal school education) does not apply to the aforementioned preferential promotion method.

### Educational Trends in Taiwan Province

— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in Taiwan, Muyun

Under the planning of the Education Department of the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, education in Taiwan Province is currently being promoted in an orderly manner. The report is as follows:

The Taiwan University Incident Resolved: The incident at the Affiliated Hospital of National Taiwan University, the highest institution of learning, lasted from the 22nd of last month to the 11th of this month before it was resolved. The cause was that some assistant obstetricians requested the school authorities to issue letters of appointment, and some of those who were unpaid requested to be changed to paid. As a result, both sides insisted, resulting in a deadlock. Notices saying "Sorry to the Patients" were posted high at the gate, and slogans such as "Down with the Patronage System" and "We are Willing to be the 72 Martyrs of the Scientific Revolution" were everywhere on the road, opening a new atmosphere of strikes and medical stoppages in higher education in Taiwan Province. After President Luo returned to Taiwan, he summoned representatives of the two hospitals and agreed to the demands they had made. He supported democratization, and thus the uproar subsided.

Difficulty in Popularizing Mandarin: The movement to replace Japanese with Mandarin has been affected by the inability to quickly develop politics, which has affected its popularity. The 96 Mandarin teachers recruited by the Education Department in Shanghai have been assigned to provincial middle and primary schools after a week of training, but due to insufficient personnel, the distribution is uneven. In fact, the army has helped promote the popularization of Mandarin. The Political Department of the 70th Army in Taipei has trained two classes of students, and it is already difficult for general primary schools to use simple Mandarin to teach because the teachers are all from the province. There are 19 youth training centers in the seven districts of Taipei County, one of which in Shilin Town has been designated as the site for promoting Mandarin, in accordance with the Education Department's regulation of one per county, but it has not yet opened. Since the beginning of December last winter, the national army in Taichung expanded the city's Mandarin training classes from 18 to 24, and the number of students increased from 2,000 to 3,000. Now, it has sharply decreased to only 7 or 8 people per class in the urban area, which originally had 20 to 30 people, a decrease of more than two-thirds. The Tainan China Daily seriously pointed out that this is a terrible low ebb.

Difficulties with National Schools: As national schools implementing compulsory education, most of the school buildings are occupied by troops. The Garrison Headquarters has notified the troops to move out before the 15th, which is expected to solve a difficult problem. Taking Taipei County as an example, there were originally 135 national schools, and the most common number of classes was 28 to 30 classes, such as the Jiaoxi and Ruifang Jiufen National Schools in Yilan. Currently, the students that each school can accommodate are only 30% to 70%, which is a common phenomenon. The principals and important teachers were all Japanese in the past. After they left, Taiwanese took over. The number of teachers has been greatly reduced, and because funds cannot be issued on time, most of them are withheld by the school groups and support associations that support the families. As a result, teachers from other provinces are planning to return home every day, and the Taiwanese are also complaining.

The Prevalence of Petitions: It is very common in the education sector to "appeal" to the authorities and submit "petitions." Some are "blood-printed" with fingerprints. For example, the Provincial Conference of Helpless Scholars in the Datun District of Taichung City "petitioned" the county authorities to request recognition of their qualifications, and then sent representatives to the Administrative Office to submit a "petition." The Civil Engineering and Survey School, a private school in Taiwan, has requested to be changed to a public school because the funds have not been settled, and 72 students and faculty members have jointly submitted a "blood-printed" document. This situation is prevalent in various counties and cities.

Stagnation of Mountain Education: The education of the Shushen indigenous people (i.e., the Takasago people) in the mountain areas, who are located in 22 communities in Taipei County, with about 7,600 people, was carried out in 15 educational institutions established by the Japanese in the past, implementing assimilation policies. The teachers were all armed, and the police were purely oppressive in their education. Since the Japanese left, all of these schools have been shut down. Because the land is barren, the people are poor, and due to environmental reasons, no one is willing to go. Taipei County once recruited educators who were interested in working with the mountain people, but only a few who applied were not educators. Now, the Education Department has set a deadline of the end of this month to complete the supervision and improvement of the national schools for the mountain people, and it is expected that there will be concrete and active measures.

The Style of Respecting Teachers Has Not Declined: In Taiwan, due to past Japanese education, the style of respecting teachers has not declined to this day. The reporter visited the Hsinchu Provincial Commercial Vocational School. According to Principal Wang, the students' good customs of respecting teachers are not found in the mainland. Not only do they salute when they see teachers, but lower grades also stand at attention when they see higher-grade classmates. Petty thieves even steal things from the military but do not take items from the school. Teachers are looked down upon by parents for watching movies and going to bars (since most bars are places for nonsense), and the environment restricts their lives, but the position of teachers is superior, equivalent to the local authoritative gentry. He said happily: I am already the fifth principal after the takeover. The students can already understand Mandarin. Every morning and evening, they raise the flag, sing the party song, and give speeches. Japanese aggressive songs and wearing wooden clogs are prohibited. The students all want to be officials. Of the more than 30 students who just graduated, 19 have been introduced to the city government.

Shrines Changed to People's Education Centers: The Education Department ordered the Japanese shrines in the province to be changed to people's education centers or memorial halls. There are 11 shrines in Taipei County, and they are now planning to reorganize them. The director of the People's Education Center has been appointed, but there is no equipment, and the education funds in the next year's budget must pay more than 40 million, while the estimated tax revenue is only 4 or 5 million. The economic difficulties have put social education and school education in a dilemma. The Japanese who are about to be dismissed and those who are requisitioned and retained know that the fate of the decadent and lost shrines is over, but they do not change their past style and still bow deeply from afar when passing by.

### Amidst Heavy Surveillance, Government Bonds Grow Increasingly Popular, Chinese Stocks Traded for Only One Hour

Government bonds displayed a rare phenomenon yesterday, with police intensifying their crackdown. Suspicious trading houses were subjected to rigorous interrogation. The head of a certain unit on the seventh floor of the stock exchange building was investigated in detail and taken to the police station for questioning. However, transactions, pieced together from various sources, were intermittent. Some were conducted indoors. Initially, at the morning opening, prices lingered around 6,000 yuan. Subsequently, with the involvement of major players from the eastern and western districts, trading became increasingly active, briefly hitting a new high of 6,400 yuan before fluctuating around 6,300 yuan. As a result, Category C bonds closed with a slight increase of 100 yuan compared to the previous day's closing. Unclassified A and B bonds rose by another 300 yuan due to large-scale arbitrage. Category E bonds increased by 200 yuan, while Category D bonds, which were priced the lowest the previous day, rose by a remarkable 400 yuan. Chinese stocks were traded for only one hour before trading was halted. This followed the arrest of a major player from the yarn and cloth building by plainclothes detectives, who took the responsible person to the police station for further investigation. Similar inspections of accounts were carried out elsewhere, leading to a widespread cessation of trading as people sought to avoid attention. However, after the account investigations, sporadic bidding slightly increased prices. After opening, Yong Yarn reached a high of 5,150 yuan, Meiya 4,200 yuan, and Jingfu 423 yuan. Demand for underwear continued, resulting in the highest price increases. Ultimately, Yong Yarn and other seasoned stocks closed slightly lower than the previous day, while other stocks showed mixed gains and losses, except for Chinese underwear, which continued to rise by 10 yuan. Due to the complete shutdown after 10:00 AM, trading times varied, making it difficult to determine a unified price. Foreign stocks also showed some apprehension under unfavorable circumstances, with most stocks slightly declining.

### Crackdown on the Black Market for Securities, U.S. Dollars Become a Rare Commodity Again

Fueled by reports that U.S. agencies in China would be settling salaries in national currency at the U.S. dollar exchange rate starting in May, sensitive individuals feared a significant reduction in the supply of U.S. dollars, leading to speculative hoarding and driving up buying. Although the opening price was stable, it quickly jumped by 100 yuan. After the stock market suspended trading at 10:00 AM, after some fluctuation, another round of price increases began, reaching a high of around 2,350 yuan. A minor sell-off then occurred, briefly pushing the price down to within 2,300 yuan before noon. In the afternoon, the market remained tight, with buyers struggling to find sellers, and bidding gradually increased again. As a result, the closing price was 170 yuan higher than the previous day. The gold exchange rate reached 680 yuan per ten taels. The official U.S. dollar exchange rate remained stable, with bank selling prices still around 2,060 yuan. Hong Kong electricity (shares) and rubber (shares) remained stable, while Hong Kong dollar notes (both new and old) rose by 10 yuan.

Furthermore, it is reported that in order to strictly control U.S. dollars, the authorities will take significant measures and cooperate with the U.S. military authorities in Shanghai to exchange all salaries into legal tender before distribution to prevent them from flowing into the black market. At the same time, the authorities will also establish strict crackdown measures on the buying and selling of U.S. dollars in the black market.

### Gold Prices Rebound

Smelted gold prices were stable yesterday, and the sudden surge in U.S. dollars boosted buying sentiment in the gold market, briefly approaching the Central Bank's allocated price. The morning opening was flat, but the sudden stimulus from the U.S. dollar triggered buying, gradually pushing prices up. At the time of the Central Bank's allocation, it was around 1,575,000. After the stock market shut down at 10:00 AM, speculative funds shifted to gold, which followed the rise of the U.S. dollar, reaching 1,595,000. Subsequently, buyers became apprehensive, and prices fell by over 20,000, hovering around 1,580,000 at noon. In the afternoon, the U.S. dollar strengthened again, and the gold market, aided by this, rebounded slightly, resulting in a rise of 30,000. Ornament gold was 168,000, silver bullion 1,600, and silver dollars were sold at 1,050 yuan. Informal interest rates remained loose, with interest rates ranging from one to one and a half cents.

### Yarn Market Price Increases Gradually Intensifying, 20-Count Yarn Most Popular

The yarn market experienced more significant price increases yesterday. Twenty-count Shuangma (Double Horse) yarn suddenly jumped by 70,000 yuan due to speculative interest. The remaining 22-count yarn, both large and small, also increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, boosting market confidence. Currently, the yarn market favors 20-count yarn, as demand for 20-count is the highest among various groups. As a result, the supply of 20-count yarn, regardless of large or small factories, cannot meet demand. Furthermore, Fangjian (Spinning & Construction) Company supplies very little 20-count yarn, making it difficult for prices to fall in the short term. Yesterday was also the regular sales date for Fangjian Company, with prices similar to the previous time. However, nine additional sets of yarn were auctioned, with industry participants bidding competitively.

### Rayon Prices Rise by 100,000, Spun Silk Stable, Silk Fabrics Rise Sharply

Yesterday, the market for rayon saw more buying than selling, and prices rose sharply. The opening price for 120-count Tianqiao (Sky Bridge) was high at 1,490,000 yuan, and then rose to 1,540,000 yuan at closing. In the afternoon, there was a slight pullback to 1,520,000 yuan, resulting in a rise of as much as 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Semi-gloss rayon rose by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, while spun silk prices remained stable. There were no transactions in foreign goods. Ordinary five-dan goods were traded at 1,850,000 yuan for ten-day promissory notes and 1,870,000 yuan for fifteen-day promissory notes. Silk fabric transactions were very active yesterday, and price increases were also severe. Meiya (American-Asian) bedding rose by 100,000 yuan per hundred pieces. Dachang (Great Success) checkered fabric opened at 3,560 yuan per piece and later traded as high as 3,720 yuan.

### Spot Cotton Trading Slightly Weaker, Market Prices Rise by 1,000-2,000 Yuan

Yesterday, the New York cotton market was closed due to a holiday, and there were no telegrams. The spot cotton market in M埠 (Mu Port) remained robust, but trading was slightly weaker. High U.S. dollar and yarn prices made it difficult for factories to reach an agreement, resulting in no transactions. Only 600-700 bales were traded among industry participants. Market prices rose by another 1,000-2,000 yuan.

### Woolen Fabric Trading Scarce

Summer woolen fabrics were in short supply in the market, and prices remained high. Although Western clothing tailors and customers from various ports had demand, few actual transactions occurred due to high prices. Sales of spring fabrics were also low, as most sales to Japan had already taken place. Sales of black autumn and winter fabrics were even lower. The woolen fabric market was in a stalemate, with no major fluctuations.

### Coal Ball Retail Sales Slow, Firewood and Charcoal Also Stagnant

Since the resumption of production by various coal ball factories, production has increased rapidly. However, retail sales of coal balls have slowed down due to the prevalence of liquid fuels and the continued sale of cheap white coal dust. Although factories maintain their original prices, they secretly offer commissions to compete. Due to cost considerations, the supply of firewood and charcoal is limited, but sales are also affected by the aforementioned factors and are stagnant, with market prices fluctuating at a low level.

### Flour Trading Prohibited, Rice Prices Remain Firm, Inconvenient Inland Transportation Also a Reason for Price Increases

Since flour prices soared following rice prices last week, they have been rising sharply in recent days. In order to prevent speculation and stabilize people's livelihoods, the municipal authorities prohibited trading in flour yesterday. The municipal miscellaneous grains and oil cake market also excluded flour from its trading scope. Yesterday, a notice was issued to stop flour trading in the market.

The rice and grain purchased and transported by grain loan merchants have recently arrived in excess of 1,000 shi, with more arriving continuously. According to the person in charge of the department, among the fifteen companies that received loans to purchase grain (the other two companies that had been approved forfeited their rights and did not receive loans), two companies had each purchased more than 3,000 shi with the 60 million yuan loan they received and were transporting them to Shanghai. The department is urging the remaining companies to turn over the loans three times a month; otherwise, their loan qualifications will be revoked. It is reported that grain prices in the Wuhu area are lower, only over 20,000 yuan per shi, but due to the lack of transportation tools in the area, transportation is extremely difficult. Therefore, most grain merchants only purchase from production areas near Shanghai. It is hoped that transportation authorities can improve transportation to smooth Shanghai's grain supply.

Yesterday, both arrivals and sales in the rice market were slow, but inland prices were firm. Production areas were divided, and transportation was blocked, so buyers were firm. Japonica and indica rice rebounded by 500-1,000 yuan, and white glutinous rice also tightened, forming a fluctuating situation. Flour prices stabilized, and the oil market continued to sell cooking oil at stable prices, and public sentiment was generally calm. Cooking oil rebounded by a small amount of 500-1,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans were expensive and secondary quality soybeans were weak. The groundnut market was depressed, and prices fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Soybean cake also fell by 200-300 yuan, and road goods fell by 400-500 yuan. It is reported that relief agency foreign rice will soon arrive in Shanghai. According to the rice market, yesterday, the city received over 7,000 shi of seven types of rice, including white japonica. The types and quantities are as follows: white japonica 3,435 shi, thin rice 1,507 shi, sheep indica 200 shi, early rice 1,183 shi, Du rice 650 shi, white glutinous rice 226 shi, and glutinous rice 59 shi.

### Affordable Vegetable Oil for Sale Today

The China Vegetable Oil Factory, entrusted by the Enemy Property Administration, is selling a large amount of affordable vegetable oil, stipulating that it be sold to 200 Class A edible oil retailers in the city. The price is set at 164,500 yuan per barrel (net 350 catties). Payment can be made at the factory from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM today, and goods can be picked up on site. Sales will not be made after the deadline.

### Lumber Market Flat and Weak

Yesterday, the lumber market was flat and weak. Fir also fell slightly yesterday because many sellers were releasing old stock. There were new arrivals of foreign pine, and prices were also weak. Teak, because prices were seemingly low, saw some absorption.

### Good News for Real Estate: Reduced Deed Tax Rate, Abolished Income Tax on Sales

In order to avoid stagnation in real estate and a standstill in the construction industry, the government plans to abolish the real estate portion of the income tax on the sale of property and adjust the deed tax rate, changing the purchase, gift, and possession rate to 6%, the mortgage rate to 4%, and the exchange and division rate to 2%. The decision to pilot this was made at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 19th of this month.

### Caustic Soda Market Prices Rising

Sales of American caustic soda are increasing daily, and prices are trending upward. Market prices continued to rise, and many transactions took place yesterday. Other prices were stable. According to industry insiders, the American rubber, white wax, red sodium, and sodium sulfide shipped from the United States to Shanghai have been temporarily anchored outside Wusongkou due to the lack of piers in the Huangpu River. Talc and pottery clay prices have more than doubled compared to half a month ago due to brisk sales.

### Tea Prices in Free Fall

Selling pressure in the tea market remains high. Some cargo owners who need cash have continued to sell off their stock for days, but without relief. Actual sales are declining, and prices are falling across the board.

### 200,000 Bolts of Enemy and Puppet Cloth

80,000 Bolts Have Been Handed Over to Fangjian for Sale

Sun Boli is the director. It is reported that the office has cleared over 200,000 bolts of various types of cloth, of which over 80,000 bolts have been successively handed over to Fangjian Company for sale.

### Canadian Paper Production Cannot Be Increased Currently

### Eight Major American Film Companies Jointly Organize Export Association to Engage in Collective Trade Abroad

[Reuters Hollywood, 24th] Eight major American film companies have formed a "Film Merchants Export Association." It is said that because of various restrictions on films in certain countries, the association will represent the eight major companies as an agency for group operations abroad. These countries include the Soviet Union, Austria, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, the Netherlands, the Dutch East Indies, Germany, Japan, and South Korea. The Council will represent the eight major companies in collective trade, distribution, and receipt of business in these foreign countries.

### Abolish Concubinage

— Wang Chongjia

Concubinage is inherently inhumane and a remnant of the autocratic era. In autocratic times, officials and nobles were often unrestrained and kept many concubines as instruments for their lust. No matter how favored they were, their status was very low. Ordinary people followed suit, using the excuse of wanting a son to take concubines. If they encountered a shrewish wife, the concubine would suffer.

Since the Republic of China, the vestiges of autocracy have not been eliminated. In the legal regulations, a concubine cannot be considered a member of the family. Most civilized countries have a monogamous system, and those with multiple wives are mostly barbaric and uncivilized people. China, as a dignified ancient country, calls itself civilized, but the custom of keeping concubines has not been eliminated. Some inferior women only seek vanity and admire the glory of the wealthy, willing to sacrifice their purity and become concubines. Frivolous and promiscuous women regard being a "second wife" as the only way out, which is a great shame for the women's world.

Now, society is shouting for women's liberation everywhere. The women's world can take this opportunity to awaken suddenly. Women who are unwilling to be slaves and who admire petty vanity can turn back and reflect.

### Women's Success School

— Mi Weiliang

On Fifth Avenue in New York, USA, there is a very special women's school. The students here range in age from eighteen to sixty or older; their weight ranges from eighty-four pounds to two hundred and twenty-two pounds, and the duration of each semester is only six weeks.

The students in the school come from all states of the United States. Why do they come here from afar? It turns out that they have lost their jobs, lost their husbands, and lost the opportunities for happiness in their lives. This school is called the Duberry Success School. Initially, most of the students who just entered the school were unfashionable women. Later, when they were about to graduate, they all became very beautiful women. Originally ordinary girls, they later became beautiful young women; those with dull minds became full of vitality and energy. When they entered, they seemed to have no inspiration, but when you came out, you were a confident and successful woman.

After entering the school, each student must be examined by a doctor and then photographed. This photo must be kept for six weeks, and when she is photographed again, she often does not believe that the person in the photo is herself. After that, measure her height, weigh her weight, and describe the advantages and disadvantages of her posture.

If her body is too fat, in the first week, she will eat some "slimming" foods. At the beginning, she still needs to take some medications, take two tablespoons of mineral oil every day, one tablespoon each before two meals a day, and take two pounds of milk of magnesia, and drink two cups of boiled water every day. If you feel a headache, cold, or uncomfortable, you can take ten grains of baking soda in capsules, and drink a cup of plain boiled water every hour. If you feel that your weight cannot be fully reduced, then you must also take the same weight of baking soda. Of course, you cannot eat white oil and salt at any time, and you must follow a light laxative method for six weeks.

Their special weight loss diet is prescribed as follows: The first thing in the morning must be done one hour before breakfast, which is to drink three cups of cold boiled water, followed by fitness exercises. Breakfast includes two oranges (eaten with the peel) and black coffee. At eleven o'clock, eat two more oranges. At one o'clock in the afternoon, have lunch, which includes beef soup or vegetable clear soup, tomato slices, and two oranges. At three-thirty, drink tomato juice and two oranges. At six o'clock in the evening, have the most abundant meal of the day; it includes celery soup, well-cooked vegetable slices, foreign potatoes, and tail food.

After that, she can listen to a recording of her own voice. After six weeks, she will be able to hear her new and pleasant voice.

Their classrooms are very airy, and their fitness exercises are specially designed. In their classrooms, you can hear the female teacher shouting the steps and beats in the fitness exercises in an impartial voice. Health and beauty are actually inseparable. According to the authorities of the success school, not only must these obese women lose weight and become slender (or make thin women gain weight), but they must also be taught how to walk, pick up things, work, push, carry, pull, and various movements. Not only must every muscle be suitable for health, but it must also be beautiful and elegant, and at the same time maintain a good posture.

After that, another teacher will teach the students how to paint their nails, beautify their faces, and eliminate defects.

If students cannot lose a lot of weight (or gain weight), then Swiss massage, swimming, etc. are added.

Later, she goes to the beauty salon to have a makeover, redesign her hairstyle, have a haircut, repaint the color of her nails, and remove blemishes from her face and eliminate stains. Her face, hands, upper legs, and lower legs are harmonized in color with massage, ointments, and skin cleansing lotions.

The dance class in the school curriculum is to enable them to have a balanced posture when dancing, and have self-confidence, so that they can attend social occasions at any time. When the students graduate, they are able to dance the conga, rumba, foxtrot, waltz, samba, etc.

After that, several teachers discuss and decide together which clothes and which colors will make her the most beautiful and attractive when she wears them, and also consider the student's economic ability.

Six weeks later, at graduation, we can see that the students here have become a group of energetic, well-postured, beautiful, and attractive women.

In the school on the road, nothing is nominal or hypothetical. They all take things seriously, work hard, and hope to get a good result.

### Figure 1: Attitude and posture are extremely important for women. Students are learning how to walk, with an object on their heads to maintain balance while walking. Figure 2: The teacher uses a machine to determine what type of skin the student's is.

### I Become a Stepmother

— Lao Dai

The increase of age has caused me to go from a young age to nearly middle age. As the old saying goes, "When a man is grown, he should marry; when a woman is grown, she should be married." Because of the difficulties of life, I could no longer delay at home to choose my ideal husband. This is something I still feel pain about today! As I am nearing middle age, I won't hide the fact that young men will no longer want me, so of course, I can only become a replacement wife. Under mutually agreeable conditions, I had to endure the humiliation of becoming the hated stepmother. However, I am very willing, I want to let the children in society know that stepmothers are not all vicious and shrewish, I want to break the deeply ingrained ideas that people have inherited through the ages, I want to add a unique luster to the women's world!

My husband is a man nearing forty years old. He is in business and is honest and sincere, truly worthy of the local character. His late wife left behind two children, who are still young. It is said that they were the last born, and the previous ones all died of illness. The family's life is still considered comfortable. After I entered the house, I began to take on the work of a housewife. The late wife's children were often worried and unhappy, suffering immensely, and my heart was also very pained for them. They are orphaned children who lost their kind mother, and hearing neighbors talk about how fierce and abusive stepmothers are and all kinds of terrible stories, how could they not tremble in their little hearts? But in order to fulfill my ambition, I would not become the kind of terrible stepmother they imagined. I often comforted and encouraged them with words, and I cared for them very much, so that they would recognize that stepmothers are not as vicious and terrible as people say.

The days passed quickly, and a year had passed before I knew it, and my body had also changed. The protruding belly made me feel unusually annoyed and troubled when doing things. But I still took care of their food and clothing as usual. I don't know why they have suddenly become silent and unhappy recently, holding a kind of vigilance and doubt towards me. I feel exceptionally pained. I don't know where I have treated them wrongly, or perhaps there is another reason? I wish I could dig out my heart and show it to them. But the fact is that I cannot do this, I can only hope that the child will come out soon, perhaps there is still a way to remedy things.

The child was born with a cry, but they are still the same, which makes me feel very depressed. Soon, I learned about their sudden change from the servants. It turns out that the stepmother's son was born, and of course, the stepmother loves her own son. Before, it was because she had no children! We finally could not escape the stepmother's "harshness and abuse." Alas! How sad is this? They are so pitiful. All kinds of bad situations of stepmothers in society have left a deep impression in their little hearts.

Before I knew it, the child I raised was already two years old. The swift passage of time really makes people feel its preciousness! I still pay attention to taking care of their food and clothing. Every time I go out, I always bring them some fruits and toys. When it comes to holidays, I take them out for a stroll. My own son enjoys the same treatment as them, sometimes they even get more. Every time they come back from school, I always prepare snacks to encourage them and teach them how to make progress in their studies. If they make a mistake, I don't beat or scold them, I only guide and teach them with words. When they sleep at night, I tell them stories of loyalty and righteousness from the ancients. All of this makes them feel the warmth of the family, and that stepmothers are not necessarily as terrible and vicious as people say.

Soon after, the often worried and unhappy look was no longer seen on their faces, but instead, they were filled with happy and innocent smiles, and the children also became lively and lovely. They often tease the younger brother and laugh, being as close and harmonious as hands and feet. Every time I see the three children playing together, ah! My heart is truly excited and happy, I have finally fulfilled my ambition! I am a good stepmother!
