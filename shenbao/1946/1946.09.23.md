[Dispatch from Washington by United Press, 21st] Members of the House Military Committee, who recently returned from a tour of the Far East, stated today: The Soviet Union wants to control China and is trying to force the United States to abandon its role as a mediator in China. They believe that the Soviet Union secretly supports the Chinese Communist army and encourages Communist leaders to sabotage the ceasefire agreement and the tripartite joint adjudication military mediation department in Beiping. The committee members said: If Marshall's efforts to end the Chinese civil war fail, the differences between the US and the Soviet Union on the China issue may become extreme. Marshall is undertaking an extremely difficult task with limited resources, and the success or failure of his mission will be determined in the near future.

### Wang Bingnan Visits Special Envoy Marshall Yesterday; Submits Memorandum from the Chinese Communist Party; Requests the Opening of a Military Tripartite Meeting Again

[Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 22nd] A large part of the conclusions as to whether there will be progress in the future situation can be obtained today, because the Communist Party submitted a second memorandum to Special Envoy Marshall today, insisting on convening a military tripartite meeting, arguing that the war situation is serious, and has expressed a firm attitude. Two days ago, Special Envoy Marshall had submitted a mediation opinion to Wang Bingnan, the content of which was to convene an informal five-person group meeting to discuss the reorganization of the National Government Committee, and after achieving success, to discuss a ceasefire. This opinion was often consulted with Zhou Enlai by Wang Bingnan, and today he received instructions from Zhou and gave a reply to Special Envoy Marshall, which was to refuse to attend the five-person meeting. When Special Envoy Marshall met Wang Bingnan, he made some suggestions to Wang and said that he would seek the opinion of the government representatives. In today's conversation, Wang Bingnan mentioned the Communist Party's request to publish the entire record of the talks, and Special Envoy Marshall also said that he needed to discuss it with the government representatives before making a decision. This afternoon, reporters interviewed Wang Bingnan, and Wang said: This is the Communist Party's last request, and the situation has reached a critical juncture. The reporter asked if the government also maintained the same resolute attitude as the Communist Party and insisted on convening a five-person meeting, the situation would be unimaginable, and whether the Communist Party had any further measures. Wang replied that he had to wait for Zhou Enlai to express his views, because Wang had already conveyed the opinions expressed orally by Marshall today to Shanghai.

[Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper] The content of the first memorandum submitted by the Communist Party on the 17th was to appeal for a ceasefire and request a military tripartite meeting. The second memorandum was submitted on the 22nd, with largely the same content. Wang Bingnan submitted it to Special Envoy Marshall at 10:00 AM. After Marshall and Wang met for an hour, the former left and went to the US Embassy to orally inform Ambassador Stuart of the content of the memorandum. After Wang left, the ambassador discussed it with his personal consultant, Fu Jingbo, who then visited Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng at 12:30 PM, presumably to convey this opinion. Today, reporters repeatedly visited these gentlemen, but the doormen of their residences all said that they were "out." When we inquired by telephone at 12:00 PM, we were told that they were very busy today and were not at home, and were already asleep. The reporter speculates that all parties may have had some consultations or are looking for a proper way to save the crisis.

[Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 22nd] In addition to receiving Wang Bingnan in the morning, Ambassador Stuart went to church with Fu Jingbo at 5:00 PM and then Special Envoy Marshall visited the embassy, where they watched a movie in the guest room and enjoyed the holiday.

### Wu Dingchang and Lei Zhen's Conversations

[Dispatch from Nanjing by this newspaper, 22nd] During the stalled negotiation period, there have been rumors that the government proposed convening a comprehensive sub-committee meeting of the Political Consultative Conference. Liang Shuming, the secretary-general of the Democratic League, told reporters from this newspaper yesterday that Wu Dingchang and Lei Zhen from the government had made this statement to Zhang Junmai. However, based on observations from all parties, it is generally believed that there is no possibility of convening a comprehensive sub-committee meeting at present. On the morning of the 22nd, the reporter specially visited Wu Dingchang, the Secretary-General of the Civil Service, to ask for an explanation on this matter. According to Wu, he went to Shanghai on the 9th. On the morning of the 10th, at the airport to see off Chairman Zhang Qun, he met Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Junmai, and others. After Zhang Qun took off, he went to Wu Tiecheng's residence with Zhang Junmai for a brief sit-down, during which they generally discussed the current situation and expressed the hope that the five-person group meeting could be convened as soon as possible. He never mentioned the comprehensive sub-committee. Zhang then visited him on the 15th, but they did not meet because of other guests. He returned the visit on the 16th, and the discussion was still as described above. As for inviting him to Beijing, it was only a personal suggestion and did not represent the government. Wu expressed great surprise at all kinds of rumors. Subsequently, the reporter visited Lei Zhen, the Deputy Secretary-General, to ask for an explanation of his mission to Shanghai. Lei said: His visit to Shanghai was not solely to meet with representatives of the Democratic League, but also for other official duties. As for what was discussed with Zhang Junmai, it never involved the comprehensive sub-committee. He also told reporters that he planned to visit Liang Shuming on the 23rd to ask about some matters.

Because the war disaster in Jiangxi Province was severe and the New Life Movement still needed efforts, the Chairman told Chen Zhaoying and Wang Lingji that he would not attend any banquets or see any plays for the time being. After strolling around the command headquarters for a moment around 9:00 PM, he still wrote in his diary as usual and silently read a few pages of scripture before going to bed. In addition, Madame Chiang spoke with the Chairman by phone from Shanghai last night and wished each other good night. The Chairman rose at dawn today, lightly dressed, wearing a khaki wool Zhongshan suit. At 9:00 AM, Chen Rongying came to visit, and the Chairman changed into military uniform and drove to the Qingyun Martyrs' Cemetery at 9:45 AM, and inspected the Sixth Officers' Corps of the Central Training Corps. Aide-de-camp Shi Juemin and Secretary Cao Shengfen followed in another car. Wang Lingji, the Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and Chen Pei, the commander of the Sixth Officers' Corps, had been waiting in front of the tomb one hour earlier. After the Chairman arrived, he got out of the car and slowly walked up the tomb path, first bowing to the memorial tower, and silently paying respects for three minutes. Later, he saw the dilapidated archway and was saddened for a long time, often looking back at the people accompanying him and instructing them to repair it properly. The Chairman lingered at the Martyrs' Cemetery for a long time, and also went to the graves of the martyrs who died in the Northern Expedition and General Hu Zuyu, who died suppressing bandits, and Cheng Maoxing, the good grain official who died for grain, to silently pay respects for a moment.

After paying respects at the Martyrs' Cemetery, the Chairman then went to the flagpole in front of the first battalion of the Officers' Corps to inspect the more than 900 demobilized officers who were receiving short-term training in the corps and about to be transferred to other jobs. The Chairman examined the appearance, complexion, clothing, and even leggings of each officer in great detail. Seeing that the officers' clothing was neat and their spirits were strong, he repeatedly said "Good", "Good". After the inspection, the Chairman stepped into the classrooms and officers' dormitories on the upper floor of the battalion headquarters, as well as the kitchen, toilet, and vegetable garden outside the corps headquarters, inspecting them one by one, inquiring in great detail about the corps' food, nutrition, and miscellaneous affairs, and giving instructions. He then summoned the battalion commanders of the corps headquarters, including Chen Nanping and six others, to inquire about the affairs of each corps and give a brief speech, encouraging each battalion commander to lead by example and train the demobilized officers to be cadres for national construction in order to complete the great cause of national construction. After the Chairman's speech, he went to Qingyunpu, where he often visited and rested during the bandit suppression period, to inspect the headquarters of the Sixth Officers' Corps, rested in the office for a moment, and then inspected the Tang Gui and Bada Shanren's calligraphy and paintings and stone carvings in the courtyard. At 11:20 AM, he returned to the command headquarters to rest and read the Nanchang newspapers for the past two days, and was very pleased with the current achievements of the Jiangxi news industry. The Chairman inspected the Nanchang urban area today and went to the old site of the command headquarters on the bank of Baihuazhou to inspect the library that was destroyed by the Japanese army.

Nanchang was cloudy today, with occasional light rain and a cool climate. Shops and residents still hung lanterns and festoons in every household. In the bustling city, major stores hung extremely exquisite and antique palace lanterns, and the windows of large stores were brightly lit with electric lights. Farmers from all over the Chao Wan Palace heard that the head of state was coming and lingered on the streets, reluctant to return home. It is said that the Chairman did not bring luggage on this trip to the province, and the provincial government temporarily made quilts and mattresses, one each. The mattress makers were reportedly to supply the Chairman's use, worked happily, and firmly refused payment, which fully demonstrates the enthusiasm of the Jiangxi compatriots for loving and supporting the head of state.

[Dispatch from Nanchang by Central News Agency, 22nd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Wang Lingji and Chen Zhaoying, went to inspect National Chung Cheng University in Wangchenggang (about 20 li west of Nanchang City) at 4:00 PM on the 22nd. The Chairman gave great encouragement to the faculty, staff, and students, urging each department head and professor to work hard in teaching and cultivate talents so that they can take on the mission of building the country in the future. On the way back, he went to the Provincial Cadre Training Corps, inquiring about the training situation of the corps, and then went to the former residence in Beitan to look at the scenery of the Gan River. At that time, the Chairman's old neighbors were helping the old and carrying the young, waiting around the door. The Chairman smiled and nodded, frequently asking "How are you?" and stroking a child, asking if he had gone to school. He waved his hand and boarded the car in warm applause, returning to the command headquarters.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Feian Steamer Robbed En Route from Nanjing to Wuhu

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Feian steamer, which was traveling from Wuhu to Nanjing with 93 passengers, was robbed on the morning of the 21st. At 8:00 AM, the ship departed from Wuhu. At 11:00 AM, 18 passengers in military uniform boarded the ship in Hezhou. As the ship sailed to the Lishan section of the river, a strong wind and rainstorm occurred. The passengers in military uniform brandished weapons and robbed the passengers on board, taking jewelry and cash worth over 30 million yuan. One passenger was shot in the arm. The robbers forced the captain to sail towards Hezhou, fired shots into the air as a warning, and then disembarked and fled. The ship arrived at Xiaguan at 4:00 PM and reported the incident to the police. An investigation is underway.

### Arch-Traitor Zhou Fohai Interrogated; Detailed Account of "Peace Movement" Given

Future investigations will focus on the crimes committed by the traitors after the puppet regime was established.

### Debate Over Investigation in Hankou: Investigation Team Issues 10,000-Word Announcement; Accusations Against Personnel Accepting Opium and Tung Oil

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 21st] The Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Investigation Team issued a detailed announcement late last night regarding the investigation into the Wuhan District Secret Goods Materials Committee of Hubei Province's handling of opium and tung oil, and based on investigative findings, made accusations against the personnel involved. The main points are as follows: (1) Opium Reception: The Investigation Team believes that although the opium received by the Committee was publicly burned, significant problems still need to be investigated: (a) Only 123 boxes of opium were burned, 16 boxes short of the original reported quantity. (b) One box of opium had been opened, with about four pounds missing, and five boxes of opium were completely different from the other boxes, indicating obvious infiltration and replacement. (c) There is strong suspicion that Wang Yukun and other handlers embezzled opium. (2) Tung Oil Section: The team found that the original reported quantity was 326 barrels, of which all were clear water, and 37 barrels were mixed with clear water. This was clearly a planned replacement fraud, and since the water and oil were difficult to separate, all 320-plus barrels of tung oil could not be auctioned, effectively becoming waste, causing significant losses to the public. Lu Qitong, Wang Guanghua, Sun Dianfu, and other responsible custodians are difficult to absolve of responsibility. After the team published the investigation into the opium, the responsible parties responded publicly with a self-justifying statement. The team considered that there were attempts to cover up the facts in the self-justification, so it drafted a nearly 10,000-word announcement overnight, marking a major written battle in the midst of the investigation.

### Anti-Banditry Operations in Yangcheng Lake Area to Be Conducted in East and West Zones; Anti-Banditry Conference Opens in Suzhou Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 22nd] The Yangcheng Lake anti-banditry and security conference officially opened at 8:00 AM on the 22nd at the Paratrooper Headquarters in Suzhou. Attendees included Commander Ma Shigong, Deputy Commander Xu Baoguang, Paratrooper Chief of Staff Xu Yanrang, Chief of Staff Liu Chenjun, Deputy Chief Xu Ya Yin, First Section Chief Luo Guoying, Second Section Chief Liu Ke, Third Section Chief He Longting, Second District Security Deputy Commander Xia Boxun, Staff Officer Xu Liyuan, Wu County Magistrate Lu Jianhua, Military Section Chief Guo Binyan, Changshu County Magistrate Pan Yichen, Military Section Chief Chen Shijun, Kunshan County Magistrate Shen Xiafei, Military Section Chief Liu Yuhan, Taicang County Magistrate Zhang Ligang, Military Section Chief Jiang Yi, and Wuxi County Military Section Chief Tang, totaling nineteen people. Ma and Xu presided over the meeting. Both Ma and Xu delivered earnest speeches, stating that the government's launch of this large-scale anti-banditry operation would focus on politics, with military force only playing a supporting role. County military and political leaders should deeply understand this intention, properly promote appeasement work, and show leniency. After the speeches, discussions began. It was decided to further divide the Yangcheng Lake area into eastern and western zones. Kunshan and Taicang belong to the eastern zone, with Liu Zheng, commander of the Fourth Paratrooper Battalion stationed in Kunshan, appointed commander. Wu County and Changshu belong to the western zone, with Guo Zhichi, commander of the Third Paratrooper Battalion stationed in Yu, appointed commander. The county magistrates of the four counties will serve as deputy commanders. Liu Ke will be responsible for intelligence, He Longting for communications and logistics, and Luo Guoying for combat. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. Discussions resumed at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, resulting in the following resolutions: (1) Each county shall immediately begin to reorganize the township and baojia system. (2) The Wuxi-Shanghai Highway shall be quickly repaired. (3) Supplies for the troops shall be provided by the original commanding units and shall not be procured locally. Because the bases in northern Jiangsu has been recovered, it is feared that Communist troops will infiltrate the coastal areas south of Yangtze River, troops should be assigned to guard those areas. Other important anti-banditry plans were also decided. The meeting concluded at 6:00 PM. Commander Ma then hosted a dinner. The military and political leaders of the counties were scheduled to return to their posts on the 23rd.

[Another Telegram] The Anti-Banditry Headquarters in the Taihu Lake area has ordered Yang Yanbin to proceed to Suzhou to assume responsibility for recruiting and pacifying scattered bandits in Taihu Lake in Mucheng Township.

### Sixth Annual Conference of the Political Examination Society Opens Grandly in Nanjing Yesterday; Presidential Message Read; Closed on the Same Day

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The sixth annual conference of the Political Examination Society opened grandly in Nanjing at 9:30 AM on the 22nd. Over 300 members attended, as well as ministers and officials from various ministries, including President Dai Chuanxian of the Examination Yuan, Vice President Zhou Zhongyue, Minister of Civil Service Jia Jingde, Minister of Organization Chen Lifu, and Minister of Education Hang Liwu. President Chen Manruo presided over the ceremony and delivered an opening speech, followed by the reading of President Chiang's message. President Dai then delivered a speech, stating that the essence of national construction is to implement the Three Principles of the People with the Five-Power Constitution, integrating the best laws and systems from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, to build China. The purpose of the examination system is to supplement the shortcomings of the modern electoral system. China has always been a country ruled by law with a personnel system at its center. If we can adopt the strengths of modern countries ruled by law and integrate them with our ancient excellent systems, it will not be difficult to build a modern country ruled by law. However, institution building is not an easy task, and it is difficult to expect it to be accomplished overnight. He recalled that when he was selected to head the Examination Yuan in 1928, he felt that it would take 30 years to complete its work. He hopes that all members will carefully study this system. Minister Chen Lifu then delivered a speech, elaborating on the connection between examination and education and administration, and how to coordinate examination and election. Finally, Vice Minister Hang Liwu and others delivered speeches. The opening ceremony concluded at 12:00 PM. At 1:30 PM, the general assembly resumed, with a moment of silence for members who died in the war. This was followed by the reading of academic papers, most of which were on the study of examination institutions and personnel systems, totaling 68 papers. The report on association affairs and discussion of proposals followed. The most notable proposals were those on establishing a civil service protection system and improving civil service salaries. Finally, the entire assembly stood in solemnity and unanimously resolved to send a telegram of respect to President Chiang and President Dai. The conference closed at 6:00 PM.

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 22nd] The message issued by the President of the annual conference of the Chinese Political Examination Society is as follows: "The examination system was clearly defined by the Founding Father in the Outline of National Construction and is one of the five governing powers of the National Government. Since the implementation of various examinations, numerous talented individuals have been selected. All qualified personnel have served in central and local positions and have been able to contribute to their duties. During the War of Resistance, they especially relied on sharing hardships and exerting their effectiveness, which is no less meritorious than fighting on the battlefield. Now that the war has been over for more than a year, and the work of national construction is underway, political reform is even more urgent. Members of the association are distributed throughout the country and are the backbone personnel of various departments. They should understand the current needs, express their loyalty, sharpen their talents and wisdom, and work together to bring the country to a unified and prosperous state. With the National Assembly convening soon, shifting power to the people and entering the justice of civil rights politics, how should we thoroughly implement the examination function and improve the personnel system so that national administration is not affected by political competition, but can seek continuous progress in stability? Members should carefully study this and offer good suggestions. They must not fail the original intention of the Founding Father in establishing this system, nor the expectations of the government in selecting talents through various terms. Let us encourage each other."

### American Airmen Lost on the Burmese Border Forced into Slavery by the Lolos; U.S. Embassy Receives Report and Requests Rescue from the U.S. Military Authorities

[United Press Nanjing, 21st] It has been learned that several American B-29 pilots were forced to land near the northern border of Burma two years ago and are now serving as slaves under savage natives. At least three Americans have recently been discovered in the Lolo tribes of western Sichuan, forced to tend livestock, collect wood, and perform other tasks, with poor treatment. The tribe is located west of Xichang, near Burma, the Indian province of Assam, and Tibet. The area is surrounded by mountains, making it inaccessible to Chinese officials. It is rumored that only a few missionaries are scattered in the area. Many American airmen believe that in 1944, when American B-29 bombers were flying from India to China, several aircraft went missing en route. The crew members parachuted to safety and disappeared. However, the U.S. military mortuary registry has never accounted for these missing persons. [Another Telegram] Ambassador Stuart today confirmed the United Press report, stating that the U.S. Embassy has received a report that American airmen who landed in the remote mountainous areas of western China more than two years ago are still alive and are being forced into slavery by the semi-savage Lolo tribes. One of the most reliable sources is Dr. Gralan, of the Chengdu United University. Dr. Gralan is a researcher of primitive peoples in the remote areas of the Tibetan border and has a great reputation. The American airmen are believed to be crew members of downed B-29s, possibly sold to the Lolo tribes as slaves by opium traffickers. These drug traffickers have considerable influence in the tribal areas. The U.S. Embassy has forwarded the report to the U.S. military authorities for rescue efforts.

### Editorial: Sino-British Naval Cooperation

Sir Philip Vian, Commander-in-Chief of the British Pacific Fleet, recently arrived at the Nanjing docks aboard the cruiser HMS Belfast for an official visit to our government. He promptly held a cocktail reception on his flagship, entertaining our government officials, and a pleasant time was had by all. The next day, our Minister of National Defense, Bai Chongxi, reciprocated with a banquet. It is also reported that during Sir Vian's stay in Nanjing, our naval and government authorities will discuss the establishment of our new navy with him. This is undoubtedly a sign of amicable relations between China and Britain. We would like to take this opportunity to express our views on the establishment of our new navy and Sino-British cooperation in this area.

Without a navy, there is no national defense. This is the painful lesson we learned during the recent war. Therefore, in the future construction of our national defense, we must not ignore the role of the navy. We have a history of training and managing the establishment of a navy for sixty or seventy years. Before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, we were once a power in East Asia. However, due to political corruption and incompetent leadership, we clung to the old ways and fell behind. After this painful experience, we are finally embarking on a new path to rebuild our navy. The establishment of the Ministry of National Defense has corrected the bad habit of the army and navy operating as separate systems, which has created a new opportunity for the Chinese navy. The newly appointed Vice Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Lieutenant General Gui Yongqing, although originally from the army, is familiar with the international situation and will certainly be able to establish our new navy under the supervision of Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng.

Those who understand warfare and modern warfare will not deny the effectiveness of the navy in national defense, even in the age of atomic energy. The navy will not be eliminated by the use of atomic energy, but will instead increase its effectiveness. The main military forces of Japan and Germany were defeated by naval power. Because our navy is backward, and our coastline is so long, we should pay special attention to naval construction in our national defense construction. In the construction of our new navy, we especially need Sino-British cooperation. Everyone knows that Britain is an advanced country in modern naval warfare. China initially devoted itself to naval construction and received British assistance at that time. Now that we are rebuilding our navy, we still need the assistance of our old friend. This is, of course, a matter of great shame for us.

Although Britain is called an old empire, it has made many contributions to modern warfare. During World War I, the British invention of the tank defeated Germany, transforming modern warfare from trench warfare back to mobile warfare, completely changing the pattern of modern warfare. In World War II, the initial British use of radar caused Goering's air force to suffer a crushing defeat. In addition, the British invention of penicillin, although not directly related to the war, was also a very important factor in victory. "Although Zhou was an old state, its mandate was new." Ancient Britain can be proud of this. Speaking of the navy, some British naval equipment may not be as good as others, but the British navy has a glorious tradition and excellent training, all of which our new navy should learn from. It is believed that Sir Philip Vian's visit to China will strengthen Sino-British cooperation, especially in the naval field.

### Propaganda for the Withdrawal of U.S. Troops from China

Several American people's organizations, such as the New York Committee for Peace and the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy, have jointly launched a "U.S. Troops Out of China Week." Thirty-five major cities across the country have already begun this propaganda campaign yesterday, which will last until the 28th. Such movements are common in democratic and free America and should not be overemphasized. However, this movement involves Chinese politics, and especially because we do not want misunderstandings and estrangement between the people of China and the United States, we must say a word to these small group of American friends.

The current situation in China is indeed very critical. China was at the forefront of the fight against aggression, persevering for eight years, and finally achieved victory. However, the Chinese Communist Party took advantage of the post-war situation, when order had not yet been restored, to raise troops and create chaos, expand its territory, and attempt to seize power by force, plunging China back into war. In order to complete the task of ending the war and creating peace, the U.S. government decided to temporarily keep U.S. troops in China to assist China in repatriating enemy nationals and prisoners of war, and to promote China's peaceful unification. For the past year, the U.S. government has been pursuing its policy towards China based on this principle, and there has been no change. Recently, a small number of Americans, on the one hand, saw the increasing expansion of the civil war in China, and on the other hand, were deceived by the CCP's propaganda offensive, and successively asked the U.S. military and political authorities to withdraw U.S. troops from China. However, the responsible U.S. authorities remain as firm as ever. For example, Admiral Kirk, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, said in Beiping on the 9th of this month that the only mission of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in China is to assist China in repatriating enemy nationals and prisoners of war and to establish a peaceful order in China. Once this task is completed, they can withdraw from China and return home. At the same time, Russell, Director of Liaison of the U.S. State Department, replied to the American Peace Committee on the 15th of this month: "The U.S. government has decided that once China's peace is restored and a strong, unified, and democratic China is realized, the U.S. military will withdraw completely and freely. President Truman issued a statement on China policy in December last year, stating that the United States would adopt a non-interference policy towards China. This policy has not changed." The U.S. government's attitude is clear and straightforward, and there is no reason to doubt it.

American public opinion on the China issue can be clearly divided into two factions: one faction believes that the United States has a major responsibility for world peace, and an even greater responsibility for the creation of peace in the Far East, especially for China, and should fulfill its promises made during the war. The American China Policy Association led by Powell, publisher of the "China Weekly Review," can be considered a representative of this faction. The association sent a letter to President Truman on the 8th of this month, requesting that the U.S. government immediately insist that the Soviet Union abandon its political control over all Chinese territories, stating that "The Chinese Communist Party is controlled by Moscow and has no intention of reaching an agreement with Chairman Chiang. They only want to use peace talks to delay time so that they can take the opportunity to consolidate their territory, obtain military equipment from the Soviet Union, train troops in the Northeast, some of whom are Japanese, Koreans, and puppet troops, and try to alienate American sympathy and assistance to Chairman Chiang." The other faction believes that the situation of war in China has become inevitable and cannot be reversed by human effort. For the sake of its own interests, the United States should avoid getting involved in the vortex, so it demands the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. This faction can be represented by Senators Eiland and Butler, who have repeatedly issued statements demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. The Boston Post also commented that "U.S. troops should not remain in China after the Japanese troops have been driven out of China. This action not only puts a huge financial burden on us, but also has the risk of getting involved in the vortex of China's civil war." The arguments of this faction are no different from those of the isolationists before the U.S. entered the war, and cannot win the support of the majority of the people.

Although the American people have two different views on the U.S. military's stay in China, they are completely united in their desire for China to achieve peace as soon as possible. Therefore, we must ask: Is the fundamental reason for the endless war in China the U.S. military's stay in China? Once the U.S. military withdraws, can the war in China be stopped immediately? If the answer is positive, then we also agree and will demand that the U.S. military withdraw from China immediately. However, in reality, at this time, the U.S. military's stay in China still has the task of assisting China in repatriating enemy nationals and prisoners of war and restoring peace and order. For the sake of China's peace, and also for the sake of world peace, the United States should implement its established policy towards China. But why is it that a small number of people in the United States do not understand the truth about the Far East and advocate the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China? This must be said to be the result of the CCP's anti-American movement. Because the current U.S. policy towards China recognizes the National Government as the only legitimate government and hopes that China can become a strong, unified, and democratic country, the CCP spares no effort to undermine it, even creating unexpected incidents in an attempt to scare away the United States. Those who understand the truth about China, of course, see very clearly the tricks played by the CCP. But there are still some who are intimidated by the CCP's threats and adopt the style of the past isolationists, taking a passive attitude and advocating the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. Little do they know that this is exactly what the CCP wants.

In short, we believe that China does need peace and hope that the United States will assist China in achieving peace, at least to prevent the war created by the CCP from expanding further in China. As for the American friends who advocate the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, because their intention is also to hope for peace in China, regardless of their arguments, we still have the obligation to make them truly understand the political situation in China. Otherwise, their erroneous actions will only further strengthen the CCP's anti-American propaganda offensive, which will not only be detrimental to China's peace, but also harmful to the United States.

### Four Foreign Ministers Gather in Paris, Conference to Reopen, Various Difficult Problems to Be Resolved

[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, 22nd Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin returned to Paris from London on Saturday night. The four major foreign ministers will meet again. Moreover, convening a four-power foreign ministers' meeting is the only way to break the deadlock in the Trieste issue sub-committee.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st] The British chief delegate to the Peace Conference, Foreign Secretary Bevin, returned to London half a month ago to attend the round table conference on the Palestine issue. During this period, the four major foreign ministers showed little concern for the progress of the Paris Peace Conference. Even Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has not appeared for several days, and the Peace Conference has fallen into a standstill. Foreign Secretary Bevin has now returned to Paris for a short stay. Whether the four foreign ministers will meet again has not been officially announced. But judging from the current situation, it seems quite possible. At the last meeting of the four foreign ministers, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes was represented by Dunn, and Bevin was also represented by Navy Minister Alexander, so it was not possible to effectively discuss various issues. If the four foreign ministers can hold a plenary meeting this time, it will be of great benefit to the resolution of various difficult problems.

[Reuters, London, 21st] British Foreign Secretary Bevin's plan to go to Paris this weekend was kept secret for security reasons. For the past two weeks, personal protection for Bevin has been extremely tight, as it is not appropriate to allow Jewish extremists to engage in intimidation during the Palestine Conference.

### Disagreement Between Two Groups at the Committee on the Romanian Treaty, All Committees Can Complete Work in Three Weeks

[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, 22nd Broadcast: In today's Paris Peace Conference, the British and American groups again clashed seriously with the Soviet group. The Economic Committee discussed the draft treaty with Romania. The two sides had widely divergent opinions. The British and American sides insisted that Romania should compensate for the losses caused to the Allies in full; however, the Soviet Union believed that one-third of the compensation was sufficient, so an agreement could not be reached.

[Reuters, Paris, 21st] Among the special measures decided after it was decided that each committee of the Peace Conference must complete its work before October 17, one was that meetings should be held for 12 hours a day, but the Trieste sub-committee decided to limit meetings to five hours a day.

### Reviewing the Treaty with Italy, Various Clauses Passed

[Reuters, Paris, 21st] The Italian Political and Territorial Committee today passed a proposal jointly submitted by Belgium and the Netherlands, deciding to include in the Italian Treaty the recently concluded Italian-Austrian agreement on guaranteeing the German-speaking residents in South Tyrol have the same rights as Italians. During the discussion, the Slavic group disagreed with the proposal. The Belarusian representative, Kislev, believed that the Italian-Austrian agreement was a domestic affair between the two countries and did not need to be recognized by the Paris Peace Conference. As a result, it was still passed by a vote of thirteen to six. Then, Article 10 of the draft Italian Treaty, concerning the Italian-Austrian guarantee of passenger and freight transportation between North Tyrol and East Tyrol, was passed without difficulty. Article 11 stipulates that Italy cede the islands off the southern coast. The Southern representative, Bebler, requested a clearer provision. The French representative suggested that the matter be referred to a sub-committee for discussion. As a result, the article was also adopted. Then, Article 12, on Italy ceding the Dodecanese Islands to Greece, was discussed. The Greek representative, Politis, argued that the names of the islands should be listed and that it should be explicitly stipulated that the small islands belonging to the group should also be ceded. This was unanimously passed.

### U.S. Maritime Workers' Strike Completely Resolved

[United Press, New York, 22nd] The strike by U.S. West Coast maritime workers has been going on for 16 days. Today, it was decided to resume work, and the maritime workers' strike seems to have come to an end. After the Atlantic maritime workers resumed work, the Pacific maritime workers continued to insist on their demands. Unless the maritime workers and pilots were "satisfied," they would not resume work, which hindered the resolution of the strike. The union members then sent a letter stating that they agreed to return to work. After the Congress of Industrial Organizations announced on Monday that its members would return to their original ships, maritime workers who had not joined the union resumed work one after another.

[Reuters, New York, 21st] Workers of the Western Union Telegraph Company, belonging to the American Federation of Labor, voted to strike after wage negotiations with management broke down. The company controls all U.S. national telegraph lines, but the company's workers in New York belong to the Congress of Industrial Organizations and are not members of the Federation of Labor, so they may not be immediately affected.

### Burmese Civil Servants Slow Down Work, Former Prime Minister U Saw Assassinated

[Reuters, Yangon, 21st] Burmese government employees, as well as employees of railways, post offices, telegraph offices, and other bureaus, previously asked the government to increase cost-of-living allowances. As of 5:00 p.m. this evening, they had not received a reply and had decided to implement a general strike starting on Monday. City government employees will strike for one day on Sunday in a show of sympathy.

### Rebellious Tribes in Iran Engage in Armed Separatism, Government Troops Dispatched to Encircle and Suppress, Capital of Fars Province in Persian Gulf Resisting Tenaciously

[United Press, Tehran, 21st] Government troops, led by tanks and aircraft, advanced on Shiraz today and surrounded the rebellious tribes, who are defending their capital of Fars Province on the Persian Gulf. At the same time, in Kangun County, another part of Iran, the situation is extremely tense. The government troops are not allowed to enter, as the area was transferred to the Tehran authorities by the Azerbaijan government.

[Reuters, Tehran, 21st] Hundreds of members of the Qashqai tribe, riding horses and carrying weapons, invaded the cities of Kazerun and Qir and disarmed the military police before fleeing towards Shiraz. Shiraz is a large city with a population of 129,000 and a strong military force, so it is unlikely to be occupied by them. However, rumors are rife here, and the cabinet has convened an emergency meeting. At the same time, the Iranian army has dispatched several motorized units and five aircraft to Shiraz to increase its defense.

### Fifty Years of Blood Debt, Japanese Exploitation of Taiwanese Assets, Numbers Shocking and Difficult to Estimate

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] The truth about Japan's exploitation of Taiwan for 50 years has now been preliminarily explained with numbers. The total value of Japanese public and private assets received by our country in Taiwan is 3,139,500,000 yen, while the total amount of debt owed by the Japanese in Taiwan is 4,400,800,000 yen. After offsetting the assets and liabilities, there is still a debt of 1,268,500,000 yen. However, this number is still only a small part of the total amount of Japan's exploitation of Taiwan. During the past half century, Japanese imperialists invaded Taiwan and implemented a colonial policy. The total amount of exploitation, if all the numbers could be obtained, would be extremely shocking. It is currently impossible to obtain this accurate number, and it is expected that the day when this shocking historical number can be obtained will never come.

### The Rift Between the Soviet Union and Western Countries is Obvious, the European Federation is Difficult to Achieve, British and French Celebrities Propose Concrete Plans

[Associated Press, New York, 21st] After former British Prime Minister Churchill recently gave a speech in Zurich advocating the organization of a "United States of Europe," the Soviet side made a strong statement, saying that Churchill was carrying out a Western group movement to confront the Soviet Union. Churchill's speech can echo Bernas's speech in Stuttgart, with the aim of invigorating the Germans and allowing them a place in the sunshine of Western democracy. Yers explicitly demanded that the small European countries break away from the Soviet Union and set their own direction according to his proposed Franco-German partnership plan. This plan is a provocation even to extreme Churchillists. Can you imagine Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia breaking away from the Soviet sphere of influence and helping France, Germany, Franco's Spain, and other countries form what could be the most powerful country in the world near the Soviet border? Thinking of this, one immediately feels a bleak outlook. The "United States of Europe" has been the goal of some of the world's best idealists, especially after the First World War. The late French Prime Minister Briand was one of the main proponents, and what was accepted by the League of Nations was planned to form an autonomous federation, with a federal parliament in charge of its affairs, resolving some internal relations issues, and establishing a joint army for defense, just like the early plan of the American federal government. Later, although some argued that a unified Europe should extend from the Ural Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean, it is generally believed that it should be limited to the rugged area west of the Baltic Sea, up to the mouth of the Danube River at most. The first step should be to establish free trade between the states. The Soviet Union's state monopoly on foreign trade system is not applicable to the new federation. However, today's Europe is no longer comparable to the Europe before World War II. The rift between the Soviet Union and Western countries is obvious, which is Churchill's so-called Iron Curtain, so the federal system will ultimately be difficult to achieve.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] Regarding a concrete plan for organizing the United States of Europe, the International Research Institute for European Issues has recently issued a declaration, signed by British Lord Beveridge, Sir Fleming, and French Héliot Curie, among others. The declaration stated: "The United Nations cannot alone prevent another war from happening, nor can it stop wars in its current form. The Security Council is powerless. According to experience, only a new world can be created. The current world must recognize that it is almost impossible to organize a world federation, and it is also impossible to form several groups to wait for future unification. Since Churchill has proposed the United States of Europe, we should put forward some concrete measures to eliminate all obstacles in the way of creating peace. At the same time, another proposal is to establish an international relations committee in each national parliament for mutual consultation, and then form a common international parliament, in which the Soviet Union can also participate at any time. However, in Germany, it must be proved that it has peaceful intentions before it can join. Therefore, all areas under the control of the United Nations, such as the Trieste region and the Ruhr region, can be well developed."

### Wallace's Campaign Speech Qualifications Denied by the Democratic Party, the Republican Party Takes the Opportunity to Seek Control of Congress

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] The Democratic National Committee stated today that it denies that former Secretary of Commerce Wallace and Senator Pepper are authorized speakers for the party in the upcoming congressional election campaign. Although the two can speak freely, they are no longer under the formal direction of the party. The Republican Party is prepared to take advantage of the internal divisions within the government to achieve political gains and welcomes this greatly. At the same time, Democrats who have always opposed Wallace's anti-New Deal policies also express their welcome. Senator Hickenlooper predicts that the split between Truman and Wallace will allow the Republican Party to control Congress.

### Allied Control Council Discusses the Issue of Nationalization of Japanese Coal Mines, Lack of Resources and Low Production are the Current Crisis

[Report from this newspaper, Tokyo Correspondent, 21st] The basic policies of the Allied Powers toward Japan are mostly decided by the Far Eastern Commission composed of eleven countries in Washington and implemented by MacArthur Headquarters. In addition, there is an Allied Control Council for Japan, which is close to advisory in nature, and is composed of representatives from China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Since April of this year, the council has discussed the issue of expanding Japan's fishing grounds and the issue of agricultural land reform. The central issue in the past two weeks has been the Japanese

Nationalization of Coal Mines

In the previous meeting (4th), the Chinese representative, General Zhu Shiming, advocated that coal mines should be nationalized and expressed his willingness to exchange China's high-grade coking coal for Japan's low-grade coal. At the meeting on the 18th, Representative Zhu raised the case again, saying that China is willing to host the MacArthur Headquarters' plan to revive the Japanese economy. The impact of our country's proposal on the revitalization of the Japanese economy is undoubtedly significant. Because coal is the foundation of various industries and is necessary for various power sources, but the quality of coal produced in Japan is extremely poor, with a high ash content, loose and brittle, and not suitable for the metallurgical industry. Before the war, the coal required by the Japanese metallurgical industry was mostly imported from Northeast China, North China, and Vietnam. Recently, the situation of coal mine production in Japan can be said to be in a slump. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, the average monthly coal production in 1941 was 4.6 million tons, and the number of miners employed that year was 334,000. By July 15 of this year, although the number of miners had not decreased, the monthly coal production gradually decreased. In 1941, the average monthly coal production per person was 13.5 tons, in April of this year it was 5.3 tons, and in June and July it was only 5 tons. At present, the minimum amount of coal required by Japanese industry is 2 million tons per month. The reason for the sluggish coal mine production lies in

Insufficient Resources

In addition, the lack of food is naturally a major factor, because the work in the mines is based on a kind of heavy labor. The second reason is that the price of coal is too low. The current coal price adopts a dual system, with a producer price and a consumer price. The producer price is subsidized by the government to cover the cost, but the government's subsidy cannot keep up with the rise in prices, so it is impossible to stimulate the increase in production. At present, the government's subsidy is 260 yuan per ton, while the production cost is 368 yuan. There is a lack of materials such as steel bars, explosives, iron, platinum, cement, textile products, and oils. The most fundamental reason is the problem of abandoned mines. The old mines have been over-mined during the war, and most of the buried coal has been mined out, and most of the equipment has been damaged. For example, for the Joban Coal Mine, 80 tons of water must be drained for every ton of coal produced. If new mines are not developed, the increase in Japanese coal production will be limited. Our country's representative's proposal has a great relationship with Japanese industry. Since the issue of nationalization of coal mines was raised in the Allied Control Council, the government and

Owners' Reactions

have not been very good. Minister of Commerce Hoshijima stated in the Materials Supply Adjustment Bill Committee of the House of Representatives on the 9th that the most important thing today is to increase production, but implementing nationalization would hinder production, so he would not consider it, and the mine owners, for their own benefit, naturally do not agree with the nationalization of coal mines. The owners advocate (1) that the allocation of food should be guaranteed. (2) Abolish the subsidy system and determine the selling price based on the production cost. (3) Priority should be given to the allocation of various materials. Various political parties are also paying close attention to this issue. The Liberal, Progressive, and Socialist parties advocate the establishment of a three-party review committee to study whether coal mines should be nationalized. The Socialist Party does not advocate immediate nationalization, but the implementation of socialized national management. The proposals of the Liberal and Progressive parties are: (1) Abolish the subsidy system and allocate materials such as wood and machinery in kind. (2) Restore the coal allocation method of 1943, that is, the Japan Coal Industry Company will purchase coal from each mine and sell it to the owners, who will sell it according to the government allocation plan, in order to increase the production awareness of each owner and strengthen their sense of responsibility. (3) Subsidize industries such as iron and steel, electricity, gas, railways, and fertilizers. Regarding coal mine

Management Methods

the opinions can be said to be endless, and the final decision will be made by General MacArthur, but according to the reporter's personal opinion, changes in management methods may not necessarily promote the increase in production, and the problem should be grasped from the current economic situation in Japan. The current economic situation in Japan can be said to have not yet reached a healthy state. The post-war malignant inflation and the confusion of the price system, and the fact that various materials have been overused during the war and are mostly dilapidated, all make the production of various industries stagnate. From the perspective of coal production, without the input of foreign materials, it is difficult for Japanese industry to recover to a healthy state. According to Japanese economist Yoshitaro Nishimura, the existing capital equipment is old and outdated and mostly old-fashioned. Not only was it not repaired during the war, but it was mostly used forcibly. Not to mention expanding production, it is difficult to maintain existing production. Therefore, the biggest problem at present is the material replenishment problem. Under the current production conditions, even if nationalization is implemented, coal production will only be bureaucratic nationalization, which will not be of any practical benefit. How can a vast wasteland where capital equipment is decayed be revived?

### Guard Against Attacks from the Arctic, the US Air Force Writes a Warning

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 22nd Broadcast: The US Army Air Force issued a serious warning to the American public in an official publication today, saying that enemy countries can attack the United States from Eurasia via a new Arctic route. The publication also analyzed: Most countries that participated in the war or have the industrial potential to carry out a war are located above 30 degrees north latitude. Aircraft flying over the Arctic can increase their speed. For example, the distance between Berlin and Chicago can save 500 miles if the new Arctic route is followed.

### Report on the Work of the Investigation Team: Director Zhang Speaks with Earnestness; Deep Dissatisfaction with the Reception and Handling Work; The Investigation Team Upholds Impartiality and Does Not Seek Undeserved Praise; Speaker Pan Offers Several Suggestions

The Shanghai-Hangzhou Group of the Investigation Team for the Reception and Handling of Enemy and Puppet Assets in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region, nearing the end of its work, held a tea party yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in Room 218 on the second floor of the Bank of China, inviting people from all walks of life to report on the significance and process of the team's investigation work. Those present included Team Director Zhang Zhiben, members Cheng Zhonghang and Fan Zhengbo, as well as City Council representatives Zhao Junhao, Ma Junshuo, He Yuanming, and Wang Jian'e, Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Council Pan Gongzhan and Xu Jiying, Standing Director of the Chamber of Commerce Jin Runxiang, Chairman of the China Industrial Association Wu Yun Chu, and more than sixty news reporters from various newspapers. First, Director Zhang Zhiben reported: "This investigation team, jointly formed by the Central Supervisory Committee, the National Political Council, and the Control Yuan, with very limited manpower and the shortest possible deadline, is charged with understanding the truth of the reception work. What do we rely on and why are we not afraid? It is because we all believe that local public opinion organs, mass organizations, and news reporters will be able to tell us as much as possible about what they have seen and heard over the past year, along with their feelings. In this way, the small number of people will in effect increase to two million, and the short time will increase to more than a year. For example, since our team arrived in Shanghai, we have received sincere cooperation from all sectors of society, which has strengthened our work and yielded significant results. On the other hand, improper reception and handling of enemy and puppet assets, as well as corruption by reception personnel, should originally be corrected or punished by normal agencies. For example, the concealment and appropriation of received assets fall within the scope of criminal law, property disputes fall within the scope of civil law, and improper or illegal administrative actions should be handled in accordance with the procedures of the Administrative Appeal Law and the Administrative Litigation Law. Other issues such as corruption and malfeasance by reception personnel can also be reported to the supervisory authorities. Our team is a temporary organization, and our work is limited to investigation. Once the investigation is completed, everything should be handed over to the competent authorities for legal processing. It is unfortunate that the country has temporary organizations, which are a last resort. We deeply hope that normal agencies can fully exercise their powers in accordance with national law, follow normal procedures, and respect the rule of law, which is the blessing of the nation.

Not Insulting the Widowed and Weak, Not Fearing the Powerful and Arrogant: Conducting Work with Fairness and Integrity

Since the team began working in Shanghai, it has received 525 documents, including 355 confidential reports, which have been classified and consolidated into 293 cases. As of the 20th of this month, the team has completed 208 cases, while 85 cases are still pending response from various agencies or are still under investigation. In addition, 85 units of Shanghai's reception agencies have submitted reports, with 4 units yet to submit them. Their superior agencies have been instructed to submit them as soon as possible. In addition to the members, the team's staff responsible for receiving, drafting, copying, and editing official documents consists of only nine people, who are all seconded from various agencies and are limited by regulations. Despite the hot weather, they still have to work all day, and their diligence is commendable.

The team members are determined to uphold the spirit of "not insulting the widowed and weak, not fearing the powerful and arrogant," and to conduct fair and upright investigations. Whether it is a confidential report from the public or a case submitted by various agencies, the team must understand the truth of the facts and seek conclusive evidence. If the evidence is conclusive, it will be immediately exposed. However, we are unwilling to make arbitrary decisions or sacrifice the reputation of others to gain a reputation for "severity." The object of the "investigation" is the work of reception and handling, with more emphasis on matters and less on people. Therefore, it is different from "investigation and prosecution." However, those who are affected by matters should be subject to legal sanctions, regardless of their identity. The team members are "cautious and careful" on the one hand, and "willing to work hard and endure complaints" on the other, which we dare to assure ourselves of. As the wise men say, "If the punishment is not appropriate, the people will not know what to do." They also say, "If right and wrong are not clear and morality is not emphasized, the world will be in chaos." For example, public officials who are corrupt should be severely punished by national law. However, the majority of public officials are now living a frugal life, and some are even unable to make ends meet. Yet, public opinion generally assumes that all public officials are corrupt, causing law-abiding public officials to consider retiring to preserve their integrity, while a few truly corrupt individuals remain at large, doing whatever they please. Similarly, during the Anti-Japanese War, most of the compatriots in the occupied areas were patriotic. However, because a few unfilial elements engaged in traitorous acts, public opinion generally assumed that all people in the occupied areas were traitors, causing most of the compatriots who were kidnapped and suffered great pain to be unjustly accused, while the true accomplices could disappear and conceal their crimes. Therefore, we believe that clarifying right and wrong is something that everyone should pay attention to.

Three Thoughts

During its time in Shanghai, the team has gathered a wide range of opinions and observed public sentiment. Summarizing these, we have come to the following conclusions: (1) The government's policy on reception and handling seems to be inappropriate. During the War of Resistance, industry and commerce were destroyed, and the people were impoverished. The government should have made the most of the received enemy and puppet assets to support the revival of industry and commerce and alleviate the suffering of the people. It does not seem appropriate to use these received assets to balance the government's fiscal revenue and expenditure. (2) Reception agencies are disorganized and scattered. There are as many as 89 reception agencies in Shanghai, each acting on its own, lacking coordination, unclear responsibilities, and conflicting with each other. This leads to an image of harassment and chaos. (3) The reception and handling work is too slow. Since the reception agencies are scattered, the handling work is also delayed. Factories and warehouses that have been sealed are subject to concealment and theft, or decay and rot due to the delay in handling. Some have not even been received, so that useful resources cannot be fully utilized, factories are closed, production declines, prices rise, and the people's lives are unbearable. These points can be said to be honest words. It is undeniable that the reception work has not been satisfactory. We should convey this to the administrative authorities, who will surely be willing to listen and accept and make improvements. As for the rumors circulating outside, which attach various labels to the government's reception personnel sent from Chongqing, such as "flying down from the sky," "drilling out from the ground," and "Chongqing Four Families," the team members regard these rumors as "the speaker is not guilty" and "the listener should take warning." However, these overly malicious rumors are morally and legally unacceptable. As the saying goes, "A rolling ball stops at a slight unevenness, and rumors stop with the wise." There is no shortage of rumors in the marketplace, and we hope that they will stop with the wise.

Grateful for Assistance

According to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, the total value of enemy and puppet assets received in Shanghai alone is over one trillion yuan, while in Hangzhou it is only over one hundred billion yuan, a significant difference in proportion. With the limited manpower and short time of this team, it is difficult to expect a thorough investigation. Fortunately, during our stay in Shanghai for more than a month, we have received encouragement and supervision from all sectors of society at any time, and various trade associations have provided us with many sincere opinions. This is something that the team deeply appreciates. In particular, the recent dispatch of five representatives from the Shanghai City Council to participate in the work demonstrates the sincere cooperation between the public opinion organs and the team, which has enabled the investigation work to achieve faster and more appropriate results.

The team is scheduled to conclude at the end of this month. All confidential reports received, reports from the reception agencies, and cases handled are being sorted, classified, and compiled into a list, which will be made public in the future for correction by all sectors of society.

Inspector Cheng's Speech

Subsequently, Inspector Cheng Zhonghang delivered his remarks, saying: "Our government has been implementing the Five-Power Constitution for twenty years. The judicial and supervisory agencies, in particular, have maintained a fully independent spirit, free from any interference or constraint. The organization of this investigation team is ultimately due to its temporary nature, making it possible to be surrounded by power and favoritism. However, even so, the team should still maintain its inherent spirit of independence, not fearing violence, not being partial to private feelings, and resisting other kinds of constraints, so that every investigation case can achieve results. We hope that the public and the media will assist us in completing our mission."

Cheng Responds, Pan Clarifies

Finally, Cheng Zhonghang responded to the points raised by Speaker Pan: (1) The investigation team is a temporary organization, and there is no designated spokesperson to the outside world. At the same time, because news reporters are very enthusiastic in visiting the team to inquire about news, it fully demonstrates the freedom of expression. In addition, some confidential reports were directly disclosed by the original informants to the reporters. (2) Regarding the point of not creating a "severe" image through work, I believe that the team's work is not "severe" enough. How many important cases have been handled to date? Regarding the Sun Tianchang case, the team has already sent it to the court. How the court investigates it is not our responsibility. In addition, I said that "it is about the matter, not the person," which is correct, because "the matter" must be done by "the person." To investigate the responsibility for the matter, of course, we must also punish the person in charge.

After Cheng's response, Speaker Pan made two clarifications: (1) My original intention was never to restrict news reporters from interviewing. (2) I did not mention the Sun Tianchang case, but now I would like to briefly state my thoughts on the case. I believe that Sun Tianchang himself should bear legal responsibility, and the responsibility of the reception and handling agencies for suddenly sealing and then returning his warehouse should also be investigated." Although Mr. Pan and Mr. Cheng had a minor debate, they both hoped that the investigation work would achieve satisfactory results, and their words were earnest, receiving enthusiastic applause from everyone. Finally, the city's reporters stood up one after another to express their opinions, and the meeting did not end until around 12:00 noon.

Clarify the Right and Wrong of Cases, Review Cases Carefully, Neither Indulge Nor Wrong: Speech by Speaker Pan Gongzhan of the Council

Subsequently, Speaker Pan Gongzhan of the Council was invited to speak: He first expressed his admiration for the team's seriousness in working under such limited manpower and financial resources. He hoped that they would maintain their past spirit and complete their mission. He also hoped that the five representatives from the Council participating in the investigation work would maintain their position as representatives of the people, be prudent and meticulous, maintain an independent spirit, and assist in the investigation work. Mr. Pan continued: "Director Zhang said that the temporary organization of the investigation team is a misfortune for the country, and I quite agree. Because if the normal supervisory agencies could fulfill their responsibilities of correcting and supervising the reception and handling work, there would be no need to organize an investigation team. Therefore, I believe that the longer the term of the investigation team, the more it indicates that the country's politics have not yet truly gotten on track. Regarding the spirit of the investigation team's past work, I have only one suggestion, that is, when the members make public statements, their opinions cannot be concentrated, and the content is bound to be inconsistent. I believe that for each case, since it is adopted through a collective decision, it can be published externally by the person in charge, which is more appropriate. In addition, I believe that the investigation team is not trying to show a "severe" image through its work. As Director Zhang said, for each case, we must clarify right and wrong, review it carefully, and neither "indulge" nor "wrong," in order to avoid the problem of "generalization." Finally, I would like to add one sentence, that is, the investigation and reception work focuses on the responsible reception agencies and the people in charge of the reception work. Although the investigation team's work, by its name, is about the matter and not the person, the people who commit malfeasance in handling the reception work are often the objects of investigation. If the person being handled is not the person in charge of the reception work, but the person being received, then each investigation is tantamount to adding to the people's suffering. This unreasonable phenomenon should, of course, be the responsibility of the competent authorities that transfer cases from the investigation team." After Mr. Pan's speech, Jin Runxiang, the standing director of the City Chamber of Commerce, continued to express his hope that the director's statement that "received assets should be used to support industry and commerce and engage in construction, not to balance revenue and expenditure" would be directly suggested to the supreme leader, so that it could have an effect.

### Major Change in Human Relations: Tragic Incident at a Used Bookstore on Beijing Road: Younger Brother Kills His Sister-in-Law

Zhang Zhongming Died from Eight Knife Wounds, His Wife is Also in Critical Condition; The Murderer Zhang Zhongfu Fled Home After the Crime

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Junfu, a native of Ningbo, is sixty years old and has two sons, the elder Zhongming, 34 years old, and the younger Zhongfu, 23 years old. Zhongming married a woman from the same town, Ms. Sheng (30 years old), early on, and has two sons, Tongmao (13 years old) and Fengmao (3 years old). Zhongfu married last August, and his wife's name is Zheng Lijuan (21 years old). Zhang Junfu opened Yongshunxing Used Bookstore at No. 603 Beijing Road, specializing in buying and selling Chinese and foreign newspapers and various used books, operating diligently and accumulating savings over the years. Several years ago, he opened a new branch at No. 521 on the same road. Zhang, due to his old age and illness, was unable to manage both stores, so he divided the family property into four shares two years ago. His sons Zhongfu and Zhongming each received one share, with Zhongming managing the old store and Zhongfu managing the new store. The old store had better business and a yearly surplus, while Zhongfu, being young and inexperienced in business, had mediocre sales. Therefore, he could not help but be jealous of his brother, and his sister-in-law, Ms. Sheng, often made sarcastic remarks, causing friction between the sisters-in-law. Fortunately, their father was still alive and often reprimanded them, preventing any incidents from occurring. Recently, Junfu returned to his hometown, and the brothers' disputes over business matters became more intense. The day before yesterday, after dinner, Zhongming, Zhongfu, Zhongming's wife Ms. Sheng, and the new store employee Lu Axing played mahjong in the old store until midnight. After eight rounds, Zhongfu and Axing were heavily in debt, so they asked to play four more rounds. Zhongming and his wife refused because it was late. Zhongfu left resentfully. The brothers returned to their respective rooms (Zhongming on the second floor, Zhongfu on the third floor). Around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, Zhongfu's employee Axing (who also slept in the attic on the third floor) got up to use the restroom and saw the door to the second-floor room wide open and heard groaning sounds. He rushed into the room and found Zhongming and his wife lying on the bed, covered in blood. Zhongming had been slashed six times in the head, and once each on his right shoulder and right finger, for a total of eight wounds. At the same time, Ms. Sheng had been stabbed twice in the head, and her right ear was almost severed. Axing witnessed the tragedy and shouted loudly, waking up the neighbors from their dreams. They rushed over and immediately notified the police at the post and telephoned the Old Gate Police Station. Criminal Division officers Feng Xiushan and Chief Sun Zhiming rushed to investigate and used a vehicle to rush the injured Zhang Zhongming and his wife to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment. Zhongming died at 10:45 AM due to severe head wounds, brain damage, and excessive blood loss. Zhang's wife, Ms. Sheng, is also in critical condition, and has not yet emerged from danger as of 0:00 AM this morning. There is no doubt that the perpetrator of this case is Zhongfu. At the time of the incident, Zhongfu was nowhere to be found, having already fled without a trace. The police station is currently investigating the matter. Furthermore, the knife used by the murderer was a military-style broadsword, which was both sharp and heavy. Zhongming was slashed as many as eight times, making it difficult to avoid death.

### Joint Reception for the Press by the New and Old Commanders of the First Supply Zone: Report on the Reception and Handling of Military Supplies in the Nanjing-Shanghai Area; Wide Area, Heavy Workload, Severe Punishment for Any Detected Malfeasance

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mr. Zhao Zhiyao, Director of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, yesterday afternoon, together with the newly appointed Commander of the First Supply Zone, Lieutenant General Fu Wen, jointly hosted a reception for the press in the club of the supply headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road. During the reception, they gave a detailed report on the reception and handling of military supplies and the supply situation during their tenure as Special Commissioners of the Ministry of Military Affairs in the Nanjing-Shanghai area and as Commander of the First Supply Zone. Mr. Zhao first stated that since being ordered to establish the Special Commissioner's Office on September 9 of last year, the work has been quite difficult and heavy because the area under its jurisdiction includes not only the Nanjing-Shanghai line, but also Yangzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Ningbo, Yuyao, Cixi, Xiangshan, Anqing, Wuhu, and other places.

Reception Methods

The reception methods were separately stipulated by the surrender officers: (1) Nanjing Area: Enemy and puppet warehouses and factories were directly received by this office. Weapons, ammunition, food, clothing, and all military supplies held by the enemy army were received by the New Sixth Army and then handed over to this office. Trucks were received by the New Sixth Army. Vehicles were received by the Army Headquarters. (2) Zhenjiang Area (including Yangzhou): Except for the enemy's Third Division's warehouses accepted by the 57th Division, which were directly handed over to the First Supply Zone, the rest were directly received by this office. (3) Shanghai Area: Except for some military factories and cloth yarn ordered by the puppet Cotton Administration Council from the puppet Management Department, which were directly received by this office, the rest of the military warehouses and all military supplies were received by the Military Supplies Reception Committee of the Former Third Front Army and then handed over to this office. (4) Other places along the Nanjing-Shanghai Line: All were received by the Mixed Reception Group of the Military Supplies Reception Committee of the Former Third Front Army and then handed over to this office. (5) Zhejiang Area and part of Wuhu: They were received by the takeover group established by the Former Third War Zone and then handed over to this office in succession. (6) Anqing: They were received by the troops stationed there by the Former Tenth War Zone and then handed over to this office. A total of 105 receiving units, including military factories, yards, stations, and warehouses, were received, including 34 in Nanjing, 34 in Shanghai, 11 in Hangzhou, 7 in Jiading, 7 in Suzhou, 4 in Changzhou, 8 in Jiaxing, and others such as Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Anqing, Taicang, and Ningbo, which only received a part of the food or a part of the military supplies.

Processing Methods

The receiving units and military supplies, except for military factories, which were taken over by personnel from the relevant departments with the principle of not stopping work, the remaining materials were ordered to be handled as follows according to their nature: (1) Report and Hand Over: All received materials that were non-military supplies or military supplies that were temporarily not needed were reported and handed over to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau. A total of more than 3.057 million pieces of cloth, more than 8,300 pieces of cotton yarn, and more than 27,300 bales of cotton were reported and handed over. A part of them were needed by the military and were approved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee in November of last year to be retained for military use. It is estimated that the value of the items reported and handed over by this office to the Handling Bureau (including all daily necessities such as undershirts, cigarettes, matches, soap, salt, etc.) is more than 300 billion yuan at current prices. (2) Supply: All supplies, such as grain, non-staple food, clothing, equipment, sanitary medicines, communications equipment, ammunition, etc., were handed over to the headquarters of the First Supply Zone for supply. (3) Storage: All stored items, such as guns, artillery equipment, medical supplies, vehicles, ships, ordnance, clothing, and raw materials, were handed over to the respective competent departments for storage.

Main Cause of Theft

Mr. Zhao and Mr. Fu also admitted that there were indeed cases of malfeasance and theft in the receiving warehouses. The main reason was the lack of original inventory lists, which allowed the managers to take the opportunity to steal. The second reason was that enemy and puppet properties were piled up like mountains during reception, and due to the lack of receiving personnel, criminals were mistakenly used. However, this situation has now been corrected. According to the two gentlemen, there were two or three theft cases in Shanghai and one in Suzhou, but the stolen goods have been recovered. The thieves were punished separately, with the most serious being shot and the lighter ones being imprisoned. In Shanghai, dozens of people have been detained for stealing from warehouses. Mr. Zhao also stated that it is difficult to deny that corruption occurred due to the vast reception area and the lack of personnel. However, although the reception work has come to an end, if any problems arise, we will not shirk our responsibility and will still be responsible. Zhao and Fu finally talked about the situation of the First Supply Zone. Zhao was originally the commander of the zone, but was transferred to the director of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense in June of this year. His vacancy was filled by the deputy commander, Fu Wen. It is said that the business of the First Supply Zone is national in scope, from Guangdong in the south to the three eastern provinces in the north, and supplies are all transferred from Shanghai. Its greatest difficulties are (1) insufficient supplies, (2) budget restrictions, and (3) inflexible coordination in transportation, resulting in the required supplies for various troops often not being delivered quickly. Efforts are currently being made to improve this. The personnel are also of varying quality, with some being irresponsible and corrupt. We hope that all parties will promptly report what they hear and see to this headquarters. If it is found that there are indeed illegal activities or dereliction of duty, we will not protect our subordinates and will definitely punish them severely.

### Wool Uniforms and Fuel Will Not Be Missed, Cotton Cloth Will Be Allocated and Sold Upon Arrival

Public School Employees Have No Obligation to Purchase Goods

The City Allocation Office first decided to allocate food boxes, but recently, some have become moldy, causing some complaints from the outside. According to Yin Tiyang, director of the office, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the distribution of goods to public school employees is done in imitation of the system in Beijing, with tickets for allocation, which is quite fair. If they do not wish to purchase certain allocated items, they are not forced to purchase them. Each allocated item is displayed in the glass window at the front of the office. If they are deemed not very practical, they can be given up. However, in fact, the number of people who purchase is very enthusiastic, and more than half have been sold in ten days, and some want to purchase double or more. As for some moldy items due to storage conditions, the office will immediately step up the opening of boxes and check them one by one to avoid the trouble of replacement. If there is any damage, it will not be issued. We hope that those who receive the goods will wait a little, as the speed of issuing goods will be slightly reduced due to the increase in the opening of boxes and checking procedures. For those who have already received moldy food boxes, there are places for replacement. We hope that each agency will collect them and bring them for replacement for convenience. When asked when cotton cloth could be allocated, Yin replied that it would be allocated and sold upon arrival from the China Trust Bureau. When asked about the allocation of wool uniforms and fuel in Nanjing, it was said that the Ministry of Economic Affairs had been requested, and the Fuel Committee had also written to the office to investigate the number of people. It is thought that the treatment of public school employees in Beijing and Shanghai is the same, and what is available in Beijing should not be missing in Shanghai. In addition, the Shanghai branch of the Relief Administration may soon designate items to be allocated by this office. The Administrative Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau has many types of items, and this office will certainly promote the distribution business step by step in accordance with the contract provisions to serve public school employees. Now that it is just starting, we hope that public school employees in Shanghai will assist us.

Moldy Food Boxes Can Be Replaced at Three Locations

In addition, according to the person in charge of the Goods Distribution Office, if mold is found in the food inside the food box, it can be replaced at the office's warehouse: (1) the Shanghai Municipal Government's Repair Shop Warehouse, (2) the Racecourse Warehouse, and (3) the Broadway Warehouse. The office has assigned special personnel to be responsible for the replacement.

### Eradicating Private Prostitutes: Intensifying Patrols

[Our Dispatch] The Police Bureau has long established management and registration measures for prostitutes in this city. All prostitutes without licenses are strictly prohibited from operating. However, recently, unlicensed private prostitutes have been openly active, especially in the amusement venues of Sincere, Wing On, and other companies. The Police Bureau believes that the established policy must be thoroughly implemented. Therefore, it has reiterated the previous order to each branch bureau, enforcing strict crackdowns.

In the fading twilight, one of the most joyful reunions on earth played out outside Wusongkou: husbands, wives, parents, children, passionate embraces, sweet kisses, hearty laughter...

### Visiting the Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties: Treasures of Art, A Grand Sight; All 206 Pieces Are Privately Owned

[Our Special Feature] Shanghai's calligraphy and painting exhibitions have always been free of charge, requiring no tickets. Therefore, in exhibition halls such as the Ningbo Tongxiang Association, it is common to see visitors bringing their families, young and old, everyone crowding in front of the works of Tang Bohu and Zhu Zhishan, because they have heard of these two names in the "Three Smiles Fate" ballads. Seeing the paintings of beautiful women hanging on the wall, some people would criticize, "A bit like Chen Yunshang." And some painters in Shanghai would really try their best to paint the beautiful women in their works to look very much like Chen Yunshang. It is not uncommon for the exhibition hall to be noisy and smoky, and everyone seems to take the watermelon seed shells all over the floor for granted.

However, yesterday's China Painting Garden was different. Although tickets were sold for two thousand each, the visitors were still quite crowded. However, there was not a single person leisurely chatting while cracking melon seeds. This exhibition of calligraphy and painting of past dynasties, jointly organized by the China Cultural Relics Company and the China Cultural Relics Research Association, has works that are very different in quality from the exhibitions hosted by painting dealers on weekdays. According to their catalog, there are a total of two hundred and six pieces in the works, from Chu Suiliang of the Tang Dynasty to Wu Changshuo and Wang Yiting of modern times. All of them are private collections, and many of these collectors themselves are qualified to open their own works exhibitions, such as Pang Xuqi, Wu Hufan, Liu Haisu, and Wu Zishen. The selection of exhibits seems to have been carefully considered. Gai Qixiang is not seen among the paintings of beautiful women, Lu Lianfu is not seen among the landscapes, and Xu Gu, who suddenly became quite popular in Shanghai some time ago, only has one piece on display. In addition, the presence of Yang Jiaoshan without Zhao Songxue does not seem accidental. The fact that Qian Nanyuan has paintings but no calligraphy is even more to my liking.

I often feel that judging calligraphy and painting can only be done by seeking mutual understanding. Therefore, the knowledge of "brush and ink" ultimately lies in the two words "fate." I think what is good is good, I cannot force you to like what I like, and I am even more unwilling to worship idols or regard good calligraphy and painting as commodities that can be weighed by the pound. I only seek to make my heart happy, I don't need to seek "authenticity," and I don't need to value "antiquity."

Therefore, my favorite pieces are: (1) Yun Nantian's "Fish and Algae Picture," which looks only clear, beautiful, and unparalleled, with the realm of Song lyrics, extremely refined. (2) Wang Yougu's "Autumn Trees and Crows Picture." I think the achievement of this picture has reached its peak, with each stroke subtly protected between intentional and unintentional, and those who see it will feel relaxed and happy. Among the works of the Four Wangs in the entire venue, this picture can be considered the best. (3) Xiang Shengmo's "Stupid Herbs" is really a pot of old iris, with a butterfly perched on it. Although it is not colored, it looks like it is colorful. The intricate and detailed patterns on the butterfly's wings and the simplicity and strength of the iris form a complementary contrast, reminding me of Chinese Fanggan buildings—the basic concept often excels in simplicity, while the decoration is often not afraid of extravagance. Just like Chinese porcelain, its style is never as strangely shaped as the Japanese do, and the glaze on the porcelain is often so gorgeous that it can make art lovers all over the world admire it. (4) Li Rihua's "Lotus" is leisurely and mellow, reminding people of the realm of the late Master Hongyi's "Branches full of spring, the moon round in the heart of heaven." (5) Shao Mi's "Wang Xizhi Exchanging Fans Picture." One of the inspirations of this picture is that "freehand" and "realistic" are united. It is clearly "doing whatever one wants," but how accurate are the lines of this goose—this is almost the breath of Western painting sketches. What is different from Western painting is that there is charm, style, and the painter's personality here. (6) Qiu Shizhou's "High Scholar under Pine Shade Picture" and Shen Shitian's "Osmanthus Bookstore Picture" are just pleasing to see. (7) Wen Zhengming's "Tea Boiling Picture." The wood itself of this painting is not necessarily anything special, but the long inscription in small regular script makes you linger and ponder endlessly. (8) Xia Gui's "Spring Mountain Riding Picture" is sparse and bright, with a very high style. (9) The oldest piece in this exhibition is He Zunshi's "Sunflower Stone Playing with Cats," the silk is already dark, but the cats in the hill are really precious like jade and snow, with vivid spirits. The coloring and brushwork are very impressive! When this painting was created, Da Vinci and Michelangelo were still unknown.

Spending two thousand yuan to see a calligraphy and painting exhibition is unprecedented in Shanghai, but the content of this exhibition is so rich. Seeing such an exhibition is much more meaningful than watching a movie like "Lotus in the Water"!

### Appropriately Allocate Educational Funds from Income of Enemy and Puppet Property: Proposal by Municipal Councilors Chen Baotai and Others

[Our Dispatch] Municipal councilors Chen Baotai, Zhou Feicheng, and others proposed to the Municipal Council that the municipal government should forward to the central government a request to allocate 12% of the income from enemy and puppet property in this city as educational subsidies for this city. The reasons are as follows: During the eight years of the War of Resistance, cultural and educational institutions in various places were mostly destroyed, especially in Shanghai. The central government has already allocated funds to subsidize other provinces and cities (such as Nanjing, which has already been allocated 1 billion yuan), but this city has not yet been benefited. This city has a large population, and the number of students is naturally large. However, the schools that have been restored after the recovery have been mostly destroyed. However, they are limited by funds and cannot afford to repair them, so they cannot accommodate as many students as possible, resulting in many candidates feeling that they have lost their chance to study this season. It is now proposed that the municipal government follow the central government's allocation of subsidies to various provinces and cities, and request the central government to appropriately allocate funds to subsidize educational institutions in this city from the income of enemy and puppet property in this city. Thus, what is taken from the local area will still be used in the local area. It is hoped that the young people who have lost their chance to study will be fortunate, education will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. (Measures) (1) It is proposed that the municipal government follow the central government's allocation of subsidies to various provinces and cities, and request the central government to allocate 12% of the income from enemy and puppet property in this city as educational subsidies. (2) Nanjing has a population of 600,000, and has been allocated 100 million yuan in educational subsidies by the central government. Shanghai has a population of 4 million, and it is proposed to allocate it proportionally from the income of enemy and puppet property. Before it is allocated, the National Bank will first lend 60 million yuan in educational subsidies to meet the urgent need. It is heard that the Municipal Council will discuss this case today. As it concerns subsidizing education, it is unlikely that there will be any objections.

### Chaoyang Establishes a Rehe-Mongolia Normal School

[Central News Agency, Chaoyang, 21st] The culture of the Mongolians in Rehe is backward. The Ministry of Education has decided to establish the National Rehe-Mongolia Normal School in Chaoyang. The principal, Ji Zhonghuan, has arrived here from Beijing and has found the site of the Mongolian School of the puppet Manchukuo as the school site. It is scheduled to open on Double Ten Day. Regarding the promotion of party affairs in Rehe-Mongolia, Yu Shiheng and Zhang Bingzhong have also been specially sent by the central government to supervise and guide. According to Yu, it is planned to first use Chaoyang as the center and then develop towards Chifeng. Zhang also said: The Rehe-Mongolia compatriots are very supportive of the central government. Although some young people mistakenly recognized the Communist army and blindly joined Chifeng, they realized that it was wrong and many fled back to the recovered areas.

### Overview of Ministry of Education Inspection

Talk by Chief Supervisor Zhong Daozan

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing] Zhong Daozan, the chief supervisor of the Educational Supervision Office, has been a supervisor of the Ministry of Education for more than ten years before and after the war, making him the most senior supervisor. Recently, he came to the ministry from Chongqing. In an interview with our reporter in Nanjing, he said that the supervisors of the Ministry of Education, in the past year after the victory, up to the summer vacation of this year, went to various recovered areas to inspect and assist in guiding the educational restoration in various places. Except for Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Taiyuan in Shanxi, and the nine northeastern provinces, which could only be inspected in part and could not be fully visited, all areas that could be reached by transportation in other provinces and cities were inspected separately. In the future, the educational inspection will be after the summer vacation. The method of distributing the supervisors to inspect different areas is being prepared, so that they can set off separately at that time. In this period, more attention is paid to secondary education, national education, and social education in the recovered areas, and guidance and promotion are given. As for higher education, because the return to school from the interior has just begun, or the entire return has not yet been completed, the higher education in the recovered areas is temporarily postponed. However, the colleges and universities and vocational schools above the specialist level that were originally in the rear, the so-called universities and colleges in the southwest and northwest, were not fully inspected in the past, so the supervisors will go to inspect them separately in this period. As for the inspection standards, except for the schools above the specialist level, roughly for primary and secondary education, social education, and educational administration, etc., nine standards have been formulated and printed into a special booklet. However, the post-war educational level is still difficult to reach the ideal standards of the past, so the supervisors can only use the actual situation as guidance.

### Government-Funded Students Studying Abroad: Scheduled to Leave the Country This Year; Results of the Examination for Students Studying Abroad to Be Announced Soon

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] The examination papers for this year's government-funded and self-funded study abroad examinations have long been transported to Beijing and sent to experts for review. Most of the papers have now been reviewed, but for a very small number of specialized subjects, it is not easy to find suitable candidates to review them in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, so experts will be invited from other places to review them. The Examination Committee for Students Studying Abroad of the Ministry of Education hopes to announce the results of the examination at the end of this month, but if unexpected difficulties are encountered, it will be postponed to early October. The general performance of the students who participated in the examination this time is not high. Among the general examination subjects, the English subject is the worst. Generally speaking, students in the rear are better than students in the recovered areas, graduates of national universities are better than graduates of private universities, students who have not migrated are better than students who have just returned, and government-funded students are better than self-funded students. In addition, students who are admitted to study abroad at public expense should participate in training courses organized by the Ministry of Education for several weeks. Recently, because the Ministry of Education ordered all students to leave the country this year in order to enroll in this semester, it is planned not to hold training courses.

### Gushan Library Opened Yesterday

[Our Dispatch, Hangzhou, 22nd] The Gushan Library in West Lake opened today. It contains the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries and various rare and unique books, which will all be displayed for people to visit. Some of them can also be borrowed for reading. According to Curator Chen Bowen, if all the books are displayed in the current library, it will still be insufficient. It was originally intended to set up library branches in many places, but it could not be realized due to limited funds. It is expected that it may be realized next year.

### Shen Lu Arrives in Beijing to Report to the Ministry of Education on the Situation of Tsinghua's Restoration

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing] Shen Lu, the Secretary-General of National Tsinghua University, professor of Southwest Associated University, and acting Director of General Affairs, recently returned to Beijing from Kunming. According to him, the three universities of Southwest Associated University were restored to their original schools after the victory. Nankai went to Tianjin, Peking University and Tsinghua went to Peiping, and the restoration was a complete joint mobilization. Most of the faculty and staff traveled by air, while the students transferred from Guiyang to Changsha to Hankou, and then took a boat through Beijing and Shanghai to Tianjin and Peiping. Because the prices of plane and boat tickets increased, the travel expenses increased, which differed greatly from the original budget and were insufficient. He came to report the actual situation to the Ministry of Education and requested an increase in travel expenses. During the war, Japanese wounded soldiers lived in Tsinghua University, and the school buildings were severely damaged. In addition, the number of students before the war was two thousand and several hundred, and now it has reached three thousand. The repair and addition of school buildings require a lot of money. Fortunately, Minister Zhu agreed to provide assistance and said that he would try his best to provide relief. Now, half of the faculty and staff of Tsinghua University have arrived in Peiping, and about one-third of the students have arrived in Peiping. The remaining staff and students are on their way. This time, the three schools of Southwest Associated University jointly enrolled students, with recruitment examinations in eight locations. There were more than 30,000 students who took the examination. The examination papers have been collected and concentrated in Peiping. Because there are too many examination papers and the professors are still on the way, it will still take some time before the admission of new students can be announced. The principle of opening Tsinghua University on Double Ten Day will not be changed. If the start of classes can be advanced, it will be after October 20, at the latest November 1. Tsinghua will have a new life from the date of restoration. Shen will go to Shanghai in the next few days and then go to Peiping from Shanghai to assist Principal Mei Yiqi in actively preparing for the opening of school.

### Educational Funds of 20 Million to Be Allocated from U.S. Surplus Material Funds: Our Country Is Negotiating with the United States

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] According to relevant sources: U.S. President Truman approved the Fulbright Act on August 1st. The act stipulates that the State Department may allocate 20 million U.S. dollars from the funds used by various countries to purchase U.S. surplus materials to be used for the exchange of students and educational and cultural activities between the United States and foreign countries. The funds are limited to countries that purchase surplus materials, and are limited to 1 million U.S. dollars per year. The United Kingdom has already concluded an agreement with the United States for this purpose. China is currently in discussions. Once such an agreement is concluded, all U.S. students studying in China, U.S. professors lecturing in China, or Chinese students studying in schools in China that are supported by the United States, can be subsidized from these special funds. Chinese students studying in the United States will also be given travel expenses.

### School Military Training

Implemented as Usual This Autumn and Spring; Centralized Military Training to Begin Next Autumn

[Our Dispatch, Chongqing, 22nd] The Sichuan Provincial Government recently received a telegram from the Military Control Zone forwarding a telegram from the Military Training Department: Graduates of high schools and above should receive one year of centralized military training. This year, due to insufficient preparation, it will be postponed and changed to start in July next year. The military training of each school in the autumn of this year and the spring of next year will still be implemented as usual. This case has been approved by Chairman Chiang.

### Raising Teachers' Salaries: Request from Municipal Primary Schools

Scheduled to Petition the Education Bureau This Thursday

Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, the principals of municipal primary schools in this city held a principals' meeting at the Municipal He'an Primary School on Xin Zha Road. Wang Zunwu was elected chairman, and the resolutions were as follows: (1) Regarding the issue of raising teachers' salaries, primary and secondary school teachers should be treated equally. Secondary school teachers have already had their salaries increased this term, but primary schools have not been included, so it is requested to increase the base salary. Moreover, the teachers of the municipal kindergarten attached primary school already have a method for increasing their salaries, with an increase of 40 yuan for teachers, 60 yuan for directors, and 70 yuan for principals. There is precedent to follow. (2) Regarding the salary amounts of teachers who have been newly hired for this semester, which have not yet been approved by the Education Bureau, the school cannot afford to pay in advance. It is requested that the Education Bureau temporarily lend 400,000 yuan per person for the salaries of the new teachers for the eighth and ninth months. (3) Regarding the issue of the construction fee of 5,000 yuan per student collected by the school, it is not necessary to submit it to the Bureau. It is sufficient for the Bureau to send someone to review it. (4) Regarding the issue of leave for teachers who have been working for a long time, there are many teachers who have been working for more than ten years, or twenty or thirty years. The regulations stipulated by the Ministry of Education should be followed, such as the provision that those who have worked for more than ten years should take a year's leave. It is requested that the Education Bureau implement it. After discussion, it was decided that the principals of the central national schools in each district would gather at the conference room of the Education Bureau at 3 p.m. this Thursday to petition the Bureau.

### Qunsheng to Battle Dongfang Tonight

Starting at 8:00 PM Still at the Municipal Stadium

Since the arrival of the Philippine Qunsheng Basketball Team in Shanghai, they have successively defeated Renyu and Huanan. Their skills are superb and have been widely praised. The team is scheduled to make its third appearance at 8:00 PM today, still at the Municipal Stadium, against the rising Dongfang Basketball Team of this city. Tickets are still 2,000 yuan upstairs and 5,000 yuan downstairs. Another grand occasion is expected on the side of Shaanxi Road.

The Qunsheng team has excellent teamwork and stamina. The three musketeers of the team, Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, and Cai Wenhua, have a legendary reputation among fans for their miraculous shooting skills. The Dongfang team has enjoyed a considerable reputation in the mainland over the years. Taking advantage of the return of overseas Chinese this time (opportunity?), they have reorganized. Examining their roster, each member is a veteran with courage and skill. It is a pity that shooter Liu Zhenyuan is unable to attend due to intestinal disease. However, others such as Ren Xiangcheng, Tang Baokun, Wang Nanzhen, and Xu Heng have superb skills. Cai Yanxiong, who was injured in the hand during the Shantou team's match against the Air Force, has now recovered and is determined to play today. The momentum of the Dongfang team is strong, and today they may be able to show their skills and compete with Qunsheng.

[Qunsheng] Lin Zhuguang (leader), Long Dongsheng (manager), Wang Gongbian (secretary), Chen Jinde (captain), Chen Jinzhi, Cai Wenhua, Zhang Yuyi, Cai Lianke, Cai Wenzhang, Yang Renhui, Zhu Shirong, Zhuang Qinghua, Chen Dexiu, Cai Deming, Li Tianxiang.

[Dongfang] Shen Kunnan (coach), Ren Xiangcheng (captain), Tang Baokun, Cai Yanxiong, Wang Nanzhen, Xu Heng, Zhang Shaoqing, Liu Jingxing, Wang Lewu, Jin Yan.

### Youyou Sports Association Decides to Reorganize

The Youyou Sports Association, with a long history, has been led by Cheng Yize, the "Little Mengchang," for decades, dominating the sports scene. In the past, it even had its own stadium, and its scale was worthy of being the best in Shanghai. Its ranks were filled with famous players, and talented people emerged in large numbers. "Iron Foot" Sun Jinshun, "Iron Head" Huang Ruihua, and goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai were all former members of Youyou. During the War of Resistance, the team members dispersed, which led to the suspension of the association's affairs. After the victory, the former members of the team returned to Shanghai one after another. The organizer, Cheng Yize, specially invited former veterans to hold a symposium to decide to reorganize. Once preparations are complete, the official roster will be announced.

Civil Affairs Briefs

### Municipal Government Reaffirms Previous Order: Civil Servants May Not Hold Concurrent Positions

And Stipulates Two Measures for Compliance

The Municipal Government issued a notice to all agencies yesterday: "It is hereby notified to all agencies that the state establishes officials and distributes duties, each with its own responsibilities. Civil servants may not hold other public positions or any concurrent positions in addition to their assigned duties. The central government has long had explicit orders strictly prohibiting this. The Municipal Government previously received Administrative Yuan Decree Jingrenzi No. 4772, which was forwarded to be followed. However, fearing that over time, this would be disregarded or even openly violated, strict enforcement is necessary to uphold the law and regulate official conduct. Therefore, two measures are specifically stipulated as follows: (1) If it is indeed necessary to hold a concurrent position and it does not hinder the performance of one's assigned duties, it must be approved by the supervising officer and reported for record before the concurrent position can be held, but no additional salary may be received. (2) If it is not absolutely necessary and concurrent positions are held without permission from higher authorities, once discovered or reported, in addition to the suspension of the individual, the direct supervisors at all levels who failed to detect the matter in advance and did not report it for approval afterward shall also be subject to appropriate punishment in order to rectify the situation. Hereafter, all levels of personnel in this city should deeply understand this intention and strictly comply, and not regard it as a mere formality, lest they incur blame."

### Prioritize Hiring Personnel Who Participated in the War of Resistance: Municipal Government Issues Notice to All Agencies to Investigate and Register

The Municipal Government approved a letter from the Ministry of Personnel, forwarding an order from the Examination Yuan, which approved a letter from the Secretariat of the Supreme National Defense Council, based on a proposal from the National Political Council, stating that those who participated in the War of Resistance in the occupied areas should be given priority for hiring and commendation. The Administrative Yuan was instructed to investigate and handle the matter. After investigation, civil servants who participated in the War of Resistance in the occupied areas risked danger, braved difficulties, and faced death. Their patriotism is truly commendable. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, those who are unemployed, without support, or unable to return to their hometowns due to banditry and traffic congestion, and who are destitute and lack food and clothing, should be given priority for hiring or commendation in order to clarify rewards and punishments and encourage morale. The Ministry has drafted separate letters to the provincial and municipal governments, instructing them to promptly investigate and register these personnel and give them priority for hiring. Those who meet the requirements of the regulations for awarding victory medals may also be requested to be awarded and commended. The situation of hiring and rewarding shall be reported to the Administrative Yuan and the Ministry for record every three months in order to streamline procedures and achieve practical results. The Administrative Yuan has approved the proposal and, in addition to replying to the Examination Yuan, has issued a letter to the Administrative Yuan to be forwarded for implementation. It is reported that the Municipal Government has instructed its subordinate units to begin investigating and registering personnel who participated in the War of Resistance in the occupied areas and to give them priority for hiring.

### Reassignment of Bao Chiefs in the Sixteenth District

In the Sixteenth District (Hongkou) District Office, Lei Shouli, the Deputy Bao Chief of the Tenth Bao, was ordered to be promoted to Bao Chief. Chen Liangfa was selected by the Jia to fill the vacancy. Chen Yaozong, the Bao Chief of the Twenty-seventh Bao, and Hu Yuantang, the Bao Chief of the Twenty-eighth Bao, resigned due to personal reasons. Liu Bingkun and Guo Wenqi, the Deputy Bao Chiefs, were selected to fill the vacancies respectively. After a meeting of the Jia Chiefs of the respective Baos, Su Liansheng was publicly recommended as the Deputy Bao Chief of the Twenty-seventh Bao, and Chen Hexuan as the Deputy Bao Chief of the Twenty-eighth Bao, and the appointments have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval.

### Q&A on Questions Regarding Household Registration Laws and Regulations

(Continued)

9. Occupation: All persons aged 12 or older must fill in this information. Persons under the age of 12 may not need to fill in this information. However, if a person under the age of 12 is employed, they must still fill in the actual situation. When filling in the occupation, it is first necessary to distinguish between employed and unemployed. Except for the three types of work: "managing one's own household affairs," "attending school," and "serving in the military," the standard for determining whether one is employed or unemployed is whether there is remuneration.

(1) Income that is not earned through labor does not count as remuneration, such as rental income from real estate property, interest income from capital, government relief or private assistance, such as pensions, etc. Those who rely on this for a living are considered unemployed. (2) If a person has more than one occupation at the same time, the occupation that provides direct remuneration is the primary occupation. If both occupations provide direct remuneration, the occupation that requires more working hours is the primary occupation. Only one primary occupation should be filled in during the survey. (3) If a person has previously been employed but is taking a break at the time of the survey, for example, due to vacation or illness, the original occupation should be filled in. (4) If a person has always been employed but is idle at the time of the survey because they have not found work, their original occupation should be filled in. For example, a porter at a bus station should still fill in "bus station porter" even if they have not found business today. (5) Unemployed persons should fill in their original occupation and fill in "unemployed" in the position or employer field. (6) A person who has never been employed, even if they are about to be employed, but has not yet engaged in that work, should still fill in "unemployed." (7) If a family member helps with the work of the head of household, increasing the income of the head of household or the family, but has no other related employment, their occupation is helping with the work of the head of household. If they have other work that provides direct remuneration, the occupation should be the work that provides direct remuneration. (8) Those who live by committing criminal acts, such as prostitutes, gamblers, etc., are all unemployed. (To be continued)

### District News

The Cooperation Society of the Twenty-third District (Wusong) has found a double-fronted municipal building at No. 310 Wusong Wai Ma Road to serve as a supply and sales department, which is scheduled to open for business on the 24th.

### 15% Commodity Tax Rate Causes Great Shock to Wool Textile Industry: Limited Production Volume Does Not Compensate for Tax Revenue, Intolerable to Impose Heavy Taxes Under Pressure from Foreign Goods

[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Woolen Textile Dyeing Industry Association hosted the press last night. More than thirty directors, supervisors, and reporters from various newspapers attended. Cheng Nianpeng, chairman of the association, reported that the association currently has 57 members. The oldest has a history of just over ten years, while the youngest is only one or two years old. The machinery and raw materials are mostly purchased from abroad. In the past, wages were lower than in foreign countries, and costs were relatively light, so there was still a small profit to be made. However, since the victory, workers' arrogance has been rampant, and wages have been raised repeatedly, exceeding more than 10,000 times the pre-war level. In addition, the interest rate is too high, so costs have increased sharply, all of which are higher than foreign goods. All factories in the industry are feeling unable to maintain themselves. The government announced the Commodity Tax Regulations on August 16, stipulating that wool yarn, wool fabrics, and wool products will be taxed at 15%. The high tax rate and wide scope, once implemented, will only cause the entire industry to collapse. The object of commodity tax should be industries with a wide scope and a large output, which can indeed supplement the tax source. Currently, the industry only has over 20,000 spindles and only about 1,000 looms, including wooden looms. About 60% to 70% of them are currently operating. More than half of the factories have simple equipment, with only a dozen or two or three looms. Therefore, in terms of scope and output, it is not suitable for the collection of commodity tax. This is the first reason. The unified tax for cotton yarn is too high at 2.5%. It has now been changed to 5%, while wool yarn and finished products are as high as 15%. Both are essential clothing items, but the tax rates are so different. Examining the reason for this discrimination, it may be mistaken that woolen fabrics are luxury goods. This is the second reason. Adding taxes is tantamount to increasing production costs, which is contrary to the government's policy of suppressing commodity prices. This is the third reason. The price of domestic woolen textiles, even without taxes, is difficult to compete with foreign goods. Adding taxes will make it even more difficult to revive. This is the fourth reason. Finally, he appealed to the media for sympathy and assistance, hoping that the authorities would adhere to their consistent policy of production and construction, consider the difficulties of businesses, and withdraw the order.

### Seven Types of Commodity Taxes to Be Levied Starting October 1

The Municipal Commodity Tax Bureau, following the order of the Ministry of Finance, has decided to levy seven new types of taxes starting October 1, including (1) flour tax – all machine-made flour and semi-machine-made flour are included, (2) cement tax – all machine-made cement and semi-machine-made ash (instead of cement) are included, (3) tea tax – all black tea, green tea, brick tea, rough tea, scented tea, tea stems, tea dust, and other types of tea designated by the Ministry of Finance are included, (4) fur tax – A. All tanned leather goods, including various leathers, skin barrels, skin blankets, and other tanned leather goods are included; B. All machine-made wool yarn, wool fabrics, wool products, and finished products mixed with various fibers are included, (5) tin foil and superstitious paper tax – all kinds of tin foil and all kinds of paper for superstitious purposes, as determined by the Ministry of Finance, are included, (6) beverage tax – all soda, fruit juice, fruit juice water, etc. are included, (7) cosmetics tax – all cold cream, facial cream, hair wax, hair oil, scented powder, rouge powder, talcum powder, floral water, scented soap, sesame paste, perfume, nail polish, eyebrow pencils, and others designated by the Ministry of Finance are included. The manufacturers of all the above-mentioned taxable items have been notified by the Commodity Tax Bureau to complete registration procedures before the 26th.

### Go to the Northeast: Rich Underground Resources, Fertile Above-Ground Products - Zhang Xiaomei Talks About the Northeast as a Base for International Commercial Warfare

[Our Newspaper Shenyang 22nd Dispatch] Zhang Xiaomei, Director of the China National Economic Research Institute, recently came to the Northeast to collect and research Northeast economic data. He has visited factories and production institutions in Shenyang and Changchun and will soon return south to the United States. According to his conversation with a Taibao reporter, the Northeast is the lifeline of our country and a major resource area. I saw the outline of the Northeast factories, I saw the Northeast soybeans and sorghum, and I know that our eight years of bloody battle were not in vain, because Jiangnan produces mostly above ground, and North China produces mostly underground. The Northeast has both underground and above ground. From an economic point of view, it is an obvious surplus. International commercial warfare will inevitably take this as a competitive base. In the near future, there will be a factual manifestation. The Japanese have more than 40 years of history in the study of the Northeast economy. We cannot but admire their spirit of research. Of course, what they studied was to cooperate with their military actions. Today, what they have studied has disintegrated and is in chaos, but we must sort it out and transform it to complete it to suit our needs. The current issue in the Northeast is to revive the dead factories, to make the smokeless chimneys smoke, to export as much surplus products as possible, and to open up the exchange between inside and outside the customs. This is to open up this economic transportation line. The talents and capital of Beijing and Shanghai will soon flow to the Northeast. The loose funds in Shanghai have nowhere to use, or they may be the pioneers to the Northeast. In the past, there were about 1.5 million Japanese technical engineers in the Northeast. Most of them have now been deported, and it is estimated that less than 50,000 will remain. In my personal opinion, excellent Japanese technology and workers should still be retained. They are the keys to opening or restoring factories. Without this key, there may be concerns that the treasure house cannot be opened smoothly. In addition, a large number of domestic technical personnel should come to the Northeast. There is nothing to be afraid of in the Northeast. Everyone may compare the Northeast to the front line of the war. That is too much consideration, or it is a misunderstanding of the rumors. Currently, economists, engineers, and journalists in the Northeast should do more to open up the exchange between inside and outside the customs in order to develop the economy, to rebuild or build a new Northeast.

### White Tung Oil Exports Stagnant: Hongjiang Tung Oil Sales Have Declined

Since the adjustment of foreign exchange, foreign trade in white tung oil has shown some vitality. However, the production area has also increased accordingly, so the recent export price seems to be miscalculated. Before the foreign exchange rate was changed, the export price in this port was 35 cents per pound in US dollars, but after the exchange rate was lengthened, it could only be sold for 33 cents. Including iron drums delivered to the dock, it only amounted to 115,000 to 116,000 yuan per market dan. Therefore, whether it is Zhejiang tung or Hankou tung transported for resale, the profit is very thin, and the operators find it tasteless. Domestic wholesale sales are between 117,000 and 118,000 yuan.

Hongjiang tung oil summer sales have already declined, and autumn sales have not yet started. The source and accumulation in western Hunan are still numerous, so the market is difficult to improve for a while. However, in terms of the proportion of all things, Hongjiang tung is not expensive. The overall reason is that the purchasing power of rural areas after the robbery is far less than before, resulting in oversupply. Although each brand, such as Yang Hengyuan, Qingyuan, Liu Tongqing, Liu Qingyuanfeng, Xiao Hengqing, and Xu Rongchang, are slightly different, the approximate selling price is always around 85,000 to 86,000 yuan.

### First Post-War Tea Arrives in England

[Reuters London 21st Dispatch] According to London tea authorities, the first batch of Chinese black tea since 1940 has arrived. The second batch of orders is larger and is expected to arrive in mid-October. The quantity of this tea is small and of low quality. The Ministry of Food has approved tea merchants to import 2.5 million pounds of Chinese tea. However, due to the precarious economic and political situation in the country and the rising price of new goods, transactions are difficult, so even the export of this small amount of tea is still problematic. Moreover, the Ministry of Food recently announced that the retail price of Chinese tea is 4 shillings and 10 pence per pound, while news from China says that most of the existing tea is not suitable for export. The import volume of Chinese green tea and black tea before the war fluctuated annually. In 1932, it was 5,428,000 pounds. In 1934, it increased to 17,795,000 pounds. In 1939, it fell again to 659,000 pounds. In 1940, it rebounded to 2,161,000 pounds.

### Oil Transportation Problem Solved: Qingdao Oil Can Flow Steadily

The China Edible Oil Company began jointly distributing edible oil with the China Vegetable Oil Factory on the 18th, with 200 barrels per day, totaling 700 market dans. The method and target are in accordance with the previous organization of Zhongzhi, and Zhongzhi is fully responsible for the agency. Zhongzhi believes that in order to maintain the market price, the inventory should be enriched. To enrich the inventory, transportation must be strengthened. It previously ordered a 1,200-horsepower, 2,000-ton large tugboat from overseas. It has just sailed to Shanghai from the Pacific Ocean last week and is being sorted out these days. Soon, the ship will tow six barges and sail directly to Qingdao to transport raw oil from the China Edible Oil Company's scattered warehouses to Shanghai. The company's previous iron bucket shortage and waiting for shipment problems can be completely solved.

### Stock Exchange Brokers Enter the Market: No Borrowing of Badges

In order to prevent unauthorized personnel from entering the market, the Stock Exchange has created badges for brokers to enter the market. Those without badges will be strictly rejected. However, since the opening, it has been repeatedly discovered that brokers' badges are worn by brokers with different faces. In order to be cautious, the Exchange issued a notice stating that henceforth brokers' badges are limited to the person's own use and may not be borrowed to prevent malpractice and maintain order.

### Hongxiang Woolen Fabrics Cheap

Hongxiang Woolen Fabrics at No. 42 Henan Road in this port is quite large, hiring professional technicians to design Chinese and Western men's and women's clothing for customers. Recently, a branch has been opened at No. 211 Zhonghua Road, Nanjing (intersection of Sanshan Street), which opened on the 21st. The two branches in Beijing and Shanghai are holding cheap prices at the same time to commemorate the occasion.

### A Comparative Study of the Old and New Income Tax Laws

— Xu Riqing

(I) Introduction

Our country's income tax originated in the 25th year of the Republic. Not long after its establishment, it coincided with the war. The government moved west, the coastal areas were lost, and customs and other taxes sharply decreased. Income tax was compelled by environmental needs, and tax revenue rapidly increased, becoming the main source of national tax revenue. Examining advanced countries such as England and the United States, their income taxes also originated in wartime. For example, the British income tax originated in 1798 during the Napoleonic Wars, the French income tax originated in World War I, and the American income tax originated in the Civil War that emancipated black slaves. Our country's income tax originated during the July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident, which can be said to be a mutually illuminating event, following the examples of others.

Last year, the Japanese bandits surrendered, and the national territory was restored. The government considered the past eight years to be a trial period, and simplifications and deficiencies were inevitable. Therefore, it promulgated the new Income Tax Law on April 16th of this year. Examining its contents, the shortcomings of the old Income Tax Law have been modified, and it has been able to take into account the actual situation, gradually becoming more rational. Now, a comparative study of the old and new Income Tax Laws is presented for review.

(II) Old and New Comparison

Our country's old Income Tax Law had 22 articles, and the new Income Tax Law has 42 articles. Now, the differences and improvements are listed as follows:

(1) Property Rental Income is Merged, While Property Sale Income is Abolished.

Our country's old Income Tax Law was divided into three categories: 1. Profit-seeking Enterprise Income, 2. Salary and Remuneration Income, 3. Securities and Deposit Income. In the 32nd year of the Republic, considering the needs of the environment, the Separate Statute of Property Rental and Sale Income Tax Law was promulgated on January 26th, levying taxes on rental income and sale income of land, houses, warehouses, docks, forests, mines, boats, vehicles, and machinery. Property sales are all land sales. Our country already has land value tax, deed tax, land value increment tax, and other items. However, the direct tax bureau still levied property sale income tax on land sales, which seemed to be a duplicate. Therefore, in the new Income Tax Law, the abolition of property sale income is very reasonable. As for the remaining property rental income tax, the new tax law lists it as the fourth category, while also adding fisheries, and separately taxing the rental income of land, houses, warehouses, forests, mines, and fisheries, and the rental income of docks, boats, vehicles, and machinery according to their weight. The latter is taxed an additional 10% on top of the former's regulations. (2) Industrial and Commercial Enterprises, Companies or Non-Company Organizations are Taxed Separately.

Profit-seeking enterprises include organizations such as companies and businesses. The old Income Tax Law (Article 1, Category 1, Item A) stipulated that all companies, businesses, firms, factories, or individual capital with profits of more than 2,000 yuan would be taxed regardless of whether they were sole proprietorships, partnerships, companies, or non-companies. The new Income Tax Law will tax the profit-seeking income of limited companies, joint-stock limited companies, and limited companies, and the profit-seeking income of unlimited companies, general partnerships, sole proprietorships, and other organizations (Article 2, Category 1) separately. For the former, the tax exemption point is when the actual capital amount is less than 5%. For the latter, the tax exemption point is when it is less than 150,000 yuan. If the income belongs to manufacturers, the tax amount will be reduced by 10% according to the previous regulations. At the beginning of national construction, to enrich the people and strengthen the country, and considering that industrial capital turnover is slow, and commercial capital turnover is fast, and that industry is now on the verge of bankruptcy, while commercial speculation profits are generous, everyone abandons industry and engages in commercial speculation, resulting in a rampant speculative market and abundant floating capital. Legislators, in order to reduce the burden on industry, stipulate that the tax rate for manufacturing is reduced by 10% according to regulations, which is a major improvement. Furthermore, the separate taxation of companies and non-companies is intended to encourage company organization, because limited companies, joint-stock limited companies, etc., rely on share capital and money, while unlimited companies, partnerships, and sole proprietorships rely on individuals and credit. The new Income Tax Law can make further analysis and encourage the former organization, which is also appropriate.

(3) Business or Artistic Remuneration is Taxed Differently from Salary Remuneration

The old Income Tax Law stipulated (see Article 1, Category 2) that the tax rate for salaries and remuneration of civil servants, freelancers, and others engaged in various occupations was the same. The new Income Tax Law (see Article 2, Category 1) divides salary and remuneration income into two items: (A) Income from business or artistic remuneration, and (B) Income from remuneration. The detailed regulations are in the Implementing Rules of the Income Tax Law. Item A refers to lawyers, accountants, engineers, doctors, and drama performers, actors, etc. (Article 33). Item B refers to civil servants and employed freelancers. The tax exemption point for the former is those who do not exceed 150,000 yuan. The tax exemption point for the latter is those whose monthly income does not exceed 50,000 yuan, because the former's income is more fluid and the latter's is more fixed. At the same time, the former's income is often more than the latter's. The legislator can analyze in detail, which is a real improvement.

(4) State-Owned Enterprises are Taxed Universally

Our country's state-owned enterprises were originally not taxed. The reason is that whether state-owned enterprises are taxed or not taxed, the outcome is the same. As the saying goes, "the wool comes from the sheep's back," which is all money from the national treasury. At first glance, it seems reasonable, but upon closer analysis, it is inappropriate for state-owned enterprises to be exempt from taxes. The reasons are listed below.

1. The old Income Tax Law stipulated that the income of jointly operated government-business profit-seeking enterprises should pay profit-seeking income tax. According to this regulation, those with government-business joint ventures are taxed, and those with merchant sole proprietorships are taxed. Only state-owned ones are not taxed, especially since state-owned enterprises do not have a monopoly nature (those with a monopoly nature are not included), so that those with government-business joint ventures or private enterprises, their production costs or prices must be higher than those of state-owned enterprises, making it impossible for those with government-business joint ventures or private enterprises to compete. From the standpoint of protecting national industry, state-owned enterprises should not be exempt from taxes, this is the first reason.

2. If state-owned enterprises are not taxed, their costs and prices are lower, making the hosts unwilling to strive for improvement. If taxes are levied uniformly, a "survival of the fittest" competitive state is formed, and the hosts must be careful and strive for improvement, which is beneficial to the country and the people. The failure of our country's past state-owned enterprises is not unrelated to this, this is the second reason.

3. If state-owned enterprises are not taxed, when their profits are turned over to the treasury, they include a portion of taxes. In order to obtain accurate statistical figures, profits and tax amounts should be divided, this is the third reason.

Based on the above three reasons, state-owned enterprises should be taxed uniformly. The new Income Tax Law (see Article 3 of the Implementing Rules of the New Income Tax Law) stipulates that "the profit-seeking enterprises mentioned in this law include public enterprises and jointly operated government-business enterprises run by governments at all levels." This is a great improvement. It is expected that in the future, private and state-owned enterprises can compete with each other on an equal footing. At the same time, those who host state-owned enterprises should be vigilant, and can also eradicate one of the malpractices of state-owned enterprises. The above three points are the obvious improvements of the new Income Tax Law. The implementation of comprehensive income tax has epoch-making significance in the history of income tax in our country, which will be specifically described in the next section. (To be continued)

### A New Trial for the Two Major Ethnic Groups: China's Sovereignty in Hong Kong (Part 2)

— Special Correspondent Ling Fang

Hong Kong Airmail, 19th of this month, from our newspaper.

Following the Hong Kong government spokesperson, our foreign affairs stationed authorities should also issue a formal statement regarding our country's position on the Kowloon Walled City issue, allowing overseas Chinese compatriots who care about the motherland to gain a correct understanding. Indeed, just before the reporter sent the manuscript, I received news that my Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Special Envoy to Guangdong and Guangxi, Guo Dehua, had met with Hong Kong Governor Yang Muqi on the afternoon of the 16th, stating that "the Chinese government will not abandon treaty rights, and the establishment of a administration in the Kowloon Walled City is in progress." The reaction that this formal statement from our officials can cause among overseas Chinese compatriots is self-evident. If this matter develops further, our country's sovereignty in Hong Kong will have a brand-new expression.

More than a month ago, after Ni Hui, a consultant from our Ministry of Judicial Administration, and Mr. Shidiwen, the new British envoy to China, passed through Hong Kong and returned to Beijing, the Hong Kong Xinsheng Evening News published on July 29th the news that "Our country will set up a court in Kowloon in the near future," which caused a sensation among overseas Chinese compatriots. The Xinsheng Evening News stated affirmatively:

This newspaper's reporter has learned from the most reliable sources that our country will set up a court in Kowloon in the very near future. Judges will be appointed by our Ministry of Judicial Administration. All Chinese and foreign civil and criminal cases will be handled by our country's court. Its nature will be the same as the First and Second Special District Courts in the Shanghai Concession before it was abolished.

This court will be the Kowloon Branch of our Baoan District Court. Our judicial authorities believe that Hong Kong is a ceded territory, while Kowloon is a leased territory. Establishing a Chinese court in Kowloon is permitted by international law. Before Guangzhou fell, Shi Yancheng, the president of the Guangzhou Court, had already returned to Hong Kong to conduct negotiations. Now, our Ministry of Judicial Administration is reviving the old matter and has raised it with the British Ambassador.

The Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that Hong Kong and China are only separated by a strip of water, and the customs and habits of the people are not very different, but Hong Kong's laws are very different from China's laws. For example: (1) Chinese women naturally have inheritance rights and special portions (Editor's note: a special portion is half of the deceased's estate, which should naturally be received equally by the heirs and cannot be freely disposed of by the deceased), while Hong Kong Chinese women have no inheritance rights. (2) In Hong Kong, a married woman who commits adultery will be imprisoned for six months, while a married man who commits adultery is not guilty, which violates Chinese law; (3) In Hong Kong, the eldest grandson has a special status, while China's Civil Code has long abolished this feudal legislative system. Our Ministry of Judicial Administration sincerely hopes that the legal differences between China and Hong Kong can be abolished as soon as possible.

Our judicial circles pointed out that Hong Kong courts judge cases based on Chinese law before 1843, but this type of law has been abandoned by China's Civil Code. Therefore, before establishing a Chinese court in Kowloon, it is necessary to seek a confusion of legal concepts; otherwise, it will be difficult to determine the rights and obligations of the people.

Regarding the selection of the president of the Kowloon Court, our judicial authorities are currently considering it carefully, because the position of the president of the special court is not high in the selection and appointment of Chinese legal officials, but the responsibility is very important. Our country intends to select suitable figures from Chinese lawyers in Hong Kong, but it has not yet been decided.

The Xinsheng Evening News dares to freely publish this shocking news alone in Hong Kong, which is still under British rule, naturally has sufficient arguments. It is said that this matter has caused considerable displeasure to the Hong Kong government authorities. The next day, the Hong Kong government's Information Department issued a statement denying this news: "The Hong Kong government has taken note of the news published by the Xinsheng Evening News on July 29th that a Chinese court will be established in Kowloon in the near future. The Hong Kong government wants the public to know that this news is completely untrue. Negotiations on the establishment of a Chinese court in British territory, whether ceded or leased areas, have never been mentioned or considered."

However, because the facts are all there, this cannot be denied. On the same day, the Xinsheng Evening News believed that the newspaper's reputation had suffered a major loss due to the Hong Kong government's statement, so it lodged a protest with the Hong Kong government. The Hong Kong government could not resist the Xinsheng Evening News's contention, so it also allowed the Xinsheng Evening News to issue a statement on the Hong Kong government's statement to recover the lost newspaper reputation. The Xinsheng Evening News issued a statement on August 1st saying.

"...The Hong Kong government's statement includes the present but does not include the future. It is a statement of facts but does not exclude the principles of international law and the intentions of the Chinese government.

Today, when Sino-British relations are harmonious, we publish this news as a matter of international law. Both China and the United Kingdom are nations that believe in the law, and naturally they can withstand trials in front of the law. Therefore, we must also declare that we are always considering the future of Sino-British friendly relations when publishing this news and this statement."

On the same day, the Xinsheng Evening News also published a Singapore airmail report dated July 23rd entitled "China and Britain Will Discuss the Future Status of Hong Kong," which said: "British Ambassador to China Shi Diwen, who is newly appointed, declared before leaving Singapore for Nanjing: Chairman Chiang and the British government will discuss the future status of Hong Kong at the appropriate time. Chairman Chiang has expressed that he will discuss the issue of returning Hong Kong to China. It seems that there is no problem for him to discuss this matter, and this is also the attitude of the British government."

Borrowing the British Ambassador's words

To raise overseas Chinese compatriots' awareness of the future status of Hong Kong and indirectly respond to the statement that "Our country will set up a court in Kowloon in the near future." Based on various facts, although the Hong Kong government has made a statement, overseas Chinese compatriots still believe that Chinese courts, like Chinese customs, will appear on the leased territory of Kowloon in accordance with international law. (Our country has the Kowloon Customs in Kowloon, which ranks second in the country in terms of import and export.) Since our authorities have intentions first, there will be results later.

Many people who talk about the Hong Kong issue only know about Hong Kong but do not know about the New Territories of Kowloon. In the treaty, Hong Kong is a ceded territory, and the New Territories of Kowloon are leased territories. Geographically, Hong Kong is an island, and the New Territories of Kowloon are the mainland. The former has an area of only 20 square miles, while the latter reaches 286 square miles. Having only Hong Kong Island without the opposite shore of the New Territories of Kowloon makes Hong Kong a veritable isolated island. Kowloon is the backbone of Hong Kong. Last time, the Japanese army first captured Kowloon before attacking Hong Kong. After the British obtained Hong Kong Island in 1842, they occupied an additional two or three square miles of land at the tip of the Kowloon Peninsula on the opposite shore in 1860 (Treaty of Beijing), which resulted in the distinction between New Kowloon and Old Kowloon. Then, in 1898, the British leased a large piece of land north of Kowloon and some islands, named the New Territories, before developing the current situation in Hong Kong. Therefore, in the eyes of the general public, the so-called Hong Kong includes the New Territories of Kowloon, which must be distinguished. When the Hong Kong Governor announced the new Hong Kong political system last month, the administrative districts under the Municipal Council were initially limited to Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and New Kowloon. It can be seen that even from the British standpoint, Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories are not treated as one. After the war, the unequal treaties have been abolished, and Sino-British relations have undergone an epoch-making change. Even if the British cannot abandon Hong Kong for a while, the New Territories of Kowloon should be returned to us in advance. In order to take into account the friendship between the two major ethnic groups, the recovery of Hong Kong Island can be delayed for a while, but the restoration of sovereignty over the New Territories of Kowloon should not be delayed any longer, as this will cause many unnecessary restrictions (such as the national army crossing the river to the north and other transportation and traffic issues). Therefore, the issue of setting up a court in Kowloon and establishing a administration in the Kowloon Walled City arose one after another. On our side, we should make careful considerations, detailed plans, and thorough implementations in order to restore the integrity of national territorial sovereignty. On the British side, we must also recognize the changes of the times, face the needs of reality, and make goodwill expressions in order to repair the friendship between the two major ethnic groups. We are neither "overly hasty" nor "permanently silent," which is certainly not right. The British side's attitude of "arguing unreasonably" or "being obsessed with the past" is not necessarily clever either. It is said that in the above two incidents, the Hong Kong government should not ignore the facts and make a statement of "no silver buried here" (even under the threat of gunboats, it is not easy to force people to believe). Why not seek the most reasonable solution with the Chinese side openly and honestly? Problems must be solved eventually.

For the sake of the Hong Kong issue, the two major ethnic groups of China and the United Kingdom are facing a historical trial. The two major ethnic groups were able to fully cooperate during the war to defeat the common enemy. Can't they fully understand each other after the war and achieve a satisfactory solution to their own problems?

### Two Western Newspapers Shout in Unison

After the Hong Kong government issued a statement on the Kowloon Walled City administration issue on the 14th of this month, Guo Dehua, the Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, acting on instructions from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, declared to Hong Kong's Yang Muqi that "Our government will not abandon treaty rights." The next day, He Fengshan, the Director of the Information Department and spokesperson for our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, issued a statement in Beijing in response to the Hong Kong government's statement. Personnel from the British Embassy in China also issued statements. In addition, with the responses and solemn expressions from various parties in Shanghai and Guangdong, this issue has changed from a local issue to an issue in Sino-British relations. The cause and course of this issue have already been reported in detail above. Now, I will summarize and analyze the reactions of the Hong Kong media and overseas Chinese compatriots to this issue in recent days to inform concerned readers.

Before Guo Dehua, the Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, formally expressed our government's opinion to the Hong Kong government, only the Xinsheng Evening News and the Gongshang Evening News in the Hong Kong Chinese media had made any expressions (the opinions of these two evening newspapers have been seen in the previous newsletter). The Hong Kong Chinese newspapers' remarks seemed to still be intimidated by the National Daily incident three months ago, and they were somewhat "terrified" of the Hong Kong government's "flexible" defense law! After the Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs and the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs successively made solemn expressions, the Sing Tao Evening News, the National Daily, and the China Daily successively began to discuss and review this issue. However, they are still limited by the environment and cannot speak freely:

The Sing Tao Evening News, on the 18th, used the title "On the Issue of Establishing a Administration in the Kowloon Walled City," cited the treaty, and believed that "the sovereignty of the Kowloon Walled City belongs to China, which is an indisputable fact." Finally, according to the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, "It is hoped that the establishment of a administration in the Kowloon Walled City will be restored as soon as possible and proceed as soon as possible." The National Daily did not publish the Hong Kong government's statement on the 14th. Only after Guo Dehua made a counter-statement to the Hong Kong Governor on the 17th did it publish the two statements together, which can be regarded as a "unique measure." On the 19th, the newspaper wrote an editorial entitled "The Status of the Kowloon Walled City," proving that "the sovereignty of the Kowloon Walled City has always belonged to China." Targeting the words of the spokesperson of the British Embassy in Nanjing that the status of the Kowloon Walled City is a matter of "treaty interpretation," the newspaper said, "Under the friendship and understanding between China and Britain, it is very possible to study and study the treaty without hindering each other... We believe that no one will stubbornly cling to their own opinions." On the 20th, the newspaper republished the Hangzhou Datong Daily's manuscript "Today's Hong Kong Issue" in the original editorial's position, and published a special article entitled "A Record of the Vicissitudes of the Kowloon Walled City."

The China Daily's editorial on the 20th, entitled "The Issue of Establishing a Administration in the Kowloon Walled City," was relatively clear and powerful: the newspaper said, "...Today, when Sino-British relations are harmonious, and after Britain has announced the abandonment of unequal treaties, we still need to be scrupulous about the disputes over

one city and one pool

within unequal treaties. We can only feel ashamed and regretful, and have nothing else to say... We hope that the British authorities will have a broad and long-term vision, and focus on the big picture from a distance. Do not cling to the old and stick to the obsolete because of such small matters, causing displeasure to each other..."

Looking back at the Hong Kong Western newspapers' remarks on this issue, we are really filled with emotions! The overseas Chinese newspapers' remarks are mostly half-hearted, as mentioned above. Some are silent as cicadas in winter, some only "indirectly hint," or reprint the original telegram from the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council requesting the recovery of the territories of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau, or publish Wang Zhuyi, the secretary-general of the Shanghai branch of the China National Diplomacy Association, that conversation regarding the Kowloon Walled City establishment issue; some even did not dare to publish the full text of Guo Dehua's statement to the Hong Kong government, only briefly saying "something was negotiated," fully demonstrating their traitorous faces (Huaqiao Daily)... The Western newspapers' remarks are different. They clearly protect their own country, not only arguing unreasonably but also being sarcastic. The so-called Sino-British alliance has long been thrown to the back of their minds. On the 18th, two Western newspapers, the South China Morning Post and the De Chen Western Newspaper, both wrote articles reviewing the Kowloon Walled City issue. The South China Morning Post categorically stated that "This matter is not new and does not cause stimulation." The newspaper said, "Geographically, economically, and socially, the Kowloon Walled City is part of the Hong Kong colony. Even if Chinese rule is established in the city, it will not benefit China or the local people." The newspaper believes that if the Chinese government insists on this request, it should be "very organized" and suggests that London and Nanjing negotiate directly instead of treating it as a local event. The newspaper refers to this issue as "post-war neurosis" and says "It is a pity to let people who claim to be 'patriots' to mess with it." The De Chen Western Newspaper said: "This deserted city with only a few broken houses left, I believe that anyone can agree that it is not very important to the Chinese government. The treaty has been in place for more than half a century without incident. Now suddenly proposing to take it back, I believe that it will not greatly benefit Sino-British relations, but will cause trouble and disharmony." The newspaper seemed to blame us for not knowing what's good for us: "If China insists that this small matter will cause serious attention, it should submit its opinions through formal channels." — What an attitude!

Not only that, the South China Morning Post's "Bird's-Eye View Column" — a kind of "three words and two words" miscellaneous commentary text — especially fully reveals

a treacherous face

For example, the paragraph on the 19th said: "The Chinese fishing village of Ma Shi Wan was robbed by a group of pirates carrying machine guns and hand grenades. Citizens of Kowloon, please see." There was another paragraph on the 20th that said: "According to the Ta Kung Pao, 'At the beginning of the Pacific War, the Chinese army rushed to rescue Hong Kong day and night', but it has not arrived yet, it is a bit late." If it is said that the South China Morning Post's shouting is not done by a "gentleman," then the nonsense of the De Chen Western Newspaper is simply "rascally"! The De Chen Western Newspaper used the contemptuous word "Hum!" as the title of Wang Zhuyi's conversation. The newspaper also titled the Information Director and spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' conversation on the Hong Kong government's statement with the words "Pui Tsui!" What is the intention? This attitude of the newspaper has aroused great resentment among overseas Chinese compatriots. If the overseas Chinese newspapers used the words "Pui Tsui!" as the title of the Hong Kong government's statement, what would the Hong Kong government do? The De Chen Western Newspaper has repeatedly lost its manners, which shows the true attitude of most British people in Hong Kong towards our country and the Kowloon Walled City issue — the issue of our country recovering lost territory and restoring sovereignty — and how much anger it has aroused in them!

The Kowloon Walled City administration issue has become a problem of current Sino-British relations through various expressions. The Hong Kong and overseas Chinese compatriots are earnestly hoping that our government will make a major decision and immediately begin formal negotiations with the British side to recover Hong Kong and Kowloon and make a total settlement of this century-old problem!

### Shenyang Victory Parade

— Photographed by the Northeast Society

On the 93rd Victory Day, the whole world celebrated, and the whole world sang praises. Two million citizens of Shenyang City, with the most joyous and excited mood, got up early in the morning to sweep the streets, hang up the national flag and party flag, hold meetings and parades. Along the way, every household was decorated with lanterns and colorful banners. The crowds were huge. Dragon lanterns and秧歌 (a folk dance) were performed in the crowds to celebrate peace. The people climbed buildings, trees, leaned on windows, and carried ladders, vying to clap their hands. The grand occasion was unprecedented.

### Opinions on the Monks' Petition

Recently, Zhang Xiaosong, the Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government, proposed to the Municipal Council on behalf of the Civil Affairs Bureau: to allocate temple buildings for the use of autonomous organizations as office space. Because of the phrase "monks like those in the Jade Buddha Temple and Jing'an Temple, who specialize in having mistresses and playing mahjong," it stirred the anger of the monks, who believed it was destroying religion and insulting monks. Therefore, they formed a group to petition, demanding that the Municipal Council revoke the previously passed proposal: "To allocate or borrow temple buildings for the use of autonomous organizations as office space," and demanded that the Municipal Government punish Zhang Xiaosong, while openly publishing in the newspaper, demanding a written apology from Zhang Xiaosong.

After seeing the above actions of the monks, we suddenly felt indignant. Zhang Xiaosong's proposal was to allocate temple buildings for the use of autonomous organizations as office space. It is very obvious here that what can be allocated is of course a part of the temple's spare buildings, not all of the temple's buildings, and even less is it about confiscating the temple's property rights, nor is it related to the monks' own houses. There is no question of destroying religion at all. I dare to assert that the sentence in Zhang Xiaosong's proposal to allocate temple buildings does not contain the meaning of driving out monks. Zhang Xiaosong's intention in the proposal is only to use the temple's surplus vacant houses to supplement the lack of office space for autonomous organizations. Now the Municipal Government stipulates that if there are vacant houses among the people, they must be rented out. Vacant houses among the people are private property. In today's severe housing shortage, the government still wants to force them to be rented out, let alone the vacant houses of temples, most of which are industries created by alms or donations. In today's severe housing shortage, who says it is not appropriate to allocate a part for use as office space for autonomous organizations? When the Municipal Council passed this case, it added the three words "or borrow" under "allocate," which has already prevented boundless Buddhism. Unexpectedly, the monks' petition demands that the entire case be revoked.

In short, Zhang Xiaosong's proposal is for the public, not for personal gain. Now that he has been unreasonably attacked by monks for the location of the autonomous organization's office, we citizens should unite to help him and demand that the authorities set up a "Temple Vacant House Leasing Management Committee" to take charge of this matter. Please see that the whole country is now suffering from a housing shortage, but only the temples' grand buildings are vacant. Renting temple vacant houses as office space for autonomous organizations or local administrative organizations is an absolutely reasonable act, and it is definitely not destroying religion. I advise the monks not to rely on boundless Buddhism, but to be compassionate and convenient, which is what Buddhist disciples should be like. (Guo Yongxi)

### Where Is the Conscience of the Relief Officials!

A reader living in Caoxing Town, District 2 of Shanghai County, a neighboring old woman, begs for a living. On the morning of the 8th of this month, she was notified by the Baojia head to go to the Tangwan Town District Office to receive flour from the Relief Administration of the Executive Yuan. The old woman went to receive it, but when she arrived, the supervisor (the commissioner of the Su-Ning Branch of the Relief Administration of the Executive Yuan) refused to give it to her. After the staff of the District Office proved according to the household register that the old woman was indeed poor and was also included in the roster, the supervisor insisted on getting a certificate from the Baojia head before distributing it. Helpless, the old woman had to return to town, ask the Baojia head for a written certificate, and go again. A sixty-year-old poor woman traveled more than ten miles back and forth, hungry and tired. When she rushed to the District Office, it was already after 5 p.m., and all the distributors had left. When asked the staff of the District Office, they said, "There are still more than eighty bags of flour left, but because the office hours have passed, you voluntarily give up, and there is no more. Because this matter is handled by the Relief Administration, the District Office has no right to advise, and it is completely controlled by the supervisor," etc. I think that the Relief Administration should focus on relief when handling relief work, and should not be limited by time. The supervisor still has a large amount of flour in the district, but he makes things difficult when distributing it, despises relief work, and neglects his responsibility. May I ask where his conscience is? No wonder the common people no longer dare to fantasize about the rosy clouds in the sky! (Wang Jinxiang)

### Eliminate Corruption and Stabilize Prices

Dear Editor: I have a few small opinions that I would like to publish in your newspaper's "Reader's Opinions" column.

(1) The Shanghai Municipal National Identity Card, the newspaper said that the authorities announced the completion of the issuance, why is it that Huangpu District has not yet received it?

(2) The prices of entertainment venues, hotels, and bathhouses in this city have reached an extreme point, far beyond the ability of the common people to bear, and their rise is faster than other goods. It used to be said that the price of rice was expensive as an excuse, but now that the price of rice has fallen, the rising trend is still the same. This kind of acute expansion stimulates general prices. I wonder if the authorities have considered it and restricted it.

(3) To eliminate corruption, we must first stabilize the lives of civil servants. Otherwise, those who cultivate morality and integrity will never enter officialdom, because the salary is not enough to support integrity, how can they work with peace of mind? Corrupt people go deep into important positions, seek personal gain and engage in malpractice, and the phenomenon of "nine out of ten officials are corrupt" should be improved and severely punished, so that corruption is eliminated, society is peaceful, and practical benefits are relied upon. (Sun Shaohou)

### Poor People Cannot Get Relief Flour

Dear Editor: The second batch of relief flour arrived in Tai before the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the Relief Association deliberately delayed the distribution until the Mid-Autumn Festival. The custom in Taixing is that everyone, big and small households, must make steamed buns before the Mid-Autumn Festival to celebrate the festival. This approach really disappointed many people! There is also an unexpected thing. Before the flour was distributed, it was said that each person would only receive two catties. Now the flour is distributed, two large families get one bag, and two small families get half a bag. It is still those with assets who have the special privilege to enjoy it. The orphans and poor people are completely not given any, and the flour list made for the first time has been completely erased. I don't know what the intention is? At that time, many people questioned the Relief Association? According to the person in charge of the association, "This time is the method stipulated by the branch, and it limits the relief population to 4,500 people. It is to relieve refugees and those who cannot live due to the war. I have no right to handle it. In addition, the flour stamps have been issued, and it is inconvenient to withdraw them. We can only wait for the third batch of flour to come to Tai and then reissue them. Now I want to ask you all to forgive me." Such relief is still suffering a group of powerless small people. (Tian)

### Housing Disputes Should Be Postponed

Dear Editor: Since the abolition of the Wartime Housing Lease Law, there have been many housing dispute cases in Shanghai courts, mostly because landlords demanded too much from tenants and used the excuse of taking back the house for their own use, but in fact they rented it to others to achieve their own goals. Therefore, a serious man-made housing shortage has been created. The Legislative Yuan is discussing the Lease Ordinance to protect the safety of people's housing. I hope that the authorities will postpone the judgment on housing dispute cases before the ordinance is promulgated. If it is still based on the pre-war law, then the salaried class will be displaced and it will be even more unbearable. (Jin Mingjing)

### The Withering of Jiangdu

— Chongzhen

Yangzhou News, 12th

It is the Mid-Autumn Festival, the moon in the sky, "Raise your head to look at the bright moon, lower your head to think of your hometown." On this festive occasion, there are fires of war all over northern Jiangsu. How can my heart as a traveler not miss my hometown?

Therefore, I, covered in wind and sand, and with heavy steps, galloped on the Liu-Yang Highway (Liuxu to Yangzhou), and finally returned to my long-separated hometown.

In the car, looking out the window, there were no trees on both sides of the road, a scene of desolation and loneliness. Compared with the previous ten miles of beaded curtains and willows, the elegant and heroic charm of ancient Guangling is really unbearable to feel the changes of the past and present. The memory of "Where does the jade person teach the flute after the bright moon over the Twenty-Four Bridges?" again weighed on my wandering heart. However, today I return, things have changed, "The children of the past have all grown up, and half of the longtime friends have passed away." Lingering in thought, I walked sadly into this ancient city shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere.

The current war situation in northern Jiangsu is in a state that is both tense and peaceful. I had the opportunity to separately visit the military and political leaders in Yangzhou and ask about the situation in northern Jiangsu. I got some clear answers to this "mystery"-like situation.

Meeting with County Magistrate Zhang

On the morning of the 7th, I met with County Magistrate Zhang Jichuan, who was busy planning to settle the more than 50,000 refugees who were constantly fleeing to Yangzhou. He said, "This number already accounts for one-third of the entire city. On average, each Bao has about three Jia, all of whom are refugees who have fled from the Communist areas. This group of refugees will increase the unexpected burden on the people in Yangzhou City. However, the people in Yangzhou are not panicked by this, and prices have not increased because of this. On the contrary, they sympathize with the unfortunate experiences of these refugees and are very able to provide them with enthusiastic assistance. They are now too familiar with the various vicious and cruel methods of the Communist army: regardless of large capital, small capital, or poor people, each person is only allowed to plant three Mu of land; the landlords are ordered to hand over their land deeds; the slogan of 'Everyone eats' incites and calls on local thugs to preside over the struggle—these make them feel particularly warm living under the protection of the National Army."

The current situation is that the Communist army cannot threaten Yangzhou. The city defense is extremely strict, and the defense of the four suburbs is solid. From Daiqiao in the east (50 Li from the city), to Lidianzhen in the south (30 Li from the city), to Dayi in the west (60 Li from the city), to Sanlidian in the north (27 Li from the city), all are under the control of the National Army and the county self-defense forces. Therefore, the people of Yangzhou are living in unusual peace.

Regarding the roads, most of them have been repaired. The Yang-Tai Highway (Yangzhou to Taizhou) and the Yang-Yi Highway (Yangzhou to Yizheng) are both open. The Yang-Tian Highway (Yangzhou to Tianchang) has been opened to Dayi. However, the worst road is from Liuxu to Yangzhou, which is uneven and dangerous for cars to travel on. It is currently being actively repaired by Zhenyang Company and others, and is expected to be completed in about a month. In terms of education, the number of schools has increased compared to before the war. There are two provincial middle schools, one county middle school, and eight private schools. There are about 20 primary schools. Therefore, there are fewer students out of school, and education is not a problem.

The Slender West Lake in the scenic area was haggard during the period of its fall. Originally, a scenic area renovation committee was organized to prepare for the renovation, but due to funding and the current situation, it had to be put on hold indefinitely.

Recent Situation in Northern Jiangsu

Speaking of this, I hurriedly said goodbye to County Magistrate Zhang. I learned that in early August, Commissioner Lin, Deputy Commander Wu (now transferred to Taixing County Magistrate), and others spent two weeks inspecting Huangqiao, Jiangyan, Rugao, Hai'an, and other places.

I managed to find the private residence of Inspector Liu of the Commissioner's Office, who had had some friendship with me, hoping to hear some details about the inspection. The young man's emotions made him speak eloquently about many valuable materials.

In the past two months, the situation in northern Jiangsu has once been severe. Fortunately, the National Army responded calmly, and it has temporarily become peaceful. Since the Communist army's fierce attack on Taixing failed, their ambition has not died, and they are waiting for an opportunity to move. When the eastern line of Huangqiao, Jiangyan, Rugao, and Hai'an were all recovered by the National Army, the National Army, in order to avoid the expansion of the flames of civil war, did not take advantage of the victory to pursue along the Fandi. Unexpectedly, the Communist army took this opportunity to counterattack again, causing Huangqiao to fall again and Rugao to be in danger. The Communist army deliberately launched a civil war and destroyed peace, which has once again been strongly proven here.

The National Army has always been in a defensive position and never acts rashly, violating the agreement. It only takes self-defense when it is absolutely necessary. Therefore, in the course of troop movements and defenses, it often encounters unexpected attacks by the Communist army, forcing the National Army to helplessly retaliate and painfully retaliate. As a result, the people are left in panic and confusion. If the area is occupied by the Communist army again, the suffering of the people is beyond description by ink. No matter what means the Communist army uses to publicize and deceive the people, it will eventually lose the hearts of the people due to the proof of facts. Therefore, when the National Army is ordered to be stationed elsewhere, the local people cry bitterly, try their best to keep them, and finally only disappointedly welcome them in the street until the shadow of the National Army's ranks is no longer visible. Every common person then goes home disappointed.

Therefore, the common people have a hope for the National Army, "Once you come, don't leave"—because the Communist army will definitely know after the National Army is stationed in a place. As soon as the National Army leaves, the Communist army will immediately come and harass and loot everything. "Come quickly after leaving," the people still hope that the National Army will come again soon. The criticism of the common people is always so powerfully expressed.

In fact, the Communist army's gamble in northern Jiangsu this time was to try to occupy the entire northern Jiangsu and threaten Beijing and Shanghai. The National Army is only in a passive position and is unwilling to actively attack. In terms of troop morale and combat effectiveness, it is really unimaginable for the Communist army. Whenever a company or a platoon of the National Army is stationed in a bunker, the Communist army always wants to solve the National Army with a regiment or a battalion of troops, but in the end it is difficult to succeed. The National Army is not proud of this, and still sticks to its position and performs its task and mission.

Various Problems

Recently, in the counties and towns recovered by the National Army, the economy has been greatly affected because the Communist army has been entrenched for a long time and because it has issued counterfeit currency. It is hoped that the government can establish banks as soon as possible to properly handle this matter. In terms of land, under the control of the Communist army, there has been arbitrary division and the land ownership is extremely chaotic. Many original owners are demanding to take it back. It is hoped that the National Army will severely punish those thugs who helped the Communist army to ravage the people and fish in troubled waters, and on the other hand, request a fair way to rectify the land ownership problem.

In terms of population, because the Communist army cannot recruit soldiers and it is not easy to replenish them, they try their best to conscript able-bodied men in the liberated areas. Men aged 18 to 45 are forced to join the army. After a very short period of training, they are sent to the front line to fight the National Army. As a result, all of them are sacrificed in vain as their cannon fodder. The conscription of young women is also difficult to avoid. Therefore, the local population has been greatly reduced, and what is left are the old and weak. Many fields are unattended, and the food harvest has become a major problem. This is the greatest favor given by the Communist army in northern Jiangsu.

Finally, he told me that currently there is not a single Communist soldier in the entire northern Jiangsu, except for two counties: Yangzhou and Jiangpu.

Inspector Liu's words came to an end. Because I was going to the wounded soldiers' hospital to take a look, I shook hands with him tightly and said goodbye.

The Platoon Leader's Accusation

I visited the three wounded soldiers' hospitals one by one. Every time I went to a hospital, I was accompanied by those white-clothed angels. From their painful conversation, I learned that the weapons used by the Communist army were mostly those of the enemy. In particular, a seriously wounded platoon leader with four bullets in his body told me like an accusation that in the Battle of Shaobo, the Communist army's artillerymen and heavy weapons shooters were all enemy captives. The first-line troops all used Japanese prisoners and young people around 18 to 20 years old. Their core personnel all stayed in the rear and would never sacrifice them easily, letting those innocent young people die. "I always thought that the War of Resistance was over and I could return to my hometown in triumph. Who would have thought that the Communist Party would launch a civil war? Isn't my injury caused by the Communist Party? I don't want a civil war, but there is no way. If I don't defend myself, the Communist army will take my life. They destroyed the happiness of my family and destroyed the peace of the country. I swear to fight the Communist army to the end." I was infinitely moved by his passionate words and immediately went to comfort him and persuade him to take good care of his wounds.

35 Communist Captives

In one hospital, there were 35 wounded captives, led by Dr. Wang of the Second Convalescent Hospital of the Field Hospital. I entered their ward. The faces of those 35 Communist prisoners were "young, strong, and good people." I sympathized with their situation and was emotionally driven to ask them about their past lives with great concern. A brief account is given below: Zhou Chuanhong—Political Instructor of a company in the New Fourth Army, from Yangzhou, 25 years old, elementary school graduate, family of five, farmer. In April of the 34th year, he was tricked into joining the Communist army. He first served as the captain of the local guard (i.e., the militia). After the victory, the Communist army claimed that the enemy refused to surrender, so they tricked him into the front line and served as an instructor. This time, he was captured in Xiaosizhuang (eastern Yangzhou) due to injuries.

Chu Qing—Soldier of the New Fourth Army, from Hefei, 22 years old, knowledge level is acceptable, family is well-off, has 120 mu of land, all of which was struggled away by the Communist army, leaving only 15 mu (5 people, 3 mu per person). Therefore, in June of the 34th year, he was forced to join the army. At that time, the name of conscription was to fight the Japanese, but who knew that after three months of training, he would kill each other with the National Army. He knew that he had been deceived and could not escape. This time, he was injured in Tianchang and captured by the National Army. He was very happy and could see the light of day again.

Yang Jingen—Soldier of the New Fourth Army, from Zhenjiang, 17 years old, born into a farming family. In August of the 34th year, he was forcibly transferred from Jiangnan by the Communist army to serve as a soldier. The excuse was to go to Jiangbei to take over and accept surrender. Who knew that the Communist army was deceiving him? Now he is injured in the civil war with the National Army in the Battle of Shaobo. He is very painful and wants to return to his hometown in Jiangnan.

Most of the other 32 captives were from farming families. The fields in their homes were struggled away by the Communist army before they were forced to join the New Fourth Army. An hour later, with sympathetic eyes, I said goodbye to the 35 wounded Communist prisoners. After leaving the hospital, my heart was beating incessantly, feeling sorry for those who had encountered unfortunate fates.

Yangzhou's Chaotic Fee Collection

The next day at noon, I was preparing to return to Shanghai. A relative invited me to dinner, inviting me repeatedly, making it impossible for me to refuse. During the meal, a stranger brought news that shocked the city of Yangzhou: in addition to tuition fees, Yangzhou Provincial Middle School also charged teachers a living subsidy of 18,000 yuan per student. I was very surprised to hear this, so much so that I couldn't believe it. After the meal, I happened to see the text of a letter from the parents of students at Yangzhou Provincial Middle School to people from all walks of life in the Jiangdu Daily, confirming that what the guest said was true. Suddenly, my mind was constantly thinking about why Yangzhou Provincial Middle School did this. After thinking about it, I couldn't figure it out. I still suspected that with 1,200 students in the entire school of Yangzhou Provincial Middle School, this huge sum of nearly 20 million yuan was originally justified to provide for the teachers' lack of living expenses. However, the teachers and staff of the provincial middle school are all listed as civil servants, with fixed salaries from the government. Moreover, the Ministry of Education has also issued instructions to all schools to strictly abide by the regulations and not to arbitrarily violate them and forcibly collect teacher living subsidies. We can't help but feel extremely sorry for this rash move by Yangzhou Provincial Middle School. Respecting teachers is the behavior that students should have, but if students do not come from the heart, and teachers themselves initiate respect for teachers, isn't this a perverted form of respect for teachers? I stayed in my hometown for two days and was deeply impressed. The above is only one or two of the records, just to express my feelings for the withering state of Jiangdu.

Legal Questions

(1) Debt Treatment

Qu Shiyin asks: I borrowed 20,000 yuan in jewelry from a relative in 1929. I made a loan note, stating that the interest rate would start at 2%, and there was also a piece of farmland as collateral. But to this day, I have not received a penny of principal or interest. Although I have repeatedly asked for it, it has been unsuccessful. (1) Is this loan note still valid after 19 years? (2) If a pre-war debt is repaid after the war, should it be repaid in the original amount, or are there other methods? (3) Is it legal to calculate it in terms of rice price or 1,200 times in the countryside? (4) If he is unable to repay, is it legal to sell the male list as collateral?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's answer] (1) According to Article 880 of the Civil Code, the right to claim a debt secured by a mortgage has been extinguished due to the statute of limitations (refer to Article 125 of the Civil Code, the right to claim is extinguished if it is not exercised for 15 years). If the mortgagee does not exercise his mortgage right within 5 years after the statute of limitations is completed, his mortgage right is extinguished; (2) Refer to Article 12 of the Supplementary Example for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery; (3) According to Article 878 of the Civil Code, the mortgagor may enter into a contract to obtain ownership of the mortgaged property in order to receive repayment after the maturity date of the debt.

(2) Cancellation of Marriage Contract

Yan Yangji asks: My friend Mr. Zhang is 21 years old this year (not of actual age). Three years ago, his parents made the decision and hired a matchmaker to arrange a marriage contract with Miss Chen. At that time, Mr. Zhang was forced by his mother to go to the woman's house for a blind date, and afterwards he said that it was okay or not. Since then, Miss Chen has often gone to Mr. Zhang's house, but Mr. Zhang himself is doing business outside and has never had a romantic relationship, nor has he ever said a word. Recently, Mr. Zhang has another lover and wants to cancel the marriage contract. The Chen family is demanding compensation for losses. Please ask (1) Mr. Zhang's marriage contract with Miss Chen is legally valid? (2) Is a marriage contract made by parents when they are 18 years old legally recognized? (3) Is Miss Chen's demand for compensation justified? (4) What kind of procedure should be taken for this kind of cancellation to be the most appropriate?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's answer] (1) The marriage contract is invalid; (2) It cannot be considered valid if consent is not expressed after adulthood; (3) Damages may be claimed; (4) Resolving the conflict through reconciliation is a better solution. Otherwise, there is only the verdict of the Yangzhou Court.

(3) Inheritance of Estate

Huang Xuan asks: I have been married for six years, and I am poor and unemployed. My father-in-law is deceased, and my mother-in-law has considerable assets. But she regards money as her life. Please ask (1) Does my wife have the right to open her mouth to share? (2) Must we wait until after my mother-in-law's death? (3) If it can be shared now, what are the procedures? What is the amount? (Her adopted son has already been divided into 200 mu, and my wife is her adopted daughter)

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's answer] If your mother-in-law is willing to distribute the property, she can do so by giving it away during her lifetime. Otherwise, your wife can only wait for her death and claim her inheritance as an adopted daughter.

### Another New Posture for Transportation Services: Bicycle Owners Can Avoid Theft Concerns

Setting up stations for management in various public places, with a small fee and responsibility for compensation

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai General Bicycle Parking Management Office, after half a year of preparation, was approved for operation last month by the Municipal Public Works Bureau. The bureau has designated 32 locations throughout the city, including parks, amusement grounds, large buildings, and public places, each to be equipped with one or two bicycle racks and wooden signs for identification. Each station will have one to two attendants wearing armbands. When bicycle owners park their bicycles, they will be issued a numbered parking ticket, and the fee is 300 yuan per visit, doubled for stays exceeding three hours. If bicycles are stolen or damaged during the parking period, the office will investigate the facts and be responsible for compensation. Yang Ziqiang, the promoter of the Shanghai General Management Office, is known for his enthusiasm in serving the transportation industry. Since the commencement of this service, bicycle owners can park their bicycles safely, with someone responsible, avoiding concerns about theft and lack of parking space. It is reported that when the office began its service earlier this month, a certain theater organized a crowd to cause trouble, destroying bicycle racks to obstruct its business. Subsequently, a request was submitted to the Public Works Bureau for investigation. Yesterday, a reply was received stating: "Both reports are acknowledged. In addition to forwarding the situation to the Police Bureau for comprehensive protection, and separately instructing theaters not to obstruct the operation, you are authorized to request assistance from the relevant police sub-bureaus at any time for protection. Please be informed, this is the reply." It is expected that this matter will proceed smoothly in the future, serving the city's transportation.

After Wang Lingji returned to the province, on the evening of the 18th and the morning of the 19th, he separately summoned the Deputy Commander of the Provincial Security and the Chief of the Municipal Police Bureau to inquire about the conflict between the security team soldiers and the police on the Mid-Autumn Festival evening. He strictly ordered an investigation into the perpetrators to uphold the law. Regarding the rash incident caused by the misunderstanding between Hu Jingan, Director of Education of the Provincial Cadre Training Corps, and Tang Xin, Mayor of Nanchang, due to the conflict between the security police, he also used an extremely impartial attitude to persuade Hu and Tang not to harbor resentment, hoping to appeal to the reporters' corps on this matter. The reporter replied: "Hu Jingan is a brave warrior who often performs on the streets, which is quite pitiful. Tang Xin is a humble scholar who lets insults pass, and his courtesy is admirable, each with their own strengths."

Before the war, there were about 13,200 shops in Nanchang. Current statistics show only 3,500. The most ornate shops are the silver and gold shops. At night, the dazzling neon lights indicate gold shops. The businesses doing best are cloth and timber. It is reported that timber has risen from 40,000 to over 60,000 yuan per load. Once Nanchang undertakes a large-scale reconstruction project, repairing 10,000 city houses, Jiangxi timber will be in short supply.

### Sights and Sounds of Nanchang

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Fang Canglang

The Jiangxi Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (RRA) has established eight refugee shelters in Nanchang, housing a total of 2,163 refugees. Among them, the elderly, weak, women, and children are unable to earn a living, and many are crying out in hunger and cold. After three visits to the refugee camps, reporters from Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hankou suggested to the Jiangxi Branch of the RRA that it provide relief, which has been adopted.

The Jiangxi Provincial Government has dispatched troops to suppress the clan fights in various townships of Fenyi County. It is reported that this trend is very prevalent in the province. Recently, it has been reported that several large households in Nanchang County are vying for seats in the county council and are brewing clan fights. The authorities are currently mediating.

On the 18th, the 34th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Assembly, after listening to the report by Dean Xiao of the Agricultural College, Chairman Wang Zhenxin suggested: (1) Select mountainous counties to promote early rice varieties such as "Nante No. 1" and "Poyang Early" to enrich the people's food supply; (2) Restore Yongxiu Cotton Field and improve cotton seeds to enrich the people's clothing; (3) Veterinary specialists should be trained in serum production to prevent animal epidemics.

The salaries of Jiangxi provincial civil servants have been adjusted since August, according to a central government order, in line with central government standards. However, the Ministry of Finance has only approved a 90% loan for the 490 million yuan difference in the adjusted salaries in Jiangxi province, and it has not yet been allocated, so civil servants are mostly full of worry.

Nanchang is the source of the New Life Movement. Opium and drugs will be eradicated, prostitution has long been eliminated, and gambling is not prevalent. However, the order in entertainment venues after the war is still chaotic, and there are open disturbances, causing the authorities considerable headaches.

On the evening of the 19th, the Nanchang Municipal Council and other twelve units hosted a banquet for the reporters' corps from Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hankou, as well as the American municipal expert Pei Te, the section chief of the Ministry of Interior Shen Erpeng, and the UNRRA representative in Jiangxi Duncan. It is heard that Nanchang's model city is certain to be realized. (Dispatch from Nanchang on the 19th)

### Northeastern Anhui Under Floods

(Middle) Only half of the city wall of Huaiyuan City is visible above the water. (Bottom) Houses near Wuhe County have become ornaments in the flooded land. [Photos by: Central News Agency]

This time, the heavy floods in northern Anhui also affected Bengbu. The floods in the suburbs were particularly severe. The Bengbu Municipal Office, to understand the actual situation of the disaster in the city, has investigated for several days. The results show that 194,298 acres of farmland have been flooded, 6,535 houses have been destroyed, property losses amount to 483,344,750 yuan, 8,552 households have been affected, 36,416 people have been affected, and grain losses amount to approximately 184,299 shi (unit of dry measure). 13,075 acres of farmland have been affected by locust plagues, 2,825 households have been affected, grain losses due to locusts amount to approximately 130.75 shi, 210,800 jin (unit of weight) of locusts have been captured, and 1,929 people have died due to epidemics.

### How Can China Industrialize?

— Translated by Deng Shaoqiu

An Outline of a Post-War Five-Year Plan

Last August, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Office of Foreign Economic Affairs, Engineering Division, published a document titled "Guide to China's Industrialization—Basic Elements of a Post-War Five-Year Plan." A sequel was published in October, and this June, an abridged version was compiled from the general design of the two documents. This translation is provided as a reference for studying and caring about China's industrial construction and recovery. Translator: Shaoqiu.

(1) The Purpose of China's Industrialization

China has 450 million people, representing one-fifth of the world's population, but China is not a country composed of numerous cities; rather, it is based on villages and farmland, on which 85% of the people depend for their livelihood. Therefore, how can China, today's China, become an industrialized country in a few decades, and at what speed? These are fundamental questions. American industrialization took a century of effort to succeed, so this guide aims to provide encouragement and assistance, giving China a basic element of a five-year preliminary plan in its perplexed path of industrialization.

Ideally, if this guide is adopted by China in a broad industrial construction program, the benefits to China can be summarized as follows:

(1) It can complete the initial infrastructure of industrialization, preparing for the second step of perfect and balanced development in the future.

(2) It can transform manpower into productive use, and develop operational skills and various production techniques.

(3) Agricultural and mineral resources can be fully utilized.

(4) National income can be universally increased after the standard of living is improved, and production can be exponentially increased.

(5) Increased production can promote international trade on the one hand, and repay loans on the other.

(6) Government revenue can be increased, and the government's political and economic institutions can be strengthened.

(2) The Plan for China's Industrialization

In fact, China's industrialization began before the Sino-Japanese War. At that time, China had several well-established steel mills, chemical plants, and cement factories. But what achievements have been made in the past eight years? The key problem is the lack of a most practical and effective planning method to cope with the expanding development of Chinese industry. So how should China industrialize now? It should have an orderly and efficient plan:

(1) Establish industrial centers in mainland China.

(2) Expand export trade.

(3) Transform pre-war damage and existing industrial plans to peacetime industry.

(4) Develop water conservancy and hydropower projects, modeled after the Tennessee Valley Authority water conservancy project in the Soviet Union.

Among these four planning steps, the first item is the greatest need in China's development of an industrial economy, which is to establish many basic industries as the foundation for large-scale industrialization. However, the plan for this establishment and development must rely on more detailed surveys of China's resources and conditions. As for the plan to expand export trade, it largely involves broad international trade issues, so it can be regarded as an economic problem rather than an engineering problem. The issue of transforming pre-war damage and existing industries also requires a full report on the status and nature of various industries before it can be addressed and specifically analyzed. As for the future development of water conservancy and hydropower projects, it is extremely important and requires years of regional research, design, and construction. However, preliminary research on this aspect has been conducted by Dr. Savage, Chief Designing Engineer of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, who was commissioned by the U.S. State Department to inspect China and design TVA-type Yangtze River dams and other water conservancy projects.

(3) Steps for China's Industrialization

(1) Select several industries that are necessary for the material life of the Chinese people and develop them, then develop natural resources and use them as a foundation—seeds. The results of the development of these many seeds will provide basic tools, materials, and parts to help future industrial development.

(2) Determine the size of the factories according to the needs and the economic production units of work capacity. But industrial development must be balanced—that is, the size and type of factories must also be suitable and uniform—so that various industries can be protected and mutually supported and assisted.

(3) The improvement and expansion of transportation tools, because raw materials, fuels, electricity, water power, transportation, labor, etc., can determine the development of industry, distribution, and even the future.

(4) Training of skilled workers, technicians, and management talents, because China lacks technicians, and conversely, most people need work and training.

(5) As a part of industrial design, industrial occurrence must combine highly mechanized operations with low-level mechanized work suitable for early industrial development.

(4) The Financial Resources Required for China's Industrialization

The financial resources required for this plan are shown in the table below: Amounts are in thousands of U.S. dollars.

Appendix: Financial Resources Required for Transportation Industry Construction
Railways (Improvement and expansion of various railway systems): Requires 503,750
Highways (All-weather roads): Requires 165,400
Automobiles (Commercial truck fleets and shops): Requires 223,480
River Transportation (Improvement of water transportation): Requires 406,300
Other: Requires 45,000
Subtotal: 1,348,930
Total: 3,027,603

(Explanation) The estimated construction costs of factories in the above table refer to building construction and equipment installation, while other items such as property records and operating capital are not included.

Also, the "Other Expenses" in the above table include the cost of preliminary mechanical engineering, $15 million USD, and the cost of purchasing hydropower construction equipment for profit, $30 million USD.

Also, the electricity industry and power generation industry in the above table are calculated based on 1.2 million kilowatts of electricity required for industrial construction (of which 470,000 kilowatts of electricity include thousands of miles of transmission lines for factory construction).

In the above two tables, the transportation industry only considers railways, highways, and waterways as the most standard and accurate. River transportation is only an approximate number because there is insufficient material and no figures could be listed. Although air transport is also extremely important, it is not estimated and included because the possible extent of China's air transport development is still difficult to determine.

(5) The Labor Required for China's Industrialization

(A) Industry

(Thousands of USD)
Chemical Industry: 119.850
Manufacturing Industry: 42.640
Electric Power Industry: 99.420
Textile Industry: 84.300
Food Production: 267.400
Other: 1.000
Subtotal: 756.710

(B) Transportation
Railways: 82.300
Highways: 500
Automobiles: 193.130
River Transportation: 100
Subtotal: 276.030
Total: 1032.740

(Note) The estimated number of employees in the above Tables 1 and 2 is limited to direct production and supervisory personnel. Other management and sales personnel are not included due to the different factory workplaces and internal organizations. The so-called food production processing and distribution in Table 1 includes 400,000 people engaged in fishing.

Everyone says that the prerequisite for China's industrialization is a high degree of demand. The Chinese people must be consumers of Chinese goods. The Chinese people's demand for cotton clothing, fragrant soap, and other manufactured products is already considerable. In addition, the urgency of demand for luxury goods in recent years can lay a cornerstone for China's future industrialization.

In my opinion, if China's industry wants to be sound, then its biggest problem is whether to do it or not.

### An Overview of Industrial and Commercial Management

— Xu Baiyi

Manufacturing and Cost

——Fifth of the Problems of Production Organizations——

In ordinary factories, not much attention is paid to cost accounting. Even in some factories, even if a cost accounting department is set up, people who are engaged in manufacturing work seem to think it is superfluous. Some people think that it is more cost-effective to spend manpower or time on production work rather than on cost accounting. This view is of course wrong. In fact, because these people often come from small-scale workshops, they cannot understand the value of cost accounting.

In fact, if cost accounting is used as a kind of record and has a historical nature, then cost accounting will not have any great use. In fact, the use of cost accounting can be divided into the following points:

A. Cost accounting can point us to a profitable path. If a factory only manufactures one kind of goods, it is much simpler, because there are only two paths, one is to continue production, and the other is to stop work. But in general, factories often manufacture more than one kind of goods. Then, we need to know which kind of goods has the highest profit? Can we increase the production of the most profitable goods and reduce the production of the less profitable goods? After such a change, we can get more profits. To find out which kind of goods has a higher profit in the end, we need to use cost accounting to calculate the cost.

B. When market prices are unstable, when market prices are unstable, we will be affected by market prices. If it rises, then how much does it rise? If it falls, then how much does it fall? The prices of our manufactured products will also rise and fall, and raw materials will also rise and fall with them. In recent years, sometimes the market price of manufactured products has been rising day by day, but the price of raw materials has not moved. Sometimes the price of raw materials has skyrocketed, but the price of manufactured products has not changed. The former situation is related to power restrictions, high rice prices, and the impact on wages. The latter is related to the weak purchasing power of the public. When market prices rise and fall, we need to calculate the cost to see if we can still get a profit from the goods we manufacture. If we let market prices rise and fall without any budget, then we will lose money and not know why. This should absolutely not happen in business management.

C. Looking forward to the future, if a factory wants to develop in the future, it must have a clear understanding of everything at present. Only by knowing the current costs and everything else can we look forward to the future. Taking cost accounting as an example, if we know the current costs, we can estimate how we should deal with it if the future costs increase by 20% or 30%. If it is to increase by one or two times, then how should we deal with it? This kind of future planning must be based on current cost accounting.

D. Clearly distinguish the responsibilities of each department; if a factory manufactures one kind of goods, then things are relatively simple, and the need for cost accounting is not as urgent as in a factory that manufactures many kinds of goods. But in a factory that manufactures many kinds of goods, we need to use cost accounting to calculate the cost of manufacturing goods in each department, so that the responsibilities of each department are clearly defined. Although this is not a law for internal enterprises, it is at least a very useful participation. For example, if the manufacturing cost of a certain department in the previous month was 100 yuan per piece, and suddenly increased to 200 yuan in the current month, then the responsible department must study the reason for the increase and see if the reason is sufficient. At the same time, we can also look forward to the future situation based on the records of the past few months.

E. When market competition is fierce. In the industrial and commercial world, competition among peers is always present, but sometimes the competition is particularly fierce. For example, the goods of two manufacturers have a place in the market, and therefore there are restrictions on the sales price and they cannot be increased freely. Then the only thing we can think about is reducing costs. To reduce costs, the first step is to implement cost accounting. Also, if several factories are going to participate in a tender of an agency at the same time, then we must have an accurate calculation of the cost.

Spring and Autumn

### The First Pass Under Heaven

— Xie Bingying

Thank goodness, I was fortunate enough to have clear weather on my second day at Shanhaiguan.

After breakfast, I first went to the train station to inquire about news. I learned that the train to Shenyang was still not running, but Station Master Xu kindly comforted me, saying:

"A freight train will be sent out today to test the tracks. If repairs are completed in time, perhaps passenger service can resume tomorrow."

"No passenger trains?"

"No, because we fear another derailment, resulting in the unjust sacrifice of many lives." Since I couldn't leave, I decided to enjoy a day in Shanhaiguan.

Shanhaiguan is a small market town with a circumference of less than five *li*, belonging to Linyu County. The marketplace presents a simple appearance. Some streets inside the city are so narrow that only one car can pass, while others are twenty to thirty *zhang* wide. The shops are mostly single-story buildings, with only a few two- or three-story buildings that still retain a rustic feel.

People walk leisurely on the streets, not as hurried and rushed as people in large cities. The reason is simple: there are no cars speeding around, nor horse-drawn carriages or rickshaws. The only modes of transportation are rickshaws and donkeys.

The imported goods stores have almost everything one needs for daily life, but most of them are from ten years ago. Glassware has not yet arrived. Little girls still wear red pants and green short shirts, riding on donkey's backs, passing through the streets, attracting the gaze of foreign tourists. Everyone feels a sense of novelty. Shanhaiguan's customs still remain in the eighteenth century, quaint and charming.

Not long after leaving the east gate, one can see from afar the five large characters "The First Pass Under Heaven." Below the characters is a portrait of Chairman Chiang, drawn too fat, making people want to laugh.

Embracing this gate tower is the famous Great Wall of China. Climbing onto the city wall, the winding and twisting Great Wall, like a giant python stretching to the horizon, is truly magnificent! Recalling Emperor Qin Shi Huang's efforts to consolidate his dynastic throne, sacrificing the lives and property of the entire nation to build the "Ten Thousand Li Great Wall," I heard many people talking about the story of Meng Jiangnü weeping at the Great Wall. Some even wanted to visit the Meng Jiangnü Temple outside the city. A middle-aged man said with emotion:

"It's a pity we don't know where Meng Jiangnü cried. Why not erect a monument to commemorate her?"

They only knew the folk tale of Meng Jiangnü weeping at the Great Wall and insisted that it happened near Shanhaiguan. Therefore, a Meng Jiangnü Temple was built more than ten *li* outside the city, which is still very popular. People seeking children and wealth go in groups to burn incense and worship during the New Year and festivals, but recently, due to the current situation, few people dare to risk it.

Standing on the highest watchtower, looking into the distance at the undulating mountains, what a strategically important place! To the south of the pass is the boundless Bohai Sea, with surging waves resembling thousands of soldiers and horses in motion. To the north is the precipitous Mount Jiaoshan. Looking closely, it seems that every mountain and every large rock has the form of crouching tigers and coiled dragons. The overlapping mountains serve as a screen for Shanhaiguan, like rows and columns of troops standing on the hills. Such a strategically important place is no wonder it has been a battleground for strategists throughout history. Although the inscription "The First Pass Under Heaven" exists in many places, this is truly the first pass, and its terrain does indeed have the danger of "one man guarding the pass, ten thousand cannot break through."

A cool breeze blew in gusts, and the vastness around me reminded me of an ancient story.

Those who have lived in Wuhan know that there is a road in Wuchang called Xiong Tingbi Road, but few know that he was a famous general of the Ming Dynasty. When he was the Liaodong Pacification Commissioner in Shanhaiguan, his defenses were tight, and the Qing army could not succeed in several attacks. Later, the emperor dismissed Xiong Tingbi after listening to slander from petty people. Soon after, Wu Sangui was ordered to guard Shanhaiguan. Li Zicheng captured Beijing, and Emperor Chongzhen of the Ming Dynasty hanged himself on a tree on Coal Hill (now Jingshan Park). Wu Sangui's father was also arrested by Li Zicheng, who wanted him to persuade Wu Sangui to surrender. When his father sent someone to deliver a message to him, he said, "It doesn't matter, I will go and release my father." But he remained idle. Then someone came to report, "The entire family of the Master has been confiscated." Wu Sangui replied calmly, "It doesn't matter, I will go and he will return them." He still remained idle. Finally, someone came to report, "Chen Yuanyuan has been captured!" At this moment, Wu Sangui was enraged, slammed the table, and shouted:

"If I don't avenge this, how can I be a man!" So he immediately sent out troops, nominally to suppress the rebels, but in reality, he surrendered to the Manchus and welcomed the Qing army into the pass. Most laughably, Wu Sangui wrote in a letter to his father such phrases as: "Father is unfaithful, son is unfilial."

A soldier like this, not anxious when the emperor hanged himself, his father was captured, and his entire family was confiscated, but so obsessed, so protective, and so concerned about a prostitute, a soldier who betrayed the country's sovereignty and sold out the entire nation for a woman, what punishment should he receive under the law of the nation? It goes without saying. Therefore, the famous poet Wu Meicun satirized Wu Sangui in "Ballad of Yuanyuan":

When the emperor (referring to Chongzhen) abandoned the world, he repelled the enemy and recovered the capital below the Jade Gate (referring to Shanhaiguan), the six armies wept in white, and in a rage he defended her beauty. Even today, reading it still evokes lingering resentment.

There are several theories about the origin of the five characters "The First Pass Under Heaven." Initially, it was from the hand of Yan Song, the Grand Secretary of the Ming Dynasty, but because he was a bad traitorous minister, the plaque he wrote was hidden away. The one hanging now is from the hand of Xiao Xian, a famous calligrapher and writer of the Ming Dynasty. Some say that his tomb is at the foot of Mount Jiaoshan.

There is a very interesting story about the origin of the inscription "The First Pass Under Heaven" here:

The character "One" looks very simple, but it is not easy to write, especially when it is between the long "Di" character and the square "Guan" character. It is not easy to make the weight match evenly. (See picture)

It is said that one day, outside a small restaurant, a poor man who looked like a beggar came and asked the old owner of the restaurant for food. The old owner saw that he had delicate features, looked like a scholar, not a beggar, so he let him stay in the shop and provided him with food and lodging unconditionally every day. After staying for several days, this extraordinary beggar used a large piece of paper to write a "One" character three feet long and wide and gave it to the old owner, saying:

"This is my gift in return for your kindness. Keep it well, and it will be of great use one day."

After saying that, the poor man suddenly disappeared. Later, Emperor Kangxi went to the pass on an inspection tour and saw the strategic importance of this place, so he praised:

"What a strategically important place with mountains and the sea! It is truly the first pass under heaven."

Therefore, he immediately ordered his ministers to write a plaque with the words "The First Pass Under Heaven," but no matter who wrote it, the four characters "Tian, Xia, Di, Guan" were well written, only this "One" character could never be matched well, either the stroke was too long or too short, too thick or too thin. So the emperor issued another edict that whoever could match this "One" character would be rewarded with a certain amount of silver. At this time, the old owner of the restaurant hurriedly presented the "One" character that the beggar had given him. When he tried it with the other four characters, it was indeed very suitable. He immediately received a great reward, so he became rich and no longer ran a restaurant.

Although this is a mythical legend, everyone who has lived in Shanhaiguan for more than forty years knows this story, especially the old man who took my picture, who told it with relish and vividness.

After strolling on the city wall for a long time, I returned along the original route. Suddenly, I saw a fallen stone tablet with the four characters "Loyal, Brave, Righteous, and Valiant" engraved on it. Next to it was a line of smaller characters: "Site where former Police Chief Hanzawa Yoshitomo died in battle." I knew that this place had been through countless bloody battles, killing many enemies and sacrificing the flesh and blood of many of our brothers. Someone had written the two characters "Wang Ba" (turtle, a derogatory term) next to "Yoshitomo," and everyone who saw it felt relieved. I don't know what kind of mentality this is, I can only call it the psychological victory of "Ah Q."

### Freedom and Shackles

— Shusun Ruying

Since the French Revolution, the word freedom has been shouted loudly. In the realm of art, freedom is also regarded as a treasure and is worshiped by artists. Freedom of artistic creation, whether in content or form, is equally important. Any suppression, restriction, or constraint on artistic forms is a shackle on artistic creation and cannot be accepted by artists.

In order to advocate freedom, shackles have been smashed. The "Three Unities," "Naturalism," and all the rules that restrict the thoughts and methods of expression of writers have been overthrown and discarded for this reason. When creators push open the boundaries of theory and move towards newer fields, it is the progress of art. And this progress is the victory of freedom and the victory of artists.

In fact, today's shackles were not shackles at the beginning. They did not hinder freedom, or even helped freedom. When Classicism was flourishing, the "Three Unities" gave Roman writers great help and guidance, but when the times advanced and the rules of Classicism could not be updated and changed, it became a shackle that hindered the development of art, and it was finally pushed down from its revered throne and shattered to pieces.

Even Romanticism, which highly advocated freedom, eventually became a shackle and was replaced by Realism. After the Industrial Revolution, science became increasingly developed, and Romanticism, which advocated passion and the development of individuality, could no longer be worshiped, and gradually declined.

In short, artistic freedom often varies with the evolution of the times. The artistic freedom of one era is often very different from the artistic freedom of another era. Similarly, the shackles that restrict the development of art also change frequently. It also changes with the progress of the times. Shackles are not always shackles, and freedom is not always freedom, but it depends on whether the content of art theory is in line with the spirit of the times.

Artworks have various styles due to different materials, creation methods, etc. Artworks are produced by materials and creation methods, but at the same time, they are also limited by materials and creation methods. This limitation, in the eyes of writers, is sometimes considered a shackle, causing them to lose their freedom. The struggle against this limitation will have two results: (1) seeking new creation methods or new materials, and becoming another type of art; (2) wanting to break through the limitation, but finally being confined to the limitation, causing the unity of art to suffer losses, affecting the value of the work.

Here, the meaning of freedom and shackles is mistaken.

For example, woodcut art, due to the limitations of materials (wooden board) and tools (woodcut knife), has its own characteristics. It is rough, powerful, obvious, and has strong contrasts, which is the unique beauty of woodcut art. Another example is drama, which must be created under the three restrictions of audience, actors, and stage. Losing one of them is no longer drama. These restrictions are by no means shackles, and there is infinite freedom within these restrictions. With the limitations of a charcoal stick and a piece of white paper, the painter can express infinite compositions and infinite feelings. A pile of clay can be transformed infinitely in the hands of a sculptor, displaying thousands of majestic and beautiful forms.

Seeking infinity within limitations, seeking freedom within "shackles" is a necessary cultivation for an artist.

To recognize what is limitation, what is shackle; what is freedom, what is licentiousness, why is it only true for artists?

The great writer Gogol of old Russia said in one of his letters: "If I were to become an actor, I would still have security... but I am a writer, so I have to starve to death."

Critic Ismailov said: "The writer's wife! is a cook, a laundress, and a dishwasher, with only one difference, which is that she does not receive compensation. If God gives them several children, then they are even more sufferers, meditating all day long, restless all day long; what will they give the children to eat tomorrow?"

Nekrasov, the Russian commoner poet with a nose reddened by the cold, said: "The fate of the writer is a well-known fate; a miserable life, an indecent title; ending this life in loneliness, half-starved...". He also said: "For three whole years, there was not a single day that I was not hungry. In big hotels, people often came in to read the newspaper without ordering anything to eat; I often did the same. When I was reading the newspaper, I would take the bread basket next to me and eat the bread. - This was my only food."

### The Life of a Writer

— Zhu Caigen

Even when Lu Xun was dying, he said: "I am like a cow, eating grass and squeezing out milk, blood." He even wrote a heavy and sad line in his will: "In the future, children, never teach them to be empty-headed literary men again."

The modern writer Mr. Lu Yan did not die in a disaster, nor was he destroyed by the flames of war, but also died in a life of poverty.

Recently, a friend told me about the hardship of writers' lives, which made me feel very sad. I heard that Mr. ××, who is currently living in Shanghai, has recently exchanged his wife's gold jewelry for emergency relief because of the difficulty in raising living expenses. The lives of dignified old writers are so desolate and so embarrassed. I really doubt whether the history of literature can continue to be written in the future? But when I flipped through the past records about the lives of writers, I found that it was the same bleak situation, and in their hardships, they lit up the light of prophets for future generations, illuminating the vast crowd. So I thought: these should be people who truly love humanity. They silently sacrificed everything for the crowd; they forgot themselves for the crowd!

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 41

— Ye Jingfeng

The dawn of the 26th arrived. From eight o'clock in the morning, we waited anxiously for news. We wanted to see what method the Japanese would use to launch this "three-part" conspiracy. Nine o'clock. Nine thirty. Ten o'clock. Still no news came. I was just about to call Mr. W to ask about the situation when the person who delivered the letter to Dingyuan suddenly ran in. I wondered why he had been delayed for so long. It turned out that Dingyuan had been sick for several days with his annual bout of amoebic dysentery, along with a bit of neurasthenia. He was just starting to get better, and he slept very well this morning, so the person who delivered the letter stayed there waiting for a reply. Dingyuan wanted me to come see him immediately. He

Fortunately, the road bureau's factory buildings were only a few minutes away from us. I handed the affairs over to Number 04 and imitated "echoes in the valley," setting up a message relay system using three people: one standing on the hillside in front of the house, one standing at the corner of the road bureau, and one at a point not far from Dingyuan's residence. As soon as the news arrived, the first person would give the second person a hand signal, the second person would relay it to the third person, so that I could receive the information in a second or two at most.

Because I knew that the Japanese's major offensive this time was aimed at eliminating the Twenty-ninth Army, and Changxindian was a key point, inevitably bound to be affected, I had to let Dingyuan know a little so that he could make some preparations. As for all the men, women, old, and children of Changxindian, there was no way to limit them in advance. I could only see if there were any rescue methods available temporarily.

Dingyuan lived in a small house in the factory. For the sake of face, he didn't welcome guests very much. Even I, as a friend, had only been there once. If he hadn't fallen ill in bed this time, he would definitely not have let me visit.

It had only been a few days since I had seen him, but he had lost a lot of weight and looked very ill. It was said that the diarrhea had been stopped using a clyster method, but now he was just inexplicably anxious and constantly suffering from insomnia. This was because excessive worry had affected his nervous system. I had to see him, just to see if he could get up and walk around because I had already planned a destination for him - Chengdu, Chengdu University.

I told him about my plan euphemistically regarding travel expenses and provisions. Because he always acted like an English gentleman, I couldn't mention financial assistance to avoid hurting his "sense of self-esteem." I only said that I had some immovable funds, which I was preparing to remit to a friend in Chengdu, entrusting him to buy some things. If provisions were short, he could use them first, as long as they were returned within a year, plus interest equivalent to that of the bank. In total, it was only a little over a thousand dollars. As far as I, a single person, was concerned, it didn't matter. Did I still have to haggle over every penny and ask him for interest? But if I didn't do this, he would definitely refuse.

I said these words, paying close attention to his reaction. Who knew that my good intentions were completely wasted. His body was weak, and he couldn't say much. His wife, that virtuous lady, explained his plans for him.

Wasn't he thinking of moving his family to take refuge before? Later, when he heard me say that this "incident" was not a local affair, but a full-scale war, he suddenly changed his plan: he was preparing to join the army and work in communications. This was a way to use his expertise to contribute to the country. His wife and Meijun, if possible, including Zhajun, were willing to join the army hospital as nurses. The two boys, Shire and Shiyi, would be brought by him to learn communication technology. Zhujun would naturally be brought by his mother and sisters. He hoped that they could work within the same military corps to avoid family separation.

"As long as I can get out of bed, I will go and join!" he told me excitedly.

— Shaofu

Autumn Rainy Night

The day before yesterday, we Shanghainese had our first autumn rainy night. Unfortunately, the rain was too heavy and too fierce, as if showing off the power of autumn. The bleakness exceeded the mood.

The world is not short of people who love rain, nor is it short of people who love autumn rainy nights. Except for those who are physiologically or psychologically abnormal, this is also a kind of persistence in taste. A kind of cultivation and appreciation that nature gives to people.

In the rain, the scenery of the city streets changed. Pedestrians were flustered, vehicles hesitated, and the lights were dim. Even the newly added sound of raindrops falling only further illustrated the surrounding tranquility. Rain is beautiful, especially rainy nights! You hold an umbrella, you walk alone, you carefully appreciate all this, and you will feel like you are enjoying it.

Balancing the Budget

Zhang Zhiben, the head of the investigative delegation, said at a reception yesterday:

"The first of the three main reasons for the poor handling of the work of receiving and dealing with enemy and puppet materials is an erroneous policy. After the victory, the authorities should have used the received enemy and puppet materials to cultivate people's strength and should not have used them to balance the financial budget."

In the past two months, the financial authorities have repeatedly announced that they have not increased the number of banknotes issued, and this has been achieved by bidding on enemy and puppet materials. If another two or three months pass and these materials are sold out, then what will happen? It's really worrying!

Chairman Zhang's words were a little late. Now, even if it is used to balance the financial budget, there are few days left.

### Shanghai's Climate Is Often Abnormal; This Year's Weather Is Even More Bizarre

— Mishan

Over the years, Shanghai's climate has been more abnormal than normal. This year's weather is even more bizarre: suddenly cold, suddenly hot, unpredictable. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the scorching sun still presses down, with autumn behaving like summer. But a burst of rain jumped from the height of summer to deep autumn. In June, the Xujiahui Observatory even announced that "there will be no summer this year," but who knew that summer would be particularly long, and it became "no early autumn this year."

Open the historical Shanghai meteorological reports and start with the hottest year:

That year was the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), and the highest temperature reached 104.4 degrees, breaking the 63-year record.

In the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), the highest temperature was 100.8 degrees.

In the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), the highest temperature was 97.2 degrees.

In the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the highest temperature was 99.9 degrees.

In the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), the highest temperature was 98 degrees.

In the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), the highest temperature was 99.1 degrees.

In the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), the highest temperature was 99 degrees.

In the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), the highest temperature was 98.4 degrees.

In the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), the highest temperature was 103.6 degrees.

In the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), the highest temperature was 98.4 degrees.

In the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), the highest temperature was 102.7 degrees.

In the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), that is, last year, the highest temperature was 100 degrees.

The highest temperature this year was 101 degrees. Compared with the highest temperatures of the above years, it doesn't seem to be anything remarkable, but in September, the heat soared again, and the highest reached 100 degrees, which was 0.1 degrees higher than the highest temperature of 99.9 degrees in the same month in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), creating the highest record in 73 years.

Several rains finally sent the autumn tiger away, but according to the report of the city's observatory, the weather will turn hot again in the next two days. What will happen? Let's wait and see.

### A Beauty's Words

An American friend, after discovering a dirty and unbearable alley on Sichuan Road, said to me:

"If this alley were in the United States, then all the residents of the alley would definitely unite to negotiate with the government, asking the government where the taxes paid by the people have gone."

### It's Investment, Not Speculation: Talking About the Stock Exchange

— Mituo

The stock exchange opened on the 9th of this month. After a week of practice trading and reconciliation procedures, it officially opened on the 16th.

China has a very short history of stock exchanges. In the past, China's commercial organizations were all run by individuals or jointly funded by a few people, and there was no organization of joint-stock companies at all. In the Qing Dynasty, one or two shops acted as agents for stock trading in other cities. At that time, most of the buyers were compradores. Later, as the number of stocks issued increased and trading became more prosperous, the "Foreign Stock Broker Association" appeared in the 17th year of Guangxu (1891), which was changed to the "Zhongye Public Office" in the 31st year of Guangxu (1905).

In the third year of the Republic of China (1914), the Chinese Stock Business Association was established. The stock trading included more than 20 kinds of stocks such as the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Commercial Press, China, China Merchants, and Hanyeping. By the ninth year of the Republic of China (1920), it was expanded into the "Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange," which was the first official stock market in China, 147 years after the establishment of the first stock exchange in London. At that time, the capital was 3 million yuan, and company stocks were opened for trading. It was suspended during the War of Resistance.

During the war, Shanghai businessmen flocked to establish new industries and engaged in speculation. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), the number of stock companies reached two hundred and several dozen, causing chaos in the market. The puppet government authorities also felt it was too outrageous and ordered a crackdown, but soon thirty or forty companies "legally resumed operations." At the same time, the puppet "Stock Exchange" also opened, and the inside story was smoky and unbearable to ask.

China's stock trading has always been centered on Shanghai. Besides Shanghai, there were only Beiping, Tianjin, and Wuhan. The Beiping Stock Exchange was established as early as the 7th year of the Republic of China (1918). It seems that Tianjin and Wuhan did not have exchanges established.

The stock exchange is originally a completely legal economic organization, and its role can guide idle capital and support industry and commerce. However, it is easily used by speculators to buy and sell short, manipulate market prices, encourage gambling, and shake market security. As Mr. Wu Guozhen said: "If the stock exchange can be run well, it may assist the government, stabilize finance, and stabilize people's livelihood; otherwise, finance and people's livelihood will be affected." At a time when industry and commerce are sluggish and finance is not very stable, everyone is giving special attention to the future development of the stock exchange.

Here, we must reiterate our hope:

"We hope that the stock exchange will become an investment market, not a speculative market!"

### Amitabha

Director Zhang made an indiscreet remark and offended many high-ranking monks.

This group of monks was "enraged," not only enraged but extremely enraged, so they used boundless Buddhist power to deal with him. They paraded, demanding to give a fifteen-minute speech on stage, revealing their attachment to the material world. The monks are not in harmony, and they are even preparing to fight a completely empty lawsuit for nothing!

"Trouble arises from speaking too much, vexation comes from being too assertive." But the monks of today are not to be trifled with. Amitabha!

### Casual Notes on Teaching

— WW

We elementary school teachers consider ourselves extraordinary, indeed possessing too much scholarly air. More than a decade ago, a former outstanding student greeted me the other day; he is now fully equipped with American goods. He advised me to change careers and help him with his foreign firm's business. My ordinary heart almost stirred, but I managed to maintain my gentlemanly self-respect and politely declined. I told my wife, and I received a scolding, mixed with my own mantra: "The essence of learning is nothing more than seeking peace of mind." Unexpectedly, my wife took a cold breath and said, "Only old people and scholar-officials are difficult to please!" I touched the beard on my chin, speechless.

An old colleague, Ran Xilai, came to talk. He estimated that my head teacher's salary was at least 500,000 or more. When I told him it was 230,000 and change, the expression on his face was beyond my clumsy pen's ability to depict. In short, he considered it a miracle. He said that a few strokes of his watercolor painting could equal a month's salary in a small city. This almost made me faint, and I blurted out my last sentence to my old friend: "Hehe, haha! Nietzsche said it well: 'This is an era in which everything must be re-evaluated...' "A hint of proud, bitter smile unconsciously floated up.

### The Young General Chen Cheng

— Re-conquest

In China, and even worldwide, General Chen Cheng is the only one to hold the rank of first-grade general at the age of forty-eight. Therefore, Chinese and foreigners alike consider him to be a young and promising military man, a typical young general.

In 1899, in Qingtian, the smallest county town in Zhejiang, an old rural scholar's family welcomed a little angel, who is now General Chen Cheng, the Chief of the General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense.

Diligence and studiousness are his only characteristics. As a child, he studied extremely hard. Even after graduating from Baoding and serving as a squad leader in the first class of Huangpu, he remained the same. I remember one morning, before dawn, he took a book to the training ground to practice calisthenics and exercise. Because he was eager to start running first, he temporarily placed the book on the ground. At that time, President Chiang happened to be walking in the training ground and noticed a book on the grass from afar. Chiang was very surprised and wanted to find a name on the book, but it was not yet light, and he could not see it. Just as he was guessing, he discovered a dark shadow wriggling. President Chiang immediately asked, "Who is it!" He replied, "I am Chen Cheng." Chiang then knew that the book must be his again, and he thought to himself that this young squad leader was able to study diligently and seek progress, which was worthy of commendation. Therefore, after the flag-raising ceremony for all officers and students in the school, he specially commended Chen Cheng, saying that he was a role model for all officers and students in the school. Soon, he was transferred out of the school and appointed as a battalion commander. From then on, he gained the trust and appreciation of the president. For more than twenty years, Chiang has always valued him very much. He also admired the president very much.

In the 31st year [of the Republic, 1942], Chairman Chiang visited India. Before the trip, Chen Cheng was still on the front lines in Hubei. He was deeply dissatisfied with Chiang's trip to India and sent a telegram to express his opinions, but Chairman Chiang did not adopt them. After Chiang returned to Chongqing from India, he specially rushed from Enshi, the wartime capital of Hubei Province, to Chongqing, and once again expressed his meaning from the previous time in person. Although this is a small matter, it shows how sincere he is.

During the first Battle of Changsha, as the commander of the Sixth War Zone and the Ninth War Zone, he commanded on the front lines. Despite the enemy's continuous bombing and strafing, he showed no fear and remained calm and composed. Once, dozens of enemy planes were constantly circling overhead, and bullets rained down on the ground. His guards were so frightened that they lay down in the trenches, but he remained calm and paid attention to the enemy planes' movements. A timid guard, worried about the safety of the commander, shouted, "Commander, lie down!" He treated his subordinates with both kindness and strictness, which is perhaps the key to his success. Once, a division commander stubbornly defended a certain position, suffering heavy losses. But his order required the division commander to hold out until a certain time before retreating, but that division commander could not bear it until the last moment (only twenty minutes from the time of the order to retreat) and withdrew from the position. As a result, Chen Cheng executed the division commander without hesitation. Another time, when he was serving as the chairman of Hubei, the younger brother of a certain department director, who was in charge of managing public grain, embezzled public funds and was reported for corruption. He also showed no mercy and executed the corrupt official. It is said that when he was in charge of Hubei, as long as there was a bit of corruption, no matter how big or small, he would definitely enforce the law. On the other hand, he cared for his subordinates and loved them. Whenever there was chaos in the front-line battles, many officers and soldiers (including the wounded and the uninjured) lost contact with their units due to the fighting. As long as he saw or knew about it, he would immediately issue a relief fund.

He came from the artillery corps. Because of his fame, many people praised the greatness of the artillery. Some people say that President Chiang, Napoleon, Duan Qirui, Chen Cheng, and many other famous generals from China and abroad all came from the artillery. So, everyone unanimously circulated a good story in the troops: "Artillery is supreme." In fact, the artillery is nothing special. It's just that the main requirement for studying artillery is a good foundation in mathematics (trigonometry, geometry, calculus, algebra, etc.); otherwise, one will feel great difficulty in the theory of shooting and in actual shooting. People who are good at mathematics have a more scientific mind.

Chen Cheng has always had a bad stomach. His peptic ulcer was once very dangerous, followed by duodenal bleeding. He could not eat ordinary food and could only drink liquid foods. But since he took office as the Chief of the General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, his health has gradually recovered. The first thing he did after taking office was to ban jeep girls in Nanjing. This order was indeed necessary in fact, but in theory, it was indeed somewhat detrimental to the status of women. Therefore, before the order was implemented, female compatriots wrote articles in the newspapers to express their opinions. Chen Cheng, a young general of China, we thank him for his efforts in the War of Resistance, and we wish him eternal health and happiness!
