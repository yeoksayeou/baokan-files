### City Suburbs Near Strongholds Occupied; Communist Army Heavily Shells Datong; Fierce Battle for Niangziguan Intensifies

Communist Army's Encirclement of Datong Situation Map

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] After the Communist representative of the Datong group of the Military Mediation Department left the city, the government and the American representative, considering the increasingly urgent attacks by the Communist army, the issue of safety, and the loss of a negotiating partner, requested and were approved by the Military Mediation Department, and returned to Beiping yesterday. Since the 12th, Datong city has been hit by a maximum of ten or more shells. According to reports this morning, the Communist army began a full-scale attack starting on the 14th. The strongholds of Qilicun in the south of the city, Baimacheng ten miles north of the city, and Yuhe Bridge five miles east of the city have all fallen. Wogou Chejiazhuang is currently under siege. The Communist army at Shaling, six miles southeast of the city, has been repelled. However, the Datong airport, the source of Datong's lifeline, has been directly affected by the war, and aircraft landings have lost safety.

[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 17th] Military sources here say that the Communist army surrounding Datong is using heavy artillery to shell the city, which has lasted for three days. The executive group of the Military Mediation Department, which left Datong by plane, has already returned to Beiping. According to government sources, the Communist army will take Datong at any cost. Others say that if the Nationalists hold Datong firmly, they can still hold out for a month even under conditions of food and ammunition shortages. The government has only airlifted a small number of reinforcements and food to Datong. It is reported that government reinforcements are heading to Datong from Baotou. The executive group of the Military Mediation Department convened a meeting of representatives of the Nationalist and Communist commanders in Taiyuan in an attempt to prevent the expansion of the war, but without result. It is reported that the Communist representative insisted that the Nationalist army must first withdraw from southern Shanxi, but this proposal was rejected by the government representative.

[United Press Tianjin Dispatch, 17th] A newspaper here reports from Beiping that Ye Jianying, the Communist representative of the Military Mediation Department, declared at a meeting of the government, Communist, and American representatives of the Military Mediation Department that the Communist Party is not responsible for the safety of the weekly liaison plane flying from Beiping to Datong.

[United Press Tianjin Dispatch, 17th] Today's newspaper reports that the commander of the Twelfth War Zone, Fu Zuoyi, flew to Datong yesterday to inspect the Nationalist army's defense situation. Government reconnaissance planes have repeatedly flown over Datong.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 17th] The artillery fire at Niangziguan is rapid, and the battle for control has not stopped for two days. Both sides have increased heavy troops, forming a decisive battle situation. The Communist army has occupied many hilltops and is attacking fiercely with artillery fire. Many shells have landed at the station. On the 16th, they once attacked outside Xiyangqi, west of the station. By evening, the battle had reached its most intense stage. The Nationalist army has increased reinforcements and deployed defenses along the road to ensure the communication line. On the 15th, the Communist army captured the three stations of Toumi, Xiapan, and Shanshang. After the Nationalist army reinforced, it successively recovered the three stations, but the rails and sleepers were all destroyed, and the station has become a ruin. The Communist army is also extensively destroying the railway with landmines between Niangziguan and Nanyu.

[Central News Agency Taiyuan Dispatch, 17th] According to transportation circles, the sections of the Zhengtai Railway that were destroyed by the Communist army are being repaired separately by the Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang Railway Bureaus. It is expected that traffic can be restored within a week. Currently, trains heading east from Taiyuan can reach Dongzhao. The southern section of the Tongpu Railway has been repaired, and trains heading south can reach Linfen. However, there is a section of about 200 meters between Nanguan and Fujiawan that must be traversed on foot. In addition, the railway line between Yuncheng and Fenglingdu was heavily damaged by the Communist army in the past. The local railway bureau recently received an order from the Ministry of Communications to re-repair it. Insufficient equipment will be allocated by the Ministry of Communications.

### American Ambassador Visits Military Mediation Department; Listens to Report on Anping Incident; Will Continue to Mediate on the Situation in China

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] Ambassador Stuart, on the morning of the 17th, went to the Military Mediation Department and had a two-hour talk with Robertson on the Anping incident and the general situation. At noon, he attended a banquet for Yenching University alumni, and at 6 p.m., he attended a welcome tea party held by the Sino-American Cultural Association at Xihua Hall in the Municipal Government. As the vice president of the association (President Zhang Bojin), he made a brief speech, stating the importance of Sino-American cultural communication, without mentioning the current situation. The reporter raised several questions before the meeting, and he answered as follows: (1) There have been no telegrams exchanged with Marshal Marshall since coming to Beiping. (2) The crux of the Nationalist-Communist negotiations lies in northern Jiangsu. (3) As the situation evolves to a final critical juncture, American policy toward China may change, but how it will change will depend on the American people. (4) Although the wars in Datong or the Central Plains are fierce, there is no complete despair yet.

[Central News Agency Beiping Dispatch, 17th] American Ambassador Dr. Stuart Leighton, on the afternoon of the 17th, visited Robertson, Zheng Jiemin, and Ye Jianying, three members of the Military Mediation Department, to listen to a report on the Anping incident.

[Another Dispatch] During the welcome reception of the Sino-American Cultural Association, the reporter met with American Ambassador Stuart Leighton and asked about the date of his trip to the south. The ambassador said that he would stay for two or three more days, and the date of departure was uncertain. The ambassador also stated that he intended to take all of his personal belongings from Yenching to Nanjing on this trip to Beijing. When the reporter asked if he would be living in Beijing for a long time, the ambassador said, "Yes." When the reporter asked the ambassador's views on the negotiations between the government and the Communist Party, the ambassador said that he was not "disappointed" and would continue to work hard to mediate after returning to Beijing. The reporter also asked if the ambassador had heard of the rumor that Marshal Marshall would be returning to the United States. Ambassador Stuart answered in fluent Mandarin: "It's all rumors, absolutely not true. Marshal Marshall's character is that he will never give up on unfinished work, and he will definitely see it through to the end and complete his mission."

### Reorganizing the Government; Authorities are Discussing

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Regarding the reorganization of the government, the general view is that the government has long been determined and that it is inevitable. As for rumors that a certain ministry will be ceded to a certain party or faction, they are unfounded and not credible. However, the authorities are currently discussing it carefully.

### Investigation Team for the Anping Incident Begins Work

Yesterday, they Listened to the American Report All Day

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] The Twenty-Five Group officially began its investigation work on the 17th. At 9 a.m., they listened to the eyewitness report of Major Swartz of the American side of the Executive Headquarters. Major Swartz went to Tianjin on official business on July 26 and returned to Beiping on July 29 in a vehicle of the American military transport team. On the way to Anping, he was attacked along with the transport team. In his report and answers to questions, he proved that the transport team was traveling from Tianjin to Beiping without any Nationalist troops accompanying or mixed in. Before being attacked, no troops or individuals had negotiated with or stopped the team. Among those who attacked them, some wore military uniforms and some wore civilian clothes. He felt unable to describe the color of the military uniforms of some of the attackers. The Communist representative Huang Yifeng then unbuttoned his military uniform pants, revealing new gray pants underneath, and asked if it was this color. Swartz replied, "Slightly lighter." In answering questions, Swartz also stated that three days before the Anping incident, on July 26, he traveled from Beiping to Tianjin, passing through the Anping town area. The jeep he was riding in was also shot at, and they retaliated with machine guns and fired six grenade launchers. At 2 p.m., the group continued to listen to the report of Constable Duke of the American Military Police of the Executive Headquarters. He and Major Swartz were both eyewitnesses to the Anping incident. He explained that when the explosion sound came, most of the transport team's grenades were in boxes, and no one was proficient in using the machine gun on his vehicle. He also stated that the American commander was killed at the beginning of the battle. He traveled from Beiping to Tianjin on July 28 and was also shot at near Chutanggou. On the way, he encountered people in civilian clothes standing on the road carrying guns. After 4:30 p.m., the group listened to the report of Major Boer of the First Battalion of the American Marine Corps, and adjourned the meeting after 5 p.m. On the 18th, they will continue to listen to the reports of his three soldiers. The liaison group sent to the Communist area departed at 5 p.m.

### Ye Jianying's Speech

Still Need to Work for Peace

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 16th] Ye Jianying returned to Beiping with Robertson last night. Today, he met with reporters and said that this trip to Beijing was to report on the Anping incident and had no other tasks. Marshal Marshall's attitude towards the Anping incident was extremely calm and objective. He also said that no one should deliberately publicize the incident, especially not to distort it. Marshal Marshall did not put forward a specific plan for the incident, but only said that he had seen the investigation procedure and hoped to reach an agreement quickly. When the reporter asked whether the issue of the survival of the Executive Headquarters was discussed with Marshal Marshall this time, Ye replied, "We have not considered this as a problem at all. Although the war is being fought, we still need to claim credit for peace." He further judged that Marshal Marshall would not give up before peace was achieved.

### Nationalist Army Recovers Xingshan in Hubei

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 17th] While the Communist army Luo Houfu's troops were about to reach a temporary ceasefire agreement with the Ninth and Thirty-second Groups, and the Nationalist army was ending military operations, they suddenly gathered their 5,000 men on the 14th, captured Xingshan County, and launched a fierce attack on Gui and Xiangxi in separate routes. The Nationalist army was unprepared and forced to retreat. It was not until yesterday afternoon that Xingshan was recovered. They are currently intercepting in separate routes.

### Local Militias Rise Up in Self-Defense; Communist Army in Eastern Henan Encounters Resistance; Elite Nationalist Troops Have Moved East from Luoyang

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] According to military sources who arrived in Beijing from Kaifeng today, there have been fierce battles on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway between Lanfeng and Huangkou for several days. Although Lanfeng has been captured by the Communist army, the Communist army advancing west from Lanfeng has now encountered strong resistance from the elite Nationalist troops moving east from Luoyang. The battle is taking place in the northeast area near Lanfeng. The skies above Kaifeng, Luoyang, and Zhengzhou are now filled with the sound of planes all day long. It is widely believed that the Nationalist army may recover Lanfeng in the short term.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Kaifeng reports that since Liu Maoen, chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, personally visited various places in eastern Henan to guide and strengthen the organization of local militias in various counties, the self-defense forces of the people in various counties in eastern Henan have become stronger. It is reported that the armed militias in Lanfeng County alone have exceeded 10,000 people. The county's militia is currently gathering in the mountainous areas on the border between Henan and Shandong, preparing to cut off the communication line between the Communist armies of the two provinces. Therefore, the Communist army that has infiltrated the eastern section of the Longhai Railway is terrified that its rear will be cut off and has become very panicked.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] Military news indicates that the offensive launched by the Communist army along the Longhai Railway extends 500 miles west from Kaifeng, mobilizing more than 100,000 troops. Xinglong, the first station east of Kaifeng, was captured yesterday. The Nationalist army is still holding on to Minquan and Kaocheng, and other important stations are under siege. In addition, the Communist army Yang Yong also led more than 30,000 troops and is converging on Dangshan from northern Anhui with Liu Bocheng's troops for a fierce attack.

[Central News Agency Kaifeng Dispatch, 16th] Liu Yizhou, deputy commander of the Henan Security Force, stated at a press conference today that the Communist army's entire strategy is to roam in central China and fight a frontal war in northern China. The roaming of Li Xiannian's troops is a containment tactic. Liu Bocheng launched the eastern Henan campaign as a frontal war with a total of 37 regiments, plus nearly 200,000 militiamen. Yang Yong has nine regiments, others are unknown. The purpose is to (1) support northern Jiangsu, (2) cut off the Longhai Railway, (3) seize Shangqiu, Kaocheng, Minquan, and Lanfeng. After obtaining these, they plan to attack Kaifeng. Our army has now begun a counterattack, and their attempt will be difficult to realize.

### Communist Army Air Raids Yangzhou Outskirts

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 16th] According to a reliable dispatch from Yangzhou, since the Nationalist army opened up the Yangzhou-Daqiao Highway, the war on the outskirts of Yangzhou has become quiet. On the 13th, taking advantage of the Nationalist army's troop redeployment, the Communist army launched a full-scale assault on Songjiaqiao, Lingtangqiao, and Gongdaoqiao from Shaobo and Gaoyou. The three places were successively occupied by the Communist army on the 15th. On the 15th and 16th, about 50,000 people fled from the three places to Yangzhou. Supporting the old and carrying the young, the situation was extremely miserable. The Yangzhou office of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association has allocated 5 million to handle emergency relief.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] It is reported here that more than 100,000 Communist army reinforcements have arrived in northern Jiangsu, attempting to launch a counterattack against the Nationalist army in the Rugao and Yangzhou area. Chen Yi, the commander of the New Fourth Army of the Northern Army, convened a meeting of senior Communist army generals in northern Jiangsu at the headquarters in Huai'an on the 13th of this month, preparing for a counterattack, with the aim of defeating the Nationalist army in Rugao and Yangzhou.

### Chairman Hosts Banquet for Zeng Qi and Others; Broad Exchange of General Opinions During the Dinner

[Our Guling Dispatch, 17th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet at his official residence at 1 p.m. on the 17th for Zeng Qi, leader of the Chinese Youth Party, and Liu Dongyan, a member of the party's Central Standing Committee, accompanied by Chen Lifu, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Yunwu, Chen Zai Lei, Chen Jinghan, Wu Dingchang, and others. During the banquet, Mr. Zeng had a broad exchange of views with the Chairman and others. In addition, the Chairman inquired of the Minister of Commerce about various issues related to industry and commerce and the petition group from the Shanghai business community. Mr. Wang answered them one by one, and the Chairman expressed his satisfaction. Minister Wang also plans to report the detailed policies of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to the Chairman soon. Zeng Qi is scheduled to leave Guling for Beijing before the 19th, but he said that he plans to visit the Chairman again before going down the mountain to discuss matters.

### Zuo Shunsheng Expresses Opinions on the National Congress Constitution Draft; Various Constitutional Issues Should be Resolved First

[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon, reporters visited Zuo Shunsheng and Chen Qitian, responsible persons of the Chinese Youth Party, at the headquarters of the Chinese Youth Party on Shanghai's Hague Road, to inquire about their opinions on the National Congress Constitution Draft and the reorganization of the government. They provided the following written response: Convening the National Congress is a necessary measure to end the tutelage and implement constitutional government. Now, less than three months away from the date set by the government for convening the National Congress, it is approaching in an instant. In order for the National Congress to be held more satisfactorily, it is necessary to complete the necessary preparations as soon as possible. The so-called necessary preparations are: first, to achieve national peace before the National Congress is held, so that the National Congress can proceed smoothly in a harmonious atmosphere; second, the amendment to the May 5th Constitution Draft must be completed within September so that the National Congress has a basis for drafting the constitution. The sole task of the First National Congress is to draft the constitution and determine the date when the constitution will begin to be implemented. According to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the Constitution Draft Review Committee must, based on the principles of amending the constitution draft, create an amendment and submit it to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures, and then submit it to the National Congress for decision. Although the Constitution Draft Review Committee already had a "draft amendment to the May 5th Constitution Draft" in Chongqing, it has not yet been fully reviewed and determined. We believe that completing the amendment to the May 5th Constitution Draft is a preparation work that cannot be ignored before the National Congress is held. The Constitution Draft Review Committee should be restored as soon as possible to continue reviewing the amendment to the May 5th Constitution Draft, so that it can become finalized as soon as possible. Although there are still some major issues in the amendment to the Constitution Draft, such as the issue of the powers of the central and local governments, and the issue of legislation and administration, which are still in dispute, the articles have been generally drafted. It only needs to be slightly sorted out, and various constitutional issues can be resolved in the spirit of reconciliation, and it will not be difficult to complete the work in a short period of time. If the amendment to the Constitution Draft is left unresolved, disputes may still arise at the National Congress. In the past, our country has repeatedly had disputes over the constitution-making issue, which has plunged the country into long-term chaos. If we want to have fewer disputes in constitution-making in the future, we must restore the Constitution Draft Review Committee as soon as possible to complete the amendment to the Constitution Draft. As for the issue of government reorganization, it must be carried out before the National Congress is held in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in order to innovate the political structure. The parties and social figures participating should try their best to seek a national lineup, and then they can have a fresh start and work together for peaceful nation-building.

### Transportation is Actively Recovering; The Construction Program will Start with Main Lines; Yu Dawei Arrives at Guling to Ask for Marshal Marshall's Support

[Our Guling Dispatch, 17th] National railway transportation is actively recovering. (1) The Jiaoji Railway will be open to traffic in the middle of next month. (2) If there are no special obstacles on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, it is expected that the entire line will be open to traffic before the National Congress. (3) The Pinghan, Pingsui, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines are expected to be gradually restored in the short term.

[Central News Agency Guling Dispatch, 17th] Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei arrived at Guling from Beijing at 7 p.m. on the 17th with Director of General Affairs Li Jinglu. It is said that he intends to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to present a plan for the implementation steps of transportation reconstruction, and also intends to visit Marshal Marshall to ask for his support. According to reporters, restoring transportation is the focus of the government's current governance. The construction program will start with the main lines of the national economic artery. It is reported that although the Jiaoji Railway has been heavily damaged by the Communist army, due to the efforts of transportation workers, it is expected to be open to traffic in September. Other lines, such as Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Longhai, Tianjin-Pukou, and Pinghan, are also scheduled to be completed in order. If the Communist army accepts the instructions issued by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on August 14 and abandons its suicidal policy of obstructing transportation, the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai lines may be the first to be opened to traffic within the year. At present, steel rails and sleepers are the most lacking materials, and business funding is also tight, but the competent authorities will spare no effort to connect the economic arteries of the country in order to achieve their goals as scheduled.

### "Darkness Envelops China" – American Public Opinion Believes Armed Conflict Is Inevitable; CCP Newspapers Emphasize "War" and "Attack"

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] The devastation and tragic situation under a full-scale war is almost inevitable. Today, the Communist side does not shy away from using words like "war" and "attack." This afternoon, this reporter visited the Communist Party spokesperson at the Military Mediation Department. With considerable enthusiasm, he introduced yesterday's editorial in the Communist Party's official newspaper, *Liberation Daily*. The editorial demanded that all military personnel and civilians in the "Liberated Areas" recognize the seriousness of the current situation, mobilize uniformly, and "crush the National Army." It further stated that only by defeating the National Army could "peace" and "democracy" be achieved. In addition to emphasizing war as the only way to resolve the current situation, the editorial also criticized "the United States, which consistently advocates mediation with a smooth tongue, as the helper and supporter of China's civil war." The article also directs the missions of various Communist Party units.

[Our Newspaper Special Correspondent, New York, 11th (Airmail)] The *New York Times*, in its editorial titled "Darkness Envelops China," stated that "Marshal [George] Marshall and Ambassador [John Leighton] Stuart issued a joint statement saying that they have found no way to peacefully resolve China's increasingly rampant civil war. This paints a dark picture of China's future. Five hundred million people are defying their own will and risking complete economic collapse by engaging in a reckless struggle because the leaders of two opposing forces refuse to accept a common plan regarding local government and troop reorganization. This is unimaginable to people of goodwill throughout the world. Darkness is clearly descending upon China and casting its shadow over the entire world. Perhaps, in the nine-year struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, achieving peace is no longer possible. Perhaps the opposing ideologies that seem to be dividing the world have made the use of force inevitable. Perhaps Marshal Marshall's mission has indeed failed, and the Chinese Communist Party will succeed. However, there may still be one hope: that the American mediator's explicit expression of pessimism and the inevitable facts they foresee can make Chinese political leaders feel their full responsibility and avoid the final catastrophe. Perhaps the painful cries of the Chinese people who long for peace can finally penetrate the solid walls of Yan'an and Nanjing. From here, it is useless to determine where the blame lies. However, the important fact is that the Nationalist government represents four-fifths of China's population, and Chairman Chiang [Kai-shek] has shown a tendency toward coordination, but there is a limit. Beyond this limit, even this wise leader dares not venture further. The Communist Party has also respected this limit, but now it has crossed this line and openly attacked the American army. The Communist Party, as a smaller group, demands equal or even superior power in any organized government, while in the areas it currently controls, it effectively practices autonomy. They do not seem to fear the war and turmoil that are otherwise inevitable. In this chaotic situation of opposition, Marshal Marshall has frankly admitted that his efforts have failed. If we withdraw aid and guidance to China, there is little hope for the future of this tragic country."

[United Press, New York, 16th] News from China indicates that this tragically destined country is on the brink of a full-scale civil war. The future situation in Europe seems more promising compared to China. One of America's major post-war plans is about to be declared a failure. If American policy changes, a complete withdrawal from China is not impossible. If that happens, all the hopes that the Chinese people and their allies held during the fourteen years of resistance against Japan will vanish. China's arduous and heroic resistance was largely sustained by this hope. If a full-scale civil war is unavoidable, China will become a vacuum in terms of politics, economy, and ideology. Forces vying for world leadership or seeking world domination will inevitably take advantage of this vacuum, and some of these forces may be drawn in against their initial wishes.

Capital Street Talk and Public Opinion: Blame the CCP for Lacking Sincerity

[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] People on the streets of Nanjing, such as shop assistants, hotel waiters, and restaurant staff, today generally believe that Marshal Marshall's mission has failed, largely due to the Communist Party's lack of sincerity. The general consensus is that "Marshal Marshall is a capable man, perhaps the most capable man in America. Unfortunately, the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is too deep to resolve. The Communist Party insists that Marshal Marshall only represents the Kuomintang, which is the reason for his failure." Those who express this view still hold a deeply rooted belief that the Communist Party's inability to compromise is manipulated by Soviet influence. However, many also believe that American military equipment and munitions have fueled the Chinese civil war. Staunch supporters of the Kuomintang deny this. Most people in Nanjing also believe that a constitutional democratic government composed of truly democratically elected officials is still vaguely in the distant future, and even if it comes, it will only exist in name and not in reality. These people also say that the Kuomintang should be a major party in China, but it should not be the only party, and others should get a piece of the pie in the government. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek remains the only reasonable leader of the country. (For news on the Communist Party spokesperson's comments on Marshal Marshall's work, please see page 2.)

### Facilitating Trade Between Inside and Outside the Customs; The Northeast Headquarters Economic Commission Formulates Four Measures; Also Opens Exchange and Regulates Commercial Goods

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] In the year since the recovery of the Northeast, what can be... to open up, and trade with the interior has been unceasing. Since the recovery of the Northeast last year, transportation has been disrupted, and the political situation has been unstable. The daily necessities of people in the Northeast have been relying on past savings and small quantities of goods carried by merchants. This situation is gradually becoming scarce. In order to change the abnormal economic situation and integrate the economies inside and outside the customs, the Economic Commission of the Headquarters has formulated and announced trade measures starting from the 15th, including interim measures for commercial goods entering and exiting, interim measures for railway cargo transportation, interim implementation measures for industrial and commercial exchange in the nine northeastern provinces, and interim measures for inspecting export commercial goods. Trade between inside and outside the customs, which had been suspended for many years, can now be facilitated.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 17th] A spokesperson for the Economic Commission, in a talk on facilitating trade and currency exchange between inside and outside the customs, stated that since the recovery of the Northeast, trade with the interior has not yet been restored. The difficulties are: first, enemy and puppet materials have not been completely received and inventoried, to prevent private transportation and loss; second, there is an urgent need for vehicles, and restrictions must be placed on commercial exports; third, there is a shortage of transportation; and fourth, exchange has not yet been opened. In order to urgently seek solutions, the Chief Executive's Office has now stopped inspecting commercial goods, and military transport vehicles are also being used as much as possible for commercial transportation. Currently, four provisional measures have been established: (1) Regarding the classification of export goods, export goods are divided into three categories: "ordinary," "permitted," and "specially permitted." All goods other than "permitted" and "specially permitted" are ordinary goods and are not subject to...; (2) Regarding the priority of cargo transportation, everyone has equal opportunities to avoid backlogs. Government and industrial... enjoy priority, and commercial goods that are more important in nature can also obtain the same rights; (3) The inspection targets determined this time only require merchants to prove that the goods are not privately held or stolen enemy and puppet materials. Clearance will be granted as long as there is a shop guarantee; (4) Regarding remittance measures, in the past, the scope of remittances from the Northeast to the interior was limited to public funds and living expenses for civil servants' families. Now that the currency system is gradually returning to normal and commercial transportation has also been opened, special implementation measures for remittances have been formulated in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for Exchange in the Nine Northeastern Provinces" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. All legitimate merchants who comply with the regulations for commercial goods entering and exiting and exchange can apply for remittances. Industrial remittances above one million yuan and commercial remittances above five hundred thousand yuan can be applied for through banks, and exchange can be settled if the banks deem them legitimate. The exchange rate will be posted by the Central Bank at any time.

### The Truth About the Communist Army's Deliberate Breaching of the Dike; Air Force Headquarters Refutes Communist Slander

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Communist Party's propaganda organ, Xinhua News Agency, published a message on the 11th, stating that the government's air force bombed the Grand Canal dike, causing a flood in northern Jiangsu, with the intention of blaming the government for the responsibility of the implementation in northern Jiangsu. For this reason, this reporter visited the spokesperson of the Political Department of the Air Force Headquarters to ask for his reaction to Xinhua News Agency's malicious slander and fabrication. He stated as follows: Anyone with a little political common sense knows that the false propaganda fabricated by Xinhua News Agency is purely a consistent Communist policy of concealment and malicious slander, attempting to distort the facts of the dike-breaching atrocity that arouses public indignation and shift responsibility to the government. We can interpret the Communist Party's sinister actions of deliberately breaching the dike and flooding 300 square kilometers of land in northern Jiangsu as follows: (1) The Communist army has repeatedly suffered defeats in northern Jiangsu, and their conspiracies have failed. In order to prevent the National Army from continuing its counterattack and to try to reverse the military decline, they had no choice but to deliberately breach the Grand Canal dike between July 31 and August 2, causing a serious flood and destroying highways and bridges in an attempt to prevent the National Army from advancing further; (2) The Communist Party's consistent goal is to seize political power by force, and its greatest conspiracy is to create widespread poverty in the country, disrupt social order, and destroy the rural economy, creating a wasteland so as to force the good people under their tyrannical rule to join their organization and use them as sacrifices to expand their territory. Such despicable propaganda is not worth a smile from those who are knowledgeable. The department also broadcast to the whole country on the evening of the 17th, clarifying the truth about the dike-breaching and criticizing the Communist Party's fallacies.

[Our Newspaper, Jiangsu, 17th] The Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference recently telegraphed Zhou Enlai, the Communist Party representative, requesting an end to the Communist army's dike-breaching and flooding in Northern Jiangsu, which has been increasing, and requesting a prompt telegram to the Communist army leaders in Northern Jiangsu to effectively stop it and change course to protect the lives of the people.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 17th] Liu Yongfang, the government representative of the 24th Traffic Group of the Military Mediation Department, submitted a memorandum to the group regarding the Communist army's destruction of the Grand Canal dike and the flooding of the eastern section of the Suihai Highway, requesting an inspection.

### Zhejiang Chairman Shen Honglie Diligently Seeks Hidden Information; Inspects Water Conservancy and Reclamation in Xiaoshan and Shaoxing

[Our Newspaper, Shaoxing, 17th] The Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Shen Honglie, left by car from [unknown] at Jingjiang Station in Xiaoshan on the morning of the 16th with a small entourage. Accompanied by the county magistrate of Xiaoshan and more than ten representatives of villagers, he inspected the Changxing Seawall, going back and forth under bean trellises and melon racks, and between interconnected fields. He inspected the Xijiang Dike and the Panjian and Pantou, which were three miles away from the dike. The shallow beach here has been eroded by the river water, and many of the Panjian and Pantou have collapsed. Shen explained the reasons for the river course modification and said that experts would be sent here to conduct research and surveys. The village representatives knelt and begged that the designated site for the airport be moved back to the original old airport. Shen then went to inspect the designated site and saw that it was located in the riverside area, with fertile land and cotton waiting to be harvested. More than a hundred people burned incense and knelt around, crying and pleading as before, their condition being very pitiful. Shen comforted them greatly and promised to consult with the aviation authorities. After asking about this year's crops and cotton harvest, he boarded the car to Xiaoshan. After arriving in Xiaoshan, he met with various legal groups and public opinion organizations, asking about the hardships of the people. Everyone said that the water conservancy problem was serious, with tens of thousands of disaster victims unable to make a living. Shen gave instructions and asked them to find ways to reclaim wasteland. Shen was still reviewing documents at lunchtime. In the afternoon, he inspected various agencies, walking more than ten li throughout the city, sweating profusely. Later, he went to the west of the city to climb Qiukou Stone to overlook Xiang Lake, which was mostly barren and silted up. Shen believed that Xiang Lake was nearby and had great development value, and it could be cultivated as a scenic area. He immediately gave some instructions, then hired a foot-rowed boat to return to the station along Xiang Lake. On the way, he inquired about the lives of the [unknown] thirty sons, showing great concern. At the station, he met many military officer trainees and inquired about their living conditions and future destinations, showing great concern.

At midnight, he consulted the commissioner and county magistrate about security and other issues. The county magistrates of Shangyu and Zhuji were also present until late at night. Shen strictly refused local hospitality on this trip, and his life was very simple. He stayed in Shaoxing for about two days.

### Henan Fellow Townsmen Appeal for Disaster Relief

### CCP Spokesperson Comments on Marshal Marshall's Work

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] A Communist Party spokesperson tonight formally stated that they would "review" the merits and demerits of Marshal Marshall's mediation work and provide criticism. The spokesperson also denied that this contained any "attack" intention. This move by the Communist Party is obviously putting mental pressure on Marshal Marshall to force Marshal Marshall to submit, which is conducive to the Communist Party's unilateral opinion, so as to implement the four agreements of the truce agreement, the Political Consultative Conference resolution, and the troop reorganization plan. The spokesperson accused Marshal Marshall, saying that in the first period from December last year to March this year, Marshal Marshall's mediation work was to faithfully implement the mission of Truman's statement and complete the four agreements, and the results were gratifying. In the second period, after Marshal Marshall returned to the United States and returned, the work was biased towards one side, the mediation lacked principles, did not achieve the due effort, and did not follow Truman's statement. Truman's statement was agreed upon at the Three Foreign Ministers Conference, and Marshal Marshall was also present at the conference. The spokesperson did not give a definite indication on whether Truman's statement would be submitted to the Security Council for resolution if it could not be implemented. The Communist Party hopes that Marshal Marshall will continue to work hard to implement the four agreements and faithfully follow Truman's statement. Finally, the Communist Party expressed great respect for Marshal Marshall personally and his past achievements.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Communist Party has begun to publicly accuse Marshal Marshall of being unfair in the Kuomintang-Communist mediation. According to reliable information: At the three-party conference in Moscow, Molotov once told Byrnes that the Soviet and Chinese representatives should jointly mediate the Northeast issue with the representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to resolve the Chinese dispute, because Molotov believed that the Northeast was the center of the Chinese problem. However, Byrnes did not express his opinion at that time. Judging from today's Communist Party's instigation of anti-Americanism and criticism of Marshal Marshall, we can know that their motives did not start today.

### Bizarre Swindle Occurs in Hankou; Old Woman Zhang Organizes a Hui (Rotating Credit Association) and Absorbs 1.3 Billion Legal Tender; Extorting Heavy Interest and Appearing to Be a Wealthy Magnate

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 17th] In the midst of high-interest borrowing, a bizarre swindle has recently occurred here. An old woman named Zhang Feng, known as Zhang Taipo (Granny Zhang, who used to work as a matchmaker), at No. 7 Xianghe Lane in Hankou, owns more than a dozen young girls. After the victory, she innovated by organizing a *hui* (rotating credit association), inviting business people and women to organize *hui* groups, with a total of more than 1,700, absorbing more than 1.3 billion legal tender. Zhang then used this to extract heavy interest and appeared to be a wealthy magnate. Unexpectedly, recently, three installments of interest were not paid. The invited members discovered the inside story and gathered more than 500 creditors yesterday to collect debts at Zhang's house. Vehicles gathered together, making the road inaccessible. Zhang was flustered and had no choice but to reply evasively. The creditors had no way to solve the problem and are now requesting the district office and security authorities to strictly clear the warehouse.

### How to Solve the Problem of Students Being Out of School

In the previous press conference of the Shanghai Municipal Government, we heard Mayor Wu's talk about the problem of primary and secondary school students in this city being out of school, and we deeply felt its seriousness. First, the cost of living has risen sharply, and tuition fees for general private primary and secondary schools will increase. Families with meager incomes will find it difficult to continue to afford their children's education expenses. Now, there are only half a month left before the start of the autumn semester. We can hear parents around us who have no money, worrying day and night about their children's education, feeling almost restless and having no way out. Second, there is the issue of the number of schools. Although there seem to be many public and private schools in Shanghai, since the victory, people from all directions have brought their old and young to Shanghai. According to Mayor Wu's report, the current population of Shanghai is almost 4.5 million. The number of schools is small, and the number of school-age children is large. Therefore, if parents or students slightly neglect the procedures for applying for admission, they risk being excluded from the school. Also, because there are many candidates and the number of places in each school is limited, the admission process has to be strict, so there are many students who fail, and they are pitifully terrified of being out of school. We can see countless young people around us who are currently rushing around in the scorching heat, registering in the east and registering in the west, taking exams in the east and taking exams in the west, worrying like pounding rice, so anxious about whether they will be accepted that they are almost beside themselves. It is very pitiful. Especially when this summer vacation has not yet passed, and the dynamics of students entering school are appropriately chaotic and turbulent, we can see very clearly that this problem of being out of school is indeed quite serious.

However, from our objective point of view, the problem of Shanghai youths being out of school is not absolutely unsolvable. In the current urgent situation, we must have temporary solutions, and when everything improves in the future, we must have fundamental solutions. Education is the most important foundation for establishing a country, and Shanghai is the largest city in the country. The municipal authorities of this city are willing to tirelessly study the problem of being out of school and express their anxiety at all times, which truly makes us feel infinitely concerned at the same time.

Regarding temporary solutions, we believe that if we divide all primary and secondary schools in the city into three shifts, we can implicitly increase the number of schools threefold. These three shifts consist of two shifts during the day and one shift at night. The two-shift system during the day was very popular in Shanghai for a while after August 13th, when the National Army withdrew from Shanghai and before the enemy occupied the concessions. Except that parents of younger children inevitably feel a little troubled because they have to manage them due to the shorter time at school, there are no other problems. Until now, it is said that there are still a few schools that have such a class schedule. Many European countries are also adopting the two-shift system during the day. For example, in Poland after the catastrophe, because many school buildings and equipment were destroyed by artillery fire, the schools adopted this two-shift system. As for the one shift at night, the United Kingdom and the United States especially value it. The government has never discriminated against universities and middle schools that hold classes at night in terms of conservative traditions in legal aspects. There are many important people in the United States today who graduated from night school. A New York dispatch from the United States Information Service on the 7th of this month said: "A survey by the American Night School Association of colleges with night classes found that the number of veterans enrolled in night schools has increased by 1,237 percent compared to a year ago, and the total number of students has also increased by 50 percent compared to a year ago." Then, why is it that a poor country like ours is unwilling to use the light of the night and unwilling to face the reading of the night? This one shift at night does not cost much, and older students can also do some work at home or elsewhere, and teachers, if they are physically strong, can also use this additional income to subsidize their families. In short, as long as we are willing to abandon prejudices and discard traditional concepts, as long as we are willing to endure hardship and practice a frugal method, and as long as everyone concentrates their efforts to promote a three-shift education system per day, we will definitely be able to dilute the serious problem of being out of school in Shanghai a lot.

However, we do not want to permanently implement a three-shift system per day for education that seeks development in hardship. At the same time, we must also establish fundamental and permanent solutions to the problem of being out of school. Given the difficulty of our country's finances and the small amount of educational funding, the government does not have huge economic power to monopolize education. Therefore, encouraging social groups or private citizens to run schools universally to help the government complete its mission in education is absolutely necessary in the future. If we want to achieve this goal, we must drastically change our policies and abolish all the trivial laws that have caused trouble, pain, and restrictions on social groups or private individuals running schools. Under the current system, the government's strict laws on private schools and the world's education systems for the procedures of registration, and the strict and thorough treatment of private schools, China can be considered the first. India is still a British colony, but the freedom to run schools in India, overseas Chinese in India know this. We want to popularize education and fundamentally solve the problem of being out of school. Unless the government is determined to monopolize it, if it still looks at those who are enthusiastic about running schools with special eyes, few people will be willing to take their own energy and act like lunatics to run schools for the country again. Today, the education authorities are making things difficult for the registration of private schools in every possible way, which is a fact known and felt painfully by the education community. If this pain is once relieved, coupled with the gradual elimination of situations such as housing shortages and the gradual improvement of the national economy, all schools across the country, after gaining freedom, will definitely spring up like mushrooms after rain and work together to fundamentally eliminate the problem of being out of school for Shanghai and the entire country, and complete the great cause of educational construction.

In short, in China at present and in the future, if we want to popularize education and improve education, we must use this revolutionary method, and we must implement some new methods that adapt to the environment and calculate frugally. If the government does not have the魄力 to stipulate a large amount of funding for education, but is unwilling to change its policies, it is tantamount to strangling the opportunity for our young people to receive universal education. We believe that in the future, the national education policy, in addition to concentrating efforts on selecting and running a number of national universities or provincial and municipal middle schools for demonstration purposes, should relax the standards and encourage social public or private establishments of schools at all levels as much as possible to make up for the deficiencies of national, provincial, and municipal schools. And the government's academic performance of all students should be measured by fair and impartial examination methods, regardless of whether the school is established by the government, social groups, or individuals. Those who pass will graduate, and those who fail will take remedial courses. China's traditional habits have never underestimated the private education undertakings of the people. We still advocate using social public and private methods to save the government's predicament of insufficient number of government-run schools. Changing course is the time now!

### Bengbu City Commerce on the Verge of Crisis: Chamber of Commerce Representatives Go to Beijing to Request Loans

[Our newspaper Bengbu correspondent] Since the recovery of Bengbu City last year, the commerce of Bengbu City has been greatly affected by the disturbance of short-term counterfeit currency. Later, the bandits and communists in the nearby counties were rampant, traffic was blocked, and cargo transportation was not smooth. All industries plummeted. This summer, the Yellow River flooded and backflowed into the Huai River, turning the Huai River region into a swamp. Locusts were everywhere in the highlands, and the disaster was thus developed. The goods on the market could not be sold, and business was virtually suspended. Therefore, high-interest loans were borrowed to maintain the status quo, drinking poison to quench thirst. Some went bankrupt. In view of this, the Bengbu City Chamber of Commerce specially elected Standing Director Peng Zhuoru and others to travel south to Beijing on the 15th to petition the central government for relief. At the same time, it petitioned the Ministry of Finance to order the Four Joint Offices to turn around and instruct the banks in Bengbu City to handle low-interest mortgage loans, and to exempt or reduce the profit tax for the 34th year to save the crisis.

### Situation in India Worsens: Large Number of British Troops Enter Calcutta; Nearly 2,000 Killed and Wounded in Two Days of Riots

[Our newspaper] New Delhi, 17th direct broadcast: The situation in India is even worse today. There are major conflicts between Indian and Muslim believers in Calcutta and other places, and fires have broken out in many places. A large number of British troops have entered Calcutta today. According to the latest statistics, 250 people died and 1,600 were injured as a result of the two days of riots.

Another report: Nehru met with Indian Governor-General Wavell today to discuss the formation of an interim Indian government.

[Our newspaper] Paris, 17th broadcast New Delhi news: Nehru recently met with Lord Wavell, the Governor-General of India, for an hour and a quarter, and the discussion involved the examination of matters related to the formation of an interim government. After the meeting, Nehru immediately reported the content to the leaders of the Congress Party, but neither side made any comments. The rumor that telegraphic communication between Calcutta and New Delhi was cut off by demonstrators has been denied by the local authorities. The disruption of traffic is probably due to the fact that the Calcutta police do not allow office workers to go to public places. There are troops guarding the Calcutta Post Office, and office workers will go there under the escort of troops.

[Our newspaper comprehensive news] The situation in India has become more serious yesterday. According to a United Press report, Congress Party leader Nehru told reporters yesterday (16th) after meeting with Jinnah, Chairman of the Muslim League, that he had tried to find a compromise plan with the Muslim League regarding the formation of a joint government, but it had failed. Nehru returned to New Delhi on the 17th to report on the progress to the Congress Party, but the rejection of the Muslim League Chairman Jinnah to participate in the organization of the interim government was also expected and did not surprise the general public. According to a Reuters report from London on the 16th, it is generally expected that the formation of the Congress Party government is no longer a problem, and it is said that if the Congress Party can leave the chairmanship to wait for the participation of the Muslim League, then Jinnah may change his original intention and agree to participate.

While the two sides have not yet found a compromise plan, Muslim parades and demonstrations and riots have occurred in Bombay, Bengal, Calcutta, etc. In Calcutta, a very large-scale conflict occurred. According to a Reuters report from New Delhi on the 16th and a United Press report from Calcutta, the 16th was designated by the Muslim League as "Direct Action Day" to protest the interim government plan set by the British Cabinet delegation, and as a result, a major conflict occurred in Calcutta. Most of the trains and streetcars in Calcutta stopped running. The offices of the Congress Party and the two Congress Party newspapers were destroyed by the Muslim masses. Robberies and stabbings occurred one after another. According to reports from the four major hospitals in Calcutta, 80 people have died and 825 have been injured. The reports from other hospitals have not yet been released and have not been calculated. All day on the 16th, Calcutta was shrouded in an atmosphere of terror. British troops in Bombay were also on alert all day, but fortunately there were no disputes. Large-scale public rallies were also held in Bangalore, Sindh, Lahore, etc.

### Indonesian Independence Day: British and Dutch Troops on High Alert; Sukarno Was Unsuccessfully Assassinated Half a Month Ago

[Our newspaper comprehensive news] According to a United Press report from London on the 16th: Well-informed sources believe that the British government may be preparing to hand over the Palestine issue to the United Nations, because Britain feels that it is unable to deal with this serious problem that threatens Britain's economic lifeline in the Middle East alone. According to a Reuters report from Paris, British Colonial Secretary Hall flew to Paris on the 16th after meeting with Jewish leaders to discuss the matter with Bevin. Bevin also met with U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes to discuss the Palestine issue. At this time, all parties are focusing on the attitude of the United States.

I will request the Senate and House of Representatives to pass a special bill to allow some Jewish and non-Jewish refugees to move to the United States to live. The U.S. government is unwilling to put forward any plan for solving the Palestine issue, but deeply hopes that the talks between the British, Arab, and Jewish parties can achieve a satisfactory solution. According to a Reuters report, the British government is currently focusing on preparing for the convening of the London Conference to allow representatives of the Arab and Jewish communities to participate in the discussion of solving the Palestine issue.

### Pidault to Serve as Chairman of the Next General Assembly on Rotation

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 17th] The Peace Conference continued its session this morning, still chaired by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang. Mr. Wang announced two items on today's agenda: (1) the Austrian government's request to present its views at the conference regarding the division of the Austro-Italian border; (2) the Iranian government's request to participate in the Peace Conference. After the agenda was approved, British representative McNeil immediately stood up to speak in support of Austria's request, while the Soviet representative expressed opposition. It was then passed by a vote of 15 to 6, allowing Austria to present its views. The General Assembly then discussed Iran's request. Vyshinsky pointed out that the major powers should recognize Iran's assistance to the United Nations. Chinese representative Guo Taiqi supported the Soviet proposal, pointing out that Iran was one of the few Asian countries participating in the United Nations. The American representative, Cohen, held the same view, and Iran's request was unanimously approved. Before the adjournment, the chairman announced that the two political and territorial committees for Bulgaria and Hungary would meet at 3:00 PM today. The next General Assembly will be chaired on rotation by French President Pidault.

[Our Newspaper's Comprehensive News] Since its commencement, the Paris Peace Conference has lasted for three weeks, during which most of the time has been spent discussing procedural matters, listening to speeches and debates by representatives from various countries, and inviting representatives from the former enemy states of Italy, Romania, Germany, Bulgaria, and Finland to attend the conference and provide opinions. Representatives from some countries are quite dissatisfied with the slow progress of the Peace Conference. At the conference on the 16th, New Zealand representative Jordan opposed delaying political matters, leading to a heated debate with Soviet representative Vyshinsky. However, the confirmation of the chairmen and vice-chairmen of various committees of the Paris Peace Conference yesterday can be regarded as a major progress of the conference, and the actual work will begin from here.

### Military Committee

### Trieste Issue

Will Still Be a Point of Contention

According to United Press, the Italian Political and Territorial Committee held its first meeting on the 13th of this month and began discussing the draft treaty on the 16th. The chairman of the committee, South African representative Ettlinger, proposed three points: (1) postpone the discussion of the preamble to the peace treaty and discuss it after the text; (2) request Italy to submit written memoranda on all disputed points; (3) adopt a procedure so that all representatives can submit memoranda on the disputed points in the treaty. According to Reuters, the Peace Conference decided on the 16th that the amendments to the draft resolution on Trieste determined by the four powers will be submitted to the Italian Political and Territorial Committee for discussion next Tuesday, which is likely to cause a fierce debate at the Peace Conference on the Trieste issue.

U.S. Senators Connally and Vandenberg, at the summons of Secretary of State Byrnes, set sail for France yesterday on the "Queen Mary." Before departure, he said, "The Soviet Union has adopted an unreasonable attitude at the Paris Peace Conference," and said, "It is impossible for the Peace Conference and the United Nations General Assembly to be held at the same time, and one of them must be postponed." In summary, the Peace Conference will enter a more tense stage, which is beyond doubt.

### Japanese Admiral Sato Commits Suicide

First Shoots Wife and Children with a Handgun

[Central News Agency, Yokosuka, 17th, United Press] Japanese Admiral Sato Shiro, 53, former supreme commander of the Japanese Navy in the Wewak war zone of New Guinea, recently shot and killed his 41-year-old wife, 11-year-old son, and 8-year-old daughter with a handgun, and then shot himself in the head. This must have been a planned suicide. According to reports, Sato returned to Japan after being demobilized last spring and suffered from malaria.

### U.S. Prepares to Send a Note to the Soviet Union Opposing Soviet Control of the Tatar Strait. Frequent Diplomatic Contacts Between Turkey, Britain, and the United States.

[Our Newspaper's Comprehensive News] According to United Press and Reuters, Ankara, Turkey, 16th, the Turkish government's reply to the Soviet Union's note requesting joint defense of the Tatar Strait has been drafted and will be submitted to Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Vinogradov today or tomorrow. According to reliable sources, Turkey will reject the Soviet request and insist that the jurisdiction of the Tatar Strait should be entirely determined by the Montreux Convention mechanism. Since receiving the Soviet request, Turkey has been closely consulting with Western countries. U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Wilson and British Ambassador to Turkey Kelly have been in frequent contact with Turkish Foreign Minister Saka, and French Ambassador to Turkey Magras has also visited the Turkish Foreign Minister to discuss the matter.

Regarding the U.S. attitude on this issue, according to United Press, San Francisco, 17th, Acting Secretary of State Acheson announced today that the United States may send a note to the Soviet Union, declaring the U.S. attitude on the country's request to amend the Montreux Convention for joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the Tatar Strait. Mr. Acheson also said that the United States would oppose this Soviet request. The U.S. policy on this issue has been announced by Byrnes, that the United States supports unrestricted passage of Soviet ships through the Tatar Strait, but opposes the Soviet Union obtaining bases in the strait. However, according to United Press, Washington, 16th, some people here privately expressed that the Soviet Union must obtain military bases in the Tatar Strait and is unwilling to give up its purpose, and it is feared that it will not be easy to find another compromise. According to London, 17th broadcast: The Soviet newspaper Pravda endorsed the Soviet Union's request in an editorial, saying that it is to safeguard the important interests of the Black Sea countries, and non-Black Sea countries should immediately stop interfering in the administration of the straits. The Soviet Union has the longest coastline in the Black Sea and naturally has the greatest right to self-defense in prohibiting the entry of navies from non-Black Sea countries.

### U.S. Public Opinion Poll: Supports Taking a Firm Stand Against the Soviet Union and Believes That the Soviet Union Wants to Go on to Dominate the World

[Central News Agency, New York, 16th Dispatch] The American Institute of Public Opinion, known for the Gallup poll, announced today that the diplomatic battle between the United States and the Soviet Union has a significant impact on the American people's views on how the United States should deal with the Soviet Union.

[Our Newspaper Translated from United Press, Honolulu, 17th] "Crossroads Test" Commander Lieutenant General Blandy declared here today that the defense methods developed from the Bikini atomic bomb test make the United States better prepared for atomic war than any other country in the world. However, he also said: "At best, defense is still not complete." He believes that no matter how many people believe that "in future wars, large numbers of atomic rockets will fly across continents and oceans and explode over cities," the navy will still be needed in the future. Based on the statistical figures obtained from Bikini, he said: "Conclusions that can affect ship design, naval and air tactics, and strategies can be obtained."

### Sulphur Island Suffers Extremely Heavy Damage from Typhoon

[Remodeling Company, Tokyo, 17th] MacArthur Headquarters announced: According to the Seventh Weather Measurement Station report: A strong typhoon will hit the southern tip of Kyushu, Japan, around 3:00 PM tomorrow, traverse Kyushu, sweep through the Sanin region, and enter the Sea of Japan.

### English Writer Wells Cremated in London. Shaw Speaks in Mourning.

[Reuters, London, 16th] The remains of English writer Wells were cremated today at the Golders Green Crematorium in London. In addition to family members, Lord Beaverbrook and others were also present. Shaw's eulogy for his deceased friend stated: Wells was not a gentleman. He was the son of a florist and a sexton, so he was a person without class, never imitating the demeanor of a gentleman, clerk, or teacher, but always maintained his personal character, being gentle, outspoken, and not glared at by people. About 50 years ago, I disagreed with him on the policies of the Fabian Society. Although I defeated him, everyone in the society expressed sympathy for him, which shows that he was loved by everyone.

### Scientists Gather in London to Study the Secrets of Longevity. Men Can Be Transformed into Women.

[Reuters, London, 16th] British and European scientists are now holding a conference in London to discuss the issue of prolonging human life. Professor Crew of Britain said: It is possible to temporarily transform male infants into females to prolong their lives, because the competitive survival function of boys is weaker than that of girls. The problem now is whether it is possible to inject hormones to temporarily transform males into females to help them survive the dangerous period of competition. Dr. Kolantchevsky, secretary of the British Longevity Research Association, said: The goal of immortality is not only to prolong life, but also to maintain strength forever. Infancy is only the beginning of life, and we need to study all stages of life. The use of glandular serum by Soviet Bogomolets to seek rejuvenation did not yield satisfactory results and could only provide temporary stimulation. Therefore, what we need to study is to discover the causes of aging and remedy them, not just to stimulate degraded fibers.

### UNRRA Council to Reopen at the End of This Year. Heated Debate Over Refugee Case.

Accelerating Relief to China to be Continued

[United Press, Geneva, 16th] The fifth plenary meeting of the UNRRA Council adjourned this afternoon and is scheduled to reopen at the end of the year. The time and location will be decided by the General Affairs Committee. The location is mostly in New York or Geneva, and the session will be held around September of this year after the United Nations General Assembly.

Unfinished matters, such as accelerating relief to China, remain to be dealt with. British representative Buck said: The 14,700 employees representing 40 countries will mostly find a way out in international institutions.

### The Confusing Indian Political Situation Our Newspaper Editorial Office (Continued)

The Problem: Pakistan

The British Empire sees that the Indian issue has reached a point where it must be resolved. As the authoritative "Forum Weekly" said: "This is our last chance to withdraw from India as friends." On March 15, Prime Minister Attlee made a world-shocking announcement in the House of Commons: "Britain has now granted India full independent status within or outside the British Empire. If India wishes to sever its relationship with the Empire through free elections, Britain will assist India in completing this move." On March 23, the inland delegation composed of Secretary of State for India Affairs Lawrence, Naval Minister Alexander, and Trade Minister Cripps arrived in India. Unfortunately, when independence was still a distant dream, the Congress Party and the Muslim League had already drawn swords and become a mess. Both sides began a fierce debate, attacking, ridiculing, cursing, threatening, and even threatening to "fight at all costs." For these messy and chaotic claims, we can still sum up in two aspects. First, in terms of administration, the Congress Party advocates a free and unified central government that includes all aspects, while the Muslim League insists on partition. Second, in terms of constitution-making, the Congress Party hopes to first establish a single constitutional assembly in India, including all aspects. Partition will only be allowed when the assembly does not advocate unity. The Muslim League believes that the northwest and northeast regions of India should be partitioned, and Muslims should separately organize a constitutional assembly to draft their own constitution.

The crux of the matter is still this unresolved "Pakistan." The Muslim League has threatened to say "If we do not partition, we would rather have civil war." After the British delegation arrived in India, it proposed a proposal to organize a temporary coalition government and allow the division of Muslim and non-Muslim areas in each province. After many lip-smacking meetings and disputes, the Muslim League still believed that this was still a situation of Hindu majority rule and insisted on implementing its own "Pakistan" partition proposal. The meeting then broke up without results on May 12.

Since the meeting broke down, Prime Minister Attlee read a white paper in the House of Commons on the afternoon of May 16, announcing the latest solution plan for the Indian issue, which included six points. The chairman was the establishment of the Indian Federation. The federal government has jurisdiction over foreign affairs, national defense, and transportation. Central administrative agencies and all-India conferences are established. Major bills must be passed by a majority of all members, and must be passed by a majority of each of the Congress Party and the Muslim League. Other powers of the government are granted to the provinces, allowing the provinces to organize their own administrative agencies and parliaments. Regarding the issue of constitution-making, each million people elects one representative, and the elected representatives are divided into three groups: Muslim, Sikh, and general. However, among the 292 seats in the All-India Constitutional Assembly, 210 seats should belong to general representatives. On this point of the constitutional assembly, the Hindus clearly have a great advantage. The reaction from the Indian side to this white paper is still a mess. The Congress Party is unwilling to participate in this temporary government with equal shares, but approves of the constitutional assembly in which it has a large advantage in proportion; the Muslim League is willing to participate in the temporary government, but opposes this constitutional assembly in which it has a minority. This last proposal then failed under such circumstances, and the British Cabinet delegation left India and returned home on June 29.

Unity Leads to Success, Division Leads to Failure

But in this new plan, there is one point that is quite thought-provoking, that is, it clearly opposes partition and supports unification. This is the first time in British history in India that it has not favored the Muslim League. In the past, Britain was always favoring the Muslim League to weaken the external forces of the Indian independence movement. This time, Britain is indeed determined to solve the problem. Roughly speaking, there are also many reasons for this, and the situation forces it to make such a decision. On the one hand, the tide of the Indian independence movement is surging, and everywhere is making the situation move towards a kind of fierce revolutionary edge, which can no longer be dealt with by the traditional "delay" policy. On the other hand, the activities of the Soviet Union in Iran and the situation in the northwest corner of Iran made Britain deeply fearful. When the Muslim League was arguing with the Congress Party over the "Pakistan" issue, a leader of the Muslim League once said, "I think the Soviet Union, our northern neighbor, will support our demands." In fact, many left-wing youths are also looking north. If the power of the Soviet Union invades the Persian Gulf through Iran, the situation in India, which bears the brunt, will be difficult to reverse. If there is a "Pakistan" as Jinnah requires in the northwest of the Indian border, then the complexity of the situation will naturally be more difficult to deal with. The British are very clear about all this. They see that continued rule is impossible, so today's peaceful withdrawal (especially to the more moderate members of the Congress Party) can still maintain some commercial and resource advantages, otherwise if the revolution breaks out that day, the withdrawal will be even more embarrassed.

The British are determined to solve the problem this time, but due to the conflict between the two parties within India, a very good opportunity for independence has been lightly let go. As Nehru said, "A half-free and half-enslaved world should no longer exist." The era is moving in the direction of independence and freedom, but the Indian people themselves should also understand that unless the internal strife ceases, the hope of independence and freedom will always be difficult to achieve. The goal of India today should be to unite in seeking the independence of their own country, and not to let internal disputes and historical hatred and suspicion weaken the strength of the independence movement. If a country wants to turn over from the oppression and bondage of another country, it must be unity leads to success, division leads to failure. We China wish to see an independent, free, strong, and peace-loving neighbor. The leaders of India should be able to make wise choices at the crossroads of this national destiny!

### Yang Wendao's Wrongful Imprisonment Seeks Redress - He Angrily Denounces Traitors in Court - The Vicious Jail Guard, "Number Eleven," is Difficult to Investigate - Yang Jianzhong and Tan Sheng Offer Evasive Testimony

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Yang Wendao (see previous image) was re-tried in the High Court's Criminal Division at 3:30 PM yesterday, presided over by Judge Wang Kequan. In addition to Yang Wendao, the important figures present included lawyer Tang Huaiqun, who has been working pro bono for Yang for ten years, lawyer Ge Zhaoji, who defended Yang ten years ago, and witnesses Yang Jianzhong and Tan Sheng, who were present at the original trial. Zeng Yuan, who once used the alias Cao Cao and planned to flee Shanghai, sat quietly in the audience and did not report to the court.

Judge Wang first informed lawyer Tang that detaining witnesses was not legally justified. If he wished to accuse these witnesses of perjury, he should file a separate complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office. He then interrogated Yang Wendao. Yang, due to extreme nervousness, tried to suppress himself, but his demeanor was still not very natural. Yang stated that he was the person in charge of the Hong Shun, Tong Ren, and Tong Yi three "Mutual Aid Associations," all of which were charitable organizations established many years ago. Judge Wang immediately asked, "Are these associations assassination organizations?" Yang replied, "They are charitable organizations, registered with the competent authorities." Asked, "According to you, you didn't kill Nakayama Hideo?" Yang then generously stated, "I truly know absolutely nothing about Nakayama Hideo's matter. I have lived a clean life, and only now, when our nation has been restored, do I have the opportunity to speak out. At this point, Yang vehemently criticized Zeng Yuan, Yang Jianzhong, Zheng Huimin, Zhang Caiyuan, Tan Sheng, and others, saying, "Please pay attention, Your Honor, these people were traitors even before the Japanese came! These shameless people formed a group, willingly served the enemy, and constantly created incidents on the clean land of the Republic of China. Taking this case as an example, they knew that I was a member of the Hongmen and never lagged behind others in loving the country, so they made me a scapegoat first. Although my life and death are insignificant, they directly harmed me on the one hand and indirectly harmed China on the other!"

The judge then asked if he knew Korean Jeck. He replied no. Asked if he knew Ye Haisheng, he replied that Ye was a member of the Hongshun Association, but they did not associate closely. Asked if it was true that on October 15th of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), someone went to the Tongyi Association to draw lots to see who would take action, and Ye drew the lot, he replied that it was completely untrue. Asked, "On the afternoon of November 9th of the 24th year of the Republic, did you, Ye Haisheng, and Jeck go to North Sichuan Road and take a handgun from a book with a hole in it and hand it to Ye Haisheng?" he replied "Absolutely not." Asked, "Upon reaching Baole'an Road, did you encounter Nakayama Hideo, and Ye followed him into Fengle Lane and killed Nakayama from the side?" he replied, "Absolutely not."

Yang stated that the Dimon brand pistol and its holster were borrowed from Li Mu, the secretary-general of the Public Security Bureau at the time, for self-defense. Because he had many children at home and feared accidents, he followed Yang Jianzhong's advice to hollow out a book and put the gun inside for safety. This book was in English, but the book shown by the court during the subsequent trial had been changed to a Chinese book.

Asked, "Did the police beat you?" He replied, "They beat me severely, from the investigative court until the death sentence was pronounced. Every midnight, they beat me until dawn. I knelt on the ground, and the Japanese police took off their leather shoes and beat me, repeatedly forcing me to confess that I had taken 150,000 yuan from Mayor Wu Tiecheng and was told to kill Nakayama Hideo, but I would rather die than comply. I died and came back to life several times before I realized that my left rib was broken." At this point, regarding the judge's request for Ye Haisheng to demonstrate what happened, lawyer Tang argued that this "demonstration" was being done while surrounded by hundreds of enemy marines and should more appropriately be called "directed" by the Japanese.

The court then summoned witness Yang Jianzhong. Yang, Yang Wendao's cousin, wore an old white silk western suit and yellow leather shoes, and looked quite dejected. The court asked if he could see the light, the court would not pursue his past actions. Yang Jianzhong then tried to push all responsibility onto his deceased cousin, Yang Guimei, and said that he himself only saw Yang Wendao once every month or two, and he had never been to Yang Wendao's house. The court then asked, "If you had nothing to do with this case, why did you try to escape after the incident?" He replied, "Because I saw the Da Mei Evening News reported that during the trial, Yang Wendao was asked 'Has Yang Jianzhong left?' Therefore, I had to leave."

Yang Wendao stated that Yang Guimei had falsely told him on April 15th of the 25th year of the Republic (1936) that the furniture of the Beishan Fellow Villagers Association had been moved away and told him to leave, but in reality, none of this was true. People with suspicious appearances were coming and going in front of Yang Wendao's door at that time.

On the morning of April 19th, at 10:00 AM, when Yang Wendao went out, he saw Tan Sheng, who beckoned plainclothes Japanese police officers who then dragged him into a car and took him directly to the Disweilu Police Station.

At this time, lawyer Tang suddenly stood up and claimed that Tan Sheng was now in court. Judge Wang then summoned him, and this "witness" wearing tattered Xiangyun yarn clothes and bare feet in slippers appeared before the entire audience.

Tan Sheng stated that he had known Yang Wendao for a long time, and Yang was his "Big Brother." He himself had a food stall at Fudan University in Jiangwan, and every day at 9:00 AM, he would go to Li Pu's house in Desheng Lane to smoke opium. There was a "Dongyang Zheng" (Japanese Zheng) who inquired about Yang Wendao's whereabouts. A Wang who was also smoking there said, "Tan Laosheng knows him." An hour later, the Japanese came again to inquire, and all four people in the opium den were taken to the Disweilu Police Station. That afternoon, they were interrogated and told that if they didn't speak, they would be beaten. So, he led them to Yang Wendao's house.

The judge asked Yang Wendao if he had anything to say to the witness. Yang, extremely angry, cursed Tan Sheng, saying, "I only want to say that these people are harmful traitors!" Tan Sheng, in a panic, replied loudly, "I was oppressed by the Japanese and had no choice!"

At this time, lawyer Tang presented a petition from Major General Zhang Lipu, requesting redress for the tragic death of his brother Zhang Chen. The court, because it was related to reporting traitors, instructed it to be sent to the High Prosecutor's Office. Yang Wendao also mentioned that when he was imprisoned in the Western Prison in the past, there was a guard numbered eleven who would beat him severely every time he saw him, and he requested an investigation. The judge replied that it was impossible to investigate and instructed him to provide additional favorable evidence to continue the investigation.

Yesterday, during the trial of this case, Yang Wendao answered in Cantonese, and lawyer Ge Zhaoji, who defended Yang in the past, translated for him into Mandarin. Because lawyer Tang had already submitted a petition to redress Zhang Chen's grievances, Ge wanted to speak as a witness. The court ruled that since he was serving as an interpreter, it was inappropriate for him to testify and did not allow it. However, because lawyer Ge had handled this case in the past and had been threatened by the Japanese, who gave him 24 hours to leave Shanghai, and was later forced to flee, he still spoke eloquently, saying that Zhang Chen, out of a sense of conscience, proved Yang Wendao's innocence and was ultimately killed by Zeng Yuan. His emotions were agitated, and he turned around and pointed at Zeng Yuan in the audience, shouting, "Traitor!" The whole audience was shocked. However, this "witness" who called himself "Cao Cao" and planned to flee to Hong Kong, although also present, was not summoned by the court because he had not reported to the court. Therefore, this suspected traitor who had been reported was still able to walk out of the courthouse safely as a witness.

### Yang Xizhi Appeared in Court Yesterday for Questioning - Unwilling to Say Much About the Grain Loan Case

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yang Xizhi, former Shanghai Grain Affairs Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Food, appeared at the office on Xuehuali Road at 9:40 AM yesterday in response to a summons for the District Prosecutor's Office's investigation into the grain loan corruption case. At 10:10 AM, Prosecutor Wu Qihua took the seat in the seventh court to inquire about the details of Yang's grain loan experience. The interrogation was completed at 10:55 AM, and Yang left in his car at 11:00 AM.

Yang Xizhi wore a light brown American gabardine suit, a white shirt with a floral tie, brown leather shoes, and a white cork hat. He arrived in a blue-gray National Shanghai 12119 car with Zhu Yingzhi, the secretary of lawyer Duanmu Kai, and a friend surnamed Tang. After getting out of the car, Yang immediately took his summons and went to the registration office to complete the registration procedures. His summons number was 2443, and the address listed was No. 26, Lane 622, Linsen Middle Road.

Regarding his absence from the first summons for questioning by the District Prosecutor's Office at 9:00 AM on the 7th of this month, he explained to reporters that the Ministry of Food called me at 12:00 PM on the 7th, and I didn't have time to go. The formal summons was only received on the morning of the 8th, so it was not that I resisted the summons.

Regarding this grain loan corruption case, Yang said: I respect the national law and respect the investigation. I have always been a public servant who abides by the law. When I went to the United States on March 14th, the grain loan method had not yet been approved, and whether to implement it was still being decided. After arriving in the United States, I was very isolated from domestic news. Later, I suddenly received a telegram from the Ministry of Food stating that the District Court wanted to summon me for questioning regarding grain loan corruption. I was very surprised to receive this news and hurriedly returned to China to find out about this matter. Now that the case is still under investigation, I do not want to say much, please forgive me.

### The Original Plaintiff, Zeng Yuan, Was Again Accused of Being a Traitor - Secretly Reported to the Enemy Gendarmes Who Killed Zhang Chen, an Important Witness in the Yang Case - The Victim's Brother Came to Shanghai to Seek Redress

Before the trial began, lawyer Tang excitedly told reporters: "This case is probably the biggest case outside of the traitor cases since the victory, right?"

He said that early yesterday morning, a Major General Zhang Lipu suddenly came from Nanjing to find him. This General Zhang is a graduate of the fourth class of Whampoa Military Academy, but his younger brother is Zhang Chen, one of the important witnesses in the Yang Wendao case! According to this General Zhang, Zhang Chen was wronged because he testified for Yang Wendao, and was resented by Zeng Yuan, who reported Yang Wendao. After the Japanese army occupied Shanghai, Zhang Chen had served as a major quartermaster in the General Headquarters of the Loyalty and National Salvation Army of the Military Commission, and in the 31st year of the Republic (1942), he was the major intelligence group leader of the Shanghai Action Team directly under the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters. He did not expect that although he knew Zeng Yuan had a grudge against him, he was very close to Zeng Yuan's younger aunt Yao Jianying. As a result, Zeng Yuan reported him to the Japanese army, and Zhang Chen was executed.

General Zhang Lipu has already filed a complaint accusing Zeng Yuan of treason. During the trial yesterday, lawyer Tang presented the complaint in court. Zeng Yuan was sitting in the audience, and when he saw this unexpected stroke by lawyer Tang, he immediately trembled, and his face turned pale. An old straw hat on his lap almost fell to the ground!

How did Zhang Chen die? Lawyer Ge Zhaoji said that the Japanese put him in a pot of boiling water and burned him alive.

### Warehouse Gauze Piled Up Like Mountains - All Belongs to the People's Wealth and Should Be Dealt With Quickly - The Investigation Team Pays Close Attention to Two Fires

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Receiving and Investigation Team's inspection of enemy and puppet warehouses began yesterday. At 9:00 AM, Committee Member Wu Wangji and Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen of the team, accompanied by Zhang Xi, the group leader of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, and Qian Zongqi and Guo Yourong, the customs commissioners of the Jianghai Customs, departed and inspected more than 20 locations, including the Broadway Road Gonghexing Wharf Warehouse, the Yangshupu Pu Wharf Warehouse, the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf Warehouse, and the Jiangwan Qimei Road Japanese Army Stable Warehouse. The inspection situation of each warehouse is described as follows:

(1) The Gonghexing Wharf Warehouse originally had 32 warehouses, all storing enemy and puppet materials. 31 of them have now been returned to their owners. Only one warehouse still stores military supplies such as steel helmets, minesweeping shells, canvas tents, explosives, old guns, and ink. (2) The China Merchants Bureau North Wharf Warehouse originally had 26 warehouses, 24 and a half of which have now been vacated. One and a half still store military supplies such as military uniforms, military shoes, artillery shells, bullets, etc., but all are small and scattered. (3) The Shanghai Warehouse originally had 14 warehouses, and about half of them still contain enemy and puppet materials, all of which are gauze, newspapers, soap, rayon, bicycles, etc. Among them, cotton yarn and cotton cloth are piled up like mountains, and the value is very considerable. (4) The Huangpu Wharf Warehouse only contained residual Japanese military supplies and items such as knives and shovels for military use. Most of them have been emptied. (5) The Gonghexing K-shaped Warehouse and the Qimei Road Stable Warehouse were burned in February and September of this year, respectively. The former damaged many of the Head Office's machines, and the latter stored food, causing millions of bags of corn to be destroyed. The investigation team is currently inquiring with the handling bureau about the truth of the two fires and the handling of the aftermath. Committee Members Wu and Zhang told reporters after the inspection: Although the enemy and puppet materials currently stored in the warehouses are only a small part, the number is still considerable. This kind of material is actually the wealth of our people. Whether it is returned or sold, it should be dealt with quickly. They also said that all the warehouses have been reorganized by the Jianghai Customs after receiving them, and now have clear registers for inspection, and the management is more strict than before. According to the Jianghai Customs, if the military supplies currently stored in each warehouse can be removed by the relevant authorities immediately, all of them can be cleared by the end of next month, for commercial use and for the Head Office to use. However, after the victory, most of the enemy and puppet materials were transferred and handed over for receiving, and it is inevitable that there will be mess and omissions. The investigation team also attaches great importance to the two warehouses that caught fire. However, according to the handling bureau, the Gonghexing K-shaped Warehouse had fire insurance of 30 million yuan with the Central Trust Bureau, and was compensated in full after the fire. The scrap iron that was burned was also sold for more than 20 million yuan, so the warehouse received a total of more than 50 million yuan after the accident and did not suffer a loss. Other warehouses will continue to be inspected tomorrow.

### US Pilot's Execution Case: Trial Did Not Comply with Legal Procedures; US Prosecutor Accuses Tanaka Hisaichi of Being Responsible

[Our Report] The US Military Tribunal continued to hear the case of Major Hocker being killed by the Japanese army in Hong Kong yesterday morning. Witness Sergeant Kawashima was the clerk of the Japanese military court that tried Hocker at the time. The points testified yesterday were largely the same as those stated by the first witness, Nakazawa Asao, the day before, that is, no witnesses or material evidence were provided at the trial on that day, only three reports from the military police and the prosecutor were relied upon. Hocker himself stated that the bombing target was a destroyer, and if fishing boats were affected as a result, it was not intentional. Based on the testimony of these two people, it is extremely clear that the Japanese military court's sentencing of Hocker to death at the time did not comply with legal procedures. Yesterday, the chief prosecutor also presented a document containing the statement made by the former chief military judge of the Japanese 23rd Army in Guangzhou last December when questioned by the US Strategic Services regarding the Japanese military court's trial procedures. It was claimed that cases sentenced to death by the 23rd Army Court did not need to be approved by the Tokyo Army Department, only the signature of the commander was required to execute the sentence. Based on this point, the prosecutor accused Lieutenant General Tanaka Hisaichi, who was the commander of the 23rd Army at the time, of being responsible for the illegal sentencing of Major Hocker to death.

[Our Report] You Shiliang, a native of Wuxi, is 35 years old and resides at No. 50, Lane 630, Datong Road. He is currently an accountant at a certain oil factory in this city, with modest savings. His wife, Mrs. Mao, has a very deep affection for him. They have already had five daughters, but the only shortcoming is that they do not have a son. In April of last year, he hired a maid, Wang Axiang (29 years old), a native of Shaoxing, with bright eyes and white teeth, quite attractive. As a result, You and the servant had an illicit affair. Before long, Wang became pregnant, and her abdomen swelled. You then sent the woman to his rural hometown in Wuxi to give birth. On May 13th of this year, she gave birth to a son. You was overjoyed and brought her to Shanghai. He informed his wife of the details, and finally obtained his wife's permission and formally cohabited after holding a grand banquet. Unexpectedly, Wang Axiang had a husband, Chen Qingsen, who lived in her original place of residence. Until recently, her husband Chen Qingsen, due to his wife's long absence, made arrangements to come to Shanghai and went straight to her aunt's house at No. 36 Ruiling Lane, Shanhai Pass Road, to inquire.

Manager Zheng Peixiang ordered 14 boxes of tin foil for wrapping cigarettes from the Hualu Aluminum Steel Factory in Hongkou in April of this year, worth approximately ten million yuan. However, this procedure was entrusted to Shen Wenqing, the factory's business department director and salesperson. Unexpectedly, Shen took advantage of his position and privately engraved a seal on May 12th and June 18th of this year, using a false name to withdraw the goods from the Hualu Factory, and then sold the goods separately for his own use. Zheng Peixiang learned of this matter and reported it to the Huangpu Branch last month, requesting an investigation.

### Qihong Asks for Too High a Price; Difficult to Negotiate Deals

The new Qimen black tea this year, although shipped to Shanghai by Zhenhe Tea Co. and others, has very high prices due to the large cost of production and all kinds of fees, reaching as high as 600,000 yuan per dan. According to news from export merchants, there has been a great demand from Europe and the United States recently, but due to the high price, they dare not inquire. Currently, Zhuyu Tea Co. and XXX Tea Co. are still inspecting the tea. However, if the sellers can make concessions, the winner can try to sell it overseas. In addition, foreign firms are still very interested in medium-grade Chen Chen Chou Zhen and Dong Zhen Mei teas, which are well-made and have no moldy taste in the tea liquor or leaf bottoms.

As for domestic sales of red and green tea, they have not decreased.

### Minister of Economic Affairs Talks About Subsidies for Raw Silk; Tea, Tung Oil, etc., Also Planned to Follow Suit

[Central News Agency, Kuling, 17th] Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yun-wu, after arriving in Kuling on the 16th, told reporters that in order to encourage exports, the government has already begun implementing a subsidy policy for raw silk. Exports of other commodities, such as tea and tung oil, are also planned to be subsidized in succession. This subsidy policy is intended to support export trade by the government. It is still hoped that industrial enterprises will reduce costs and increase production on their own, to avoid the government bearing huge long-term losses. The Minister stated that the industrial and commercial sectors are requesting government assistance for the economic crisis, and the government should accept this. However, the industrial and commercial sectors should also help themselves. He, coming from the private sector, cited Shanghai as an example: the city's fiscal revenue is about 4 billion per month, of which banquet taxes account for 1.5 billion. Calculating banquet taxes at 20%, Shanghai spends as much as 7.5 billion per month on banquets. This huge consumption, while not entirely from the industrial and commercial sectors, should at least account for a considerable amount. If the industrial and commercial sectors could economize mutually, using the funds spent on banquets to develop industrial and commercial enterprises, wouldn't that be better than seeking assistance? Finally, when reporters inquired about the Minister's mission in Kuling, he replied that he was summoned to the mountains and could only announce it after meeting with the Chairman.

### National Cotton Production This Year Expected to Reach 5 Million Dan

Shaanxi cotton production this year is expected to reach 1.2 million dan, and national production is expected to reach 5 million dan.

### Tax Bureau's Inefficient Handling; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Request for Improvement; Pre-War Tax Bills Issued Same Day; Now Must Wait Up to a Week

[This newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to request that the Goods Tax Bureau restore the practice of issuing cotton yarn tax bills on the same day, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating roughly: According to a letter from the Municipal Towel and Blanket Industry Association: In order to export directly woven finished cotton yarn products, it is necessary to send the original cotton yarn ex-factory tax bills to the Goods Tax Bureau for issuing shipping permits before export. This permit procedure could be completed on the same day before the war, but now it is officially stipulated as three days, and in practice it often takes up to a week or even longer. Recently, the number of ships to other ports has decreased, and the shipping schedules are far apart. The delay in issuing permits often leads to delays in shipping, making it difficult to export goods. This puts a greater strain on the circulation of funds. Please forward this to the Ministry of Finance, instructing the Goods Tax Bureau to restore the pre-war practice of issuing permits on the same day, to facilitate industry and commerce. It was easy for industrial and commercial enterprises to complete tax paperwork on the same day before the war. The Bureau was re-established after the war and has been operating for nearly a year; it is assumed that its internal structure has gradually been organized completely. All the good practices that benefited merchants and the public before the war should be restored as quickly as possible, in order to eliminate any gap between officials and merchants. Facilitating the circulation of goods also benefits national tax revenue. We respectfully request that your ministry instruct the Bureau to make proper and quick arrangements.

### Smooth Cargo Transportation on the Yangtze River

[This newspaper] China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, San Peh Steam Navigation Company, and China National Aviation Corporation all have ships going up and down the river. China National Aviation Corporation's "Minlian" ship has sailed from Shanghai to Chongqing, loaded with a large quantity of hardware and paints, as well as more than 600 pieces of cotton yarn and cotton cloth. The "Minzhong" arrived in Shanghai today from Yichang, but the incoming cargo is unknown. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiangshun" ship also sailed to Chongqing this morning, fully loaded with 1,600 tons of mixed goods, including more than 500 pieces of cotton yarn and cotton cloth. San Peh Steam Navigation Company's "Hongzhen" ship is scheduled to sail to Hankou next Tuesday, and its tonnage is already fully booked.

### Yarn Rises, Cloth Falls

Yesterday, the yarn market was firm. Sporadic transactions between the Tianjin and Guangzhou guilds were not quiet. 20-count yarn generally rose by about 20,000, with the old brand 20-count yarn from Fangjian being the most popular. Due to the fact that Fangjian only offered cone yarn for sale for 42-count double-strand thread the previous day, all of the competitors were turned away empty-handed, which led to an increase of 40,000 to 50,000 for thread yesterday, as there were many people searching for it.

The cloth market was bleak and lifeless. Sales were sluggish, and at the same time, many speculators were dumping their holdings. The prices of Caiqiu Yanghe serge continued to weaken. The price of other fabrics was generally unchanged, and there were very few transactions. Fangjian Company opened sales as usual, with serge priced at 1,250 yuan for "small" and V Longtou at 1,000 yuan for "small."

### White Coal Blocks Surge

After coal merchants watched over and made purchases in the coal market, the supply of spot goods on the market has been extremely scarce in recent days. Therefore, traders who need to purchase coal can only raise prices to compete for purchases. Prices have risen sharply across the board. Because of shortages, small pieces of white coal are also selling well in coal stores, and prices are rising along with the lump coal. The main sales channel for large white coal pieces is for manufacturing coal balls. Recently, due to the strong sales of liquid fuels such as coal oil, the sales channels of coal balls have been greatly affected, so the prices remain stable.

### Price Index Life Insurance; Central Trust Bureau Clarifies Meaning; Charges 2/1000 of Insured Amount; Letter of Reply Takes Effect Immediately, Forms Supplement Later

[This newspaper] The Life Insurance Department of the Central Trust Bureau has launched group life insurance based on the price index to protect the livelihood of the people. In order to make all sectors understand the function of this group life insurance, the Bureau hosted a press conference at 3:00 PM yesterday. The manager of the Bureau, Luo Beichen, first stated the importance of life insurance, and then made several points regarding the special price index group life insurance plan: (1) Motivation: (A) For the outside world, it is purely to protect the livelihood of the people. (B) For the Bureau itself, it is to open up new life insurance business. (2) Principle: To obtain the maximum benefit with the minimum cost. The goal is for this life insurance plan to conform to economic principles. (3) Design Process: The Bureau had previously considered life insurance plans based on rice, wheat, gold, U.S. dollars, and foreign exchange rates, but they were not successful. Finally, it created the price index life insurance plan. (4) Features: (A) The cost of living index unit is used as the insurance unit, and the insured amount of the insured person can automatically increase or decrease with the rise and fall of the cost of living index. (B) No distinction is made between genders. (C) No distinction is made between occupations. (D) No distinction is made between physical strength. (5) Procedures are extremely simple. Any agency or organization that wishes to insure only needs to send a letter to the Bureau. It will take effect immediately after the Bureau sends a letter of approval. The forms are to be completed later. The insurance premium is uniformly calculated at 2/1000 of the insured amount and is collected monthly. (6) The insured amount of the insured person can be as high as ten "cost of living index units," or five million yuan. It can be changed monthly to meet needs. If the insured person unfortunately dies or becomes disabled, compensation will be paid immediately in accordance with the regulations.

### Flour Export; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Another Telegram Request

[This newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on a request from the Tianjin Grain Merchants Association to lift the ban on shipping Shanghai flour to Tianjin, telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Food again yesterday, requesting that the ban on flour exports be lifted. The original telegram stated roughly: (omitted above) According to the current situation, Shanghai flour mills have a surplus of more than 100,000 bags per day. Tianjin also needs to transport southern flour north. Lifting the ban would benefit both sides, while maintaining the original order would hinder both the Shanghai flour mills and the Tianjin people's food supply, which is very clear. Even for the sake of the Shanghai people's food supply, it should be judged whether the flour production and the local sales volume in Shanghai are balanced. Now that there is a surplus production of more than 100,000 bags per day, it is clear evidence that there is a surplus for the people's food supply. It is requested that your esteemed departments adopt the suggestions of the industrial and commercial sectors in Beijing and Shanghai and approve the export of flour, which is in the public interest.

### Central Sand White Coal Rises Again

Yesterday, the sugar market saw the central sand white coal rise again, as the company's allocation of raw sugar to the trade had an expectation of supplying 30,000 bags, but the result was that only 14,100 bags were actually allocated at 47%, so it has recovered to its original price. It is evident that the amount of supply is greatly related to the increase or decrease in price. Other local high-quality sugar is also in tight supply, while lower-quality sugar is flat. Chaoqing sugar saw continuous purchases from the Ningbo group, and the top grade opened at 100,000, and the secondary grade at 98,500 to 95,500 yuan, totaling over one hundred bags. Cotton sugar of fifty to sixty bags sold for 125,000 to 126,000 yuan, Xinghua white sugar for 141,500 to 142,000 yuan, Xinghua red sugar for 117,000 to 118,000 yuan, with over one hundred transactions, and oil-packaged miscellaneous Qing sugar for 90,000 yuan.

### Timber Dull and Weak

The timber market is dull and weak. There are now more imported foreign pine, so the market price has fallen. However, due to the large expenses such as warehousing and loading costs, the price will not plummet drastically. Now, a large amount of ship-side delivery is being dumped on the market, which is cheaper than the market price.

Shanghai Import and Export Statistics for the First Half of the Year

According to statistics released by the Customs, the total value of Shanghai's imports and exports for June of this year is as follows (unit: 1,000 yuan):

June Cumulative from January to June
(1) Imports 122,619,151 347,260,004
(2) UNRRA Goods 31,677,700 106,685,537
(3) Exports 6,717,458 34,794,400
(4) Trade Deficit 115,901,695 312,465,604
(5) Trade Deficit Including UNRRA Goods 147,579,395 419,151,141

Imports for June were still dominated by cotton, followed by Western medicine and chemical products, and then by automobiles and their parts. Exports were dominated by pig bristles, followed by wood and spices, and then by raw silk.

### Today's Longhai Railway

— Xi'an, 3rd (Air Mail) Special Correspondent Li Chi

The entire line's track restoration project has been completed. The Tianbao section is awaiting opening. Work has commenced on the Tianlan section. Direct through train service between Beijing and Shaanxi is being planned.

The Longhai Railway is China's only railway running east-west, starting from Tianshui in Gansu in the west and ending at Haizhou in Jiangsu in the east, connecting the Northwest Plateau and the coastal area of the Huai River. The Longhai Railway Bureau—the headquarters of this railway—is still in Xi'an. Because the location is too far west, it will soon be moved to Zhengzhou, which is closer to the midpoint of the entire line. During the reconstruction period, the Longhai Railway is playing a huge role in transportation. The train cars passing through Xi'an, whether heading east or west, are equally crowded with passengers and cargo. Those who cannot get in are squeezed onto the top of the cars.

Landslides Expected to Decrease

We should start with the west, with the section from Tianshui to Baoji. Construction began during the late stages of the Anti-Japanese War and was only opened to traffic this spring. Because the work was rushed and materials were insufficient, the construction was sloppy and far from meeting engineering standards. In particular, the slope of the mountains was insufficient, so landslides were frequent. Landslides of thousands of cubic meters of loess were "commonplace," and even collapses of tens of thousands of "cubic meters" were not uncommon. Therefore, although the tracks were painstakingly laid, the number of days of traffic in the past few months was clearly much less than the number of days without traffic. In fact, as early as shortly after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War last fall, some "insiders" in railway transportation criticized the authorities for the upside-down priorities, because the section between Luoyang and Tongguan was delayed due to a lack of manpower and materials, while the "Tianbao section" at the west end was being rushed. They predicted the results caused by "landslides" and therefore advocated stopping the construction of the "Tianbao section," moving the materials from that area eastward, and quickly repairing the "Tongluo section" to meet the urgent needs of reconstruction. Now that the "Tianbao" and "Tongluo" sections have been completed one after another, the traffic results prove that if this suggestion had been implemented, many losses could have been reduced.

At 27 kilometers from Tianbao and at the 27th tunnel, there have recently been collapses of huge amounts of earthwork, each exceeding 10,000 "cubic meters." There are also many sporadic landslides along the way. The train has stopped. According to the Railway Bureau, it is expected that all of the landslides will be cleared by mid-August, but if it rains, there may be further delays. Fortunately, rainfall will gradually decrease after September, and landslides are expected to be less frequent in the future. The roadbed earthwork project between Lanzhou and Tianshui has begun. If the Tianbao section can be unimpeded, it will help the progress of the Tianlan section project.

Overview of the Xiantong Branch Line

Baoji is the junction point of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway and the Longhai Railway. For more than half a year, countless Chongqing passengers who could not get seats on Yangtze River ships have transferred to trains in Baoji to return east. The journey is as crowded as it was ten years ago when they fled west.

Xi'an County's western neighbor is Xianyang County. In Xianyang, the Longhai Railway has a "Xiantong Branch Line" that goes directly to Tongguan County, about 200 li north of Chang'an. This is a new railway built during the Anti-Japanese War, mainly used to transport coal from the Tongguan coal mines, for the railway itself and for civilian use along the line. Tongguan has more than 50 coal mines, seven of which have mechanical mining equipment, with a total monthly production of about 50,000 tons. However, the total amount transported by train, animal power, and human labor is only about 20,000 to 30,000 tons per month. At the beginning of the month, a railway bridge on the branch line was damaged by a mountain flood, but it was repaired a month ago. Only then did the Xi'an power plant resume normal power supply. Before that, there had been a power outage for more than 20 days. The coal price in the city has also gradually fallen, but it is still around 145,000 yuan per ton, while it is only sold for 37,000 to 38,000 yuan at the mines. The Railway Bureau is currently expanding a tunnel in the middle of the branch line, so that large locomotives can enter and exit. In this way, the transportation volume will be greatly increased, which will greatly benefit the mines and civilian use along the line. The construction of this tunnel has been going on for two years, and it has only recently been opened. It is known that the project is quite large. By the way, I recently saw several newly published Chinese maps of Shanghai, all of which omitted this branch line. Some even considered the "Tianbao section" as an uncompleted railway. Such errors seem unforgivable.

Directly to Luoyang on the Entire Line

The railway then goes east to Tongguan, where Shaanxi and Henan meet. It suffered through a darkest period during the Anti-Japanese War. The Longhai Railway has to pass through a tunnel there, the so-called 17th tunnel, before the eastward-bound train can enter the "pass" to Tongguan County. During the most critical times, the train could only run at night, with the lights turned off and the windows closed, crawling on the dark roadbed. Across the Yellow River from Tongguan is Fenglingdu, where there are still remains of the artillery positions built by the enemy. In those years, the enemy artillery crazily fired from there, aiming at Tongguan. If a shell hit the tunnel entrance, it could cut off the critical military transport and general transport at the time, reducing the contributions made by the Longhai Railway during the Anti-Japanese War. Fortunately, until the end of the war, the 17th tunnel only suffered severe vibrations from the bursting of shells, and cracks appeared in the tunnel walls, but the train could still pass. However, from the perspective of engineering calculations, it was dangerous.

After the victory last fall, the Longhai Railway Bureau repaired eastward from Tongguan. Repairing the 17th tunnel was also included in the plan. Later, because the track restoration project was tight, and if the tunnel was thoroughly repaired immediately, it would inevitably affect the eastward transport of road construction equipment. It was not until recently, when the entire line had reached Luoyang, that the old matter was brought up again, saying that construction would begin.

Surveying Three Routes

The problem then arose: To repair the tunnel, it is necessary to build another temporary detour road outside the old tunnel to replace the section of track being repaired inside the tunnel. The Longhai Railway Bureau surveyed three routes, two of which had to pass through the town of Tongguan, and one had to bypass the north city wall from outside the west gate and connect to the east station. These three routes all passed through many civilian houses, and it was necessary to demolish them to make way for the detour. Tongguan, a small town, had benefited greatly from the Longhai Railway in the past. The railway had brought wartime prosperity to it. However, the residents of the county town heard the news of the railway rerouting and had already begun to oppose it last year. Although the Railway Bureau had telegraphed the Ministry of Transport to purchase the land occupied by the detour, dividing it into three grades, A, B, and C, according to the highest land price, and the price offered was very high, the county residents still opposed it, saying, "If a detour is built in the city again, the central area of Tongguan will be destroyed. The people of Tongguan County and Town will definitely fight to the end and will never covet the high price." Since they admitted the "high price" but were still not convinced, the situation must be extremely helpless. The residents designed another route, passing through the west and outside the north city wall to Dongguan, which was only about 100 meters longer than the third route mentioned above.

Planning for Through Train Service on the Entire Line

The section from Tongguan to Lingbao Town was the first to be repaired after being damaged during the war, followed by the extension to Shaan County. Between Shaan County and Luoyang, repairs were carried out separately from the east and west ends, borrowing steel rails from other routes. It took a lot of hard work to complete the section at the beginning of last month. The borrowed steel rails were said to be of more than 50 different types, with different weights and lengths. The losses caused by the inability to standardize industrial equipment should be a profound lesson. Between Guanyintang and Xiashi Station on the Shaanluo section, there is a large bridge (Bridge No. 8), and the repair work was extremely difficult. After more than three months of hard work by more than 500 workers, requisitioning all the large timber along the line and the foreign pine timber supplied by UNRRA, it was completed at the end of July. It will be formally tested in the coming days, and if it is good, it will be officially opened to traffic. I'm afraid it won't be more than a few days. This is the last scene of the entire line restoration project of the Longhai Railway. Is it fast? It will soon be the first anniversary of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War.

After Bridge No. 8 is opened to traffic, Shaanxi and Luoyang can be directly connected, without having to change trains halfway like now. The traffic situation between Luoyang and Zhengzhou is still good. There are two routes between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, one is to bypass Xinxiang and cross the Yellow River via a temporary bridge between Xinxiang and Kaifeng; the other is to pass directly through the Zhongmou flood area between Zhengzhou and Kaifeng. Last month, due to the rising Yellow River water, the Xinbian temporary bridge was once interrupted; the Zhongmou railway bridge was also automatically dismantled due to the Yellow River water. It was not until late July that these two routes were restored, but they had to be connected by ferries. The details are beyond the scope of the reporter's report, so I will omit them here.

Finally, I would like to report to the readers in Beijing and Shanghai: The Longhai Railway Bureau is planning through train service on the entire line, abolishing the current sectional train system (now a passenger traveling from Tianshui to Haizhou has to buy seven tickets and change trains six times!). It also plans to connect with the southern section of the Jinpu Railway to form a direct train between Beijing and Shaanxi. This may be realized after the Yellow River water recedes and the Zhongmou railway bridge is repaired again after autumn. This is a very beneficial plan, both for reconstruction work and for east-west freight transport.

Investigation Reveals That the Township Chief of Chashan Is Diligent and Honest and Did Not Arrest Villagers

A letter from the Jinshan County Government states: Dear Editor: We have received your letter regarding the posting of the article "Such a Township Chief," and we have read it carefully. In order to determine the truth of the matter, we extracted the key points and dispatched a competent official to conduct a detailed on-site investigation to clarify the truth. According to the report from the official, the Township Chief of Chashan, Feng Shuliu, read this article and, in order to clarify the truth, has submitted a letter requesting a correction. The villagers of the township also believe that the matter is groundless and are indignant. They have gone everywhere to investigate secretly and openly, and all claim that there is no such fact. Furthermore, merchants and civilians such as Neng Xiehe, Weng Shengxing, and Wang Tongxing have provided written proof stating that Township Chief Feng Shuliu has worked diligently since taking office on December 12 of last year and has been commended by former District Chief Guo. Regarding the claim made by a Chashan villager in the "Reader's Opinions" column of the Shen Bao on July 26 that he was personally detained and extorted by Township Chief so-and-so, resulting in a loss of 20 dan of rice, and that the ignorant villager was also threatened, resulting in a loss of more than 30 dan of rice, and was detained again, these claims are purely false and completely fabricated. Among the more than 500 households in our township, no one has been arrested for committing a crime recently. Since there is no such person, how can there be such a thing? Therefore, the citizens dare to provide evidence that this is the truth. I also met with Township Chief Feng Shuliu and repeatedly questioned him about the facts reported in the newspaper. He replied that there was indeed no such thing in his township, and that he did not know whether there were similar reports in neighboring townships. Therefore, I have compiled a document reporting the findings of the investigation and respectfully request your review. While the investigation was underway, we also received a telegram from Tang Yu and Dong Xingzhuang, the captain and vice-captain of the third detachment of the seventh district team of the Youth Corps of our county, stating that the facts regarding Township Chief Feng Shuliu of Chashan Township being falsely accused, and the evidence provided by merchants and civilians such as Xiehe, are completely consistent. From this, it can be seen that the facts stated in the article were not committed by Township Chief Feng Shuliu of Chashan Township. In addition to ordering the district chief to investigate other townships for similar matters and report back for further investigation, we have specially sent this letter to your publication detailing the investigation and ask that you disclose it in your newspaper to correct any misperceptions. Sincerely, The Jinshan County Government, August 10.

### Preparation for the Asian Labor Conference

— Zhou Shang

Today's world is almost a labor world, and future world issues will likely be mostly labor issues. Labor issues are a product of the Industrial Revolution. The direct confrontation between laborers and capitalists has become an unavoidable reality of modern society. Capitalists want to preserve their "vested interests," while laborers want to obtain their "right to survival." The labor issue is indeed a major problem; if this problem is not resolved, other problems will be difficult to resolve, and the world will forever have troubles and disturbances.

The International Labor Office believes that Asian labor has unique characteristics, so on May 19 of this year, it invited China and other related countries to discuss holding an "Asian Labor Conference." At the beginning of the discussion, there was a dispute over the location of the conference. The Indian representative requested it be held in India, while the Chinese representative naturally requested it be held in China. After some debate, a compromise was reached, resolving to hold a preparatory meeting in India in January of next year, and a formal conference in China the year after.

Now, there are only four full months until the preparatory meeting. In order to prepare for this, the Ministry of Social Affairs recently organized the "Asian Labor Conference Preparatory Committee." The members of this committee are senior officials and experts and scholars from relevant agencies. The formation of this committee seems somewhat late in terms of timing, and the invited committee members are not yet sufficiently comprehensive in terms of experts and scholars. Because the agency representatives are not selected by the agencies and some are not in charge of the relevant matters, there is concern that they may be ineffective. However, the fact that there is this preparation, that it is not sloppy or careless, is truly commendable. After all, there has been great progress in Chinese officialdom.

The countries invited to the Asian Labor Conference are designated as China, India, Siam, and the Philippines. As for whether Korea, Malaya, Annam, Burma, Java, Ceylon, etc., should send representatives or only send advisors has not yet been determined. How the United States, Britain, France, Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, etc., which have close ties with Asia, should participate is still under study. I believe that Korea and the Malay states absolutely, absolutely need to have representatives present with voting rights. The British and Dutch states can only be invited as observers, to assist and guide and listen to the call of this conference. Australia must not be formally included in this Asian conference, firstly because of the different geography; Australia itself is a continent. If it is included in this conference, there will inevitably be a regrettable "mismatch in name." Secondly, their labor standards are very high, and it seems somewhat incompatible to compare them together. Asian Near Eastern countries such as Arabia, Turkey, Afghanistan, and Iran must have representatives to attend the meeting; they are not currently included and must be strongly advocated for. We also hope that the Soviet Union will have observers to join, to see the other side of labor. All these proposals should be decided by a subcommittee authorized by the Board of Directors. Our country has been elected as one of the members of that committee. How will we fulfill the responsibilities of a member, and how will we benefit the laborers of small and weak nations in Asia?

The agenda of the preparatory meeting is divided into four categories: (1) the organization of social security, (2) general labor policies and their implementation, (3) annual implementation plans for social standards set by conventions and recommendations that have not yet been ratified and implemented by the relevant countries, and (4) the general economic background of social policies, including industrialization and other issues. Hidden behind these four major issues are many, many complex problems, and the unique characteristics of Asian labor do not seem to have been fully stated.

I believe that the special characteristics of Asian labor issues, different from those in Europe and the United States, are twofold: one is colonial-style labor, and the other is overseas Chinese labor. Industry in various parts of Asia is backward, and foreign economic aggression stifles development, which has made industrialization impossible. After the war, foreign goods flooded in, exacerbating the severity of the problem. Therefore, the Asian labor issue is not only a simple economic problem, or a political problem, or a political and economic problem, but a comprehensive integration of national, political, and economic issues. The Asian labor issue is already inseparable from the national issue. To be liberated from the oppression of international capitalism, only the liberation of the national issue can lead to the liberation of the labor issue.

Overseas Chinese labor is closely related to colonial labor. In places where there are many indigenous people in colonies, the necessary labor can certainly utilize the labor of the indigenous people. However, if the indigenous people are not yet civilized and are still engaged in a naive, self-sufficient economic life, their labor is not suitable for the colonialists' capitalist management purposes. Therefore, it is not possible to follow the principle of free contract, and direct or indirect coercion is often used. In colonies with few indigenous people and low efficiency, it is necessary to prevent the emigration of indigenous people and promote the immigration of foreign laborers. Under the characteristics of colonial labor policy, our overseas Chinese laborers become victims.

The most extreme form of forced labor is the slave system, which enslaves the indigenous people on the one hand, and imports slaves from outside on the other. Foreign slaves, like livestock, are merely providers of labor, and their labor is exploited as much as possible. The profits of the slave trade are often from 50% to 200%. Coolie labor is a variation of slavery. In the mid-19th century, after the partition of Southeast Asia by the great powers, Chinese people changed from free immigrants to contract immigrants. Contract immigration involves foreign governments or commercial organizations recruiting laborers in China, and the term and treatment are stipulated in a specific contract, which actually contains the nature of slave trade, which is what we call "selling piglets" and foreigners call "coolie trade." Chinese people are able to endure hardship, are obedient, and have low wages, making them the most suitable laborers, especially in subtropical and tropical regions. White people are not adapted to the climate, and the indigenous people are lazy. There is no one more suitable for labor than the Chinese people. Therefore, various countries compete to recruit contract Chinese laborers.

Even today, there is still harsh contract Chinese labor recruitment. For example, recently, the British company Great Britain Lien-zhi Company recruited three translators, 216 mechanics, and 970 laborers in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces to work on the islands of Ocean Island and Nauru Island. There are many harsh provisions in the recruitment charter. For example, the recruited Chinese laborers must be selected by the company's Hong Kong agent, Li Rongshidon Company, and examined by a doctor. However, it is also stipulated that the Chinese laborers must undergo another examination by the local government before landing. Those who do not meet the standards will be sent back to Hong Kong. This is tantamount to canceling the Hong Kong inspection. If unfair treatment is encountered before landing, the Chinese laborers will suffer losses, and the company will not care. The daily working hours are as long as nine hours or more, which is clearly inconsistent with the eight-hour working system decided by the International Labor Conference. The compensation for death due to work is only the worker's full-year salary, which is too little. The compensation fee in the UK is usually 36 to 40 months of the worker's income, why do you discriminate against me? These are all issues, and I hope that the authorities will make a special proposal during the conference.

Moreover, it is said that the Chinese laborers in the Siberian region of Russia endure harsh winds and ice on their beards, and after hard work, the wages they earn cannot be remitted to their homeland to support their parents and wives. When returning home, luggage and clothing are strictly restricted, and cash is absolutely not allowed to be taken out of the country. With such special treatment, what should be done during the conference?

The collection of materials for the conference is also a crucial issue. The sanctity of labor did not originate in the West. In ancient China, labor was highly respected. Isn't there a record of the "Examination of Craftsmen"? "The country has six offices, and artisans occupy one of them." This time, Chinese labor data must be collected universally and in depth. The deadline for collection is November of this year. Within these three months, we must make double the effort and sweat. We must gather the sweat and blood of many people, concentrate our efforts, and work diligently without any slack. Relevant government agencies, from the central to the local levels, should have specialized personnel to bury themselves in the work of comprehensive analysis. The original materials obtained by relevant academic institutions, schools, newspapers, social groups, and even individual research institutes should be diligently requested from them. The person in charge of collection must be like mercury, penetrating everywhere. Because this conference is a groundbreaking one. Because this conference is to be compared with India, Siam, and other countries, nothing can be done without materials, and it is truly self-defeating not to collect the available materials. At the same time, the Chinese people should automatically contribute everything they know and have to the conference. This is not to show off, it is a matter of national honor.

In addition to the agenda, future proposals should also be based on conscience, with many temporary proposals. The speeches at the conference, the speeches of labor and capital, must be studied with some thought. The most important thing is that the figures spoken by each person must be absolutely the same. At this time, the organization of a proposal group is urgently needed. Our country can have at least twenty people in the delegation. The selection of such people must be based on standards, and it is necessary to find specialists in various fields. Because the effectiveness of everything depends on people. Not just anyone can go to the meeting, otherwise, the topic will not be addressed, and only deepen our shame. The selection of personnel must be decided within the next month so that everyone can prepare early, to avoid digging a well when facing the sea.

There are approximately seven million overseas Chinese workers scattered throughout Asia. They must have their own voice at the conference, which is a matter of course. Is it reasonable to be a representative of local labor and capital? Can we negotiate with the local people without causing competitive conflicts? Will there be policy contradictions with the ruling government? What techniques do we use to achieve satisfactory results for all three parties? All these require prior arrangements and preparations.

Forewarned is forearmed; unprepared, undone. We must prepare quickly, preparing to hold a thorough conference. (Written on the 35th, 8th, and 14th in the capital.)

### "Orphans, Widows, Poor, and Sick" Cry Out for Food, Hoping Compassionate Readers Will Provide a Steady Stream of Assistance

Let everyone come to save the most pitiful people in society!

Since the "Orphans, Widows, Poor, and Sick Relief Fund" entrusted to this newspaper by Elder Qingxia began operating on June 29, a total of four batches, 24 people, have been approved, with an expenditure of 1.82 million yuan in subsidies. To date, there is a surplus of 291,000 yuan, and recently, letters of request from "orphans, widows, the poor, and the sick" in this city have been received almost daily. There are also lonely old and young people coming to the newspaper office to ask for relief. In addition to expressing sympathy and comfort, we really feel helpless to provide assistance! In this Shanghai, where people from all walks of life gather, from heaven to hell, the unequal distribution of happiness and suffering cannot be fully described in words. The miserable situation of this group of orphans and helpless people is even worse than that of ordinary poor people. Our purpose in providing "orphans, widows, the poor, and the sick" relief is no different from lending a hand to them in a deep pit of fire and water. However, to save them, even the minimum passive measures require money. Where does the money come from? This is an urgent issue. We hope that compassionate and loving readers will lend a hand and donate some money, whether it is 10,000 or 20,000 yuan, or even better, 50,000 or 100,000 yuan. Small amounts add up to make them all survive in hopeless situations. The merit is truly immeasurable.

### Selfish Good People

— Zhao Dan

Before an actor plays a role, someone always asks him, "Are you playing a good guy or a bad guy?" This makes it difficult for an experienced actor to answer, because the personality of a character cannot really be encompassed by the two words "good guy" and "bad guy." For example, Hu Si in "Sunrise" is a 27-year-old young man; if you say he is a righteous young man, he is actually an idler; if you say he is a villain, he does not plot anything or do anything bad. Especially for an actor, he should not be confined by this bloodless and meaningless term. Otherwise, he will play all the characters into a completely identical stereotype. An actor's creation of a character must start from his inner emotions and thoughts; after he has completed the creation of this character and expressed it on the screen or stage, then it is up to others to affirm or deny its existence value. Therefore, we should not call a living, flesh-and-blood character by that vague and general term, nor should we simply determine the identity of a character in that way, but should start from their thoughts and emotions.

This time in "Distant Love," I am playing a professor. This role simply cannot be encompassed by a fixed term. The director once joked, "A bad guy who is not a bad guy." Like such a character, neither villain nor righteous, neither affirmation nor denial can encompass the character's personality and actions. So, how should this be said? In my opinion, it should be said: a selfish good person whose thinking remains in the 1940s.

### How to Learn Kunqu Opera

— Xuan Lu

Recently, the trend of learning Kunqu opera has become quite popular. National institutions of higher learning, in accordance with the Ministry's regulations, have mostly established "Kunqu Selections" credits in the compulsory curriculum of the Chinese Literature Department of the School of Liberal Arts to impart knowledge. There are also many elegant people in society who take pleasure in humming a few Kunqu opera tunes, and even young ladies from prominent families are enthusiastically participating. So-called Kunqu societies and elegant gatherings have become fashionable for a time. In China, there is no lack of people who simply seek entertainment and cater to the current trends, but there are also many who are moved by the beautiful art of music, who are concerned that this tune is about to become extinct, and who therefore sacrifice a part of their spirit to explore the true essence of national music, and who take it as their responsibility to continue what is broken, preserve what remains, revive what is in decline, and repair what is damaged.

However, this art has been declining for a long time, and the lack of talents is particularly severe today. Generally, those who teach in institutions of higher learning have more than enough literary talent, but are not familiar with the ancient laws. When they teach Kunqu opera, they simply select a few short tunes or scattered suites from books such as "Yongxi Music Palace," "Yangchun White Snow," "New Sounds from the Court and the Countryside," and "Excerpts from Lyrical Orders," or select a few Northern and Southern tunes from books such as "Selections from Yuan Drama," "Prosperous Ming Miscellaneous Drama," or "Sixty Kinds of Kunqu Opera," and ask students to recite and chant them. When they lecture on Kunqu studies, they simply pick up the leftovers of recent scholars such as Wang Guowei and Wu Mei and make no new discoveries. As for how to coordinate with the musical modes and how to accompany with wind and string instruments, the teachers are not familiar with it, and the students have never heard of it. In other words, the musical component of Kunqu opera has been abandoned, and attention is paid only to the literary component. As a result, teaching Kunqu opera is no different from teaching poetry, and learning Kunqu opera is no different from learning poetry. Teaching this unique art in such a way, there is little hope that Kunqu opera can be preserved.

Secondly, those who teach Kunqu opera in society are so-called flute teachers, commonly known as "paixian" (short for "paiqu xiansheng," or "tune-beating teacher"), who are mostly former veteran actors or those who play accompaniment in the Liyuan Garden (i.e., the so-called "stage"), and although their art has been passed down from teachers, they mostly have art but no learning, that is, they have art but have not progressed to the Tao.

Those who teach Kunqu opera are no more than the above two types of people, so it is inevitable that our country's Kunqu opera will be lost. Why do I say this? Because those who learn Kunqu opera under the professors of universities only know how to read Kunqu opera like reading poetry, and compose Kunqu opera like writing poetry. As for the achievements and advantages of Kunqu opera in music and drama, they "regret not learning." Those who learn Kunqu opera under the flute teachers only know how to open their throats and rest, but do not know what Kunqu studies are, or what Kunqu laws are, just like parrots learning to speak, similar but only similar. What is the meaning of it, they stare blankly and do not know how to respond. The two do not run parallel without contradicting each other, but actually go in opposite directions and become disjointed. It is no wonder that the art of Kunqu opera is gradually dying out and even perishing.

The author has been a university professor, teaching the "Kunqu Selections" course in the School of Liberal Arts, and has also been a volunteer flute teacher, participating in so-called Kunqu societies and elegant gatherings. Having personally experienced the joys and hardships of both, I can still speak about them briefly.

I believe that there are three steps to learning Kunqu opera: first, tune recitation; second, music notation; and third, composition. These three must be advanced step by step, and it is not possible to leapfrog ahead, but because of their close and inseparable relationship, it is absolutely impossible to abandon the other two when advancing to a certain stage. In other words, although those who are learning tune recitation have not yet reached the stage of music notation, they cannot fail to understand the theories and rules of music notation and composition. Otherwise, their learning process will be twice the effort for half the result, and the level they can only achieve will be mechanical and lack artistic spirituality. At the same time, those who learn composition must also be proficient in the skills of music notation and tune recitation, and those who learn music notation must also be rich in the talent of composition and tune recitation. Otherwise, it will be like armchair strategy, impractical, and will also encounter obstacles everywhere, making it impossible to write. Because the relationship between the three is linked in a chain, and absolutely cannot be severed. Today's Kunqu opera learners, whether they come from the School of Liberal Arts of a university or from a Kunqu society, all cut this chain into three, and this is a major reason for the decline of Kunqu opera.

According to the author's view, although it is not necessary to advance the three (composition, music notation, and tune recitation) at the same time when learning Kunqu opera, the teacher must integrate the three into one furnace, so that the students can have the joy of drawing inferences from one instance and avoid the suffering of playing the se with glued-down pegs. Therefore, the teaching method should be different from the traditional mechanical and rigid teacher-student transmission method.

I believe that teaching any discipline must have a plan. This plan must first conduct a complete observation of the entire picture of this discipline, and then dissect it in an organized manner, so as to divide it into several equally spaced parts that are interconnected, and then formulate a schedule according to the depth and difficulty of each part, differentiating between the order of precedence. Such a division of equal parts, divided into stages, combined to form a whole, is a planned teaching method. Learning any discipline cannot escape this formula. As for Kunqu opera, because it has not yet become an organized discipline, and scholars are mostly accustomed to the traditional teacher-student transmission method and do not know how to reform, so no planned teaching method has yet been produced. The author, despite his ignorance, intends to make an attempt in this regard.

### Diana Ping and Her Half-Year-Old Daughter.

### Watching the Performance of "Spring Cold"

— Kou Jiabi

When "Spring Cold" was performed in Chongqing the year before last winter, not only was the audience packed, but it also received unanimous praise from the news and cultural circles. Especially the acting skills of the actors left an indelible impression on my mind.

In this hot summer, "Spring Cold" opened at the "Lyceum". Most of the actors were the original cast. Tao Jin played the old doctor Zhou Pu. He not only grasped a typical appearance, but also excavated the character's inner personality to the depths of his soul. I saw a Zhou Pu on stage who was simple in life, upright in character, serious in attitude, and kind in heart, but I didn't see Tao Jin's spirit of "hitting the vital point."

The female doctor Fang Jieru, through the creation of Shu Xiuwen, who had artistic cultivation, became a living being with flesh and blood. She revealed the character's sincere enthusiasm, empty dreams, pure heart, and weak will without reservation, winning the audience's infinite sympathy. Although the actress fulfilled her greatest duty, because the character itself was limited by the script, she could not show her high level of performing arts in the process of performing.

In many plays, I have seen that all the villains are played by the actors as so-called negative characters. This is because the actors want to achieve a strong effect on the audience, so they try their best to make people disgusted in their dialogues and actions. He Zhiyuan in "Spring Cold" is a big man. He is a character who makes money in the pool of eating people. He hides his sinister heart and despicable means under a generous and solemn appearance and a noble temperament. He is indeed a unique archetype in today's society. Zong You performed very well, but his speech was not in line with the public.

Liu Li played the young boy He, but his dialogue and actions were not unconstrained enough, lacking a slippery air. Bai Chen played Section Chief Ren Boqin, and he had already achieved the insidious and treacherous character, but his dialogue was too low, and many lines were unclear. Jiang acted as the county magistrate rarely exhibiting much Yang, only achieving a simple appearance and a clean heart, lacking a strong temperament and the status of a county magistrate, so his performance was not very capable. Xia Tian played Ren Shiqi, the president of Tongshan Society, and created a complete character for him, but his makeup was too old. His performing actions, tone, and expression all showed that he was relatively young. Therefore, I felt that he was old but "too" strong.

Tong Man read Zheng Xu fen, the little nurse, Fang Bo played Wu Ziqing, the principal, Wang Wei played Mrs. Cai, the principal's wife, and Qiang Ming played Wu Qi, the reporter. Although they were in secondary positions in the play, they all fulfilled their due responsibilities and were just right. In short, the artistic level of this performance was more in-depth than Dai Qing's performance.

In just one month, I watched four plays, and I also saw many famous and accomplished actors. Their performances can indeed make the audience clap their hands and applaud, but in the entire performance, there is a lack of collective cooperation, and it cannot become a complete performance. Although the actors in "Spring Cold" have their strengths and weaknesses, they are serious about theatrical art, their attitude is serious, and their spirit is always tireless. In this period of drama misfortune, we need more solemn performances and complete artistic works.

### Review of "A Family of Loyalty and Righteousness"

— Zhu Defeng

Qin Yi in "Distant Love"

"A Family of Loyalty and Righteousness" is the first domestic film after the victory. It finally met the cultural circles on August 5 at the Great Light Cinema. This long-awaited first dystocia film is of course to be given special attention and viewed in a different light. According to the general comments in recent days, there are divergent opinions, each with its own reason, and even started a war of words!

Here, based on my personal prejudice, I would like to say a few words. First of all, I want to say: this is a movie worth seeing by the general public, and even a movie that must be seen. The story is very ordinary, depicting the cruelty of the enemy and puppets and the ugliness of traitors during the period when Shanghai was occupied. It develops its story with a family that is hardworking, enduring, loyal, and steadfast. Here are: blockades and food shortages, rice dealers being robbed and shot, enemy soldiers letting dogs bite people, buying household registration rice and being flogged, being forced to subscribe to the "Xin Shen Bao", using public office for private revenge to be caught by the military police team and forced to drink water and be subjected to electric shocks, searching for terrorists, and other cruel acts, all in full view. I believe that people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time, these scenes are all facts that they have heard and witnessed in the previous period; perhaps many people have experienced them; although time will pass and they will forget, it is inevitable that their impressions will fade. Watching this movie is like reliving the past, which will make you feel cold and your hair stand on end; it will arouse a kind of angry emotion and a psychology of revenge.

On the other hand, the Hua family? It just shows the spirit of righteousness that cannot be subdued by force or tempted by wealth. Liu Qiong plays two roles alone. Although there is little room for young Wei Gang to play, there is a lot of room for him to play the old father.

The atmosphere of the whole play is very sad, making the audience's emotions sink into the painful plot. I secretly saw many female audience members wiping their tears with handkerchiefs, which proves that this film has received the due effect in the hearts of the audience.

### Weekly Movie Short Review

— Zhu Xi

There are still very few particularly good movies this week. "Loyal Dog Seeks Master" is better, but it seems that the director lacks strength in the part of the people.

Loyal Dog Seeks Master

The script is simple, but the insertion of the old rural couple and the two street performers is not bad. The director's handling of the dog is excellent. Lan Xi's eyes are very deep and touching. The ferocity of the big black dog and the cuteness of the little white dog are both very successful. However, apart from the old couple in the countryside, the people are not good. In the grand reunion scene between the little master and Lan Xi, the atmosphere can be lowered on the side of the little master before he is seen, because it is easier to create a good climax after the lowering.

You Feng Xi Long

The story is completely Americanized. The director often creates good jokes and has a unique writing style. Several characters, such as the detective, the shopkeeper, and the old man, are interspersed well.

Li Quelen plays the best, naturally depicting the personalities of the characters in the play.

The ending is not bad, not clichéd.

Fire Line Heroine

The play is calm and only becomes active after being straightforward. The handling is not bad, but it is too long, which is also where the director has not succeeded.

Claudette Colbert is very competent. Sonny Tufts made his debut on the screen here, and his performance is not bad.

The plane bombing is not as good as the opening of "Bataan Island Bloodbath", so it is said that the director is not outstanding.

Silver Screen Orioles

Introduces forty-eight starlets, but unfortunately, none of them have good results. However, here we can see several conversation scenes of Bao Caiqi, which are quite flexible and solid. However, the music team and dancing tricks of six groups of dozens of people are all terrible because he did not give them a wide enough space, which is Bao Caiqi's biggest mistake.

A Socialite's Love Affairs

When light comedies are quite scarce, this film is Liao Hua in Shu, but when such films come in droves, it will be relatively inferior, as long as you compare it with "Professional Woman" and "You Feng Xi Long".

Except for some small gimmicks in the dialogue, the whole film has no brilliance in terms of technique, such as the several repetitive interior scenes in the car, which also seem very boring.

Across the Pacific

The scattered script is the biggest problem of the play. Humphrey Bogart does not show his personality. Mary Astor plays the worst. In comparison, the two Chinese actors are more successful, but they are not very clever.

The director is good in a few scenes, which is in the first half. In the second half, he, like the screenwriter, entered a sleepy state.

Double-Gun Lone Ranger

This is the worst film. The director has no spirit in the whole film. The first scene seems to be able to be deleted. The scene of the strong man fighting the villain at the end is too hasty. Even Sonny Tufts, who has the best performance, did not create a good atmosphere when he was sentenced to hang.

White Perlan Brighton plays the best and is a promising member.

The best actors in this time are listed below:

(1) Lan Xi (dog), in "Loyal Dog Seeks Master".

(2) Li Que Lun, in "You Feng Xi Long".

(3) White Perlan Brighton, in "Double-Gun Lone Ranger".

There are too few good actors this week, and it is simply impossible to pull them out. Reluctantly speaking, Claudette Colbert in "Fire Line Heroine" and Roti Aikers in "Loyal Dog Seeks Master" can be listed as second-class.

Spring and Autumn

### Duponno

— Xi Shou

Henri Duvernois (1875-1936) was born in Paris and was a versatile and intelligent writer. His output was as abundant as an inexhaustible spring. He wrote more than seventy volumes in his lifetime. Duvernois left his family very early and lived a wandering life. At first, he worked as a recorder in the Charpentier Bookstore and met many celebrities. Around the age of twenty, he worked hard to write and submit articles to newspapers (Le Journal), Parisian Life (Vie Parisienne), Femina, and other publications. He wrote in a humorous, relaxed, and interesting style, writing everything that could make the writer happy. In 1903, he published his first full-length novel, The Iron Reed (Le Roseau ce ler). The following year, he published Husband and Wife's Bed (Nane ou le lit conjugal), which showed some talent. He was not complacent and continued to work hard, writing Crapotte (1908), which immediately shocked the French literary world.

Duvernois mostly wrote about what he had seen with his own eyes, because in his wandering youth, he had already met a group of vagrants, mad girls, ridiculous inventors, frivolous people, rogues, and swindlers, etc. He collected them all into his novels. Fifinoiseau (1913, short story collection), The Dog Who Speaks (Le chien qui parle, 1913, short story collection), etc., are all his small masterpieces. Duvernois's first period of works contained a bit of superficial optimism and were mostly inseparable from the scenes on the street, which can be simply called street literature.

Since Duvernois matured, he had a deeper understanding of life. His second period of great works can be modeled on the novel Dead Beast (Morte la bete 1925). Duvernois mixed the funny with the tragic, thought with emotion, and had moved far away from the street and abandoned superficial optimism.

Duvernois's third period of works was biased towards drama. His attractive dialogue was praised by the public. During this period, he initially wrote some short plays and small comedies, such as The Club of Mandarin Ducks (Le club ces canards Mandarins), which was a resounding success. The characters and themes in Duvernois's plays were mostly drawn from his previous novels.

Duvernois was a keen observer who expanded his impressions and used a novel pen, giving people a new concept. His rich imagination was truly amazing. He wrote about all kinds of individual characters in an engaging way. Duvernois was a first-class contemporary French writer. He created many characters, as active and moving as Balzac. He told those events in a low and light tone, like telling secrets, dealing with those familiar characters in a realistic attitude. Superb technique combined with rich emotions, humor, and unpredictable endings, gave us the feeling that each work was his best masterpiece. Now, most writers escape from reality to fantasy, while Duvernois is the opposite, escaping from fantasy to reality. Duvernois is a writer who only knows Parisian society and specializes in writing about Parisian customs.

### Uncle Big Head Cried!

— Harry

When Fan Datou first arrived in Xicun, people said he was a monster because his head was terribly big, bright, and bald, without a single hair, and his face was covered with scars, like a three-dimensional map. The skin of his left eyelid was turned up by a scar, so his eyes seemed to be angry forever!

As time went by, people realized that he was a good man. He worked hard and thriftily, he liked children, and he often told them stories, listening to each child so attentively that their saliva dragged at the corners of their mouths, a foot long.

One day, the sun was hanging high, without a single piece of floating cloud. Along a stream, Fan Datou hesitated alone, with his head down and his face not looking very good. Suddenly, a group of children swarmed over:

"Uncle Big Head, tell us a story!"

"Don't make noise! I'm not in the mood today!" He said, shrinking his right hand into his sleeve, grabbing the cuff, and wiping it all over his bald head.

"Hmm, tell us! We all want to listen." The children were concerned about his coarse cloth shirt, one pulled at it, the other pushed it; Fan Datou looked at this group of innocent lives, and two shadows floated in his mind...

He finally sat down on a large rock by the stream, "cough!" Spitting a mouthful of yellow phlegm into the stream, and then wiping his lips with his sleeve.

"Okay, let me tell you another story! Once upon a time, there was a carpenter, who had a wife and a son. Because of thrift, the family was still doing well. His wife was so virtuous! She was busy with housework all day long, and when the carpenter returned, she had to serve her man to wipe his body and wash his feet. She never spoke loudly, was considerate to her husband, and also liked children, she...."

——He kept his head down, looking at the water illuminated by the sun into millions of pieces of gold and silver, his eyes were rolling, full of tears.

"That child was also really likable, with a round face, big eyes, dark and black, looking at people, as dazzling as this water!

——He bent down, subconsciously holding the flowing water in his hands, a few drops of tears fell into the flow, none of the children noticed.

"At that time, like you, I told stories to people every day. He was very well-behaved, never making a fuss, and would even sing along with adults... But out of nowhere, a war broke out. The planes dropped a big bomb with a rumbling sound. Damn it, it landed right at the carpenter's door, ah! That was scary! Boom...."

"Ah! Then what about the carpenter and his wife and children?"

"Don't interrupt! Alas, I will never forget it. The child cried and shouted for his mother, the woman held the child tightly, just a burst of sound, boom, the bomb flew straight towards their heads, only ah, everything was over... The smoke and fog became a mess. I, no, that carpenter wanted to rush over, but it was too late, letting the flames spray on his face, burning like needles...."

He stopped here; his hand, trembling, touched his face, which was covered with sores!

"Did the carpenter never see his wife and children again?"

The children asked hesitantly.

"Hmm!" Some sobs.

"Then what about the carpenter? Tell us! Uncle Big Head, what happened later?"

"Carpenter, carpenter... Alas! What else is there to say? Children, I only hope that you will never see war again in your life!"

"Hey! Uncle Big Head, why is your face wet, are you crying?"

"Uncle Big Head is crying!"

Yes, Uncle Big Head cried, loudly, with infinite anger, resentment, and sorrow.

### Joining the Army (World Honorary Selection)

— Gore, Curator of the Zang London Guild of Fine Arts

Gore (W.H. Gore) was educated in art since childhood and entered the Royal Academy in 1880. "Joining the Army" was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1885. The background is the pasture of Kenannt Village, where the author grew up. The man in the painting has been conscripted into the army and is separating from his wheat. The sad feeling is overflowing the screen, which makes people want to cry.

### · Under the Eaves ·

— Zhang Baihuai

That stubborn girl cried. Her face sadly showed the sallow color of malnutrition. The unfortunate mother stood beside her, with a shadow of sadness in her eyes.

"Go," the woman said helplessly: "No one will laugh, what does it matter to be barefoot! ..."

The weak girl suddenly cried even more sadly! Her tearful eyes stared at the raindrops under the eaves, holding a pair of small white cloth shoes with red trim, and wiping her tears with another thin little hand.

This is a sad thing. Does a child who is already ten years old not understand that not having a father is an irreparable regret in life?

I know how the girl's father died. This unfortunate woman will never forget it...

That man left silently. When he was still alive, maybe he could still give them a little happiness. I remember him as such a short man, his round eyes were dull and empty; his liver-colored lips were thick and upturned, as if he would not forgive anyone.

In the kitchen, he did the lowest-grade chores, washing dishes, carrying water, and wiping tables. He did not smile, and rarely spoke, even if he occasionally resisted someone's curse, it was just a vague roar that could not be heard.

He was often shirtless. He had no clothes to wear. His dark skin, thin face, and shaved head made people feel sorry for him just looking at him. Now this woman, his surviving wife, is the same as him; her hair is loose and dirty, and the pair of feet in the broken shoes make people think that she has probably not washed them with water for half a month. They only earned two meals.

It seems like a very, very long road has passed, but that was only last autumn.

The terrible plague danced in the village like a soul-reaping ghost, and at the same time, it was rumored that the enemy would soon arrive with burning and killing. It was a chaotic and sad season.

That man, alas, I really don't want to be trampled on by this painful impression again. His feet were exposed with cave-like red and swollen sores, but he still勉强 carried water bucket after bucket. Later, the woman temporarily replaced his labor, no, from then on she would always replace his labor.

There was a new pile of yellow soil on the hillside, and it was said that it was buried with two pieces of wood.

The woman's eyes were swollen terribly. The heart of sympathy was also swollen terribly, and what made the woman shed her last tear was the baby, who was only seven or eight months old, who also closely followed her unfortunate father and completed a life experience in the terror of the plague...

At this moment, I stood dumbfounded under the eaves, listening to the child sobbing. The morning sky was drizzling, and a series of impressions were cutting my memory. I knew she had sent her daughter to the nearby National School, but I didn't know that the child didn't understand her mother's heart.

"What is she crying about again?"

"It's raining, saying that other people have overshoes and she doesn't have overshoes, she refuses to go to school..."

At this time, a girl with two small braids walked past me. She was wearing a black dress, carrying a purple-red schoolbag, and her new rubber shoes were black and shiny. She looked at me and put up her umbrella, proudly walking into the misty rain.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

Within a few months, her parents, one after the other, passed away. (There were many who died of grief in those times). She, a girl of fifteen or sixteen, at least had the heart and the plan. She first tried to close the shop. Closing a shop, how easy could it be? Under those circumstances, closing a shop was at least ten thousand times more difficult than opening one. Yet she managed to close it successfully. Although she didn't get a decent price, she managed to get some money back. Her plan was to go through the pass, to Beiping, or to Jinan. She had some classmates in Beiping and some old relatives in Jinan.

"At that time, I couldn't explain why, but after talking to her for a few words, I became very concerned." Tsurumi noticed the letter I had shown him and stared at it blankly. "Afraid that she might encounter ruffians or something, I accompanied her all the way home."

"You could say she was quite beautiful, not as artificial as Japanese women, and not as delicate as Chinese women. In my eyes, she could be described as healthy and beautiful. Innocent yet with a hint of cleverness, lively, but not frivolous—quite dignified. I say dignified, but you must know she was only fifteen or sixteen at that time."

"At that time, I was determined to make something of myself, so I wanted to seize the opportunity to cultivate some pure, healthy, new blood, so in the conversation, I gave her a little hint."

The next day, Tsurumi got her a pass, because at that time, the General Staff Headquarters was above all else, and Tsurumi was quite popular in the department, so he easily got the matter settled. At the same time, Tsurumi drafted a study plan for her and sent a subordinate to escort her secretly to Beiping.

From then on, Yaoqun, this daughter of the Northeast, was always under Tsurumi's protection. He directed her to a very prestigious missionary university, and her every move was reported. Whether spiritually or temperamentally, as soon as Yaoqun felt any unease, Tsurumi immediately improved or made up for it. After three years in university, Tsurumi felt that her general knowledge was sufficient, and at the same time, there were other opportunities, so he wrote a letter, advising her to leave the pass immediately and learn some special skills, skills indispensable for a career—shooting, jujutsu, first aid, reconnaissance, surveying, photography, code breaking, radio communication, military knowledge, horsemanship, driving, etc. The teacher was a special person, a Westerner who had naturalized in China.

"She is already an adult now. Her physique has grown to the right standard." Tsurumi became more and more excited, "I often sneak a peek when she is practicing, and I see that she is really diligent and willing to work hard."

"Brother, she is really in pain—mental depression—because she always thought that my surname was Gu, a Chinese soldier (a puppet soldier, but a person with ambition, ability, and a special mission). She corresponded with me in Beiping, and I had her send it to the Shenyang Post Office for forwarding. When I got outside the pass, I canceled this method and told her that I had traveled far away to other places."

"She is not a fool. She tried a few tricks to find out my whereabouts from her teacher. But, do you think she could succeed? She couldn't get any information from the post office either. Her only hope is the imagined words 'special mission.' This is also my only magic weapon to relieve her mental instability."

"Why don't I see her?" Tsurumi tried to suppress his emotions, but he couldn't hide a kind of pain. "Brother, please tell me, can I see her...?"

Speaking of this, Tsurumi stared at me sadly for a while, then gradually lowered his head, gradually crossed his strong and flexible hands, propped up his forehead, and covered his face. This is perhaps called "A hero's spirit is shortened by sentimental affection."

I also felt a kind of inexplicable loss, and instinctively picked up the thick stack of long letters again:

"Mr. Gu, I always remember that you said in one of your letters, 'When there are troubles in the country, maybe that's when we will meet.' You see, the affairs inside the pass have already started, haven't they? Why don't you let me meet you? Don't you need help?

"The only reason I can think of is that, although we have only had one or two short meetings, we have been friends for five or six years, and emotionally, we may be more than just casual acquaintances; you are afraid that once we meet, we will fall into the trap of ordinary love, thus delaying our cause."

### Not Mistaken

— Shao Fu

A relative complained to me that he has been very worried about his housing and children (collectively called students) recently. He originally lived in a friend's house, but the landlord sold the house, and he had to move out. Where should he move to? There are many advertisements in the newspaper saying that houses require so many "gold bars" to take over, or so many "gold bars" to transfer, and he is not mistaken. He also knows how much each "gold bar" is worth, but the "gold bars" just don't listen to him.

He has five children in school. He thought that the provincial and municipal schools have already been tested, and he can't afford private schools. What should he do with his children? Fortunately, he caught up with the second enrollment of municipal middle schools, so he followed the enrollment advertisement in the newspaper and found a school closer to his friend's house to register his children. When he ran to the school, he saw a sign posted at the door saying that the school had "long" moved to a new location. He ran to the new location (the old and new locations are three or four miles apart). He walked straight into the office from the school gate and did not see any notices or signs indicating registration. Two staff members were sitting in the office, lazily saying: "Registering today? Our school has "long" decided that it is September 1st." He flipped through the newspaper he brought with him, and the school clearly stated the old address and that it was indeed the day to register. He was not mistaken.

Regarding housing, we hope that the actual elimination of transfer fees and bribes will prevent Shanghai's houses from being inextricably linked with "gold bars" forever. Regarding schools playing this kind of inexplicable game of snatching flowers to waste students' and parents' time and energy, we really can't think of any appropriate reason to treat students and parents as if they are asking for trouble.

Sighing and groaning, I wonder if the municipal authorities are as disgusted with this kind of thing as we are?

### Education, Education, Education!

— Chen Yu

Because demand exceeds supply, the post-war recovery has brought many students, and recently there has been a shortage of schools again. Generally, public schools, due to the limited number of places, only want fewer students, not more. Teachers are happy to mark fewer papers, and school authorities can also reduce some troubles. As for the students outside the school gate, no matter how crowded they are, the school always ignores them, like a streetcar ticket seller, ignoring you. Private schools, although they want to accommodate more students to ease some expenses, but years of poor education, coupled with a serious housing shortage, even if they can barely maintain and not close down or change careers, they can't even think of establishing new schools, let alone have the surplus power to expand and improve!

Teachers who have been poor for many years seem to be able to vent some resentment, but this is not the time to vent resentment, nor is it an opportunity to hoard and profit. It is such a serious education problem. Can we just stand by and watch its evolution?

The emergency solution, of course, cannot be expected to be solved by the restoration of all schools. The only options here are to expand the number of places and add more classes. This is still easier for public schools to handle. Schools may apply to the authorities to allocate more enemy property, immediately stop selling enemy and puppet properties, and quickly find ways to renovate and use them.

During the founding of the country, education is the most important thing. Indeed, the importance of education in the founding of the country can be imagined. However, let's see how many educational supplies, such as books and instruments, have been imported since the victory a year ago. How much enemy property has been confiscated and allocated for higher education? On the contrary, it is often heard that soldiers occupy school buildings, such as the problems of Xinben and other schools, haven't they been going on for a long time? There is also the National Fudan University, which is said to have decided to run a summer school to prevent its dormitories from being occupied. Do you think it's interesting?

Thinking of the model airplane competition the day before yesterday, someone said that it is enough to arouse people's interest in aviation. However, we believe that modern Chinese people have already attached considerable importance to the aviation industry, especially the young people who are studying. They almost all know that the times attach importance to them, so most of them (it can be said all of them) are willing to work hard, study hard, research, and work hard, and they are all willing to dedicate themselves to the great project of building the country in the future. However, due to the limitation of the number of places, they are rejected en masse! The young group is turned back—discouraged!

Education first is not just a slogan, it should be expressed in facts and implemented practically and systematically!

The main reason why China is suffering today is education, and if we still don't work hard on education at this moment, I ask you: what can we do!

### Postal Rate Increase

— Xu Hong

The postal rate increase that was rumored to be implemented soon has been temporarily suspended because the Executive Yuan did not consider it. It is said that it will be discussed again in two months, and the postal bureau's losses will be transferred from the national treasury.

At first glance, it seems to be a good measure by the authorities to not increase postal rates, reduce the burden on the people, and avoid stimulating price increases. However, on closer inspection, there are many inappropriate aspects of not increasing prices.

We always feel that those engaged in state-run enterprises should not have the mentality of making money, but they should not intentionally lose money either. In this time of rising prices, a reasonable adjustment is necessary. Each time the adjustment, if the rate of increase is not large, it will not easily stimulate prices. Adjusting in small increments can further reduce the stimulating effect on rising prices.

In terms of today's prices, a set of fritters costs one hundred yuan, and making a public phone call costs at least two hundred yuan, up to five hundred yuan, while sending a regular letter costs only twenty yuan. What kind of ratio is this? The price of twenty yuan was set seven months ago. How much have prices risen in the past few months? How many times have civil servants' salaries been adjusted? Why not let the postal bureau's only source of income, postal rates, increase? If the postal bureau's income and expenditure can still be balanced, we certainly do not approve of increasing prices. However, last month's losses reached one million yuan! After the salary adjustment for civil servants in August, the general increase was more than 50%, so we estimate that this month's losses will reach more than one and a half million yuan. Then, if the adjustment is really made two months later, then in these three months, the postal bureau's losses will reach four million yuan. It's good to be offset by the national treasury. However, is the national treasury abundant? Where does the money in the national treasury come from? Everyone knows that the national treasury is not abundant at all, and the money is collected from the people under various names! How many undertakings cannot be carried out because the country has no money! That is because the national treasury is not rich! And the country uses huge amounts of money from the inherently poor national treasury on unnecessary undertakings, we really don't understand!

Talking about stimulating prices, the last time the postal rate increased from one yuan per regular letter to twenty yuan per regular letter was enough to stimulate prices! From the twenty yuan per regular letter set in mid-January to the number that is sufficient to offset the postal bureau's income and expenditure in October, we estimate that it will be at least five to ten times. Increasing prices by five times, ten times, or twenty times at once is enough to stimulate price increases! If it had been increased by half a time two or three months ago, and then increased by one time recently, we dare to believe that such an increase is reasonable, necessary, and will not stimulate price increases, at least not as severely as adding five times, ten times, or twenty times at once!

Therefore, we want this time not to increase postal rates, but we object to increasing postal rates by five times, ten times, or twenty times at once! We also object to the method of offsetting the postal bureau's deficit with funds from the national treasury! We advocate a reasonable increase in prices. We hope that there will be an increase in prices soon so that the postal bureau's income and expenditure can be offset. After that, the salaries of civil servants will be adjusted once—of course, prices will have changed once—and the postal rates will be adjusted once, with the rate of increase based on offsetting the postal bureau's income and expenditure as much as possible while avoiding stimulating price increases. We dare to believe that a reasonable adjustment is necessary, and taking from the people and using it all for the people in a reasonable way is what everyone agrees with and supports!

Foreign soldier: Hello, conductor! Buy a ticket to the end.

Conductor: I'm sorry, our country has no precedent for soldiers buying tickets, so you can skip it.

### Busy

— Jiuzhang

It is said that the philosopher Kant's life was the most regular. He walked from his home to the university at a certain time every morning, day after day for decades. A small shop opened on this road, and the clock in the shop was sometimes fast and sometimes slow, but it had to be adjusted when Mr. Kant appeared. However, according to some notes, this quiet and meticulous Kant also had insomnia one night. The next day, he was more than an hour late in walking to the University of Berlin. This made the owner of the small shop wonder and want to find out the reason why Mr. Kant had insomnia. In the evening, he learned that the revolution had broken out in Paris two days ago. There were no telegrams or radios in the eighteenth century, and Mr. Kant knew the news a day earlier than the small shop owner. Of course, Kant had to think through the affairs of the universe and life thoroughly, so he had insomnia for half the night, while the small shop owner must have been unmoved and continued his retail business.

Naturally, when mentioning the eighteenth century, comparing it with the twentieth century, even a stupid person like me would feel a strong contrast. Modern life is busy, and ancient life is leisurely, which is just a general concept. Why is work busy? Because there are machines, and because people have a competitive spirit. Entertainment also becomes busy, rushing to take a bus to the suburbs for recreation at a certain time, and rushing back to the city for a banquet at a certain time. When entertainment becomes a busy affair, the atmosphere of life changes, and it becomes modern. This is very different from the busy-ness of nothing in the Dream of the Red Chamber.

It is said that the famous people of the Jin Dynasty visited friends on snowy nights, but when they reached the door of their friends' houses, they did not go in. He said that he was only there to see the snow, "I came on a whim, and I will return when the whim is gone," why must I meet that friend? There are madmen in modern life, but no famous people.

Let me copy another short story. When England and Germany were at war and the United States had not joined, an American reporter stayed in Berlin. Paris fell. What did the people of Berlin say? What were their thoughts? Paris had fallen in 1871, and the Berliners were ecstatic: This time it was different. Everyone continued to work and continued to plan for a pseudo-life. The poorer people were still paying more attention to whether they could buy more rations than to the Western battlefield. The reporter said that it was not necessarily that the Nazis had numbed people to this extent, "It seems that everyone thought it was just being implemented according to the plans of the General Staff." According to their thinking, the General Staff was the person playing chess, and the frontline charge became the movement of chess pieces. Getting a famous city is like making a good move; and sacrificing some people is like sacrificing a few chess pieces.

In fact, I don't doubt that modern life requires organization, connection, tension, and busyness; but when people can forget themselves and be happy, they are still so serious, which may be a sign of mechanization. This is of course just an extreme example, but modern life should be a further development of human nature, not a rigidification of human nature, which is another big problem.

### The Life and Death of Books

— Yingying

Modern students can comfort themselves with the saying: the two words "reading" have evolved from reading to death to reading to life. In the past, students read to death, which cannot be denied. They recited the Three Character Classic in the village school, but they didn't even know what "At the beginning of man, his nature is good" meant. If you asked the tutor, he would definitely hit your small forehead painfully. They only taught you to copy it onto the imperial examination paper, so you became a xiucai, juren, or even zhuangyuan, and your wish to read was over. Society and the country were completely separate matters.

While it was ridiculous for students to read in the past, it is very pitiful for students to read now. Of course, it is true that reading has recovered from reading to death to reading to life. But the so-called reading to life is just being able to explain each word one by one. After the explanation, what is the use? Teachers didn't think about it, and students didn't think about it either. The wish to read is still to hope to enter middle school, enter university, and even go abroad, and then it's over. The only improvement is that there is more explanation, although it avoids reading to death, but reading to life may be too alive and become virtual reading. There is no one in the modern education world who doesn't do this, which should not be denied. The biggest knot is forgetting practicality. Reading books should be able to be applied in a practical way, so that it is not considered virtual reading. As for reading to life while holding books and thinking about red lights and green wine, it is especially undesirable.

### Accidental Insurance Fee

— Qiren

Who says China is backward? Along with the victory, China has made great progress. Please take the following as proof:

Long-distance buses on the Xihu and Hutai highways require each passenger to pay an "Accidental Travel Insurance Fee" of 100 yuan when purchasing tickets, with an insured amount of 200,000 yuan. So passengers are guaranteed. If there is a car accident, a large amount of insurance money can be claimed, isn't this progress?

However, the progress is too tragic. Originally, the cost of living is so high. How many materials does a person need to consume to survive in this progressive China? The value of life seems that it may not be necessary to consider it. For example, our merciful insurance company directly values ​​human life at 200,000 yuan—the death of a person is equivalent to four shi of rice rotting in the warehouse; equivalent to losing a pig; or equivalent to a student's tuition for a semester.

As for this method of collecting insurance money, it is indeed the most clever. For the highway authorities, it can avoid the troublesome "liability issue" and be a win-win broker. For the insurance company, the insurance fee, which is not worth calculating, is quite considerable when collected every day.

From now on, Chinese law will have one more regulation: Causing death or injury to others due to negligence should be compensated with 200,000 yuan in damages; but "those who are not insured are not subject to this rule!"

### Everyone Abides by Traffic Laws; Order First, Safety First

— Ren Long

The severity of Shanghai's traffic problems stems from both inherent deficiencies and acquired imbalances. The inherent deficiencies are Shanghai's buildings and streets, which lack planning and are chaotic, a problem that cannot be improved immediately. Now, let's be pragmatic and start with the acquired imbalances.

There are two objects of acquired imbalance: vehicles and pedestrians. Summarizing it, it's all a human problem. From now on, the world will be peaceful, and the number of vehicles in Shanghai will only increase. As for pedestrians, they will not decrease in this international commercial city in the future. However, the severity of the traffic problem lies not only in the large number of vehicles and the crowds of pedestrians, but also in whether Shanghai people abide by traffic regulations (Traffic Regulations); in other words, whether they are qualified to be residents of a metropolis.

Please Look at New York

For example, in New York, there are also many people and many cars. However, what is their traffic situation like? There, there are extremely many cars, one after another, driving slowly forward, sometimes even slower than running. Horns are simply left unused. At intersections, they drive strictly according to traffic signals. There is a certain speed limit, and if that limit is exceeded, traffic police will record the number and summon the car owner to the police station to be fined the next day. They maintain urban traffic order in an orderly manner. Frankly speaking, the solution to this problem is only two words: "obey the law." As for the strict organization and dedication of traffic police, that is purely a technical issue. However, this is also something our security authorities can emulate.

A Bloody Record

However, there is another serious matter related to traffic problems that deserves our consideration: this is the matter of vehicle accidents. We can note that the number of vehicle accidents in this city after the victory is increasing with time, without a single day passing without them. These cases pose an unlimited threat to the safety of citizens. The number of people who are sent to the afterlife every day, or who are crippled as a result, is countless. This is a problem that our security authorities and people from all walks of life should pay close attention to. Cases of people injuring or killing others due to careless driving usually fall into two categories: one is negligent, and the other is non-negligent. Non-negligent cases are settled with compensation, while negligent cases are handed over to the court for trial, sentencing, and compensation to resolve the matter. Non-negligent cases are naturally not a problem. However, dealing with negligent cases in that way may not be enough to encourage remorse. Therefore, I believe that the negligent driver should be forced by the police to accompany the injured person to the hospital or the corpse of the person who died from the injury to the morgue, and stay with them until the injured person recovers or the deceased is buried, and only after fulfilling the legal responsibility can they be released. Only in this way will he have the opportunity to witness the bloody consequences of his own negligence and feel remorse. I heard people in the hospital say that the situation of people who are injured or die as a result of car accidents is the most horrifying and tragic. Let the negligent driver take a look. I am afraid that he will never forget the tragedy he created and will never repeat the same mistake.

Film Promotion

In addition, in order to assist the authorities in maintaining traffic, film companies can also shoot short films specifically depicting the process of car accidents, especially the pain and suffering of the injured, which should be filmed in detail. Then, it should be screened in major theaters to make those who drive cars aware and vigilant. Psychologically, it can raise their awareness, thereby reducing the occurrence of tragedies. It is recently reported that the United States is also vigorously promoting the above-mentioned method. This method may have a great effect. I hope our security authorities pay attention to it.
